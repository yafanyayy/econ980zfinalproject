During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company.
We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are: Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairmen and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal 2016 financial performance and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, provide an update on the integration activities associated with Micrel acquisition and provide some additional commentary on our announced acquisition of Atmel. We'll then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relation page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effect of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the December quarter were above the midpoint of our guidance at $552 million, and were down 1.3% sequentially from net sales of $559.4 million in the immediately preceding quarter. 
Non-GAAP net sales were $11.7 million higher than GAAP net sales, as we're recording non-GAAP net sales on a full sell-through revenue recognition basis or GAAP does not recognize revenue on the sell-through products heading in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs and when distributor contracts are changed to the standard Microchip format compared to the sell in revenue recognition contract that Micrel previously have for certain of their distributor partners.
We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On an non-GAAP basis, gross margin were 57.9% in the December quarter and at the high-end of our guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 28.5% of sales below the of our guidance range and non-GAAP operating income was 29.5% of sales, which was above the high-end of our guidance. 
Non-GAAP net income was $138.4 million, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $0.64, which was higher than our preannounced results from January 19.
On a GAAP basis, net sales were $540.3 million and gross margins, including share-based compensation acquisition-related expenses, were 54.2% in the December quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $2.3 million of share-based compensation, $6.9 million of gross margin impacts from the distributor revenue adjustments as I mentioned earlier, and $17.8 million in acquired inventory valuation cost and acquisition-related restructuring costs.
Total operating expenses were $216.6 million or 40.1% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $48.3 million, share-based compensation of $14.7 million, $1.5 million of acquisition-related expenses and special income of $5 million.  GAAP net income was $61.2 million or $0.28 per diluted share. 
In the December quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 10%, and the GAAP tax benefit rate was 22%. The non-GAAP tax rate reflects the benefits in December quarter for the R&D tax credit reinstatement. But we're including the benefit from R&D tax credit for previous quarters that were reinstated only in the GAAP results to make future periods more comparable. We expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 10% and 11%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet, consolidated inventory at December 31, 2015, was $319.5 million and includes $11 million of fair value markup on Micrel's inventory required by GAAP purchase accounting. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, Microchip had 120 days of inventory at December 31, 2015, which is down by 5 days from the levels of the end of the September quarter. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, inventory at our distributors was 34 days, which is down 1 day from September quarter levels. I want to remind you that historically, Microchip's distribution revenues throughout the world has been recognized on a sell-through basis.
Micrel has some distributors that historically recognize revenue on a selling basis. Microchip change substantially all the contractual relationships with these distributors during the December quarter, which has resulted in sell-through revenue recognition in the future. Our non-GAAP revenue guidance provided in our release today is based on sell-through revenue recognition for the Micrel distributors, for the entire March quarter in order to continue to provide investors with the view of the true end-market demand for our products.
There will be difference in GAAP revenue recognition as the inventories in the distribution channel at the end of the conversion to sell-through accounting will not be recognized as revenue for the GAAP accounting purposes.
The cash generation in the December quarter, excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit was $172 million. As of December 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.398 billion, our borrowings under our revolving line of credit at December 31, were $1.008 billion, $288 million lower than it was on September 30, as we pay down portion of revolving line of credit, Excluding dividend payments, changes in borrowing levels and never acquisition activities, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $140 million to $160 million in the March quarter.
Capital spending was approximately $17.9 million in the December quarter. We expect about $28 million in capital spending in the March quarter, and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 to be about $110 million. Well, below our previous guidance to The Street of $125 million. We're selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the SMB and test operations that are currently outsource. 
Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $26.7 million.
Over the past several years, Microchip's dividend paid to shareholders has been treated as a return of capital as Microchip did not have earnings and profits in the United States. As indicated in last quarter earnings call, due to the integration of Micrel and for Microchip global tax structure, Microchip will have earnings and profits in the United States in fiscal year 2016. For this transaction, Microchip brought back about $250 million of offshore cash to the U.S. and we don't anticipate paying any U.S. cash taxes on the amount as we'll use net operating losses to offset the income.
As a result, a portion of Microchip's calendar year 2015 dividends are taxable to shareholders versus the return of capital treatment from the last few years. We have posted a copy of Form 8937 on the Investor Relations page of our website, which indicate the split between taxable dividend and return of capital for is dividend payment made during calendar year 2015. 
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?"

Before I start my prepared remarks, I would like to take a moment to thank Steve, our Board of Directors, the Microchip executive team and the 10,000 employees of Microchip worldwide for the high honor and the distinct privilege they stood on me to be the next President of Microchip. There is being the journey of a life time to witness and contributed to the growth and success of Microchip and I look forward to continuing that journey with the Microchip team as we scale new heights and achieve new business milestones in the years to come.
Now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller revenue was down 3.5% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter. As we experienced, the same broad-based weakness that the industry experienced. In calendar year 2015, our microcontroller business was down 1.4% as compared to calendar year 2014. And, while we're not happy about the decline, we're confident that we're gaining market share in every microcontroller segment that we compete in what was the difficult year for the overall industry. The official microcontroller rankings, we expect will be available in time for our next earnings conference call.
We are continuing to deliver innovative new 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers, as well as software and developed control solutions to complement them, which we believe will enable us to grow faster than the market and gain for the market share. 
As we mentioned at our January 19 conference call, the addition of Atmel 8-bit AVR microcontroller family and 32-bit ARM microcontroller family, we expect will enhance Microchip's industry-leading 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller offerings. Microcontrollers represent a 58.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. 
Moving to analog. Our analog business, which includes Micrel results was up 4.1% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter and was up 3.6% compared to the year-ago quarter.
In calendar year 2015, our analog business was up 22.4% as compared to calendar year 2014. The strong growth and increase in Microchip in 2015 was the result of our organic efforts as well as Micrel acquisition. Analog business represented 31.2% Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter, a highest percentage of our total revenue it has ever been. To put the size of our analog business in perspective, in the December quarter, Microchip's analog business alone was almost a same size as all of Microchip was in the March quarter of 2009. And at an almost $700 million annual revenue run rate, it is emerging as one of the larger analog franchises serving the embedded control market. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products, if future growth of our analog business complemented by the products added to our portfolio through acquisition.
Now moving to the memory business. Our memory business, which is comprised serial squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory products was down 8.3% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solution. Our memory business represented 5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. 
Now let me pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?"
31500,322516638,926041,"Microchip Technology Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Microchip Technology Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ganesh. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of the 2016, including comments on the progress conference call about acquisition of Atmel.",2516,"Thank you, Ganesh. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of the 2016, including comments on the progress conference call about acquisition of Atmel. Our December quarter results were strong and a very turbulent, macro and semiconductor backdrop. The quarterly results in non-GAAP revenue, gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage and operating profit percentage were all better than the midpoint of our guidance. Additionally, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came in at $0.64, which is above the $0.62 to $0.63 upwardly revised guidance we provided and the announcement of our preliminary on January 19, 2016.
I will now provide guidance for the March 2016 quarter. We believe that our business has stabilized and that the majority of the inventory could behind us. The March quarter is impacted negatively by the Chinese New Year holidays in Asia, but it is also the strongest quarter of the year for Microchip in Europe. Based on our analysis of economic and semiconductor industry conditions, as well as our own business indicators, we're guiding the March quarter non-GAAP net sales to be between flat to up 3% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 57.9% and 58.1% of sales, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 27.3% and 27.9% of sales, and we expect the non-GAAP operating profit to be between 30% and 30.8% of sales. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be $0.65 to $0.69 per share.
Now let me provide you with an update on the integration of Micrel. The integration continues to progress as planned, there were 7 main elements of integration we had defined. 5 of them are complete, which are: number 1, financial and business systems consolidation; number 2, consolidation of Micrel wafer starts planning; number 3, integration of sales for, rep and distribution network; number 4, integration or product lines and R&D activities; and number 5, integration of human resources systems, equity plan 401(k), medical benefits, bonus plans, et cetera. The remaining 2 areas, which are progressing well, but are not complete yet are: number 1, the closure of Micrel fab, which is on schedule for August 2015; and number 2, the integration of back end operational systems, which also remain on schedule for August of 2016.
With this, let me now provide guidance for accretion from the acquisition of Micrel. Micrel acquisition was about $0.007 accretive in the September quarter and was $0.038 accretive in the December quarter to non-GAAP EPS.
This accretion will continue to increase and we now achieve $0.30 of EPS accretion run rate from Micrel by the end of fiscal year 2017. This is up from $0.25 accretion target that we provided in the prior conference calls. These numbers depend upon the speed of integration efforts and the health of the underlying economics in general.
Now, some update about at Atmel. I have visited Atmel headquarter location in San Jose and fab location in Colorado Springs and held all employee communication meetings and one-on-one meetings with the executive. Ganesh and I had headed to Europe in the mid February to visit Atmel European locations in France, Germany, Norway and the U.K. We completed the U.S. antitrust filing last week and the filings in Germany and Korea are scheduled for next week. We're also targeting the S-4 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in about a week. We continue to expect to close this transaction in the second calendar quarter of 2016.
Since the announcement of the Atmel transaction in our conference call on January 19, most of the feedback from investors and analysts has been very positive that the deal makes sense. However, there are also areas where either we will not sufficiently clear or investors have further question. We would like to provide more clarification regarding these concerns today. The general view that we have heard is that the current slow growth environment -- that in the current slow growth environment investors like the self-help story is that can continue to general growth despite the challenging macro environment. We have recently shared with investors Microchip's organic and total growth in the last 6 years. To repeat just 1 metric from calendar year 2009 to calendar year 2015, Microchip's organic compounded annual growth rate has been 8.3% per year and the total compounded annual growth including acquisitions had been 17.3% per year. 
Investors have commented that our management team has the best chance of turning around Atmel and making them successful. Now let us go into some of the concerns that investors and analysts have raised.
First is leverage. Investors have raised the concern that the Atmel acquisition increases Microchip's debt-to-EBITDA leverage quite a bit and understandably have questions about the cash question and potential risk to the dividend. We have said in the conference call that after the stock buyback, our senior debt-to-EBITDA leverage will be 2.7 and never total leverage will be 4.5. We would like to point out that these numbers are before synergies. Once you factor in synergies, consistent with what companies like and have done in their quoted leverage numbers, we expect our debt-to-EBITDA leverage to drop rapidly as follows: after the first year, the senior leverage will drop from 2.7 to 2.3 and the total leverage will drop from 4.5 to 4. After 2 years, the senior leverage drops to 1.9 and the total leverage drops to 3.4. And after 3 years, the senior leverage will drop to 1.7 and the total leverage will drop to 3.1. As you can see -- as you can clearly see, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage drops rapidly over the first 3 years after the close of the Atmel acquisition. Additionally, Microchip's management and the board is fully committed to the dividend and does not see any risks to the dividend.
The second question that has been raised is multiple architectures. We received this question at the last conference call also, but we have continued to receive follow-on question about this. The comment from investors had been that Microchip in the past has been dismissive on the ARM architecture so what has changed now? When Microchip was dismissive of the ARM architecture, it was in response to investors' question about replacing our PIC32 architecture, which is mixed base. In that regard, nothing has changed. We continued to hear from distributors and our customers that ARM has commoditized this market and Microchip's PIC32-based solutions are differentiated and superior products in the marketplace. Therefore, Microchip has no plans to share one or the other architecture. We'll be the only company that we have ARM architecture when the customer demands and ARM solution and we'll have PIC32 when we can sell a differentiator solution like we have been doing for several years.
By the way Atmel does not considered its ARM-based products to be commodity nor do any of the other suppliers who are also trying to differentiate their products using different peripheral. This is consistent with what we have been saying for years that it is not about the core, it's about the total solution. Atmel's ARM 32-bit-based products and Microchip's PIC32 products are both successful in their own right and we believe have strong ecosystems and market momentum to continue to be successful. As far as, AVR and PIC are concerned, at the 8-bit architecture level, these are both very mature solutions with fully developed product portfolios, development tools and ecosystems and they can continue to coexist. There are PIC head engineers who like PICs. and there are AVR freaks, a group on the web who like AVR. We cannot disappoint either and will continue to support both of these groups. But as we mentioned during our conference call, we do expect to find synergies by not having to duplicate the investment in IP building blocks that make up our microcontrollers. We believe that the investors are making the same mistake that they made when they believe that SMS is vertical product lines in automotive and personal consumer issue for us because we were based on horizontal market and sales. Investors have routinely underestimated Microchip's management's ability to transform the company's organization and resources to take on the challenge at hand.
The third question raised has been revenue synergies. Investors believe that not all of Atmel's product lines will meet Microchip's margin criteria and some segments will be exited or divested. Investors have pointed to our attempt to purchase Atmel in 2008 when we were going to divest a couple of segments to ARM semiconductors. 
Well, in 2008, Microchip was planning to sell the memory business and automotive business to on semiconductor. I must point out, that while the memory business was in lower margin business at that time, the primary reason for Microchip to divest those 2 businesses was affordability not the margin. 
On semiconductor was going to bring $1 billion at cash into the deal, without that Microchip could not afford to buy Atmel at the size Microchip was then. Since then, Microchip has grown tremendously and with a large market capitalization. Today, we can afford the entire Atmel business ourselves. Secondly, Atmel has divested many of the low margin businesses namely smart card, Serial Flash memory business, and some others. Today, we see only 5% of business that is in mobile consumer electronics, touch segment that is very low gross margin. We believe that there are significant positive synergies in this acquisition to easily overwrite any potential negative synergy out of these 5% business, which has declined very significantly already under Atmel clock.
Fourth question raised has been the synergy through multi-sourcing. There seems to be misconception that both Microchip and microcontrollers are designed into the same socket and therefore, there will be some synergy. We do not understand this concern due to different architectures, Microchip's and Atmel's microcontrollers are never designed into the same socket. There is also concern the distributors will not sell a broad portfolio. they don't understand that either. If that line of thinking was to be true, then distributors should give all of Texas instrument business to me as they have a much broader portfolio than we do. 
Microchip and Atmel combined will do approximately $2 billion for the distribution channel. The combined product lines of Microchip and Atmel will be one of the most sought-after broad-based product line with multiple opportunities for distribution for attaching analog, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, memory, USB, Ethernet, timing products and others.
The fifth concern raised has been our target is $0.33 accretion in fiscal year '17 and then $0.90 in fiscal year '19. This bridge is somewhat misunderstood. So let me clarify that. Let me first remind you about that commission numbers again. That are $0.33 in fiscal year '17, $0.67 in fiscal year '18 and $0.90 in fiscal year '19. The accretion is coming from 3 factors: first, the operating expense reduction; second, the gross margin improvement and third, the revenue growth. The operating expense reduction is not a 1 year's job, because of the size of the transaction, we believe, it will be a continuous effort over a 3-year period to rationalize the R&D as well as SG&A expenses and bring them into Microchip's cost structure. The gross margin improvement is also gradual through for improvement of manufacturing efficiency as well as higher or lower emphasis on product lines based on the gross margin. And then, there will be revenue synergy both for contributing to the EPS synergy. Atmel's revenue has been declining for the last 5 years as they have restructured out of the very large touch business and they also sold the serial flash business to a company called . We're confident that Atmel's revenue will bottom in the first half of 2016 and then grow afterwards. We also see a significant opportunity to attach analog and other connectivity products to Atmel's microcontrollers like we have been successful with Microchip's microcontrollers. In fact, I see the analog attach opportunities with microcontrollers with Atmel's microcontroller-s to be a bonanza for our analog business. The combination of all these factors build the accretion from $0.33 in fiscal '17 to $0.67 in fiscal year '18 to $0.90 in fiscal year '19.
The final concern we have heard about is the size of the deal. The Microchip has been successful in smaller days can be duplicate that success with these larger deal. Now I must say that, we heard this concern when we bought SMSC also. SMSC was 4X larger than any deal we have done prior to that. Microchip today is at $2.2 billion company and is capable of taking on the larger acquisition compared to what we could do a few years ago. Atmel's business is also quite familiar to us, which was unlike the case with SSDS, SMSC, et cetera. 
As I said before, Microchip management is capable of transforming its organization, resources and strategies to meet the challenges at the given time. Just today, we announced the promotion of Ganesh Moorthy to President and COO. In addition to the Ganesh deserving of the promotion, it is also a recognition of the fact that we're taking on an acquisition that's about 47% of our own size and it will require Ganesh and I both to manage this enterprise with all of the involved worldwide. We're also adjusting the organizations below us to adapt to this new reality. Microchip is an incredible executive development machine. You may not know this, but Microchip has not hired a VP level person from outside the company for over 15 years. Although, we have gained some VPs through our acquisitions. 
Through training, mentoring and developing, we have groomed our own executives that have replaced some of the retirements that have taken place, as well as provided the leadership bandwidth required to effectively manage the growth that we have experienced. You cannot imagine the familiarity, understanding, cohesiveness, speed of execution and constancy of purpose that it builds in the organization. This culture has been one of the hallmarks of our success. We have been able to -- we have been able to extend this culture to our mini acquisitions and we believe that we'll be able to achieve the same with Atmel. I hope that it alleviates some of your concerns. In closing, I would like to say that the December quarter marks the bottom for us for this correction and we're expecting a low single-digit sequential growth in the March quarter. Beyond the March quarter, we get into 2 back-to-back seasonally stronger quarters for Microchip. These quarters beyond organic growth will also have incremental accretion from the restructuring of Micrel and these corridors will begin to have accretion from the closing of the Atmel transaction. This triple affect coming from organic growth, accretion from Micrel and accretion from Atmel will set up the earnings growth momentum that we expect will lead us to a 23% non-GAAP EPS growth from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017.

We have declined some in the memory business, we declined in some of the other miscellaneous when we have acquired these companies, these companies or these companies all did some of the foundry business. Supertex had some foundry business where any companies with the 6-inch fab, they're underloaded and they attempt to take odds and ins of foundry business doing some work for the people, which goes on for years because nobody wants to move it. It's going to be small amount of work. When you closed the fab that part of the business atrophies because nobody wants to transfer it to another fab. Atmel has some foundry business also. Supertex had it, Micrel had it. We put that all in the other. So I think when you look at it all that, our core businesses have all done well. You can compare our core business to Atmel, you can compare it to, you can compare it to anybody else. And when the numbers come out from Gartner, we can share that with you. I think, other thing, John, I would say, is that, we had largely broken out the organic versus inorganic numbers based on your request, you may recall. And I don't think it has helped us. The thing investors and analysts have to recognize is that, these acquisitions are anonymous amount of work. We take an anonymous amount of Microchip exit it's and our people and of energy to bring these acquisitions, which read underperforming really doing nothing, Micrel had done 6.7% operating profit in the quarter we bought them. And now, they're operating profits are approaching 20% and will be 30% or higher by the time we're done. All that effort would have gone into our business. In many cases, take the case of Micrel, for example, we terminated one of our product Gigabit Ethernet and we decided to take Gigabit Ethernet from Micrel and marketed further, because they were farther along in the development of that product. So when you look at it, 1 year, 2 year, 3 years down the line, when you guys the way you interpret organic versus inorganic, you basically take all the earnings that we have produced, all the revenue that we have produced, all the work that we have done to take these acquisitions, which were essentially making no money.

Where it works is, a customer sits down to lay out their board and when they choose a microcontroller, they start to write the code and the analog is later, I need a supervisor, I need a LDO, I think I need converter, I think I need this and that. But those are things that you can attach around the microcontroller and many times those selections are made many months later. But when a microcontroller manufacturer like us has its own analog, so one of the advantage we have is we can sample all the things that customer needs in their application right away, so when the customer is ready, it's handy already, it's available in front of his eyes. And the attached rate to the Atmel's microcontroller would be very similar. That's the first thing we would do to take all of their block diagrams worldwide, that exist customers and really see whose analog is around."

We competed where Freescale when they were multi-billion dollar revenue company, $4 billion, $5 million company and Microchip was just a $100 million, $200 million, then $500 million than $1 billion.

For years, years we have had a common development tool because we could. All these things were developed internally at 8-bit and 16-bit internal architecture. And one of the thing -- reason, part of the reason wee also choose mix was because we were able to work with them in a way that we could bring them into a common development environment and Microchip tools extend to it architecture. But no other company has it. Freescale has number of development environments for PowerPC, for ARM architecture, for thier 8-bit product line, 16-bit product line. Atmel has AVR, they have ARM, a number of other companies have the similar. Silicon Labs has an AD51 for 8-bit, then its ARM for 32-bit. So no other company has it. Those companies aren't dead. Now true, if we had bought a company with the same architecture, it will be incrementally better. But I think Steve is looking at like it's dead, like it breaks that tool and then there see end of the world. These are highly successful product lines in their own right. At other companies, they have existed with multiple architectures. They can exist and multiple architectures have Microchip. We already have, we have a ARM development tool that sells products from SMSC, networks had it. So what we used other architecture, we use AD51, we use ARC, we use ARM. But it's predominantly our own architecture, we would agree with it. But we have already in the last few years, with other smaller acquisitions already introduced ARM-based products. And if you're taking an ARM best product the momentum, there was nowhere then that would be formidable challenge to develop it. But it's a successful product line. And so is the AVR 8-bit. So I just think, look at it in that light. And on the ARM itself, for 8 years, you guys have haunted us for not having ARM that it was a negative. Now we have ARM, and some how it's negative again.

During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company.
We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are: Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairmen and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal 2016 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, provide an update on the integration activities associated with the Micrel acquisition and provide some additional commentary on our announced acquisition of Atmel. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effect of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the December quarter were above the midpoint of our guidance at $552 million and were down 1.3% sequentially from net sales of $559.4 million in the immediately proceeding quarter. 
Non-GAAP net sales were $11.7 million higher than GAAP net sales, as we are reporting non-GAAP net sales on a full sell-through revenue recognition basis while GAAP does not recognize revenue on the sell-through of products sitting in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs and when distributor contracts are changed to the standard Microchip format compared to the sell-in revenue recognition contract that Micrel previously have for certain of their distribution partners.
We posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 57.9% in the December quarter and at the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 28.5% of sales, below the bottom end of our guidance range. And non-GAAP operating income was 29.5% of sales, which was above the high end of our guidance. 
Non-GAAP net income was $138.4 million, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $0.64, which was higher than our preannounced results from January 19.
On a GAAP basis, net sales were $540.3 million and gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 54.2% in the December quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $2.3 million of share-based compensation, $6.9 million of gross margin impacts from the distributor revenue adjustments I mentioned earlier, and $17.8 million in acquired inventory valuation cost and acquisition-related restructuring costs.
Total operating expenses were $216.6 million or 40.1% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $48.3 million, share-based compensation of $14.7 million, $1.5 million of acquisition-related expenses and special income of $5 million. GAAP net income was $61.2 million or $0.28 per diluted share. 
In the December quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 10%, and the GAAP tax benefit rate was 22%. The non-GAAP tax rate reflects the benefits in the December quarter for the R&D tax credit reinstatement, but we are including the benefit from R&D tax credit from previous quarters that were reinstated only in the GAAP results to make future periods more comparable. We expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 10% and 11%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at December 31, 2015, was $319.5 million and includes $11 million of fair value markup on Micrel's inventory required by GAAP purchase accounting. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, Microchip had 120 days of inventory at December 31, 2015, which is down by 5 days from the levels at the end of the September quarter. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, inventory at our distributors was at 34 days, which is down 1 day from September quarter levels. I want to remind you that historically, Microchip's distribution revenues throughout the world has been recognized on a sell-through basis.
Micrel has some distributors that historically recognize revenue on a sell-in basis. Microchip changed substantially all the contractual relationships with these distributors during the December quarter, which has resulted in sell-through revenue recognition in the future. Our non-GAAP revenue guidance provided in our release today is based on sell-through revenue recognition for the Micrel distributors for the entire March quarter in order to continue to provide investors with the view of the true end-market demand for our products.
There will be difference in GAAP revenue recognition as the inventory in the distribution channel at the end of the conversion to sell-through accounting will not be recognized as revenue for GAAP accounting purposes.
The cash generation in the December quarter, excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit, was $172 million. As of December 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.398 billion, our borrowings under our revolving line of credit at December 31 were $1.008 billion, $288 million lower than it was on September 30, as we paid down a portion of the revolving line of credit. Excluding dividend payments, changes in borrowing levels and our acquisition activity, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $140 million to $160 million in the March quarter.
Capital spending was approximately $17.9 million in the December quarter. We expect about $28 million in capital spending in the March quarter, and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 to be about $110 million, well below our previous guidance to The Street of $125 million. We are selectively adding capital to support growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. 
Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $26.7 million.
Over the past several years, Microchip's dividend paid to the shareholders has been treated as a return of capital, as Microchip did not have earnings and profits in the United States. As indicated in last quarter's earnings call, due to the integration of Micrel into Microchip's global tax structure, Microchip will have earnings and profits in the United States in fiscal year 2016. For this transaction, Microchip brought back about $250 million of offshore cash to the U.S. and we don't anticipate paying any U.S. cash taxes on the amount as we will use net operating losses to offset the income.
As a result, a portion of Microchip's calendar year 2015 dividends are taxable to shareholders versus the return of capital treatment from the last few years. We have posted a copy of IRS Form 8937 on the Investor Relations page of our website, which indicate the split between taxable dividend and return of capital for each dividend payment made during calendar year 2015. 
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?"

Before I start my prepared remarks, I'd like to take a moment to thank Steve, our Board of Directors, the Microchip executive team and the over 10,000 employees of Microchip worldwide for the high honor and the distinct privilege they have bestowed on me to be the next President of Microchip. It has been the journey of a lifetime to have witnessed and contributed to the growth and success of Microchip, and I look forward to continuing that journey with the Microchip team as we scale new heights and achieve new business milestones in the years to come.
Now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller revenue was down 3.5% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter, as we experienced the same broad-based weakness that the industry experienced. In calendar year 2015, our microcontroller business was down 1.4% as compared to calendar year 2014. And while we're not happy about the decline, we are confident that we're gaining market share in every microcontroller segment that we compete, in what was a difficult year for the overall industry. The official microcontroller rankings, we expect will be available in time for our next earnings conference call.
We are continuing to deliver innovative new 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers, as well as software and developed contour solutions to complement them, which we believe will enable us to grow faster than the market and gain further market share. 
As we mentioned at our January 19 conference call, the addition of Atmel's 8-bit AVR microcontroller family and 32-bit ARM microcontroller family, we expect will enhance Microchip's industry-leading 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller offerings. Microcontrollers represented 58.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. 
Moving to analog. Our analog business, which includes Micrel results, was up 4.1% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter and was up 3.6% compared to the year-ago quarter.
In calendar year 2015, our analog business was up 22.4% as compared to calendar year 2014. The strong growth and increase in market share in 2015 was the result of our organic growth efforts as well as the Micrel acquisition. Our Analog business represented 31.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter, the highest percentage of our total revenue it has ever been. To put the size of our analog business in perspective, in the December quarter, Microchip's analog business alone was almost the same size as all of Microchip was in the March quarter of 2009. And at an almost $700 million annual revenue run rate, it is emerging as one of the larger analog franchises serving the embedded control market. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products that fuel the future the growth of our analog business complemented by the products added to our portfolio through acquisition.
Now moving to the memory business. Our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory products, was down 8.3% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. 
Now let me pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?"

Additionally, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came in at $0.64, which is above the $0.62 to $0.63 upwardly revised guidance we provided in the announcement of our preliminary results on January 19, 2016.
I will now provide guidance for the March 2016 quarter. We believe that our business has stabilized and that the majority of the inventory correction is behind us. The March quarter is impacted negatively by the Chinese New Year holiday in Asia, but it is also the strongest quarter of the year for Microchip in Europe. Based on our analysis of economic and semiconductor industry conditions, as well as our own business indicators, we are guiding the March quarter non-GAAP net sales to be between flat to up 3% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 57.9% and 58.1% of sales, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 27.3% and 27.9% of sales, and we expect the non-GAAP operating profit to be between 30% and 30.8% of sales. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be $0.65 to $0.69 per share.
Now let me provide you with an update on the integration of Micrel. The integration continues to progress as planned. There were 7 main elements of integration we had defined. 5 of them are complete, which are: number one, financial and business systems consolidation; number two, consolidation of Micrel's wafer fab starts planning; number three, integration of sales force, rep and distribution network; number four, integration of product lines and R&D activities; and number five, integration of human resources systems, equity plan, 401(k), medical benefits, bonus plans, et cetera. The remaining 2 areas, which are progressing well, but are not complete yet are: number one, the closure of Micrel's San Jose fab, which is on schedule for August 2016; and number two, the integration of back-end operational systems, which also remain on schedule for August of 2016.
With this, let me now provide guidance for accretion from the acquisition of Micrel. Micrel acquisition was about $0.007 accretive in the September quarter and was $0.038 accretive in the December quarter to non-GAAP EPS.
This accretion will continue to increase and we now achieve $0.30 of EPS accretion run rate from Micrel by the end of fiscal year 2017. This is up from $0.25 accretion target that we provided in the prior conference calls. These numbers depend upon the speed of integration efforts and the health of the underlying economy in general.
Now some update about Atmel. I have visited Atmel's headquarter location in San Jose and fab location in Colorado Springs and held all employee communication meetings and one-on-one meetings with the executive. Ganesh and I had headed to Europe in mid-February to visit Atmel's European locations in France, Germany, Norway and the U.K. We completed the U.S. antitrust filing last week, and the filings in Germany and Korea are scheduled for next week. We are also targeting the S-4 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in about a week. We continue to expect to close this transaction in the second calendar quarter of 2016.
Since the announcement of the Atmel transaction in our conference call on January 19, most of the feedback from investors and analysts have been very positive, that the deal makes sense. However, there are also areas where either we were not sufficiently clear or investors have further question. We would like to provide more clarification regarding these concerns today. The general view that we have heard is that the current slow growth environment -- that in the current slow growth environment, investors like the self-help stories that can continue to general growth despite the challenging macro environment. We have recently shared with investors Microchip's organic and total growth in the last 6 years. To repeat just 1 metric, from calendar year 2009 to calendar year 2015, Microchip's organic compounded annual growth rate has been 8.3% per year and the total compounded annual growth, including acquisitions, had been 17.3% per year. 
Investors have commented that our management team has the best chance of turning around Atmel and making them successful. Now let us go into some of the concerns that investors and analysts have raised.
First is leverage. Investors have raised the concern that the Atmel acquisition increases Microchip's debt-to-EBITDA leverage quite a bit and, understandably, have questions about the cash cushion and potential risk to the dividend. We have said in the conference call that after the stock buyback, our senior debt-to-EBITDA leverage will be 2.7 and our total leverage will be 4.5. We would like to point out that these numbers are before synergies. Once you factor in synergies, consistent with what companies like NXP and Avago have done in their quoted leverage numbers, we expect our debt-to-EBITDA leverage to drop rapidly as follows. After the first year, the senior leverage will drop from 2.7 to 2.3 and the total leverage will drop from 4.5 to 4. After 2 years, the senior leverage drops to 1.9 and the total leverage drops to 3.4. And after 3 years, the senior leverage will drop to 1.7 and the total leverage will drop to 3.1. As you can see -- as you can clearly see, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage drops rapidly over the first 3 years after the close of the Atmel acquisition. Additionally, Microchip's management and the board is fully committed to the dividend and does not see any risks to the dividend.
The second question that has been raised is multiple architectures. We received this question at the last conference call also, but we have continued to receive follow-on questions about this. The comment from investors had been that Microchip in the past has been dismissive of the ARM architecture, so what has changed now? When Microchip was dismissive of the ARM architecture, it was in response to investors' question about replacing our PIC32 architecture, which is mixed-based. In that regard, nothing has changed. We continue to hear from distributors and our customers that ARM has commoditized this market and Microchip's PIC32-based solutions are differentiated and superior products in the marketplace. Therefore, Microchip has no plans to shelf one or the other architecture. We will be the only company that will have ARM architecture when the customer demands an ARM solution and we will have PIC32 when we can sell a differentiated solution like we have been doing for several years.
By the way, Atmel does not considered its ARM-based products to be a commodity nor do any of the other suppliers who are also trying to differentiate their products using different peripherals. This is consistent with what we have been saying for years that it is not about the core, it's about the total solution. Atmel's ARM 32-based products and Microchip's PIC32 products are both successful in their own right and we believe have strong ecosystems and market momentum to continue to be successful. As far as AVR and PIC are concerned, at the 8-bit architecture level, these are both very mature solutions with fully developed product portfolios, development tools and ecosystems and they can continue to coexist. There are PIC head engineers who like PICs. And there are AvrFreaks, a group on the web, who like AVR. We cannot disappoint either and will continue to support both of these groups. But as we mentioned during our conference call, we do expect to find synergies by not having to duplicate the investment in IP building blocks that make up our microcontrollers. We believe that the investors are making the same mistake that they made when they believe that SMSC's vertical product lines in automotive and personal computer business was an issue for us because we were based on horizontal market in sales. Investors have routinely underestimated Microchip's management's ability to transform the company's organization and resources to take on the challenge at hand.
The third question raised has been revenue dissynergies. Investors believe that not all of Atmel's product lines will meet Microchip's margin criteria and some segments will be exited or divested. Investors have pointed to our attempt to purchase Atmel in 2008 when we were going to divest a couple of segments to ON Semiconductor while, in 2008, Microchip was planning to sell the memory business and automotive business to ON Semiconductor. I must point out, that while the memory business was a lower margin business for Atmel at that time, the primary reason for Microchip to divest those 2 businesses was affordability not the margin. 
ON Semiconductor was going to bring $1 billion of cash into the deal. Without that, Microchip could not afford to buy Atmel at the size Microchip was then. Since then, Microchip has grown tremendously and with a large market capitalization. Today, we can afford the entire Atmel business ourselves. Secondly, Atmel has divested many of the low margin businesses namely smart card, Serial Flash memory business, and some others. Today, we see only 5% of Atmel business that is in mobile consumer electronics touch segment that is very low gross margin. We believe that there are significant positive synergies in this acquisition to easily override any potential negative synergy out of this 5% business, which has declined very significantly already under Atmel's clock.
Fourth question raised has been dissynergy through multi-sourcing. There seems to be a misconception that both Microchip and Atmel microcontrollers are designed into the same socket and, therefore, there will be some dissynergy. We do not understand this concern. Due to different architectures, Microchip's and Atmel's microcontrollers are never designed into the same socket. There is also a concern that distributors will not sell a broad portfolio. We don't understand that either. If that line of thinking was to be true, then distributors should give all of Texas Instruments' business to mean as they have a much broader portfolio than we do. 
Microchip and Atmel combined will do approximately $2 billion for the distribution channel. The combined product lines of Microchip and Atmel will be one of the most sought-after broad-based product lines with multiple opportunities for distribution for attaching analog, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, memory, USB, Ethernet, timing products and others.
The fifth concern raised has been our target is $0.33 accretion in fiscal year '17 and then $0.90 in fiscal year '19. This bridge is somewhat misunderstood. So let me clarify that. Let me first remind you about that accretion numbers again. They are $0.33 in fiscal year '17, $0.67 in fiscal year '18 and $0.90 in fiscal year '19. The accretion is coming from 3 factors: first, the operating expense reduction; second, the gross margin improvement and third, the revenue growth. The operating expense reduction is not a 1-year job. Because of the size of the transaction, we believe it will be a continuous effort over a 3-year period to rationalize the R&D as well as SG&A expenses and bring them into Microchip's cost structure. The gross margin improvement is also gradual through improvement of manufacturing efficiency as well as higher or lower emphasis on product lines based on their gross margin. And then, there will be revenue synergy also contributing to the EPS synergy. Atmel's revenue has been declining for the last 5 years as they have restructured out of the very large touch business and they also sold the Serial Flash business to a company called Adesto. We are confident that Atmel's revenue will bottom in the first half of 2016 and then grow afterwards. We also see a significant opportunity to attach analog and other connectivity products to Atmel's microcontrollers like we have been successful with Microchip's microcontrollers. In fact, I see the analog attach opportunities with Atmel's microcontrollers to be a bonanza for our analog business. The combination of all these factors build the accretion from $0.33 in fiscal '17 to $0.67 in fiscal year '18 to $0.90 in fiscal year '19.
The final concern we have heard about is the size of the deal. Microchip has been successful in smaller deals, can we duplicate that success with this larger deal? Now I must say that we heard of this concern when we bought SMSC also. SMSC was 4x larger than any deal we had done prior to that. Microchip today is at $2.2 billion company and it's capable of taking on a larger acquisition compared to what we could do a few years ago. Atmel's business is also quite familiar to us, which was unlike the case with SST, SMSC, et cetera. 
As I said before, Microchip management is capable of transforming its organization, resources and strategies to meet the challenges at a given time. Just today, we announced the promotion of Ganesh Moorthy to President and COO. In addition to Ganesh deserving of a promotion, it is also a recognition of the fact that we are taking on an acquisition that's about 47% of our own size, and it will require Ganesh and I both to manage this enterprise with all of the travel involved worldwide. We're also adjusting the organization below us to adapt to this new reality. Microchip is an incredible executive development machine. You may not know this, but Microchip has not hired a VP level person from outside the company for over 15 years, although we have gained some VPs through our acquisitions. 
Through training, mentoring and developing, we have groomed our own executives that have replaced some of the retirements that have taken place, as well as provided the leadership bandwidth required to effectively manage the growth that we have experienced. You cannot imagine the familiarity, understanding, cohesiveness, speed of execution and constancy of purpose that it builds in the organization. This culture has been one of the hallmarks of our success. We have been able to extend this culture to our many acquisitions and we believe that we will be able to achieve the same with Atmel. I hope that it alleviates some of your concerns. In closing, I would like to say that the December quarter marks the bottom for this correction and we're expecting a low single-digit sequential growth in the March quarter. Beyond the March quarter, we get into 2 back-to-back seasonally stronger quarters for Microchip. These quarters, beyond organic growth, will also have incremental accretion from the restructuring of Micrel and these quarters will begin to have accretion from the closing of the Atmel transaction. This triple affect coming from organic growth, accretion from Micrel and accretion from Atmel will set up the earnings growth momentum that we expect will lead us to a 23% non-GAAP EPS growth from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017. With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?"

We have declined some in the memory business, we declined in some of the other miscellaneous. When we have acquired these companies, these companies audited some of the foundry business. Supertex had some foundry business with any companies with their 6-inch fabs, they underload it and they tend to take odds and ins of the foundry business doing some work for other people, which goes on for years because nobody wants to move it. It's going to be a small amount of work. When you close the fab, that part of the business atrophies because nobody wants to transfer it to another fab. Atmel has some foundry business also. Supertex had it. Micrel had it. We put that all in the others. So I think when you look at it, all that, our core businesses have all done well. You can compare our core business to Atmel, you can compare it to Renesas, you can compare it to anybody else. And when the numbers come out from Gartner, we can share that with you. I think, other thing, John, I would say, is that we had largely broken out the organic versus inorganic numbers based on your request, you may recall. And I don't think it has helped us. The thing the investors and analysts have to recognize is that these acquisitions are an enormous amount of work. We take an enormous amount of Microchip executives and our people and our energy to bring these acquisitions, which were underperforming, really doing nothing. Micrel had done 6.7% operating profit in the quarter we bought them. And now their operating profits are approaching 20% and will be 30% or higher by the time we are done. All that effort will have gone into our business. In many cases -- take the case of Micrel, for example, we terminated one of our product, gigabit Ethernet, and we decided to take a gigabit Ethernet from Micrel and market it further because they were farther along in the development of that product. So when you look at it a year, 2 years, 3 years down the line, when you guys -- the way you interpret organic versus inorganic, you basically take all the earnings that we have produced, all the revenue that we have produced, all the work that we have done to take these acquisitions, which were essentially making no money and make hundreds and millions of dollars from this acquisitions to bring them into 30%-plus operating profit and you take them out from the cuff and saying our core business isn't doing well.

And I think I spoke about it in the last conference call. I mean, do you really think a conservative management like Microchip will take on this acquisition and leverage without doing a real heavyweight downside analysis? And seeing in there where the leverage gets to, is there any threat to the dividend? What happens to the cash flow? What happens to the capital? Do you think we really would do that? So trust us that we did a real bottoms up analysis. And what happens in every downside is our capital needs dry up, and we have shared with you before in graphs that our capital needs some sustaining. A very small amount of capital is sustaining. But on the rest of the capital is kind of growth on new technologies and all that. And what we find is in a down environment, the capital needs dry up. When the capital needs dry up, there's a huge cash flow that comes up because you don't have to really spend all that money on capital. So yes, we did a downside analysis and the total leverage metric is 5 and the senior leverage hurdle is 3.0. And we don't really get close to those by taking all those factors into account."

We competed with Freescale when they were a multi-billion dollar revenue company, $4 billion, $5 million company, and Microchip was just a $100 million, $200 million, then $500 million then $1 billion.

Atmel has then -- they have AVR, they have ARM. A number of other companies have similar. Silicon Labs has an 8051 for 8-bit, then its ARM for 32-bit. So no other company has it. Those companies aren't dead. Now true, if we had bought a company with the same architecture, it will be incrementally better. But I think street is looking at it like it's dead, like it breaks that tool and then it's the end of the world. These are highly successful product lines in their own right. At other companies, they have existed with multiple architectures. They can exist under multiple architectures at Microchip. We already have -- we have a ARM development tool that sells products from SMSC. Roving Networks had it. So we used other architecture, we use AD51, we use ARC, we use ARM. But it's predominantly our own architecture, we would agree with it. But we have already, in the last few years, with other smaller acquisitions, already introduced ARM-based products. And if you were taking an ARM-based product that had no momentum, that was nowhere, then that would be a formidable challenge to develop it. But it's a successful product line, and so is the AVR 8-bit. So I just think -- look at it in that light. And on the ARM itself, for 8 years, you guys have hounded us for not having ARM, that it was a negative. Now we have ARM, and somehow it's negative again. You can't have it both ways."

During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company.
We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are: Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal 2016 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, provide an update on the integration activities associated with the Micrel acquisition and provide some additional commentary on our announced acquisition of Atmel. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effect of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the December quarter were above the midpoint of our guidance at $552 million and were down 1.3% sequentially from net sales of $559.4 million in the immediately preceding quarter. 
Non-GAAP net sales were $11.7 million higher than GAAP net sales, as we are reporting non-GAAP net sales on a full sell-through revenue recognition basis while GAAP does not recognize revenue on the sell-through of products sitting in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs and when distributor contracts are changed to the standard Microchip format compared to the sell-in revenue recognition contract that Micrel previously had for certain of their distribution partners.
We posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 57.9% in the December quarter and at the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 28.5% of sales, below the bottom end of our guidance range. And non-GAAP operating income was 29.5% of sales, which was above the high end of our guidance. 
Non-GAAP net income was $138.4 million, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $0.64, which was higher than our preannounced results from January 19.
On a GAAP basis, net sales were $540.3 million and gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 54.2% in the December quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $2.3 million of share-based compensation, $6.9 million of gross margin impacts from the distributor revenue adjustments I mentioned earlier, and $17.8 million in acquired inventory valuation cost and acquisition-related restructuring costs.
Total operating expenses were $216.6 million or 40.1% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $48.3 million, share-based compensation of $14.7 million, $1.5 million of acquisition-related expenses and special income of $5 million. GAAP net income was $61.2 million or $0.28 per diluted share. 
In the December quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 10%, and the GAAP tax benefit rate was 22%. The non-GAAP tax rate reflects the benefits in the December quarter for the R&D tax credit reinstatement, but we are including the benefit from R&D tax credit from previous quarters that were reinstated only in the GAAP results to make future periods more comparable. We expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 10% and 11%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at December 31, 2015, was $319.5 million and includes $11 million of fair value markup on Micrel's inventory required by GAAP purchase accounting. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, Microchip had 120 days of inventory at December 31, 2015, which is down by 5 days from the levels at the end of the September quarter. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, inventory at our distributors was at 34 days, which is down 1 day from September quarter levels. I want to remind you that historically, Microchip's distribution revenues throughout the world has been recognized on a sell-through basis.
Micrel has some distributors that historically recognize revenue on a sell-in basis. Microchip changed substantially all the contractual relationships with these distributors during the December quarter, which has resulted in sell-through revenue recognition in the future. Our non-GAAP revenue guidance provided in our release today is based on sell-through revenue recognition for the Micrel distributors for the entire March quarter in order to continue to provide investors with the view of the true end-market demand for our products.
There will be a difference in GAAP revenue recognition as the inventory in the distribution channel at the end of the conversion to sell-through accounting will not be recognized as revenue for GAAP accounting purposes.
The cash generation in the December quarter, excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit, was $172 million. As of December 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.398 billion, our borrowings under our revolving line of credit at December 31 were $1.008 billion, $288 million lower than it was on September 30, as we paid down a portion of the revolving line of credit. Excluding dividend payments, changes in borrowing levels and our acquisition activity, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $140 million to $160 million in the March quarter.
Capital spending was approximately $17.9 million in the December quarter. We expect about $28 million in capital spending in the March quarter, and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 to be about $110 million, well below our previous guidance to The Street of $125 million. We are selectively adding capital to support growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. 
Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $26.7 million.
Over the past several years, Microchip's dividend paid to the shareholders has been treated as a return of capital, as Microchip did not have earnings and profits in the United States. As indicated in last quarter's earnings call, due to the integration of Micrel into Microchip's global tax structure, Microchip will have earnings and profits in the United States in fiscal year 2016. For this transaction, Microchip brought back about $250 million of offshore cash to the U.S. and we don't anticipate paying any U.S. cash taxes on the amount as we will use net operating losses to offset the income.
As a result, a portion of Microchip's calendar year 2015 dividends are taxable to shareholders versus the return of capital treatment from the last few years. We have posted a copy of IRS Form 8937 on the Investor Relations page of our website, which indicates the split between taxable dividend and return of capital for each dividend payment made during calendar year 2015. 
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?"

It has been the journey of a lifetime to have witnessed and contributed to the growth and success of Microchip, and I look forward to continuing that journey with the Microchip team as we scale new heights and achieve new business milestones in the years to come.
Now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller revenue was down 3.5% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter, as we experienced the same broad-based weakness that the industry experienced. In calendar year 2015, our microcontroller business was down 1.4% as compared to calendar year 2014. And while we're not happy about the decline, we are confident that we're gaining market share in every microcontroller segment that we compete, in what was a difficult year for the overall industry. The official Gartner microcontroller rankings, we expect will be available in time for our next earnings conference call.
We are continuing to deliver innovative new 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers, as well as software and developed contour solutions to complement them, which we believe will enable us to grow faster than the market and gain further market share. 
As we mentioned at our January 19 conference call, the addition of Atmel's 8-bit AVR microcontroller family and 32-bit ARM microcontroller family, we expect will enhance Microchip's industry-leading 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller offerings. Microcontrollers represented 58.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. 
Moving to analog. Our analog business, which includes Micrel results, was up 4.1% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter and was up 3.6% compared to the year-ago quarter.
In calendar year 2015, our analog business was up 22.4% as compared to calendar year 2014. The strong growth and increase in market share in 2015 was the result of our organic growth efforts as well as the Micrel acquisition. Our Analog business represented 31.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter, the highest percentage of our total revenue it has ever been. To put the size of our analog business in perspective, in the December quarter, Microchip's analog business alone was almost the same size as all of Microchip was in the March quarter of 2009. And at an almost $700 million annual revenue run rate, it is emerging as one of the larger analog franchises serving the embedded control market. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products that fuel the future the growth of our analog business complemented by the products added to our portfolio through acquisition.
Now moving to the memory business. Our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory products, was down 8.3% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. 
Now let me pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?"
31500,322516638,926178,"Microchip Technology Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Microchip Technology Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ganesh. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016, including comments [indiscernible] since the conference call about acquisition of A",2518,"Thank you, Ganesh. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016, including comments [indiscernible] since the conference call about acquisition of Atmel. Our December quarter results were strong amidst a very turbulent macro and semiconductor industry backdrop. The quarterly results in non-GAAP revenue, gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage and operating profit percentage were all better than the midpoint of our guidance. Additionally, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came in at $0.64, which is above the $0.62 to $0.63 upwardly revised guidance we provided in the announcement of our preliminary results on January 19, 2016.
I will now provide guidance for the March 2016 quarter. We believe that our business has stabilized and that the majority of the inventory correction is behind us. The March quarter is impacted negatively by the Chinese New Year holiday in Asia, but it is also the strongest quarter of the year for Microchip in Europe. Based on our analysis of economic and semiconductor industry conditions, as well as our own business indicators, we are guiding the March quarter non-GAAP net sales to be between flat to up 3% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 57.9% and 58.1% of sales, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 27.3% and 27.9% of sales, and we expect the non-GAAP operating profit to be between 30% and 30.8% of sales. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be $0.65 to $0.69 per share.
Now let me provide you with an update on the integration of Micrel. The integration continues to progress as planned. There were 7 main elements of integration we had defined. 5 of them are complete, which are: number one, financial and business systems consolidation; number two, consolidation of Micrel's wafer fab starts planning; number three, integration of sales force, rep and distribution network; number four, integration of product lines and R&D activities; and number five, integration of human resources systems, equity plans, 401(k), medical benefits, bonus plans, et cetera. The remaining 2 areas, which are progressing well, but are not complete yet are: number one, the closure of Micrel's San Jose fab, which is on schedule for August 2016; and number two, the integration of back-end operational systems, which also remain on schedule for August of 2016.
With this, let me now provide guidance for accretion from the acquisition of Micrel. Micrel acquisition was about $0.007 accretive in the September quarter and was $0.038 accretive in the December quarter to non-GAAP EPS.
This accretion will continue to increase and we now achieve $0.30 of EPS accretion run rate from Micrel by the end of fiscal year 2017. This is up from $0.25 accretion target that we provided in the prior conference calls. These numbers depend upon the speed of integration efforts and the health of the underlying economy in general.
Now some update about Atmel. I have visited Atmel's headquarter location in San Jose and fab location in Colorado Springs and held all employee communication meetings and one-on-one meetings with the executive. Ganesh and I had headed to Europe in mid-February to visit Atmel's European locations in France, Germany, Norway and the U.K. We completed the U.S. antitrust filing last week, and the filings in Germany and Korea are scheduled for next week. We are also targeting the S-4 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in about a week. We continue to expect to close this transaction in the second calendar quarter of 2016.
Since the announcement of the Atmel transaction in our conference call on January 19, most of the feedback from investors and analysts have been very positive, that the deal makes sense. However, there are also areas where either we were not sufficiently clear or investors have further question. We would like to provide more clarification regarding these concerns today. The general view that we have heard is that the current slow growth environment -- that in the current slow growth environment, investors like the self-help stories that can continue to generate growth despite the challenging macro environment. We have recently shared with investors Microchip's organic and total growth in the last 6 years. To repeat just 1 metric, from calendar year 2009 to calendar year 2015, Microchip's organic compounded annual growth rate has been 8.3% per year and the total compounded annual growth, including acquisitions, had been 17.3% per year. 
Investors have commented that our management team has the best chance of turning around Atmel and making them successful. Now let us go into some of the concerns that investors and analysts have raised.
First is leverage. Investors have raised the concern that the Atmel acquisition increases Microchip's debt-to-EBITDA leverage quite a bit and, understandably, have questions about the cash cushion and potential risk to the dividend. We have said in the conference call that after the stock buyback, our senior debt-to-EBITDA leverage will be 2.7 and our total leverage will be 4.5. We would like to point out that these numbers are before synergies. Once you factor in synergies, consistent with what companies like NXP and Avago have done in their quoted leverage numbers, we expect our debt-to-EBITDA leverage to drop rapidly as follows. After the first year, the senior leverage will drop from 2.7 to 2.3 and the total leverage will drop from 4.5 to 4. After 2 years, the senior leverage drops to 1.9 and the total leverage drops to 3.4. And after 3 years, the senior leverage will drop to 1.7 and the total leverage will drop to 3.1. As you can see -- as you can clearly see, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage drops rapidly over the first 3 years after the close of the Atmel acquisition. Additionally, Microchip's management and the board is fully committed to the dividend and does not see any risks to the dividend.
The second question that has been raised is multiple architectures. We received this question at the last conference call also, but we have continued to receive follow-on questions about this. The comment from investors had been that Microchip in the past has been dismissive of the ARM architecture, so what has changed now? When Microchip was dismissive of the ARM architecture, it was in response to investors' question about replacing our PIC32 architecture, which is mixed-based. In that regard, nothing has changed. We continue to hear from distributors and our customers that ARM has commoditized this market and Microchip's PIC32-based solutions are differentiated and superior products in the marketplace. Therefore, Microchip has no plans to shelf one or the other architecture. We will be the only company that will have ARM architecture when the customer demands an ARM solution and we will have PIC32 when we can sell a differentiated solution like we have been doing for several years.
By the way, Atmel does not consider its ARM-based products to be a commodity nor do any of the other suppliers who are also trying to differentiate their products using different peripherals. This is consistent with what we have been saying for years that it is not about the core, it's about the total solution. Atmel's ARM 32-based products and Microchip's PIC32 products are both successful in their own right and we believe have strong ecosystems and market momentum to continue to be successful. As far as AVR and PIC are concerned, at the 8-bit architecture level, these are both very mature solutions with fully developed product portfolios, development tools and ecosystems and they can continue to coexist. There are PIC head engineers who like PICs. And there are AvrFreaks, a group on the web, who like AVR. We cannot disappoint either and will continue to support both of these groups. But as we mentioned during our conference call, we do expect to find synergies by not having to duplicate the investment in IP building blocks that make up our microcontrollers. We believe that the investors are making the same mistake that they made when they believed that SMSC's vertical product lines in automotive and personal computer business was an issue for us because we were based on horizontal market in sales. Investors have routinely underestimated Microchip's management's ability to transform the company's organization and resources to take on the challenge at hand.
The third question raised has been revenue dissynergies. Investors believe that not all of Atmel's product lines will meet Microchip's margin criteria and some segments will be exited or divested. Investors have pointed to our attempt to purchase Atmel in 2008 when we were going to divest a couple of segments to ON Semiconductor while, in 2008, Microchip was planning to sell the memory business and automotive business to ON Semiconductor. I must point out, that while the memory business was a lower margin business for Atmel at that time, the primary reason for Microchip to divest those 2 businesses was affordability not the margin. 
ON Semiconductor was going to bring $1 billion of cash into the deal. Without that, Microchip could not afford to buy Atmel at the size Microchip was then. Since then, Microchip has grown tremendously and with a large market capitalization. Today, we can afford the entire Atmel business ourselves. Secondly, Atmel has divested many of the low margin businesses namely smart card, Serial Flash memory business, and some others. Today, we see only 5% of Atmel business that is in mobile consumer electronics touch segment that is very low gross margin. We believe that there are significant positive synergies in this acquisition to easily override any potential negative synergy out of this 5% business, which has declined very significantly already under Atmel's clock.
Fourth question raised has been dissynergy through multi-sourcing. There seems to be a misconception that both Microchip and Atmel microcontrollers are designed into the same socket and, therefore, there will be some dissynergy. We do not understand this concern. Due to different architectures, Microchip's and Atmel's microcontrollers are never designed into the same socket. There is also a concern that distributors will not sell a broad portfolio. We don't understand that either. If that line of thinking was to be true, then distributors should give all of Texas Instruments' business to me as they have a much broader portfolio than we do. 
Microchip and Atmel combined will do approximately $2 billion through the distribution channel. The combined product lines of Microchip and Atmel will be one of the most sought-after broad-based product lines with multiple opportunities for distribution for attaching analog, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, memory, USB, Ethernet, timing products and others.
The fifth concern raised has been our target is $0.33 accretion in fiscal year '17 and then $0.90 in fiscal year '19. This bridge is somewhat misunderstood. So let me clarify that. Let me first remind you about that accretion numbers again. They are $0.33 in fiscal year '17, $0.67 in fiscal year '18 and $0.90 in fiscal year '19. The accretion is coming from 3 factors: first, the operating expense reduction; second, the gross margin improvement and third, the revenue growth. The operating expense reduction is not a 1-year job. Because of the size of the transaction, we believe it will be a continuous effort over a 3-year period to rationalize the R&D as well as SG&A expenses and bring them into Microchip's cost structure. The gross margin improvement is also gradual through improvement of manufacturing efficiency as well as higher or lower emphasis on product lines based on their gross margin. And then, there will be revenue synergy also contributing to the EPS synergy. Atmel's revenue has been declining for the last 5 years as they have restructured out of the very large touch business and they also sold the Serial Flash business to a company called Adesto. We are confident that Atmel's revenue will bottom in the first half of 2016 and then grow afterwards. We also see a significant opportunity to attach analog and other connectivity products to Atmel's microcontrollers like we have been successful with Microchip's microcontrollers. In fact, I see the analog attach opportunities with Atmel's microcontrollers to be a bonanza for our analog business. The combination of all these factors build the accretion from $0.33 in fiscal '17 to $0.67 in fiscal year '18 to $0.90 in fiscal year '19.
The final concern we have heard about is the size of the deal. Microchip has been successful in smaller deals, can we duplicate that success with this larger deal? Now I must say that we heard of this concern when we bought SMSC also. SMSC was 4x larger than any deal we had done prior to that. Microchip today is at $2.2 billion company and it's capable of taking on a larger acquisition compared to what we could do a few years ago. Atmel's business is also quite familiar to us, which was unlike the case with SST, SMSC, et cetera. 
As I said before, Microchip management is capable of transforming its organization, resources and strategies to meet the challenges at a given time. Just today, we announced the promotion of Ganesh Moorthy to President and COO. In addition to Ganesh deserving of a promotion, it is also a recognition of the fact that we are taking on an acquisition that's about 47% of our own size, and it will require Ganesh and I both to manage this enterprise with all of the travel involved worldwide. We're also adjusting the organization below us to adapt to this new reality. Microchip is an incredible executive development machine. You may not know this, but Microchip has not hired a VP level person from outside the company for over 15 years, although we have gained some VPs through our acquisitions. 
Through training, mentoring and developing, we have groomed our own executives that have replaced some of the retirements that have taken place, as well as provided the leadership bandwidth required to effectively manage the growth that we have experienced. You cannot imagine the familiarity, understanding, cohesiveness, speed of execution and constancy of purpose that it builds in the organization. This culture has been one of the hallmarks of our success. We have been able to extend this culture to our many acquisitions and we believe that we will be able to achieve the same with Atmel. I hope that it alleviates some of your concerns. In closing, I would like to say that the December quarter marks the bottom for this correction and we're expecting a low single-digit sequential growth in the March quarter. Beyond the March quarter, we get into 2 back-to-back seasonally stronger quarters for Microchip. These quarters, beyond organic growth, will also have incremental accretion from the restructuring of Micrel and these quarters will begin to have accretion from the closing of the Atmel transaction. This triple effect coming from organic growth, accretion from Micrel and accretion from Atmel will set up the earnings growth momentum that we expect will lead us to a 23% non-GAAP EPS growth from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017. With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?"

We have declined some in the memory business, we declined in some of the other miscellaneous. When we have acquired these companies, these companies all did some of the foundry business. Supertex had some foundry business where any companies with their 6-inch fabs, they underload it and they tend to take odds and ins of the foundry business doing some work for other people, which goes on for years because nobody wants to move it. It's going to be a small amount of work. When you close the fab, that part of the business atrophies because nobody wants to transfer it to another fab. Atmel has some foundry business also. Supertex had it. Micrel had it. We put that all in the others. So I think when you look at it, all that, our core businesses have all done well. You can compare our core business to Atmel, you can compare it to Renesas, you can compare it to anybody else. And when the numbers come out from Gartner, we can share that with you. I think, other thing, John, I would say, is that we had largely broken out the organic versus inorganic numbers based on your request, you may recall. And I don't think it has helped us. The thing the investors and analysts have to recognize is that these acquisitions are an enormous amount of work. We take an enormous amount of Microchip executives and our people and our energy to bring these acquisitions, which were underperforming, really doing nothing. Micrel had done 6.7% operating profit in the quarter we bought them. And now their operating profits are approaching 20% and will be 30% or higher by the time we are done. All that effort will have gone into our business. In many cases -- take the case of Micrel, for example, we terminated one of our product, gigabit Ethernet, and we decided to take a gigabit Ethernet from Micrel and market it further because they were farther along in the development of that product. So when you look at it a year, 2 years, 3 years down the line, when you guys -- the way you interpret organic versus inorganic, you basically take all the earnings that we have produced, all the revenue that we have produced, all the work that we have done to take these acquisitions, which were essentially making no money and make hundreds and millions of dollars from this acquisitions to bring them into 30%-plus operating profit and you take them out from the top and saying our core business isn't doing well.

Did we discontinue the PC business? Did we discontinue the other parts of the business? This question is raised every time. When we go in, we assess the situation, we look at all the product lines, we see how it maps to our product line, what the margins are. We put higher focus on the product lines, which we can grow faster at higher margin. We put less focus on the product lines that have lower margin and we change the model mix, we change the factory strategy, we shut down factories, we move things around. In every acquisition, we have gotten those results. Two weeks after announcing the acquisition and the one in which, basically, we got very little insight into the company because of competitive factors compared to any of our acquisitions. Why do you guys always assume that the gross margin improvement has to happen only from discontinuing these product lines? Those pieces have been there before and they've been always wrong. We didn't do that in the prior acquisitions and, yet, we got them into -- last quarter, the December quarter, Supertex gross margin was 70%. That's actual data."

I know in the past, when we've hit a downturn, you've been able to ramp back OpEx for Microchip in order to protect EPS. Do you feel the same confidence in the ability to do that on Microchip with some leverage as you're in the process of paying down that leverage from the deal?"

And I think I spoke about it in the last conference call. I mean, do you really think a conservative management like Microchip will take on this acquisition and leverage without doing a real heavyweight downside analysis? And seeing in there where the leverage gets to, is there any threat to the dividend? What happens to the cash flow? What happens to the capital? Do you think we really would do that? So trust us that we did a real bottoms up analysis. And what happens in every downside is our capital needs dry up, and we have shared with you before in graphs that our capital needs some sustaining. A very small amount of capital is sustaining. But on the rest of the capital going to grow through new technologies and all that. And what we find is in a down environment, the capital needs dry up. When the capital needs dry up, there's a huge cash flow that comes up because you don't have to really spend all that money on capital. So yes, we did a downside analysis and the total leverage metric is 5 and the senior leverage hurdle is 3.0. And we don't really get close to those by taking all those factors into account."

And a lot of people put their entire microcontrollers in IoT and, if you do that, you got well over a $1 billion of business. But a very strict definition of IoT would be really not counting the microcontroller, but when really the application is really connected on the Internet wirelessly, either through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth or whatever. So I mean, our IoT business is approximately twice the size of Atmel's IoT business. Again, somebody could count it differently how you define it, but counting apples-to-apple. So it grows our business by 50%. We had all the functionality. We had the Wi-Fi, the Bluetooth, the BLE. So we had all the functionality. From that standpoint, we don't really get something new but when you get it scaled, 50% larger scale. And secondly, when you get into individual specs and products, people could argue, ""My product is better"" and ""Mine is lower power"" and ""Mine is larger range"" and this and that and that, and the combination of those we're going to get.

We competed with Freescale when they were a multi-billion dollar revenue company, $4 billion, $5 million company, and Microchip was just a $100 million, $200 million, then $500 million then $1 billion. And we have constantly competed, being a much smaller company, whether Renesas, with TI, with Freescale and with STMicro and others. Scale is important, but just scale for the sake of scale with not good product lines and not good execution and all that, a lot of larger companies have terrible business models.

For years, yes, we have had a common development tool because we could. All these things were developed internally at 8-bit and 16-bit with an internal architecture. And one of the thing -- reasons -- part of the reason we also choose MIPS was because we were able to work with them in a way that we could bring them into a common development environment, and Microchip tool set we were to extend to a MIPS architecture. But no other company has it. Freescale has a number of development environments for a power PC, for ARM architecture, for their 8-bit product line, 16-bit product line. Atmel has then -- they have AVR, they have ARM. A number of other companies have similar. Silicon Labs has an 8051 for 8-bit, then its ARM for 32-bit. So no other company has it. Those companies aren't dead. Now true, if we had bought a company with the same architecture, it will be incrementally better. But I think street is looking at it like it's dead, like it breaks that tool and then it's the end of the world. These are highly successful product lines in their own right. At other companies, they have existed with multiple architectures. They can exist under multiple architectures at Microchip. We already have -- we have an ARM development tool that sells products from SMSC. Roving Networks had it. So we used other architecture, we use AD51, we use ARC, we use ARM. But it's predominantly our own architecture, we would agree with it. But we have already, in the last few years, with other smaller acquisitions, already introduced ARM-based products. And if you were taking an ARM-based product that had no momentum, that was nowhere, then that would be a formidable challenge to develop it. But it's a successful product line, and so is the AVR 8-bit. So I just think -- look at it in that light. And on the ARM itself, for 8 years, you guys have hounded us for not having ARM, that it was a negative. Now we have ARM, and somehow it's negative again. You can't have it both ways."

We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are: Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our fourth quarter fiscal 2016 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, provide an update on the integration activities associated with the Micrel acquisition and provide some additional commentary on our announced acquisition of Atmel. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effect of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the March quarter were a record and at the high end of our guidance at $568.4 million, and were up 3% sequentially from net sales of $552 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Non-GAAP net sales were $10.8 million higher than GAAP net sales as we are reporting non-GAAP net sales on a full sell-through revenue recognition basis, while GAAP does not recognize revenue on the sell-through of products sitting in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs and when distributor contracts are changed to the standard of Microchip format compared to the sell-in revenue recognition contract that Micrel previously had for certain of the distribution partners. 
We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 58.4% in the March quarter, which was above the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 27% of sales below the bottom end of our guidance and non-GAAP operating income was 31.4% of sales, which was significantly above the high end of our guidance, which was 30.8%. Non-GAAP net income was $153 million, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $0.70, which was also above the high end of our guidance. 
For fiscal 2016, on a non-GAAP basis, net sales were a record $2.214 billion, an up 2.5% year-over-year, gross margins were 58.1%, operating expenses were 27.2% of sales and operating income was 31% of sales. Net income was $583.3 million and non-GAAP EPS was a record $2.68 per diluted share.
On a GAAP basis, net sales were $557.6 million and gross margins were 54.3% in the March quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $1.9 million of share-based compensation, $5.4 million of gross margin impact from the distributor revenue adjustment I mentioned earlier, $18.2 million an acquired inventory valuation cost and a manufacturing material issues of $3.6 million. Total operating expenses were $222.8 million or 40% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $48.1 million, share-based compensation of $15.4 million, $5 million of acquisition-related expenses and special charges of $0.8 million. GAAP net income was $67.4 million or $0.31 per diluted share.
For fiscal year 2016, GAAP net sales were a record $2.173 billion, gross margins were 55.5%, operating expenses were 39.3% of sales and operating income was 16.2% of sales. Net income was $324.1 million or $1.49 per diluted share. 
In the March quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 11% and the GAAP tax benefit rate was 16.9%. The non-GAAP tax rate does not reflect a $12.3 million benefit for nonrecurring items associated with the tax audit, settlements and other matters. Including Atmel, we expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 8% to 9%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our inventory balance at March 31, 2016, was $306.8 million. Excluding the purchase accounting adjustments going through the income statement, Microchip had a 117 days of inventory at March 31, 2016, which is down by 3 days from the levels at the end of the December quarter. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, inventory at our distributors was at 32 days, which is down 2 days from the December quarter level. I want to remind you that historically, Microchip's distribution revenue throughout the world has been recognized on a sell-through basis.
Atmel had a mixture of sell-in and sell-through revenue recognition in its distribution channel. Our non-GAAP revenue guidance provided in our release today is based on sell-through revenue recognition for the Atmel distributors for the entire June quarter in order to continue to provide investors with a view of the true end market demand for our products. There will be difference in GAAP revenue recognition as the inventory in Atmel sell-through distribution channels at the date of the acquisition will not be recognized as revenue for GAAP accounting purposes and also because some of the contracts with the Atmel distributors selling revenue recognition for GAAP accounting purposes.
The cash generation in the March quarter excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit was a record $196.3 million. This includes a $22 million cash benefit from unwinding the interest rate swap that we had in place. The swap was unwind as our natural hedge of floating rate debt went away by utilizing our cash to fund the Atmel acquisition. As of March 31, the consolidated cash total investment position was $2.565 billion. Our borrowings under our revolving line of credit as of March 31 was $1.052 billion, excluding dividend payments, changes in borrowing levels and acquisition-related activities, we expect our total cash generation to be approximately $140 million to $160 million in the June quarter.
Capital spending was approximately $16.5 million in the March quarter and $97.9 million in fiscal 20 section., well below $110 million forecast we provided on our last earnings call. We expected our $35 million captors spending in the June quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 to be about $140 million, including Atmel. We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our parts bring new products and technologies and to bring in house more of the assembly and test operation that are currently outsource. Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $26.2 million and $103.9 million for fiscal year 2016. 
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter. Ganesh?"

Today, I will give you a summary of our product line performance and then provide an update as to where we're with the Atmel integration from a product line perspective. Lets take a closer look performance of each of our product lines starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller revenue was up 5.5% in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter as we experienced a broad-based recovery in our business, all 3 businesses, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers were sequentially up with 16-bit and 32-bit businesses being up in double-digit percentages. Microcontrollers represented 59.9% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter.
Gartner data quest just released their microcontroller market share report for 2015. We're pleased to report that Microchip retained #1 position for 8-bit microcontrollers and once again, gained market share in 2015. In the 16-bit microcontroller market too, we continue to gain market share, while in the 32-bit microcontroller market share was about flat. The microcontroller market share data reported by Gartner is getting increasingly volatile driven by the inclusion of smart card and NFC revenue. And is further exacerbated by, I believe, data is inconsistently reported by the company's survey. 
Smart card and NFC revenue has no bearing on the broad-based microcontroller market, which is a much more resilient and profitable business and Microchip participates. We remain pleased with the performance and competitiveness of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the broad-based market. Our overall market results outperforming the market in a very competitive environment and these results are attributed to relentless effort by the worldwide Microchip team. We have gained market share, and we have a new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we further build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. The addition of Atmel microcontrollers to our portfolio was further strengthen our position and performance in the microcontroller market. 
Moving now to analog products. Our analog business was about flat in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter and was up 34.6% compared to the year ago quarter. 
In fiscal year 2016, which ended on March 31, our analog business was up 26.3% as compared to fiscal year 2015. The strong growth and increasing market share in fiscal year 2016 was a result of our organic growth efforts as well as the Atmel acquisition. Our analog business represented 30.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear mix signal, power interface and timing products to fill the future growth of our analog business. 
Moving now to our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products, as well as our SuperFlash Memory products. This business was down 1.8% in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains a consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serve several microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 4.8% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter.
Now an update about Atmel and where we are in the integration process. Since the close of the acquisition on April 4, we has spent considerable time understanding Atmel's businesses, organization and systems. We're developing detail integration plan that are in various stages of completion. Where we have decisions made, we have begun to execute those plans, while we continue to build and refine integration plan in other areas. Specific to the product line, here is where we are with our integration. We have combined Atmel's 8-bit AVR microcontroller business along with Microchip's 8-bit PIC microcontroller business under a single leader. The 8-bit AVR microcontroller, which is still very popular among the broad-based of engineers at atrophied under Atmel over the last 5 years, as resources were diverted to touch and 32-bit microcontrollers. 
That stopped on April 4 as we reprioritize resources to reintegrate the iconic AVR microcontrollers to drive growth. We expect to release a steady stream of innovative new AVR microcontrollers over the next 12 months, that will lead even as they continue to release the steady stream of innovative new 8-bit PIC microcontrollers. 
We have also combined Atmel's 32-bit microcontroller and 32-bit microprocessor business along with Microchip's 32-bit microcontroller business under a single leader. 32-bit microprocessor, by the way, are a new product category for Microchip and are typically higher performance and complex embedded control solutions. Unlike microcontrollers, which are Flash memory on chip, microprocessors have no Flash memory on chip and instead use much larger external Flash memories. Microchip had a PIC 32 microprocessor program, which was in its early stage of investment and we have decided to terminate that investment as we can capitalize on Atmel's 32-bit microprocessor road map, which is more advanced and already in significant revenue stage. 
Looking forward, we expect to continue to develop new SEM 32 and PIC 32 products exploiting specific area of specialization that each company had carved out over the years. While streamlining and harmonizing the technology and intellectual property building blocks that each will use. We have combined Atmel's wireless business and Microchip's wireless business under a single leader. The product lines have some overlap and roadmaps are in the process of being rationalized to bring the investment in line with what is appropriate for the business. 
In that light, one decision we made was to close Atmel's Wireless Development Center in mid-April. There is more wireless investment rationalization that is less today. We have combined Atmel's memory business and Microchip's memory business under a single leader. The product lines offer many substitutable products and while we will continue to support both product lines for any customer who cannot switch. For the great majority of the customers, we will converge to a best of product, which has the lowest overall cost and best overall customer value. We have also begun rationalizing going forward R&D investment to eliminate redundant projects either at Microchip or at Atmel. Atmel's touch business is process of being restructured into mobile and non-mobile, which is essentially the automotive and industrial businesses. We have identified the leadership structures required for 2 independent businesses as we announced on April 4, the automotive and industrial touch business will stay with Microchip in the long run, while the mobile touch business will be sold. We expect to have the 2 organizations in place sometime this quarter and to begin marketing the mobile touch business soon after.
Atmel's Security Solutions business consist of a number of crypto products. This is a newer field of place in Microchip and Atmel's offerings will add to and strengthen our security offerings as well as accelerate some of the solutions that Microchip had planned to independently develop. Steve will comment in more detail in his section about how we expect to see the accretion results rollout. 
Finally, let me provide an update on Atmel's acquisition. On the Atmel acquisition in regards to our product line reporting, Atmel's standard microcontroller revenue, including the automotive and inertial touch microcontrollers, will be reported as part of Microchip's microcontroller product line. Atmel's analog revenue, which is predominantly made up of products for the automotive market, will be reported as part of Microchip's analog product line. Atmel's memory revenue will be reported part of Microchip's Memory product line. Atmel's had a product line called multi-market, which included the aerospace business, the legacy CPLD business and foundry services business. Microchip will adopt multi-market as a product line moving forward and we will roll the revenue from our historic and other product line, which consisted of manufacturing services into this multi-market product line. Further, Atmel also has some legacy microcontrollers comprising either discontinued products or products which had not had any investment for many years. We intend to include revenue from these products in the multi-market product line as well. As we mentioned during our April 4 conference call, Atmel's mobile touch business classified as an asset out for sale and we will only report the net profit loss for this business below operating line of Microchip's income statement. Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, our guidance going forward and some more about the Atmel integration. Steve?"

Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2017. I will also make comments on the progress of integration for Micrel and newly acquired Atmel. Our March quarter financial results were very strong and mixed weak semiconductor industry backdrop. We achieved the high end of our net sales guidance, establishing a new record in the process and we exceeded the high end on the guidance for our non-GAAP gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was sequentially up approximately 11% from the December quarter due to improving sales, gross margin and operating expense leverage. I hope that demonstrates the operating leverage left in our premium business model.
Before I go into guidance, let me give you a brief update on the integration of Micrel and Atmel. On Micrel, we are essentially in the final stages of completing the integration. The 2 items remaining are both in the manufacturing area, the integration of back end operations into Microchip Systems is on schedule for August. The other item is the closing on the fab and we have an update on that. We could have closed Micrel fab in August by building a large amount of inventory for the customers to switch to Microchip 8-inch fabs. But as we have analyzed options after the Atmel purchase, we believe that a couple of processes are better transferred from the Micrel's 6-inch fab to Atmel's 6-inch fab in Colorado spring. This will require less inventory and result in lower risk to the customers and business units. Therefore, we are transferring the process to Atmel's fab and we will structure the Micrel fab to a very small operation, largely running a couple of those processes until they are qualified in the Atmel fab. We believe this will delay the final close of the Micrel fab by 4 months to December of 2016. The financial model of Micrel is starting to look very good. Recall that when we purchased Micrel about 9 months ago, it was making a gross margin of 48.4% and the operating profit was 6.7% of revenue. 
In the December 2015 quarter, we achieved 49.5% gross margin and 18% operating profit from Micrel. I'm happy to report that in the March 2016 quarter, we achieved 53.2% gross margin and 22.8% operating profit from Micrel. We now believe that after we close the fab, the final operating profit for Micrel will exceed 30% and will be above our original model.
By the way, Supertex integration is complete. Final result, gross margin in the high 60s and the operating expenses are really intertwined, so harder to decide for but safe to say that the operating profit is in the 30s. 
Now regarding Atmel, Ganesh provided the progress report on the integration of product lines of Atmel. This is not a whole lot more beyond that with just one month gone, we're in the process of across franchising Microchip and Atmel distributors and we are sorting through all the overlaps in rep coverage and major accounts. 
I will now provide guidance for the June 2016 quarter. We started out June quarter with a stronger backlog than we had going into January and the bookings and turns for the quarter, so far, have been strong. The Chinese New Year holidays in Asia are also behind us, although this is traditionally a slower quarter in Europe. Based on our analysis of economic and semiconductor industry conditions, as well as our own business indicators, we are guiding the March quarter net sales without Atmel to be up between 1% to 5% sequentially or between $574.1 million and $596.9 million.
We expect to non-GAAP gross margin, again without Atmel, to be between 58.2% and 58.6% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 26.3% and 26.6% of sales and we expect the non-GAAP operating profit to be between 31.6% and 32.3% of sales. We expect -- we expect our non-GAAP earnings per share without Atmel to be $0.70 to $0.74 per share. 
With this, let me now provide guidance for attrition from the acquisition of Atmel. There are 2 items that we need to be mindful of as we look at guidance for Atmel net sales. First, while Atmel reported its net sales based on sell-in revenue recognition through distributors in Asia, Microchip will report Atmel's non-GAAP sales based on its sell-through revenue recognition worldwide. Secondly, Microchip will report the mobile touch portion of Atmel business as an asset held-for-sale and will report this business unit profit or loss, below the net operating profit of Microchip and will exclude these net profit or loss for non-GAAP purposes. We expect Atmel to add approximately $225 million to $245 million in net sales for the continued businesses. We expect the continuing business of Atmel to be between 46% to 47% in gross margin and we expect the Atmel subsidiary to be between $0.00 to $0.05 accretive to Microchip's non-GAAP earnings per share.
So now let's combine the guidance for our core Microchip and Atmel. We expect June quarter net sales to be between $799.1 million and $841.9 million. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.70 to $0.79 per share. We continue to expect that Atmel will be about $0.25 accretive to Microchip non-GAAP earnings per share in fiscal year 2017. 
In closing, I would like to say that March quarter marks the start of the growth period for us after ending the inventory correction in the December quarter. 
In case of Atmel, the inventory on the balance sheet and the distribution inventory is still high and that is still some inventory correction to go through that is baked into our guidance. Combining growth from our core business, further accretion coming from Micrel and accretion from Atmel, this trip will affect will set up the earnings growth momentum, we have mentioned that we expect will lead us to an 18% non-GAAP EPS growth from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. With this, operator, will you please poll for questions."

The investment roadmaps have been, what they were, they were focused on 32-bit and touch. There wasn't as much on 8-bit. We see that as a potential area of growth for us going forward. There is a nice growth we believe in security. Certainly, in the microcontroller -- 32-bit microcontrollers and wireless areas that they have invested in. It's a little early to give you any specific numbers. We're working on that. We also have to look at how to balance that with investments Microchip has also been making in similar areas. So that's with respect to growth. On the positioning, I think, we have very clear ways in which products have areas of strength that they have developed. On 8-bit, the AVR has a strong following, a wide base of customers and applications and so does the PIC microcontrollers. The biggest opportunity on that is going to be how do we take analog products and create more attach around both companies efforts. Obviously, we've been doing that on 8-bit for a long time, now doing it for the AVR 8-bit as well. On 32-bit, microprocessors is an area that Atmel had as a strength. We haven't been doing it. We will take that and run with it and again, position the rest of our product lines to attach with the microprocessors. We expect on the microcontrollers that are ARM-based, as well as MIPS-based microcontrollers. So we will have PIC32s and 32 products, they each have different uniqueness around them, have gone up a slightly different markets, in some cases, they could be commonality of customer. And so largely on the microcontrollers, we are not expecting that this big shakeups in the roadmaps. And then, outside of microcontrollers, really the rest of the product lines are reasonably well positioned."

So if you add it to the midpoint of our guidance that we provided, it's about $250 million. So it's really neither way up or down much. We basically feel that Atmel was in the middle of a very major inventory correction. There was a very, very large amount of distribution inventory as well as the insight inventory. We have seen some of that behavior with the sell-in driven companies in our prior acquisitions also, but this one was really over the top. As we announced back on April for that based on sell-in driven revenue recognition, the revenue was only in the $220 million range. So there was really a massive inventory correction in distribution. If they were stand-alone then the revenue would just have been very, very low. And I think the second part of your question was, when do we see growth. We believe we see stabilization beginning now.

I think, if you, if you take it from the high level, in consolidation of any industry, there are company's at the bottom that have been underperforming for years.

I think, if you, if you take it from the high level, in consolidation of any industry, there are company's at the bottom that have been underperforming for years. They are being forced by either their boards or the activist investors to seek strategic alternatives, which is another word for basically selling the company. Such consolidation is now taking place in the semiconductor industry and we have been kind of one of the consolidators, Microchip has purchased a number of companies that were all underperforming. And in each of these companies, we found some negative surprises after we bought the companies. But Microchip has systematically transform the companies that we have brought into in the highly profitable enterprises, performing in the Microchip business model for giving you examples of SMSC, Micrel, Supertex before. And we believe that we'll be able to do the same with Atmel. We have competed Atmel for years. What we knew of Atmel from outside was that they have very good products in technology. And a month after we have purchased them, we have confirmed that many of Atmel's products and technologies are good. And they fit very well with Microchip's products, technologies and our roadmaps. But at the same time, we always wondered why Atmel was such a good products in technology, always underperformed and could not make even 1/3 of the profit that Microchip made. We now have a deeper understanding of that. And the easiest way to describe that is, they were very purely managed. I will put that in 5 main buckets. First, the poor accountability for results. I mean, kept giving bonuses and raises or whatever irrespective of the performance of the company. So very poor accountability for results. Number second, poor teamwork as we have seen teamwork we're doing sales, and operations and planning and inventory and if everybody does what they need to do, and very poor teamwork. Number three, very high spending culture, obviously, operating expenses in excess of 40% of revenue. Number four, always stringing for home runs and essentially getting stuck out, stuck out versus Microchip building its business with singles and doubles. And finally number five, very poor pricing discipline. So I think those are the 5 areas we have diagnosed, again, poor accountability for results, poor teamwork, very high spending culture, stringing for for the home runs and very, very poor pricing discipline. So we have now combined most of Atmel's business units under Microchip leaders, so that we can begin to teach and implement our system of teamwork, accountability, operating expense, discipline, broad customer base and strong pricing discipline. As we have done with our SMSC, Supertex, and Micrel, we'll be sharing that progress with the investors and analysts in the coming quarter. Atmel is not the first company and that I have been stressed over after purchasing them, but I'm confident that just like in other cases, investor will like the results we deliver as we transform Atmel's good products and technologies to yield kind of Microchip kind of financial performance. So that's kind of how I see."

We have set up meetings already where operations and business units are in a common meeting for getting out what the demand is, what we should build. Those things were not connected basically. Business units demand over the and manufacturing group went and built it and sales never booked that order, I never won that design and there are lots and lots of millions of parts sitting written off and there was a very, very high amount of inventory write-off at Atmel.

And when you then measure revenue by sell-in, the revenue had a deep follow-up in the latter quarters, which is what your committing in a significant revenue drop of Atmel in 2015. And I'm not figuring that the revenue was 17%, 17.5%. From the number that we're guiding you today, we see this number to be the starting point of stabilization in Atmel's revenue. There is somewhat distribution inventory correction to go through, so the second half of this year should be stronger than the first half. Now beyond that would be better execution, combined roadmap, good pricing discipline, greatest distribution methodology, cross-selling distributor each of this product, analog, attach and others, we need to produce a growth rate from Atmel, which is, at least, as much as the industry.

So we have found foreign businesses in Atmel, a particular line items to particular customers that were at negative gross margins, where you are wrapping around every part that you're shipping, and some of that happening even on non-commodity products even microcontrollers. I mean why would you do that? So I think as we try to correct those things, I put the -- I put the brand in 3 different categories, 3 different positioning and let me take that angle from a marketing standpoint. A company has a brand position, which is really what to the customer think of the company, then a company has a product position, positioning where what is the customer think of company's products. And then the third company has a pricing position, where what do the customer think of the value the company provides to the customers on its products. So positioning is important in 3 different ways, brand positioning product positioning, and pricing positioning. When I look at Microchip, I find this very strong in all 3. We have a good brand reputation, we have a good product positioning, and we have good pricing positioning where we're able to draw very, very good pricing by customer seeing the value in our products that's how we make near 60% gross margin. When I apply the same principle to Atmel, I find they have a good product positioning and Ganesh and I mentioned that we find have good products. The company probably has just an okay brand position as a company, but it has a very poor pricing positioning, where it hasn't positioned its products to be able to show the value to the customer. And they sell them like, like jelly beans. So as Microchip starts to put the discipline in place, and there are common customers where we do business with and same customers that Atmel does business with. And that's something in paper where some executive laboring about and being pissed off or whatever, but no longer have a job, the cheese has been moved. But all these customers are doing business with Microchip. And they're doing business with Microchip, we're able to position our products at a much higher value. And we have substantially higher gross margin at the same customers, where Atmel has a very poor gross margin."

We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are: Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2016 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on the integration activities associated with the Atmel and Micrel acquisitions. We will then be available to respond to specific investor-and-analyst questions.
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to those results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the March quarter were a record and at the high end of our guidance at $568.4 million and were up 3% sequentially from net sales of $552 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Non-GAAP net sales were $10.8 million higher than GAAP net sales as we are reporting non-GAAP net sales on a full sell-through revenue recognition basis while GAAP does not recognize revenue on the sell-through of products sitting in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs and when distributor contracts are changed to the standard Microchip format compared to the sell-in revenue recognition contracts that Micrel previously had for certain of their distribution partners. 
We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference. 
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 58.4% in the March quarter, which was above the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 27% of sales, below the bottom end of our guidance. And non-GAAP operating income was 31.4% of sales, which was significantly above the high end of our guidance, which was 30.8%. Non-GAAP net income was $153 million, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $0.70, which was also above the high end of our guidance. 
For fiscal 2016, on a non-GAAP basis, net sales were a record $2.214 billion, an up 2.5% year-over-year. Gross margins were 58.1%. Operating expenses were 27.2% of sales, and operating income was 31% of sales. Net income was $583.3 million, and non-GAAP EPS was a record $2.68 per diluted share.
On a GAAP basis, net sales were $557.6 million, and gross margins were 54.3% in the March quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $1.9 million of share-based compensation, $5.4 million of gross margin impact from the distributor revenue adjustment I mentioned earlier, $18.2 million in acquired inventory valuation cost and a manufacturing vendor material issues of $3.6 million. Total operating expenses were $222.8 million or 40% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $48.1 million, share-based compensation of $15.4 million, $5 million of acquisition-related expenses and special charges of $0.8 million. GAAP net income was $67.4 million or $0.31 per diluted share.
For fiscal year 2016, GAAP net sales were a record $2.173 billion. Gross margins were 55.5%. Operating expenses were 39.3% of sales, and operating income was 16.2% of sales. Net income was $324.1 million or $1.49 per diluted share. 
In the March quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 11%, and the GAAP tax benefit rate was 16.9%. The non-GAAP tax rate does not reflect a $12.3 million benefit for nonrecurring items associated with the tax audit, settlement and other matters. Including Atmel, we expect our longer-term, forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 8% to 9%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our inventory balance at March 31, 2016 was $306.8 million. Excluding the purchase accounting adjustments flowing through the income statement, Microchip had 117 days of inventory at March 31, 2016, which is down by 3 days from the levels at the end of the December quarter. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, inventory at our distributors was at 32 days, which is down 2 days from the December quarter levels. I want to remind you that, historically, Microchip's distribution revenue throughout the world has been recognized on a sell-through basis.
Atmel had a mixture of sell-in and sell-through revenue recognition in its distribution channel. Our non-GAAP revenue guidance provided in our release today is based on sell-through revenue recognition for the Atmel distributors for the entire June quarter in order to continue to provide investors with a view of the true end market demand for our products. There will be a difference in GAAP revenue recognition as the inventory in Atmel sell-through distribution channels at the date of the acquisition will not be recognized as revenue for GAAP accounting purposes and also because some of the contracts with the Atmel distributors drive selling revenue recognition for GAAP accounting purposes.
The cash generation in the March quarter, excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit, was a record $196.3 million. This includes a $22 million cash benefit from unwinding the interest rate swap that we had in place. The swap was unwound as our natural hedge of floating rate debt went away by utilizing our cash to fund the Atmel acquisition. As of March 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.565 billion. Our borrowings under our revolving line of credit as of March 31 were $1.052 billion. Excluding dividend payments, changes in borrowing levels and acquisition-related activities, we expect our total cash generation to be approximately $140 million to $160 million in the June quarter.
Capital spending was approximately $16.5 million in the March quarter and $97.9 million in fiscal 2016, well below the $110 million forecast we provided on our last earnings call. We expect about $35 million in capital spending in the June quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 to be about $140 million, including Atmel. 
We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. 
Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $26.2 million and $103.9 million for fiscal year 2016. 
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter. Ganesh?"

Today, I will give you a summary of our product line performance and then provide an update as to where we are with the Atmel integration from a product line perspective. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. 
Our microcontroller revenue was up 5.5% in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter as we experienced a broad-based recovery in our business. All 3 businesses, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers, were sequentially up with the 16-bit and 32-bit businesses being up in double-digit percentages. Microcontrollers represented 59.9% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter.
Gartner Dataquest just released their microcontroller market share report for 2015. We are pleased to report that Microchip retained the #1 position for 8-bit microcontrollers and, once again, gained market share in 2015. In the 16-bit microcontroller market, too, we continue to gain market share. While in the 32-bit microcontroller market, our market share was about flat. 
The microcontroller market share data reported by Gartner is getting increasingly volatile, driven by the inclusion of smart card and NFC revenue, and is further exacerbated by, I believe, that this data is inconsistently reported by the company's survey. Smart card and NFC revenue has no bearing on the broad-based microcontroller market, which is a much more resilient and profitable business and where Microchip participates. 
We remain pleased with the performance and competitiveness of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the broad-based market. Our overall microcontrollers results are outperforming the market in a very competitive environment, and these results are attributed to the relentless effort by the worldwide Microchip team. We have gained market share, and we have a new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we further build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. The addition of Atmel microcontrollers to our portfolio will further strengthen our position and performance in the microcontroller market. 
Moving now to analog products. Our analog business was about flat in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter and was up 34.6% compared to the year ago quarter. In fiscal year 2016, which ended on March 31, our analog business was up 26.3% as compared to fiscal year 2015. The strong growth and increasing market share in fiscal year 2016 was a result of our organic growth efforts as well as the Micrel acquisition. Our analog business represented 30.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear mix signal, power interface and timing products to fuel the future growth of our analog business. 
Moving now to our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory products. This business was down 1.8% in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 4.8% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter.
Now an update about Atmel and where we are in the integration process. Since the close of the acquisition on April 4, we have spent considerable time understanding Atmel's businesses, organization and systems. We're developing detail integration plans that are in various stages of completion. Where we have decisions made, we have begun to execute those plans while we continue to build and refine integration plans in other areas. 
Specific to the product lines, here is where we are with our integration. We have combined Atmel's 8-bit AVR microcontroller business along with Microchip's 8-bit PIC microcontroller business under a single leader. The 8-bit AVR microcontroller, which is still very popular among a broad-based of engineers, had atrophied under Atmel over the last 5 years as resources were diverted to Touch and 32-bit microcontrollers. That stopped on April 4 as we reprioritize resources to reinvigorate their iconic AVR microcontrollers to drive growth. We expect to release a steady stream of innovative new AVR microcontrollers over the next 12 months that will lead in tree surgeons even as we continue to release a steady stream of innovative new 8-bit PIC microcontrollers. 
We have also combined Atmel's SAM 32-bit microcontroller and 32-bit microprocessor business, along with Microchip's 32-bit microcontroller business, under a single leader. 32-bit microprocessors, by the way, are a new product category for Microchip and are typically higher performance and complex embedded-control solutions. Unlike microcontrollers, which are flash memory on chip, microprocessors have no flash memory on chip and instead use much larger external flash memories. Microchip had a PIC 32 microprocessor program, which was in its early stage of investment, and we have decided to terminate that investment as we can capitalize on Atmel's SAM 32-bit microprocessor road map, which is more advanced and already in significant revenue stage. Looking forward, we expect to continue to develop new SAM 32 and PIC 32 products, exploiting specific areas of specialization that each company had carved out over the years while streamlining and harmonizing the technology and intellectual property building blocks that each will use. 
We have combined Atmel's wireless business and Microchip's wireless business under a single leader. The product lines have some overlap, and road maps are in the process of being rationalized to bring the investment in line with what is appropriate for the business. In that light, one decision we made was to close Atmel's Dresden Wireless Development Center in mid-April. There is more wireless investment rationalization that is left to do. 
We have combined Atmel's memory business and Microchip's memory business under a single leader. The product lines offer many substitutable products. And while we will continue to support both product lines for any customer who cannot switch, for the great majority of the customers, we will converge to a best-of-breed product which has the lowest overall cost and best overall customer value. 
We have also begun rationalizing the going-forward R&D investment to eliminate redundant projects either at Microchip or at Atmel. 
Atmel's Touch business is in the process of being restructured into mobile and nonmobile, which is essentially the Automotive and Industrial businesses. We have identified the leadership structures required for 2 independent businesses. As we announced on April 4, the Automotive and Industrial Touch business will stay with Microchip in the long run while the Mobile Touch business will be sold. We expect to have the 2 organizations in place sometime this quarter and to begin marketing the Mobile Touch business soon after.
Atmel's Security Solutions business consist of a number of crypto products. This is a newer field of play for Microchip, and Atmel's offerings will add to and strengthen our security offerings as well as accelerate some of the solutions that Microchip had planned to independently develop. Steve will comment in more detail in his section about how we expect to see the accretion results roll out. 
Finally, let me provide an update on Atmel's acquisition -- on the Atmel acquisition in regards to our product line reporting. Atmel's standard microcontroller revenue, including the automotive and industrial touch microcontrollers, will be reported as part of Microchip's microcontroller product line. Atmel's analog revenue, which is predominantly made up of products for the automotive market, will be reported as part of Microchip's analog product line. Atmel's memory revenue will be reported as part of Microchip's Memory product line. 
Atmel had a product line called Multi-Market, which included the aerospace business, the legacy CPLD business and the foundry services business. Microchip will adopt Multi-Market as a product line moving forward, and we will roll the revenue from our historical Other product line, which consisted of manufacturing services, into this Multi-Market product line. 
Further, Atmel also has some legacy ASIC microcontrollers comprising either discontinued products or products which had not had any investment for many years. We intend to include revenue from these products in the Multi-Market product line as well. 
As we mentioned during our April 4 conference call, Atmel's Mobile Touch business will be classified as an asset held for sale, and we will only report the net profit or loss for this business below the operating line of Microchip's income segment -- income statement. 
Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, our guidance going forward and some more about the Atmel integration. Steve?"

Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2017. I will also make comments on the progress of integration for Micrel and the newly acquired Atmel. 
Our March quarter financial results were very strong and mixed weak semiconductor industry backdrop. We achieved the high end of our net sales guidance, establishing a new record in the process, and we exceeded the high end of the guidance for our non-GAAP gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share. 
Our non-GAAP earnings per share was sequentially up approximately 11% from the December quarter due to improving sales, gross margin and operating expense leverage. I hope that emphatically demonstrates the operating leverage left in our premium business model.
Before I go into guidance, let me give you a brief update on the integration of Micrel and Atmel. On Micrel, we are essentially in the final stages of completing the integration. The 2 items remaining are both in the manufacturing area. The integration of back-end operations into Microchip systems is on schedule for August. The other item is the closing on the fab, and we have an update on that. 
We could have closed Micrel fab in August by building a large amount of inventory for the customers to switch to Microchip's 8-inch fabs, but as we have analyzed options after the Atmel purchase, we believe that a couple of processes are better transferred from the Micrel's 6-inch fab to Atmel's 6-inch fab in Colorado Springs. This will require less inventory and result in lower risk to the customers and business units. Therefore, we are transferring the process to Atmel's fab, and we will structure the Micrel fab to a very small operation, largely running a couple of those processes until they are qualified in the Atmel fab. We believe this will delay the final close of the Micrel fab by 4 months to December of 2016. 
The financial model of Micrel is starting to look very good. Recall that when we purchased Micrel about 9 months ago, it was making a gross margin of 48.4%, and the operating profit was 6.7% of revenue. In the December 2015 quarter, we achieved a 49.5% gross margin and 18% operating profit from Micrel. I'm happy to report that in the March 2016 quarter, we achieved 53.2% gross margin and 22.8% operating profit from Micrel. We now believe that after we close the fab, the final operating profit model for Micrel will exceed 30% and will be above our original model.
By the way, Supertex integration is complete. Final result: gross margin in the high 60s, and the operating expenses are really intertwined, so harder to decipher, but safe to say that the operating profit is in the 30s. 
Now regarding Atmel. Ganesh provided the progress report on the integration of product lines of Atmel. There is not a whole lot more beyond that with just 1 month gone. We are in the process of cross-franchising Microchip and Atmel distributors, and we are sorting through all the overlaps in the rep coverage and major accounts. 
I will now provide guidance for the June 2016 quarter. We started out June quarter with a stronger backlog than we had going into January, and the bookings and turns for the quarter, so far, have been strong. The Chinese New Year holidays in Asia are also behind us, although this is traditionally a slower quarter in Europe. Based on our analysis of economic and semiconductor industry conditions, as well as our own business indicators, we are guiding the March quarter net sales, without Atmel, to be up between 1% to 5% sequentially or between $574.1 million and $596.9 million.
We expect to non-GAAP gross margin, again without Atmel, to be between 58.2% and 58.6% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 26.3% and 26.6% of sales, and we expect the non-GAAP operating profit to be between 31.6% and 32.3% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP earnings per share, without Atmel, to be $0.70 to $0.74 per share. 
With this, let me now provide guidance for attrition from the acquisition of Atmel. There are 2 items that we need to be mindful of as we look at guidance for Atmel net sales. First, while Atmel reported its net sales based on sell-in revenue recognition through distributors in Asia, Microchip will report Atmel's non-GAAP sales based on its sell-through revenue recognition worldwide. Secondly, Microchip will report the Mobile Touch portion of Atmel business as an asset held for sale and will report this business unit's profit or loss below the net operating profit of Microchip and will exclude these net profit or loss for non-GAAP purposes. 
Now based on that, we expect Atmel to add approximately $225 million to $245 million in net sales for the continued businesses. We expect the continuing business of Atmel to be between 46% to 47% in gross margin, and we expect the Atmel subsidiary to be between $0.00 to $0.05 accretive to Microchip's non-GAAP earnings per share.
So now let's combine the guidance for core Microchip and Atmel. We expect June quarter net sales to be between $799.1 million and $841.9 million. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.70 to $0.79 per share. We continue to expect that Atmel will be about $0.25 accretive to Microchip's non-GAAP earnings per share in fiscal year 2017. 
In closing, I would like to say that March quarter marks the start of the growth period for us after ending the inventory correction in the December quarter. In case of Atmel, the inventory on the balance sheet and the distribution inventory is still high, and there is still some inventory correction to go through that is baked into our guidance. 
Combining growth from our core business, further accretion coming from Micrel and the accretion from Atmel, this triple affect will set up the earnings growth momentum that we expect will lead us to an 18% non-GAAP EPS growth from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017. 
With this, operator, will you please poll for questions."

They were focused on 32-bit and Touch alone. There wasn't as much on 8-bit. We see that as a potential area of growth for us going forward. There is a nice growth, we believe, in security certainly in the microcontroller -- 32-bit microcontroller and wireless areas that they have invested in. It's a little early to give you any specific numbers. We're working on that. We also have to look at how to balance that with investments Microchip has also been making in similar areas. So that's with respect to growth. On the positioning, I think we have very clear ways in which products have areas of strength that they have developed. On 8-bit, the AVR has a strong following, a wide base of customers and applications, and so does the PIC microcontrollers. The biggest opportunity on that is going to be: How do we take our analog products and create more attach around both companies efforts? Obviously, we've been doing that on 8-bit for a long time, now doing it for the AVR 8-bit as well. On 32-bit, microprocessors is an area that Atmel had as a strength. We haven't been doing it. We'll take that and run with it, and again, position the rest of our product lines to attach with their microprocessors. We expect on the microcontrollers that are ARM-based as well as MIPS-based microcontrollers, so we'll have PIC 32s and SAM 32 products. They each have different uniqueness around them, have gone after slightly different markets. In some cases, there could be commonality of customers. And so largely on the microcontrollers, we're not expecting that there's big shakeups in the road maps. And then outside of microcontrollers, really, the rest of the product lines are reasonably well positioned."

So if you add it to the midpoint of our guidance that we provided, it's about $250 million, so it's really neither way up or down much. We basically feel that Atmel was in the middle of a very major inventory correction. There was a very, very large amount of distribution inventory as well as the insight inventory. We have seen some of that behavior with the sell-in-driven companies in our prior acquisitions also, but this one was really over the top. As we announced back on April 4 that based on its sell-in-driven revenue recognition, the revenue was only in the $220 million range. So there was really a massive inventory correction in distribution. If they were standalone, then the revenue would just have been very, very low. And I think the second part of your question was when do we see growth. We believe we see stabilization beginning now, and it continuously improves. We are improving Atmel's systems on many different fronts, and you will see the second half of this year to be significantly better than what you have seen in the first half."

I think if you take it from the high level, in consolidation of any industry, there are companies at the bottom that have been underperforming for years. They are being forced by either their boards or the activist investors to seek strategic alternatives, which is another word for basically selling the company. Such consolidation is now taking place in the semiconductor industry, and we have been kind of one of the consolidators. Microchip has purchased a number of companies that were all underperforming, and in each of these companies, we found some negative surprises after we bought the companies. But Microchip has systematically transformed the companies that we have brought into in the highly-profitable enterprises, performing in the Microchip business model by giving you examples of SMSC, Micrel, Supertex before. And we believe that we'll be able to do the same with Atmel. We have competed Atmel for years. What we knew of Atmel from outside was that they have very good products and technology. And a month after we have purchased them, we have confirmed that many of Atmel's products and technologies are good, and they fit very well with Microchip's products, technologies and our road maps. But at the same time, we always wondered why Atmel with such good products and technologies always underperformed and could not make even 1/3 of the profit that Microchip made. We now have a deeper understanding of that. And the easiest way to describe that is, they were very poorly managed. I will put that in 5 main buckets. First, a very poor accountability for results, I mean, kept giving bonuses and raises or whatever, irrespective of the performance of the company. So very poor accountability for results. Number second, poor teamwork as we have seen teamwork were doing sales and operations and planning and inventory, and just everybody does what they need to do, and very poor teamwork. Number three, very high spending culture, obviously, operating expenses in excess of 40% of revenue. Number four, always stringing for home runs and essentially getting stuck out, struck out versus Microchip building its businesses with singles and doubles. And finally, number five, very poor pricing discipline. So I think those are the 5 areas we have diagnosed. Again: poor accountability for results; poor teamwork; very high spending culture; stringing for fences, for the home runs; and very, very poor pricing discipline. So we have now combined most of Atmel's business units under Microchip leaders so that we can begin to teach and implement our system of teamwork, accountability, operating expense, discipline, broad customer base and strong pricing discipline. As we have done with our SMSC, Supertex, and Micrel, we'll be sharing that progress with the investors and analysts in the coming quarters. Atmel is not the first company in that I have been stressed over after purchasing them, but I'm confident that, just like in other cases, investor will like the results we deliver as we transform Atmel's good products and technologies to yield kind of Microchip kind of financial performance. So that's kind of how I see it."

But we have a deep experience inside of Microchip, the people we have prepared and battle-hardened to do these integrations over many, many different acquisitions. Remember, we have done acquisition in memory, which was SST. We have done acquisitions in wireless before. We have done acquisitions in logic businesses like SMSC. We have acquired manufacturing assets before where we brought one of the test plant, MMT. We brought a fab plant in Oregon. So across our diverse management structure, we have deep expertise in integrating acquired companies across many, many disciplines. And the entire that trained and battled-hardened management team of Microchip is really at work at Atmel, where essentially, all but one or sort of the divisions today, business units, are being led by Microchip executive. And we are basically making the operational changes, the cultural changes, the teamwork changes. We have set up meetings already, where operations and business units are in a common meeting for getting out what the demand is, what we should build. Those things were not connected basically. Business units truly demand over the wall, and manufacturing group went and built it. And sales never booked that order, never won that design. And there are lots and lots of millions of parts sitting, written off. And there was a very, very high amount of inventory write-off at Atmel when we look at the history of that, and it doesn't compare anything with Microchip, where we are really well run. Rare that you have any kind of large inventory write-off, so we are implementing all of Microchip's processes. And as we implement Microchip's processes, then a lot of the gross margin and another improvement will just happen because you don't write off the inventory. There's a better pricing discipline. There is less OpEx. People are working together. All that kind of stuff."

So 1 month after this, we're not ready to talk about what happens to Atmel's revenue 3 years from now. What we are seeing is that there was a very, very large shipment into distribution where distribution inventory was out of sight. And when you then measure revenue by sell-in, the revenue had a steep fall off in the later quarters, which is what you're counting in as significant revenue drop of Atmel in 2015. And I'm not disfiguring that the revenue was 17%, 17.5%. From the number that we're guiding you today, we see this number to be the starting point of stabilization in Atmel's revenue. There is some more distribution inventory correction to go through, so the second half of this year should be stronger than the first half. Now beyond that would be better execution, combined road maps, good pricing discipline, great distribution methodology or cross-selling distributor at each of those products, analog attach and others. We need to produce a growth rate from Atmel, which is, at least, as much as the industry. I don't think that will be that difficult from how atrophied it is, and we have seen that in other acquisitions. Beyond that, I can't tell. You have the numbers, too."

Then a company has a product position -- positioning, where, what does the customer think of company's products. And then the third, company has a pricing position, where, what do the customers think of the value the company provides to the customers on its products. So positioning is important 3 different ways: brand positioning, product positioning and pricing positioning. When I look at Microchip, I find us very strong in all 3. We have a good brand reputation; we have a good product positioning; and we have good pricing positioning, where we're able to draw very, very good pricing by customers seeing the value in our products.

During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are: Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2016 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on the integration activities associated with the Atmel and Micrel acquisitions. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to those results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the March quarter were a record and at the high end of our guidance at $568.4 million and were up 3% sequentially from net sales of $552 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Non-GAAP net sales were $10.8 million higher than GAAP net sales as we are reporting non-GAAP net sales on a full sell-through revenue recognition basis while GAAP does not recognize revenue on the sell-through of products sitting in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs and when distributor contracts are changed to the standard Microchip format compared to the sell-in revenue recognition contracts that Micrel previously had for certain of their distribution partners. 
We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference. 
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 58.4% in the March quarter, which was above the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 27% of sales, below the bottom end of our guidance. And non-GAAP operating income was 31.4% of sales, which was significantly above the high end of our guidance, which was 30.8%. Non-GAAP net income was $153 million, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $0.70, which was also above the high end of our guidance. 
For fiscal 2016, on a non-GAAP basis, net sales were a record $2.214 billion, an up 2.5% year-over-year. Gross margins were 58.1%. Operating expenses were 27.2% of sales and operating income was 31% of sales. Net income was $583.3 million and non-GAAP EPS was a record $2.68 per diluted share.
On a GAAP basis, net sales were $557.6 million, and gross margins were 54.3% in the March quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $1.9 million of share-based compensation, $5.4 million of gross margin impact from the distributor revenue adjustment I mentioned earlier, $18.2 million in acquired inventory valuation costs and a manufacturing vendor material issues of $3.6 million. Total operating expenses were $222.8 million or 40% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $48.1 million, share-based compensation of $15.4 million, $5 million of acquisition-related expenses and special charges of $0.8 million. GAAP net income was $67.4 million or $0.31 per diluted share.
For fiscal year 2016, GAAP net sales were a record $2.173 billion. Gross margins were 55.5%. Operating expenses were 39.3% of sales and operating income was 16.2% of sales. Net income was $324.1 million or $1.49 per diluted share. 
In the March quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 11% and the GAAP tax benefit rate was 16.9%. The non-GAAP tax rate does not reflect a $12.3 million benefit for nonrecurring items associated with a tax audit, settlement and other matters. Including Atmel, we expect our longer-term, forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 8% to 9%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our inventory balance at March 31, 2016 was $306.8 million. Excluding the purchase accounting adjustments flowing through the income statement, Microchip had 117 days of inventory at March 31, 2016, which is down by 3 days from the levels at the end of the December quarter. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, inventory at our distributors was at 32 days, which is down 2 days from the December quarter levels. I want to remind you that, historically, Microchip's distribution revenue throughout the world has been recognized on a sell-through basis.
Atmel had a mixture of sell-in and sell-through revenue recognition in its distribution channel. Our non-GAAP revenue guidance provided in our release today is based on sell-through revenue recognition for the Atmel distributors for the entire June quarter in order to continue to provide investors with a view of the true end market demand for our products. There will be a difference in GAAP revenue recognition as the inventory in Atmel sell-through distribution channels at the date of the acquisition will not be recognized as revenue for GAAP accounting purposes and also because some of the contracts with the Atmel distributors drive sell-in revenue recognition for GAAP accounting purposes.
The cash generation in the March quarter, excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit, was a record $196.3 million. This includes a $22 million cash benefit from unwinding the interest rate swap that we had in place. The swap was unwound as our natural hedge of floating rate debt went away by utilizing our cash to fund the Atmel acquisition. As of March 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.565 billion. Our borrowings under our revolving line of credit as of March 31 were $1.052 billion. Excluding dividend payments, changes in borrowing levels and our acquisition-related activities, we expect our total cash generation to be approximately $140 million to $160 million in the June quarter.
Capital spending was approximately $16.5 million in the March quarter and $97.9 million in fiscal 2016, well below the $110 million forecast we provided on our last earnings call. We expect about $35 million in capital spending in the June quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 to be about $140 million, including Atmel. 
We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. 
Depreciation expense in the March quarter was $26.2 million and $103.9 million for fiscal year 2016. 
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the March quarter. Ganesh?"

Today, I will give you a summary of our product line performance and then provide an update as to where we are with the Atmel integration from a product line perspective. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. 
Our microcontroller revenue was up 5.5% in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter as we experienced a broad-based recovery in our business. All 3 businesses, 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers, were sequentially up with the 16-bit and 32-bit businesses being up in double-digit percentages. Microcontrollers represented 59.9% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter.
Gartner Dataquest just released their microcontroller market share report for 2015. We are pleased to report that Microchip retained the #1 position for 8-bit microcontrollers and, once again, gained market share in 2015. In the 16-bit microcontroller market, too, we continue to gain market share. While in the 32-bit microcontroller market, our market share was about flat. 
The microcontroller market share data reported by Gartner is getting increasingly volatile, driven by the inclusion of smart card and NFC revenue, and is further exacerbated by, I believe, that this data is inconsistently reported by the company's survey. Smart card and NFC revenue has no bearing on the broad-based microcontroller market, which is a much more resilient and profitable business and where Microchip participates. 
We remain pleased with the performance and competitiveness of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the broad-based market. Our overall microcontroller results are outperforming the market in a very competitive environment, and these results are a tribute to the relentless effort by the worldwide Microchip team. We have gained market share, and we have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we further build the best-performing microcontroller franchise in the industry. The addition of Atmel microcontrollers to our portfolio will further strengthen our position and performance in the microcontroller market. 
Moving now to analog products. Our analog business was about flat in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter and was up 34.6% compared to the year ago quarter. In fiscal year 2016, which ended on March 31, our analog business was up 26.3% as compared to fiscal year 2015. The strong growth and increase in market share in fiscal year 2016 was the result of our organic growth efforts as well as the Micrel acquisition. Our analog business represented 30.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear, mixed signal, power, interface and timing products to fuel the future growth of our analog business. 
Moving now to our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory products. This business was down 1.8% in the March quarter as compared to the December quarter. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 4.8% of Microchip's overall revenue in the March quarter.
Now an update about Atmel and where we are in the integration process. Since the close of the acquisition on April 4, we have spent considerable time understanding Atmel's businesses, organization and systems. We're developing detailed integration plans that are in various stages of completion. Where we have decisions made, we have begun to execute those plans while we continue to build and refine integration plans in other areas. 
Specific to the product lines, here is where we are with our integration. We have combined Atmel's 8-bit AVR microcontroller business along with Microchip's 8-bit PIC microcontroller business under a single leader. The 8-bit AVR microcontroller, which is still very popular among a broad base of engineers, had atrophied under Atmel over the last 5 years as resources were diverted to Touch and 32-bit microcontrollers. That stopped on April 4 as we reprioritized resources to reinvigorate their iconic AVR microcontrollers to drive growth. We expect to release a steady stream of innovative new AVR microcontrollers over the next 12 months that will lead its resurgence even as we continue to release a steady stream of innovative new 8-bit PIC microcontrollers. 
We have also combined Atmel's SAM 32-bit microcontroller and 32-bit microprocessor business, along with Microchip's 32-bit microcontroller business, under a single leader. 32-bit microprocessors, by the way, are a new product category for Microchip and are typically higher performance and complex embedded-control solutions. Unlike microcontrollers, which are flash memory on chip, microprocessors have no flash memory on chip and instead use much larger external flash memories. Microchip had a PIC 32 microprocessor program, which was in its early stage of investment and we have decided to terminate that investment as we can capitalize on Atmel's SAM 32-bit microprocessor road map, which is more advanced and already in significant revenue stage. Looking forward, we expect to continue to develop new SAM 32 and PIC 32 products, exploiting specific areas of specialization that each company had carved out over the years while streamlining and harmonizing the technology and intellectual property building blocks that each will use. 
We have combined Atmel's wireless business and Microchip's wireless business under a single leader. The product lines have some overlap, and road maps are in the process of being rationalized to bring the investment in line with what is appropriate for the business. In that light, one decision we made was to close Atmel's Dresden Wireless Development Center in mid-April. There is more wireless investment rationalization that is left to do. 
We have combined Atmel's memory business and Microchip's memory business under a single leader. The product lines offer many substitutable products. And while we will continue to support both product lines for any customer who cannot switch, for the great majority of the customers, we will converge to a best-of-breed product which has the lowest overall cost and best overall customer value. 
We have also begun rationalizing the going-forward R&D investment to eliminate redundant projects either at Microchip or at Atmel. 
Atmel's Touch business is in the process of being restructured into mobile and non-mobile, which is essentially the Automotive and Industrial businesses. We have identified the leadership structures required for 2 independent businesses. As we announced on April 4, the Automotive and Industrial Touch business will stay with Microchip in the long run while the Mobile Touch business will be sold. We expect to have the 2 organizations in place sometime this quarter and to begin marketing the Mobile Touch business soon after.
Atmel's Security Solutions business consists of a number of crypto products. This is a newer field of play for Microchip, and Atmel's offerings will add to and strengthen our security offerings as well as accelerate some of the solutions that Microchip had planned to independently develop. Steve will comment in more detail in his section about how we expect to see the accretion results roll out. 
Finally, let me provide an update on Atmel's acquisition -- on the Atmel acquisition in regards to our product line reporting. Atmel's standard microcontroller revenue, including the automotive and industrial touch microcontrollers, will be reported as part of Microchip's microcontroller product line. Atmel's analog revenue, which is predominantly made up of products for the automotive market, will be reported as part of Microchip's analog product line. Atmel's memory revenue will be reported as part of Microchip's Memory product line. 
Atmel had a product line called Multi-Market, which included the aerospace business, the legacy CPLD business and their foundry services business. Microchip will adopt Multi-Market as a product line moving forward, and we will roll the revenue from our historical Other product line, which consisted of manufacturing services, into this Multi-Market product line. 
Further, Atmel also has some legacy ASIC microcontrollers comprising either discontinued products or products which had not had any investment for many years. We intend to include revenue from these products in the Multi-Market product line as well. 
As we mentioned during our April 4 conference call, Atmel's Mobile Touch business will be classified as an asset held for sale, and we will only report the net profit or loss for this business below the operating line of Microchip's income segment -- income statement. 
Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, our guidance going forward and some more about the Atmel integration. Steve?"

Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal first quarter of 2017. I will also make comments on the progress of integration for Micrel and the newly acquired Atmel. 
Our March quarter financial results were very strong amidst a weak semiconductor industry backdrop. We achieved the high end of our net sales guidance, establishing a new record in the process, and we exceeded the high end of the guidance for our non-GAAP gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share. 
Our non-GAAP earnings per share was sequentially up approximately 11% from the December quarter due to improving sales, gross margin and operating expense leverage. I hope that emphatically demonstrates the operating leverage left in our premium business model.
Before I go into guidance, let me give you a brief update on the integration of Micrel and Atmel. On Micrel, we are essentially in the final stages of completing the integration. The 2 items remaining are both in the manufacturing area. The integration of back-end operations into Microchip systems is on schedule for August. The other item is the closing of the fab and we have an update on that. 
We could have closed Micrel fab in August by building a large amount of inventory for the customers to switch to Microchip's 8-inch fab, but as we have analyzed options after the Atmel purchase, we believe that a couple of processes are better transferred from the Micrel's 6-inch fab to Atmel's 6-inch fab in Colorado Springs. This will require less inventory and result in lower risk to the customers and business units. Therefore, we are transferring the process to Atmel's fab, and we will structure the Micrel fab to a very small operation, largely running a couple of those processes until they are qualified in the Atmel fab. We believe this will delay the final close of the Micrel fab by 4 months to December of 2016. 
The financial model of Micrel is starting to look very good. Recall that when we purchased Micrel about 9 months ago, it was making a gross margin of 48.4% and the operating profit was 6.7% of revenue. In the December 2015 quarter, we achieved a 49.5% gross margin and 18% operating profit from Micrel. I'm happy to report that in the March 2016 quarter, we achieved 53.2% gross margin and 22.8% operating profit from Micrel. We now believe that after we close the fab, the final operating profit model for Micrel will exceed 30% and will be above our original model.
By the way, Supertex integration is complete. Final result: gross margin in the high 60s. And the operating expenses are really intertwined, so harder to decipher, but safe to say that the operating profit is in the 30s. 
Now regarding Atmel. Ganesh provided the progress report on the integration of product lines of Atmel. There is not a whole lot more beyond that with just 1 month gone. We are in the process of cross-franchising Microchip and Atmel distributors, and we are sorting through all the overlaps in the rep coverage and major accounts. 
I will now provide guidance for the June 2016 quarter. We started out June quarter with a stronger backlog than we had going into January, and the bookings and turns for the quarter, so far, have been strong. The Chinese New Year holidays in Asia are also behind us, although this is traditionally a slower quarter in Europe. Based on our analysis of economic and semiconductor industry conditions, as well as our own business indicators, we are guiding the March quarter net sales, without Atmel, to be up between 1% to 5% sequentially or between $574.1 million and $596.9 million.
We expect to non-GAAP gross margin, again without Atmel, to be between 58.2% and 58.6% of sales. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 26.3% and 26.6% of sales, and we expect the non-GAAP operating profit to be between 31.6% and 32.3% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP earnings per share, without Atmel, to be $0.70 to $0.74 per share. 
With this, let me now provide guidance for attrition from the acquisition of Atmel. There are 2 items that we need to be mindful of as we look at guidance for Atmel's net sales. First, while Atmel reported its net sales based on sell-in revenue recognition to distributors in Asia, Microchip will report Atmel's non-GAAP sales based on its sell-through revenue recognition worldwide. Secondly, Microchip will report the Mobile Touch portion of Atmel's business as an asset held for sale and will report this business unit's profit or loss below the net operating profit of Microchip and will exclude this net profit or loss for non-GAAP purposes. 
Now based on that, we expect Atmel to add approximately $225 million to $245 million in net sales for the continued businesses. We expect the continuing business of Atmel to be between 46% to 47% in gross margin, and we expect the Atmel subsidiary to be between $0.00 to $0.05 accretive to Microchip's non-GAAP earnings per share.
So now let's combine the guidance for core Microchip and Atmel. We expect June quarter net sales to be between $799.1 million and $841.9 million. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be between $0.70 to $0.79 per share. We continue to expect that Atmel will be about $0.25 accretive to Microchip's non-GAAP earnings per share in fiscal year 2017. 
In closing, I would like to say that March quarter marks the start of the growth period for us after ending the inventory correction in the December quarter. In case of Atmel, the inventory on the balance sheet and the distribution inventory is still high, and there is still some inventory correction to go through that is baked into our guidance. 
Combining growth from our core business, further accretion coming from Micrel and the accretion from Atmel, this triple effect will set up the earnings growth momentum that we expect will lead us to an 18% non-GAAP EPS growth from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017.

They were focused on 32-bit and Touch alone. There wasn't as much on 8-bit. We see that as a potential area of growth for us going forward. There is some nice growth, we believe, in security certainly in the microcontroller -- 32-bit microcontroller and wireless areas that they have invested in. It's a little early to give you any specific numbers. We're working on that. We also have to look at how to balance that with investments Microchip has also been making in similar areas. So that's with respect to growth. On the positioning, I think we have very clear ways in which products have areas of strength that they have developed. On 8-bit, the AVR has a strong following, a wide base of customers and applications, and so does the PIC microcontrollers. The biggest opportunity on that is going to be: How do we take our analog products and create more attach around both companies’ efforts? Obviously, we've been doing that on 8-bit for a long time, now doing it for the AVR 8-bit as well. On 32-bit, microprocessors is an area that Atmel had as a strength. We hadn't been doing it. We'll take that and run with it, and again, position the rest of our product lines to attach with their microprocessors. We expect on the microcontrollers that are ARM-based as well as MIPS-based microcontrollers, so we'll have PIC 32s and SAM 32 products. They each have different uniqueness around them, have gone after slightly different markets. In some cases, there could be commonality of customers. And so largely on the microcontrollers, we're not expecting that there's big shakeups in the road maps. And then outside of microcontrollers, really, the rest of the product lines are reasonably well positioned."

In fact, just today, we closed one of the design centers of their wireless, which was based in Dresden, Germany. But Microchip had a very strong momentum on wireless.

So if you add it to the midpoint of our guidance that we provided, it's about $250 million, so it's really neither way up or down much. We basically feel that Atmel was in the middle of a very major inventory correction. There was a very, very large amount of distribution inventory as well as the inside inventory. We have seen some of that behavior with the sell-in-driven companies in our prior acquisitions also, but this one was really over the top. As we announced back on April 4 that based on its sell-in driven revenue recognition, the revenue was only in the $220 million range. So there was really a massive inventory correction in distribution. If they were standalone, then the revenue would just have been very, very low. And I think the second part of your question was when do we see growth. We believe we see stabilization beginning now and it continuously improves.

I think if you take it from the high level, in consolidation of any industry, there are companies at the bottom that have been underperforming for years. They are being forced by either their boards or the activist investors to seek strategic alternatives, which is another word for basically selling the company. Such consolidation is now taking place in the semiconductor industry, and we have been kind of one of the consolidators. Microchip has purchased a number of companies that were all underperforming, and in each of these companies, we found some negative surprises after we bought the companies. But Microchip has systematically transformed the companies that we have bought into in highly-profitable enterprises, performing in the Microchip business model. I've given you examples of SMSC, Micrel, Supertex before. And we believe that we'll be able to do the same with Atmel. We have competed Atmel for years. What we knew of Atmel from outside was that they have very good products and technology. And a month after we have purchased them, we have confirmed that many of Atmel's products and technologies are good and they fit very well with Microchip's products, technologies and our road maps. But at the same time, we always wondered why Atmel, with such good products and technologies, always underperformed and could not make even 1/3 of the profit that Microchip made. We now have a deeper understanding of that. And the easiest way to describe that is, they were very poorly managed. I will put that in 5 main buckets. First, very poor accountability for results, I mean, kept giving bonuses and raises or whatever, irrespective of the performance of the company. So very poor accountability for results. Number second, poor teamwork as we have seen teamwork between sales and operations and planning and inventory, and just everybody does what they need to do, and very poor teamwork. Number three, very high spending culture, obviously, operating expenses in excess of 40% of revenue. Number four, always swinging for home runs and essentially getting stuck out, struck out versus Microchip building its businesses with singles and doubles. And finally, number five, very poor pricing discipline. So I think those are the 5 areas we have diagnosed. Again: poor accountability for results; poor teamwork; a very high spending culture; swinging for fences, for the home runs; and very, very poor pricing discipline. So we have now combined most of Atmel's business units under Microchip leaders so that we can begin to teach and implement our system of teamwork, accountability, operating expense, discipline, broad customer base and strong pricing discipline. As we have done with SMSC, Supertex, and Micrel, we'll be sharing that progress with the investors and analysts in the coming quarters. Atmel is not the first company that I have been stressed over after purchasing them, but I'm confident that, just like in other cases, investors will like the results we deliver as we transform Atmel's good products and technologies to yield kind of Microchip kind of financial performance. So that's kind of how I see it."

And we are basically making the operational changes, the cultural changes, the teamwork changes. We have set up meetings already, where operations and business units are in a common meeting for getting out what the demand is, what we should build. Those things were not connected basically. Business units threw a demand over the wall and manufacturing group went and built it. And sales never booked that order, never won that design. And there are lots and lots of millions of parts sitting, written off. And there was a very, very high amount of inventory write-off at Atmel when we look at the history of that. And it doesn't compare anything with Microchip, where we are really well run. Rare that you have any kind of large inventory write-off. So we are implementing all of Microchip's processes.

And when you then measure revenue by sell-in, the revenue had a steep fall off in the later quarters, which is what you're counting in a significant revenue drop of Atmel in 2015. And I'm now just figuring that their revenue was down 17%, 17.5%. From the number that we're guiding you today, we see this number to be the starting point of stabilization in Atmel's revenue. There is some more distribution inventory correction to go through, so the second half of this year should be stronger than the first half. Now beyond that would be better execution, combined road maps, good pricing discipline, a great distribution methodology, a cross-selling distributor on each of those products, analog attach and others. We need to produce a growth rate from Atmel which is, at least, as much as the industry. I don't think that will be that difficult from how atrophied it is, and we have seen that in other acquisitions. Beyond that, I can't till you have the numbers to it."

So we have found businesses in Atmel, particular line items to particular customers that were at negative gross margins, where you are wrapping money around every part that you're shipping. And some of that happening even on non-commodity products, even microcontrollers. I mean, why would you do that? So I think as we try to correct those things -- I put the brand in 3 different categories, 3 different positioning, and let me take that angle from a marketing standpoint. A company has a brand position, which is really, what do the customers think of the company. Then a company has a product position -- positioning, where, what does the customer think of company's products. And then the third, the company has a pricing position, where, what do the customers think of the value the company provides to the customers on its products. So positioning is important 3 different ways: brand positioning, product positioning and pricing positioning. When I look at Microchip, I find us very strong in all 3. We have a good brand reputation; we have good product positioning; and we have good pricing positioning, where we're able to draw very, very good pricing by customers seeing the value in our products. That's how we make near 60% gross margin. When I apply the same principle to Atmel, I find they have a good product positioning, and Ganesh and I mentioned that we find good products. The company probably had just an okay brand position as a company, but it has a very poor pricing positioning, where it hasn't positioned its products to be able to show the value to the customer.

We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our first quarter and fiscal 2017 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on the integration activities associated with the Atmel acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you'll find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effect of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the June quarter of $844 million, were well above the high end of our guidance and were up 48.5% sequentially, and form net sales of $568.4 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Non-GAAP net sales were $44.6 million higher than GAAP net sales as we are reporting non-GAAP net sales on a full sell-through revenue recognition basis, while GAAP does not recognize revenue on sell-through of product sitting in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs and additionally, from the Atmel distribution network is on selling revenue recognition for GAAP, primarily in Asia. We will convert the Atmel distributors to the Microchip contracts when business systems integrate later this year.
Our non-GAAP results are being presented on a full sell-through basis to provide investors with a better view of the true end market demand for our product. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference.
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 55.8% in the June quarter and above the high end of our guidance, which was 55.2%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 28.4% of sales, below the bottom end of our guidance range of 29.1%, and non-GAAP operating income was 27.4%, well above the high end of our guidance of 26.1%.
Non-GAAP net income was a record $194 million, resulting in record earnings per diluted share of $0.84. This was $0.05 higher than the high end of our guidance of $0.79.
On a GAAP basis, net sales were $799.4 million and gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 43.6% in the June quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $7.9 million of share-based compensation, $23.4 million of GAAP gross margin effect from the distributor revenue adjustment I mentioned earlier, $90.5 million acquired inventory valuation costs and $0.8 million of other items.
Total operating expenses were $407.6 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $80.2 million, share-based compensation of $51.7 million, $13.7 million of acquisition-related and other costs and special charges of $22 million.
With all the purchase accounting adjustments, the Atmel acquisition-related charges and the related tax impact, we had a GAAP net loss from continuing operations of $109.2 million or $0.51 per diluted share.
In the June quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 8.3% and the GAAP tax rate was negative 20.4%. We expect our long-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 8% and 9%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our inventory balance at June 30, 2016, was $518.4 million, including $80.9 million of fair value mark up on the Atmel inventory as required for GAAP purchase accounting. Excluding the purchase accounting adjustments, Microchip had 107 days of inventory at June 30, 2016, which puts our inventory in outstanding position. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, inventory at our distributors would have 32 days, which is flat to the March quarter level.
The cash generation in the June quarter, excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit was $184 million. As of June 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $601.8 million. Our borrowings under our revolving line of credit at June 30 was $1.922 billion. Excluding dividend payment, changes in borrowing levels and our acquisition-related activities, we expect our total cash generation to be approximately $175 million to $200 million in the September quarter.
Prior to the Atmel acquisition closing, we have provided a 3-year forecast for how we expect that Microchip's total net to EBITDA to trend over time. In those prior forecasts, we have projected that our total net leverage at the closing of the Atmel transaction would be 3.51 and improve to 3.04 by March 2017. We are pleased to report that we are ahead of schedule on this plan with our total net leverage ending the June quarter being 3.22.
Capital spending was approximately $18.5 million in the June quarter. We expect about $30 million in capital spending in the September quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 to be about $110 million. We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $30.6 million.
For several years prior to fiscal 2016, Microchip's dividends paid to its shareholders has been treated as return of capital as Microchip did not have earnings and profits in the United States. In fiscal 2016, about 60% were treated as taxable dividends and about 40% were treated as return of capital. In the fiscal 2017, we expect our dividends paid to shareholders to be treated as return of capital. Please note that the first quarter of calendar year 2016 will have approximately the same 60% taxable dividend and 40% return of capital split as of fiscal 2016 dividends I mentioned earlier. We will keep investors updated if anything changes on our expectation of the dividend treatment as we progress throughout the year.
I will now ask Ganesh to give us comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter. Ganesh?"

With the addition of Atmel results for the June quarter and the significant size of Atmel's business, the normal quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year comparisons we have typically provided aren't quite as meaningful. Therefore today, I shall give you more of a qualitative summary of our product line performance, along with select quantitative summaries and also provide you an update as to how we're progressing with the Atmel integration.
Now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines starting with microcontrollers. Our core microcontroller business, excluding Atmel, as well as Atmel's microcontroller business, were both up strongly in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter, as we continue to experience broad-based growth in our business. Strength in Atmel's microcontroller business was in part due to seasonal strength and in part, because customers with completed designs thus reassure about Microchip's plants going forward and therefore launch their new products with confidence. All microcontroller business units for Microchip as well as for Atmel outperformed our expectations in the June quarter.
Microcontrollers had over $2.15 billion in annualized revenue, represents a 63.7% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. We made significant progress integrating Atmel's microcontroller business over the last quarter. We combined Atmel's 8-bit AVR microcontroller business, along with Microchip's 8-bit PIC microcontroller business under an experienced microcontroller leader. Atmel's 8-bit AVR microcontroller business, which is still very popular among a broad-based of engineers, had been starved of investment, and hence, atrophied over the last 5 years. We have reprioritized resources to reinvigorate this product line, establish clear new product road maps, formed combined teams to execute the road maps and expect to release a steady stream of innovative new AVR microcontrollers that will lead through this resurgence. We have also received very positive feedback from AVR customers who have longed for more innovative new products, and were concerned about support for the existing products. All these while we continue to develop and introduce innovative new 8-bit PIC microcontrollers at a steady pace as before.
We also combined Atmel's SAM 32-bit microcontroller business, along with Microchip's PIC 32-bit microcontroller business under an experienced Microchip leader. We have established clear joint product road maps, formed combined teams to execute the road maps and expect to continue to release a steady stream of new, innovative PIC32 and SAM 32 microcontrollers to drive future growth. We carved out Atmel's 32-bit microprocessors as a separate business to give it additional focus. This business continues to be led by the Atmel executive who used to run the business before, who is working well with the Microchip leadership team to grow this very profitable business. This business is a good example of finding the right Microchip answer for the combined company, whereby Microchip terminated our investment in a microprocessor product family that started prior to the acquisition and instead, adopted Atmel's microprocessor road map as our future road map.
We combined Atmel's wireless business and Microchip's wireless business under an experienced Microchip leader. This business is running at a large loss and required significant surgery to combine road maps, reduce redundant spending and rationalize priorities. We have made substantial progress towards this end and expect to finish the restructuring for this business in the December quarter.
Atmel's Touch business was organizationally and operationally split into an automotive and industrial business, which has consistent growth and profitability characteristics, which we will retain; and a mobile business, which does not fit our business goals that we have been marketing for sale to interested buyers.
An area of opportunity we identified early in April, which we have worked diligently since, is pricing discipline. While Atmel has many strong products and technologies, tragically, in 2 many cases, these products were sold at prices that did not recognize the value of these products. We have implemented Microchip's discipline pricing process to ensure that not only are we competitive, but that we also get appropriately rewarded for providing innovative solutions that enable our clients to achieve success in their business goals.
We have been pleased with the performance and competitiveness of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the broad-based market, which have been augmented by the addition of Atmel's products. We continue to gain market share and have a new product momentum and customer engagement to gain even more share as we further build the best performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.
Moving now to our analog business. Our analog business, excluding Atmel, as well as including Atmel, were both up nicely in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter. Microchip's vast portfolio of analog products is one of our greatest growth opportunities as our sales teams and channel partners incrementally attach them to Atmel microcontrollers at customers and application that otherwise did not have visibility into.
Our analog business at approximately $860 million in annualized revenue, represented 25.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary, new, linear, mixed-signal, power interface and timing products to fuel the future growth of our analog business, and now have the line of sight for analog to be a greater than $1 billion revenue business for Microchip.
Moving to our memory products. Our combined Microchip and Atmel memory business, which is comprised of Serial E-squared memory products as well as SuperFlash Memory products, performed well in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter. We made significant progress integrating Atmel's memory business over the last quarter. We combined Atmel's memory business and Microchip's memory business under an experienced Microchip leader. The product lines offered many substitutable products and while we will continue to support both product lines for customers who don't wish to switch, for the great majority of customers, we will converge to a best-of-breed memory product, which has the lowest overall cost and the best overall customer value. We have also rationalized the going forward R&D investment to eliminate redundant projects either at Microchip or at Atmel, established clear new product road maps and formed combined teams to execute the road maps.
In the memory business too, we identified early in April that pricing discipline was a significant improvement opportunity. We have therefore implemented Microchip's discipline pricing process for this business to ensure that we are competitive and don't chase bad business in the pursuit of profitless prosperity.
Our sales integration is well underway with Microchip and Atmel teams reporting to common leadership in every region of the world. We have begun extensive cross-training of the teams, and we're actively working to ensure that we maximize the cross-selling of products for new customer design activity.
We have also started franchising Microchip channel partners to carry Atmel products and Atmel channel partners to carry Microchip products. We're in the midst of planning to integrate our business systems and are working towards making this happen at December quarter. We're also systematically reviewing our internal and outsourced manufacturing activities as well as our overall procurement activities to find the efficiencies that will reduce costs and also position us better for future growth.
All in all, I have to say that our first quarter of integrating Atmel has gone well despite challenges along the way. Our thanks go out to the many employees across the globe who have gone above and beyond to contribute to the rapid integration and help deliver synergy results ahead of forecast.
Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, our guidance going forward and some more about the Atmel integration. Steve?"

Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2017 and then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2017. I will also make comments on the progress of integration for Micrel and make extensive comments on Atmel.
Our June quarter financial results were extremely strong. Our non-GAAP net sales, gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share were all above the high end of our guidance. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.095 per share better than the midpoint of our guidance and up 19.6% sequentially from the March quarter, due to improving sales, gross margin, operating expense leverage and accretion from both Micrel and Atmel. We achieved excellent results both from our core business at Microchip as well as from Atmel. This was also our 103rd consecutive profitable quarter.
Last month, we made our first 100 day assessment of Atmel, its products and its operations and we shared them with the employees of Atmel. Today, I would summarize and share that first 100 day assessment with the investors and analysts. First, let me cover Atmel's strength. Atmel has good products and technology. This is what was visible to us from the outside when we competed with Atmel, and we have confirmed that in general, Atmel has very good products and microcontrollers, microprocessors, memory, wireless, high-voltage analog, car access, security and touch products. As we have come up with common road map and common technologies to design future products, Atmel's products and technologies have strong presence in those joint road maps. The vast majority of the people left at Atmel after our initial restructuring, we have found are strong in their areas of expertise, recognize that the business was run poorly and eager to adopt our culture and create a strong results-based future for the combined company.
Then, as we look into Atmel's weaknesses, we have summarized those weaknesses in 6 major areas. First is accountability. Atmel had a culture of poor accountability. The dismal financial results for the last few years say it all. That is why we had to make drastic leadership changes at Atmel early on.
Second area was poor teamwork. Atmel do not have a culture of teamwork. Instead, the company was highly siloed into various business units and other functional groups. The business units, sales and operations did not constantly communicate to adjust the factory build rates to changing demand. This routinely resulted in very high inventory buildup and significant inventory write ups. We have put the entire company on a Microchip type of common incentive program that values sales growth, gross margins, operating expense and operating profit. With our managers rolling the culture of accountability and teamwork, we believe that we will turn the situation around rapidly.
Third area was that Atmel had a culture of high operating expenses, which routinely ran over 40% of sales. The culture was one of spending what is needed versus what can be afforded. Atmel had a very top-heavy management structure with very poor accountability, leading to significant underperformance. Since the acquisition, we have removed 33 of the 41 Vice Presidents in the company. That lead is not needed and will not be replaced.
Second, Atmel had a very poor operating expense discipline in R&D. Many R&D projects were continuing despite low gross margins and poor return on investment. Combining the road maps of Microchip and Atmel, we terminated many projects with poor return on investment and restructured the expenses that are no longer needed. The worst performance of any business unit was in wireless where Atmel lost $32 million on sales of $40 million in 2015, all in the name of the buzzword, IoT or Internet of Things. Microchip's IoT portfolio is very strong and we merged Atmel's wireless road map with Microchip's. We have been doing substantial restructuring to get the expenses in line with what the business can afford and which is consistent with the merged road map.
And third, on the operating expense side were sales and distribution. Atmel had a selling-driven sales model and a commission-driven sales force that made commissions irrespective of complete profitability. A few former sales employees have told us that the customers liked Atmel. Well, if you allow me to sell a large amounts of $1 bills for $0.90, I can get a lot of love from the customers, too. Microchip's customer relations are built on charging a fair price for our proprietary, value-added products. There's nothing wrong with some healthy and constructive tension with customers on the pricing front. Our customer relations are generally healthy and our success can be seen in our numbers and our market share. We have received some criticism from ex-employees that we're happy shipping at low prices and low margins. We believe that such criticism was expected from the employees who invest in the status quo.
The fourth area is swinging for home run. Atmel had a culture of swinging for defenses in terms of going after large accounts and often signed onerous contracts with them. Atmel often struck out and lost many of the designs for 1 band at better low gross margin. Microchip will expand Atmel's customer base and target a very broad base of 100,000 plus customers like Microchip.
The fifth area is the lack of pricing discipline that Ganesh also commented on. Atmel had a very poor pricing discipline. We immediately expired a lot of low-margin and negative margin quotes to bring some sanity to the pricing. We have also implemented a new price book beginning July 1, and we now begin the hard work of implementing the new prices customer-by-customer. We will see the positive effects on gross margins in the coming quarters. This is something we have done successfully in our previous acquisitions. In case of Atmel, most of the products are proprietary, and therefore, we will not be concerned about losing a lot of business.
We have also heard a concern that customers would have bought a lot of product early ahead of the price increases. At the direct OEM customers with the pattern of customer orders and shipments into July has continued after the new prices went into effect. So the concern is unfounded.
In case of distribution, we only recognize non-GAAP revenue on sell-through basis, and we wrote up the distribution inventory to the new prices on July 1. So any previously purchased inventory is still in the distribution shelf would have been marked up on July 1. The point of sales trends in July are not showing any noticeable negative effects from the pricing changes.
And number 6, Atmel made no investment in training and development of employees, at the higher level of the company, it was largely a revolving door with an average tenure of executives at less than 3 years. In contrast, the average tenure of executives at Microchip is over 20 years. We make substantial investment in training and development of employees and then promote largely from within, thus, retaining substantial talents -- talent base and experience. We have begun implementing Microchip's training and development curriculum at Atmel.
Now after giving you this 100 day assessment of Atmel, now let me continue with the deciphering the financial results of Microchip from the fiscal first quarter of 2017. While we recognize that some analysts have interest in breaking down organic and nonorganic net sales, we have made the decision to not provide the breakdown between organic and nonorganic sales. We have seen such data largely misinterpreted. In some of my interactions with the investors, I have seen them taking our GAAP sales from the SEC filings, subtracting the non-GAAP sales from acquisitions that we broke out previously, and then conclude that organic sales were down or flat. GAAP net sales in the SEC filings ignored the sales out from distribution that are from the products shipped into distribution prior to the close of the acquisition. This confuses investors since GAAP net sales look lower. And if you then make the assumption that the sales from an acquisition was a given number that we provide, then the natural and wrong conclusion that you reach is that organic sales were down. This confusion is partially the result of wacky accounting rules on acquisitions related to distribution sales. In case of Atmel, this would be even more confusing because GAAP net sales in the SEC filings will be based on sell-in revenue recognition in Asia, while the non-GAAP net sales that we are focusing on is based on sell-through revenue recognition in Asia.
Now when we acquire the company, our focus is to grow their sales and earnings of the new joint company. And we focused over resources on the best opportunities from the combined company. For example, in case of Atmel, as Ganesh also pointed out, we have fully combined each of the 8-bit microcontrollers, 32-bit microcontrollers, wireless and memory businesses of both companies. Each of these business units are now headed by a Microchip executive whose managing it as 1 business, taking the lowest cost product, manufacturing it to the lowest cost supply chain and then shipping at the highest ASP opportunity irrespective of whether the dye, assembly or tests comes from core Microchip side or Atmel side.
Trying to artificially balance both businesses of Microchip and Atmel is less than optimum solution and makes no business sense once we are 1 company and we will not do it. Therefore, we will refrain from providing a line-by-line breakdown of our results between core Microchip and Atmel. We will, however, provide some useful negative information on Atmel as well as Microchip so here are some of those negatives.
We achieved all-time record net sales in our core Microchip business. Gross margin from core Microchip business was very strong at 59.75%, up 130 basis points sequentially, and operating profit from our core Microchip business was 33.4% of sales. Gross margin on Atmel improved significantly from the March 2016 quarter prior to the acquisition. March 2016 quarter, while never formally announced, was a very weak quarter in sales as well as gross margin percentage.
Now let us decipher the operating expense where we made very significant progress. Microchip's operating expense in the March quarter was $153.5 million and Atmel's operating expense in the March quarter was $100 million. So adding them together, our starting point is $253.5 million. The total operating expense in the June quarter was $246.4 million, a reduction of $7.1 million for the quarter or $28.4 million annualized. Out of this $246.4 million OpEx, $6.4 million was attributed to Mobile Touch business, which is an asset held for sale therefore the operating expense on a continuing basis was $240 million per quarter or 28.4% of continuing sale.
With the combined effect of better-than-expected net sales, higher gross margin percentage and lower OpEx, we achieved an accretion from Atmel of $0.08 per share versus our guidance of $0.00 to $0.05 per share. We worked very hard to make up for how much Atmel's business had atrophied prior to the close of the acquisition.
On the core Microchip side, without Atmel, we achieved a record net -- we achieved a record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.76 per share versus the $0.72 per share midpoint that was embedded in our guidance.
So again, summarizing, we achieved $0.08 accretion from Atmel and the non-GAAP earnings per share on the Microchip side was $0.76 versus $0.72 per share, which was embedded in our guidance. By any measure, our June quarter results were stellar. We performed excellently on our organic business as well as from Atmel and we diversed the sales decline for Atmel marking the March 2016 quarter as bottom. One quarter does not make a trend, so we're working hard to make sure that it does become a trend.
So now let us go into the non-GAAP guidance for September quarter. We expect total net sales, including Atmel, to be up between 0% and 4% sequentially. We expect gross margin to be between 55.6% and 56.2%. We expect overall operating expenses from continuing operations to be between 27.2% and 27.9% of sales, making -- marking another significant reduction in Atmel's operating expenses. We expect operating profit percentage to be between 27.7% and 29% of sales. And we expect earnings per share to be between $0.83 and $0.91 per share. The earnings per share guidance includes an accretion from Atmel of between $0.09 and $0.11 per share.
Now if you combine the accretion from Atmel for first quarter, which was $0.08 and the midpoint for the second quarter, which is $0.10, then $0.18 of accretion from the first 2 quarters against our guidance of $0.25 accretion from Atmel for the entire fiscal year 2017, the fiscal year 2017 guidance seems like a gimmick. So we are increasing the accretion target from Atmel on $0.25 previously to $0.40 now for our fiscal year 2017.
We are not changing Atmel accretion guidance for the outer years yet. We have not yet completely analyzed how much of the upside is pulling of the accretion and how much is upside on the likely some of each.
Moving to Micrel. We had essentially in the final stages of completing the integration. The last wafer starts in the Micrel 6-inch fab are being made this week with the last wafer starts this week, which should be closing the Micrel fab in late October. This is about 2 months ahead of what we guided last quarter. After closing the Micrel fab, we save approximately $26 million in annual wafer costs, which will find its way into the profit and loss statement over the coming quarters as we ship more and more 8-inch wafers and deplete the 6-inch inventory. After we close the fab, the final operating profit model for Micrel will meet or exceed our long-term target of 33%.
I also have an update on the sale process for the Mobile Touch business unit. As of the deadline to receive offers for that business last week, we have several offers for the Mobile Touch business unit. We have a bolder view of the process later this week, and depending on the party we select and depending on the remaining diligence needed, we expect to be able to complete the sales of the Mobile Touch business well before the end of the calendar year.

A lot of the sales decline was happening to bring all the time we Atmel was on sales starting almost May of last year when the CEO first told the world that he was going to step down, which began the sales process. And there were some sales decline related to the Touch business even after in the previous years. We think the meetings we have had with the major customers, the messages we have given to The Street, the messages we have given to the sales force, the meetings we have had with the distribution, rapidly, we have given the market confidence that the number one, we're not obsoleting large number of products like many times acquisitions complete tend to do. Microchip has a culture of not products and providing long-term service to their clients. The only business we put on sale was this is Mobile Touch business, which was relatively small business. And the other concerns, which actually investors have more than the customers was what was going to happen to the 8-bit AVR business, what is going to happen to Atmel microcontroller together with Microchip's microcontroller, which were competitive. All that has worked out extremely well. We are given customers the confidence that we're going to continue promoting those products, introduce new products. In fact, take many of the great features that we have added on our 8-bit microcontrollers, while Atmel's 8-bit microcontroller has retrofit, we're introducing new products with many great features and given the messages that the brand of Atmel AVR is here to stay."

That's a very, very good fab. We're going to keep it. We have also using Atmel's 6-inch fab to transfer some of the most sticky Micrel 6-inch products where we had, had trouble bringing them on to 8-inch. It seems like the 6-inch to 6-inch transfer has been smoother than the 6-inch to 8-inch transfer on just a handful of products. I was talking about 2 process technologies and a few products. 85%, 90% of products for Micrel really have been transferred to Microchip 8-inch fabs.

Where I cautioned investors and analysts is if I remember reading the commentary on what said, they kind of look at -- they look at it as so Microchip's about a 15% of revenue would go away or something like that. We're going to let go of bottom 15% of our revenue, which will be a huge number. This is not bottom 15% of our revenue. There's no revenue, but we've is not going to go down. This is in terms of activity. So projects. So were doing some projects as a some higher priority projects, there's some from lower priority projects. WE will take the lowest pretty precious of ours and substitute by the acquired companies better projects, which meld in. So overall, the portfolio becomes stronger and generating even higher revenue, more competitive pricing, better margins and all that, and not equate that to all, we should take combine company and take 15% of the revenue ends it's going to go away.

Really, only those 3 things and there is attached rate, let's say, attaching analog and all of that. If you take those 4 major complements for the long-term accretion will come from, the upside in the quarters from the revenue side was real. This net April income that there will revenue upside, which will continue quarter after quarter. The OpEx piece is, is a certain amount of OpEx you need to take out and remove the bad R&D and remove the bad stuff. And any accretion we would get on OpEx if you get the job done in one year ready then 2 or 3 years and that and will not have further upside. Because this a certain amount of OpEx we're going to do, and we're doing it much faster than we talked. And honestly, one of the reasons for that, in my mind, is our earlier expectation was that we will find a disaster in Europe. And Europe is harder to restructure, as you all know, with European laws and Works Council and all of that. And that's what we found. We found very good running businesses in Europe, and we find it disaster in U.S. on the business unit side and that's what we were able to do a lot of the restructuring in a very rapid fashion. And that's largely working ahead of the OpEx goal there. On the gross margin, we haven't gotten an upside in the gross margin side yet, as we talked earlier it takes a while for price increases and cost reductions to take place. So that so far is on pace with the provided earlier. But if you get ahead, we'll let you know. And the last one is attached. There, attache is not in the revenue stream today, it's only in the final stage. So maybe that helps you a little bit."

During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events for the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal 2017 financial performance. And Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on the integration activities associated with the Atmel acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the June quarter of $844 million were well above the high end of our guidance and were up 48.5% sequentially and -- form net sales of $568.4 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Non-GAAP net sales were $44.6 million higher than GAAP net sales, as we are reporting non-GAAP net sales on a full sell-through revenue recognition basis, while GAAP does not recognize revenue on sell-through of product sitting in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs, and additionally, some of the Atmel distribution network is on selling revenue recognition for GAAP, primarily in Asia. We will convert the Atmel sell-in distributors to the Microchip contracts when business systems integrate later this year.
Our non-GAAP results are being presented on a full sell-through basis to provide investors with a better view of the true end-market demand for our product. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference.
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 55.8% in the June quarter and above the high end of our guidance, which was 55.2%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 28.4% of sales, below the bottom end of our guidance range of 29.1%. And non-GAAP operating income was 27.4%, well above the high end of our guidance of 26.1%.
Non-GAAP net income was a record $194 million, resulting in record earnings per diluted share of $0.84. This was $0.05 higher than the high end of our guidance of $0.79.
On a GAAP basis, net sales were $799.4 million. And gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 43.6% in the June quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $7.9 million of share-based compensation, $23.4 million of GAAP gross margin effect from the distributor revenue adjustments I mentioned earlier, $90.5 million acquired inventory valuation costs and $0.8 million of other items.
Total operating expenses were $407.6 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $80.2 million, share-based compensation of $51.7 million, $13.7 million of acquisition-related and other costs and special charges of $22 million.
With all the purchase accounting adjustments, the Atmel acquisition-related charges and the related tax impact, we had a GAAP net loss from continuing operations of $109.2 million or $0.51 per diluted share.
In the June quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 8.3% and the GAAP tax rate was negative 20.4%. We expect our long-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 8% and 9%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our inventory balance at June 30, 2016, was $518.4 million, including $80.9 million of fair value markup on the Atmel inventory as required for GAAP purchase accounting. Excluding the purchase accounting adjustments, Microchip had 107 days of inventory at June 30, 2016, which puts our inventory in an outstanding position. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, inventory at our distributors was at 32 days, which is flat to the March quarter levels.
The cash generation in the June quarter, excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit was $184 million. As of June 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $601.8 million. Our borrowings under our revolving line of credit at June 30 was $1.922 billion. Excluding dividend payment, changes in borrowing levels and our acquisition-related activities, we expect our total cash generation to be approximately $175 million to $200 million in the September quarter.
Prior to the Atmel acquisition closing, we have provided a 3-year forecast for how we expects Microchip's total net to EBITDA to trend over time. In those prior forecasts, we have projected that our total net leverage at the closing of the Atmel transaction would be 3.51 and improve to 3.04 by March 2017. We are pleased to report that we are ahead of schedule on this plan with our total net leverage ending the June quarter being 3.22.
Capital spending was approximately $18.5 million in the June quarter. We expect about $30 million in capital spending in the September quarter, and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 to be about $110 million. We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $30.6 million.
For several years prior to fiscal 2016, Microchip's dividends paid to its shareholders have been treated as return of capital, as Microchip did not have earnings and profits in the United States. In fiscal 2016, about 60% were treated as taxable dividends and about 40% were treated as return of capital. In fiscal 2017, we expect our dividends paid to shareholders to be treated as return of capital. Please note that the first quarter of calendar year 2016 will have approximately the same 60% taxable dividend and 40% return of capital split as of fiscal 2016 dividends I mentioned earlier. We will keep investors updated, if anything changes on our expectations of the dividend treatment as we progress throughout the year.
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter. Ganesh?"

With the addition of Atmel results for the June quarter and the significant size of Atmel's business, the normal quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year comparisons we have typically provided are not quite as meaningful. Therefore today, I shall give you more of a qualitative summary of our product line performance along with select quantitative summaries and also provide you an update as to how we're progressing with the Atmel integration.
Now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines starting with microcontrollers. Our core microcontroller business, excluding Atmel, as well as Atmel's microcontroller business were both up strongly in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter, as we continued to experience broad-based growth in our business. Strength in Atmel's microcontroller business was in part due to seasonal strength and in part because customers with completed designs felt reassured about Microchip's plans going forward and, therefore, launched their new product with confidence. All microcontroller business units for Microchip as well as for Atmel outperformed our expectations in the June quarter.
Microcontrollers at over $2.15 billion in annualized revenue represented 63.7% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. We made significant progress integrating Atmel's microcontroller business over the last quarter. We combined Atmel's 8-bit AVR microcontroller business, along with Microchip's 8-bit PIC microcontroller business under an experienced microcontroller leader. Atmel's 8-bit AVR microcontroller business, which is still very popular among a broad base of engineers, had been starved of investment and, hence, atrophied over the last 5 years. We have reprioritized resources to reinvigorate this product line, establish clear new product road maps, formed combined teams to execute the road maps and expect to release a steady stream of innovative new AVR microcontrollers that will lead this through resurgence. We have also received very positive feedback from AVR customers who have longed for more innovative new products and were concerned about support for the existing products. All this while we continued to develop and introduce innovative new 8-bit PIC microcontrollers at a steady pace as before.
We also combined Atmel's SAM 32-bit microcontroller business, along with Microchip's PIC 32-bit microcontroller business under an experienced Microchip leader. We have established clear joint product road maps, formed combined teams to execute the road maps and expect to continue to release a steady stream of new, innovative PIC32 and SAM32 microcontrollers to drive future growth. We carved out Atmel's 32-bit microprocessors as a separate business to give it additional focus. This business continues to be led by the Atmel executive who used to run the business before, who is working well with the Microchip leadership team to grow this very profitable business. This business is a good example of finding the right Microchip answer for the combined company, whereby Microchip terminated our investment in a microprocessor product family that started prior to the acquisition and instead adopted Atmel's microprocessor road map as our future road map.
We combined Atmel's wireless business and Microchip's wireless business under an experienced Microchip leader. This business was running at a large loss and required significant surgery to combine road maps, reduce redundant spending and rationalize priorities. We have made substantial progress towards this end and expect to finish the restructuring for this business in the December quarter.
Atmel's Touch business was organizationally and operationally split into an automotive and industrial business, which has consistent growth and profitability characteristics, which we will retain; and a mobile business, which does not fit our business goals, that we have been marketing for sale to interested buyers.
An area of opportunity we identified early in April, which we have worked diligently since, is pricing discipline. While Atmel has many strong products and technologies, tragically, in 2 many cases, these products were sold at prices that did not recognize the value of these products. We have implemented Microchip's disciplined pricing process to ensure that not only are we competitive, but that we also get appropriately rewarded for providing innovative solutions that enable our clients to achieve success in their business goals.
We have been pleased with the performance and competitiveness of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the broad-based market, which have been augmented by the addition of Atmel's products. We continue to gain market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to gain even more share as we further build the best performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.
Moving now to our analog business. Our analog business, excluding Atmel as well as including Atmel, were both up nicely in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter. Microchip's vast portfolio of analog products is one of our greatest growth opportunities as our sales teams and channel partners incrementally attached them to Atmel microcontrollers at customers and applications that otherwise did not have visibility into.
Our analog business at approximately $860 million in annualized revenue represented 25.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new, linear, mixed signal, power interface and timing products to fuel the future growth of our analog business, and now have the line of sight for analog to be a greater than $1 billion revenue business for Microchip.
Moving to our memory products. Our combined Microchip and Atmel memory business, which is comprised of Serial E-squared memory products as well as SuperFlash Memory products, performed well in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter. We made significant progress integrating Atmel's memory business over the last quarter. We combined Atmel's memory business and Microchip's memory business under an experienced Microchip leader. The product lines offer many substitutable products. And while we will continue to support both product lines for customers who don't wish to switch, for the great majority of customers, we will converge to a best-of-breed memory product, which has the lowest overall cost and the best overall customer value. We have also rationalized the going-forward R&D investment to eliminate redundant projects either at Microchip or at Atmel, established clear new product road maps and formed combined teams to execute the road maps.
In the memory business too, we identified early in April that pricing discipline was a significant improvement opportunity. We have, therefore, implemented Microchip's disciplined pricing process for this business, too, to ensure that we are competitive and don't chase bad business in the pursuit of profitless prosperity.
Our sales integration is well underway with Microchip and Atmel teams reporting to common leadership in every region of the world. We have begun extensive cross-training of the teams, and we're actively working to ensure that we maximize the cross-selling of products for new customer design activity.
We have also started franchising Microchip channel partners to carry Atmel products and Atmel channel partners to carry Microchip products. We're in the midst of planning to integrate our business systems and are working towards making this happen in the December quarter. We're also systematically reviewing our internal and outsourced manufacturing activities as well as our overall procurement activities to find the efficiencies that will reduce costs and also position us better for future growth.
All in all, I have to say that our first quarter of integrating Atmel has gone well despite challenges along the way. Our thanks go out to the many employees across the globe who have gone above and beyond to contribute to the rapid integration and help deliver synergy results that are ahead of forecast.
Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, our guidance going forward and some more about the Atmel integration. Steve?"

Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2017 and then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2017. I will also make comments on the progress of integration for Micrel and make extensive comments on Atmel.
Our June quarter financial results were extremely strong. Our non-GAAP net sales, gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share were all above the high end of our guidance. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.095 per share better than the midpoint of our guidance and up 19.6% sequentially from the March quarter, due to improving sales, gross margin, operating expense leverage and accretion from both Micrel and Atmel. We achieved excellent results, both from our core business at Microchip as well as from Atmel. This was also our 103rd consecutive profitable quarter.
Last month, we made our first 100-day assessment of Atmel, its products and its operations, and we shared them with the employees of Atmel. Today, I would summarize and share that first 100-day assessment with the investors and analysts. First, let me cover Atmel's strength. Atmel has good products and technologies. This is what was visible to us from the outside when we competed with Atmel, and we have confirmed that, in general, Atmel has very good products in microcontrollers, microprocessors, memory, wireless, high-voltage analog, car access, security and touch products.
As we have come up with common road map and common technologies to design future products, Atmel's products and technologies have strong presence in those joint road maps. The vast majority of the people left at Atmel after our initial restructuring, we have found are strong in their areas of expertise, recognize that the business was run poorly and are eager to adopt our culture and create a strong results-based future for the combined company.
Then, as we look into Atmel's weaknesses, we have summarized those weaknesses in 6 major areas. First is accountability. Atmel had a culture of poor accountability. The dismal financial results for the last few years say it all. That is why we had to make drastic leadership changes at Atmel early on.
Second area was poor teamwork. Atmel do not have a culture of teamwork, instead the company was highly siloed into various business units and other functional groups. The business units, sales and operations did not constantly communicate to adjust the factory build rates to changing demand. This routinely resulted in very high inventory buildup and significant inventory write-ups. We have put the entire company on a Microchip type of common incentive program that values sales growth, gross margins, operating expense and operating profit. With our managers role modeling the culture of accountability and teamwork, we believe that we will turn the situation around rapidly.
Third area was that Atmel had a culture of high operating expenses, which routinely ran over 40% of sales. The culture was one of spending what is needed versus what can be afforded. Atmel had a very top-heavy management structure with very poor accountability, leading to significant underperformance. Since the acquisition, we have removed 33 of the 41 vice presidents in the company. That layer is not needed and will not be replaced.
Second, Atmel had a very poor operating expense discipline in R&D. Many R&D projects were continuing despite low gross margins and poor return on investment. Combining the road maps of Microchip and Atmel, we terminated many projects with poor return on investment and restructured the expenses that were no longer needed. The worst performance of any business unit was in wireless where Atmel lost $32 million on sales of $40 million in 2015, all in the name of the buzzword, IoT or Internet of Things. Microchip's IoT portfolio is very strong, and we merged Atmel's wireless road map with Microchip's. We have been doing substantial restructuring to get the expenses in line with what the business can afford and which is consistent with the merged road map.
And third, on the operating expense side was sales and distribution. Atmel had a sell-in driven sales model and a commission-driven sales force that made commissions irrespective of company profitability. A few former sales employees have told us that the customers liked Atmel. Well, if you allow me to sell a large amounts of $1 bills for $0.90, I can get a lot of love from the customers, too. Microchip's customer relations are built on charging a fair price for our proprietary, value-added products. There's nothing wrong with some healthy and constructive tension with customers on the pricing front. Our customer relations are generally healthy, and our success can be seen in our numbers and our market share. We have received some criticism from ex-employees that we're happy shipping at low prices and low margins. We believe that such criticism was expected from the employees who are vested in the status quo.
The fourth area is swinging for home run. Atmel had a culture of swinging for the fences in terms of going after large accounts and often signed onerous contracts with them. Atmel often struck out and lost many of the designs or won them at very low gross margin. Microchip will expand Atmel's customer base and target a very broad base of 100,000 plus customers like at Microchip.
The fifth area is the lack of pricing discipline that Ganesh also commented on. Atmel had a very poor pricing discipline. We immediately expired a lot of low-margin and negative-margin quotes to bring some sanity to the pricing. We have also implemented a new price book beginning July 1, and we now begin the hard work of implementing the new prices customer-by-customer. We will see the positive effects on gross margins in the coming quarters. This is something we have done successfully in our previous acquisitions. In case of Atmel, most of the products are proprietary, and therefore, we will not be concerned about losing a lot of business.
We have also heard a concern that customers would have bought a lot of product early ahead of the price increases. At the direct OEM customers, the pattern of customer orders and shipments into July has continued after the new prices went into effect. So the concern is unfounded.
In case of distribution, we only recognize non-GAAP revenue on sell-through basis, and we wrote up the distribution inventory to the new prices on July 1. So any previously purchased inventory is still in the distribution shelf would have been marked up on July 1. The point of sales trends in July  are not showing any noticeable negative effects from the pricing changes.
And number six, Atmel made no investment in training and development of employees. At the higher level of the company, it was largely a revolving door with an average tenure of executives at less than 3 years. In contrast, the average tenure of executives at Microchip is over 20 years. We make substantial investment in training and development of employees and then promote largely from within, thus retaining substantial talents -- talent base and experience. We have begun implementing Microchip's training and development curriculum at Atmel.
Now after giving you this 100-day assessment of Atmel, now let me continue with deciphering the financial results of Microchip from the fiscal first quarter of 2017. While we recognize that some analysts have interest in breaking down organic and nonorganic net sales, we have made a decision to not provide the breakdown between organic and nonorganic sales. We have seen such data largely misinterpreted. In some of my interactions with the investors, I have seen them taking our GAAP sales from the SEC filings, subtracting the non-GAAP sales from acquisitions that we broke out previously, and then conclude that organic sales were down or flat.
GAAP net sales in the SEC filings ignored the sales out from distribution that are from the products shipped into distribution prior to the close of the acquisition. This confuses investors since GAAP net sales look lower. And if you then make the assumption that the sales from an acquisition was a given number that we provide, then the natural and wrong conclusion that you reach is that organic sales were down. This confusion is partially the results of wacky accounting rules on acquisitions related to distribution sales. In case of Atmel, this will be even more confusing because GAAP net sales in the SEC filings will be based on sell-in revenue recognition in Asia, while the non-GAAP net sales that we are focusing on is based on sell-through revenue recognition in Asia.
Now when we acquire the company, our focus is to grow their sales and earnings of the new joint company. And we focus over resources on the best opportunities from the combined company. For example, in case of Atmel, as Ganesh also pointed out, we have fully combined each of the 8-bit microcontrollers, 32-bit microcontrollers, wireless and memory businesses of both companies. Each of these business units are now headed by a Microchip executive who's managing it as one business, taking the lowest-cost product, manufacturing it to the lowest-cost supply chain and then shipping it at the highest ASP opportunity irrespective of whether the die, assembly or tests comes from core Microchip side or Atmel side.
Trying to artificially balance both businesses of Microchip and Atmel is less than optimum solution and makes no business sense once we are one company and we will not do it. Therefore, we will refrain from providing a line-by-line breakdown of our results between core Microchip and Atmel. We will, however, provide some useful nuggets of information on Atmel as well as Microchip. So here are some of those nuggets.
We achieved all-time record net sales in our core Microchip business. Gross margin from core Microchip business was very strong at 59.75%, up 130 basis points sequentially, and operating profit from our core Microchip business was 33.4% of sales. Gross margin on Atmel improved significantly from the March 2016 quarter prior to the acquisition. March 2016 quarter, while never formally announced, was a very weak quarter in sales as well as gross margin percentage.
Now let us decipher the operating expense where we made very significant progress. Microchip's operating expense in the March quarter was $153.5 million, and Atmel's operating expense in the March quarter was $100 million. So adding them together, our starting point is $253.5 million.
The total operating expense in the June quarter was $246.4 million, a reduction of $7.1 million for the quarter or $28.4 million annualized. Out of this $246.4 million OpEx, $6.4 million was attributed to Mobile Touch business, which is an asset held for sale. Therefore, the operating expense on a continuing basis was $240 million per quarter or 28.4% of continuing sale.
With the combined effect of better-than-expected net sales, higher gross margin percentage and lower OpEx, we achieved an accretion from Atmel of $0.08 per share versus our guidance of $0.00 to $0.05 per share. We worked very hard to make up for how much Atmel's business had atrophied prior to the close of the acquisition.
On the core Microchip side, without Atmel, we achieved a record net -- we achieved a record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.76 per share versus the $0.72 per share midpoint that was embedded in our guidance.
So again, summarizing, we achieved $0.08 accretion from Atmel. And the non-GAAP earnings per share on the Microchip side was $0.76 versus $0.72 per share, which was embedded in our guidance. By any measure, our June quarter results were stellar. We performed excellently on our organic business as well as from Atmel, and we reversed the sales decline for Atmel marking the March 2016 quarter as bottom. One quarter does not make a trend. So we are working hard to make sure that it does become a trend.
So now let us go into the non-GAAP guidance for September quarter. We expect total net sales, including Atmel, to be up between 0% and 4% sequentially. We expect gross margin to be between 55.6% and 56.2%. We expect overall operating expenses from continuing operations to be between 27.2% and 27.9% of sales, making -- marking another significant reduction in Atmel's operating expenses. We expect operating profit percentage to be between 27.7% and 29% of sales. And we expect earnings per share to be between $0.83 and $0.91 per share. The earnings per share guidance includes an accretion from Atmel of between $0.09 and $0.11 per share.
Now if you combine the accretion from Atmel for first quarter, which was $0.08, and the midpoint for the second quarter, which is $0.10, then $0.18 of accretion from the first 2 quarters against our guidance of $0.25 accretion from Atmel for the entire fiscal year 2017, the fiscal year 2017 guidance seems like a gimmick. So we are increasing the accretion target from Atmel on $0.25 previously to $0.40 now for our fiscal year 2017.
We are not changing Atmel accretion guidance for the outer years yet. We have not yet completely analyzed how much of the upside is pulling of the accretion and how much is upside, and there's likely some of each.
Moving to Micrel. We are essentially in the final stages of completing the integration. The last wafer starts in the Micrel 6-inch fab are being made this week. With the last wafer starts this week, we should be closing the Micrel fab in late October. This is about 2 months ahead of what we guided last quarter.
After closing the Micrel fab, we save approximately $26 million in annual wafer costs, which will find its way into the profit and loss statement over the coming quarters as we ship more and more 8-inch wafers and deplete the 6-inch inventory. After we close the fab, the final operating profit model for Micrel will meet or exceed our long-term target of 33%.
I also have an update on the sale process for the Mobile Touch business unit. As of the deadline to receive offers for that business last week, we have several offers for the Mobile Touch business unit. We have a border view of the process later this week. And depending on the party we select and depending on the remaining diligence needed, we expect to be able to complete the sale of the Mobile Touch business well before the end of the calendar year.
With this operator, will you please poll for questions?"

Microchip has a culture of not obsoleting products and providing long-term service to their clients. The only business we put on sale was just this Mobile Touch business, which was relatively small business. And the other concerns, which actually investors have more than the customers, was what was going to happen to the 8-bit AVR business? What was going to happen to Atmel's microcontroller, together with Microchip's microcontroller, which were competitive? All that has worked out extremely well. We have given customers the confidence that we're going to continue promoting those products, introduce new products. In fact, take many of the great features that we have added on our 8-bit microcontrollers, while Atmel's 8-bit microcontroller has atrophied. We're introducing new products with many great features and giving the messages that the brand of Atmel AVR is here to stay."

This is a fairly very competitive fab, so after a very thorough analysis and we've got good manufacturing ahead on us, I think you have seen it over the years, we have decided and told the Colorado fab people and the community that we will keep Colorado fabs with some of the rumors where something else could happen. That's a very, very good fab. We're going to keep it. We have also using Atmel's 6-inch fab to transfer some of the most sticky Micrel 6-inch products where we had, had trouble bringing them on to 8 inch. It seems like the 6-inch to 6-inch transfer has been smoother than the 6-inch to 8-inch transfer on just a handful of products. We're talking about 2 process technologies and a few products. 85%, 90% of the products for Micrel really have been transferred to Microchip 8-inch fabs.

And on the analog, high voltage, RF front, it's in the same time frame, end of the year or early next year. So that process is really going very, very well. Where I cautioned investors and analysts is, if I remember reading the commentary on what said, they kind of look at -- they look at it as like so Microchip's bottom 15% of their revenue would go away or something like that. We're going to let it go, bottom 15% of our revenue, which will be a huge number. This is not the bottom 15% of our revenue. There's no change in our revenue, but revenue is not going to go down. This is in terms of activity, so projects. So we are doing some projects as some higher-priority projects. There are some lower-priority projects. We will take the lowest priority project of ours and substitute by the acquired company's better projects which meld in. So overall, the portfolio becomes stronger and generates even higher revenue, more competitive pricing, better margins and all that.

And then there is attach rate, let's say, attaching analog and all that. If you'll take those 4 major components where the long-term accretion would have come from, the upside in the quarters from a revenue side was real. That's not a pull-in. That's a real revenue upside which will continue quarter after quarter. The OpEx piece is there's a certain amount of OpEx you need to take out and remove the bad R&D and remove the bad stuff. So any accretion we would get on OpEx if we get the job done in 1 year rather than 2 or 3 years, then that push-in will not have further upside because there's a certain amount of OpEx equation we got to do, and we're doing it much faster than we talked. And honestly, one of the reason for that, in my mind, is our earlier expectation was that we will find a disaster in Europe. And Europe is harder to restructure, as you all know, with European laws and Works Council and all that. And that's what we found. We found very good running businesses in Europe, and we found a disaster in the U.S. on the business unit side. And that's why we were able to do a lot of the restructuring in a very rapid fashion, and that's largely working ahead of the OpEx goal there. On the gross margin, we haven't gotten upside in the gross margin side yet. As we talked earlier, it takes a while for price increases and cost reductions to take place, so that, so far, is on pace with what we guided earlier. But if we get ahead, we'll let you know. And the last one is attach. There, attach is not at a revenue stage today, it's only at the funnel stage. So maybe that helps you a little bit."

During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events for the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal 2017 financial performance. And Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on the integration activities associated with the Atmel acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the June quarter of $844 million were well above the high end of our guidance and were up 48.5% sequentially and -- form net sales of $568.4 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Non-GAAP net sales were $44.6 million higher than GAAP net sales, as we are reporting non-GAAP net sales on a full sell-through revenue recognition basis, while GAAP does not recognize revenue on sell-through of product sitting in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs, and additionally, some of the Atmel distribution network is on selling revenue recognition for GAAP, primarily in Asia. We will convert the Atmel sell-in distributors to the Microchip contracts when business systems integrate later this year.
Our non-GAAP results are being presented on a full sell-through basis to provide investors with a better view of the true end-market demand for our product. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference.
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 55.8% in the June quarter and above the high end of our guidance, which was 55.2%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 28.4% of sales, below the bottom end of our guidance range of 29.1%. And non-GAAP operating income was 27.4%, well above the high end of our guidance of 26.1%.
Non-GAAP net income was a record $194 million, resulting in record earnings per diluted share of $0.84. This was $0.05 higher than the high end of our guidance of $0.79.
On a GAAP basis, net sales were $799.4 million. And gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 43.6% in the June quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $7.9 million of share-based compensation, $23.4 million of GAAP gross margin effect from the distributor revenue adjustments I mentioned earlier, $90.5 million acquired inventory valuation costs and $0.8 million of other items.
Total operating expenses were $407.6 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $80.2 million, share-based compensation of $51.7 million, $13.7 million of acquisition-related and other costs and special charges of $22 million.
With all the purchase accounting adjustments, the Atmel acquisition-related charges and the related tax impact, we had a GAAP net loss from continuing operations of $109.2 million or $0.51 per diluted share.
In the June quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 8.3% and the GAAP tax rate was negative 20.4%. We expect our long-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 8% and 9%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our inventory balance at June 30, 2016, was $518.4 million, including $80.9 million of fair value markup on the Atmel inventory as required for GAAP purchase accounting. Excluding the purchase accounting adjustments, Microchip had 107 days of inventory at June 30, 2016, which puts our inventory in an outstanding position. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, inventory at our distributors was at 32 days, which is flat to the March quarter levels.
The cash generation in the June quarter, excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit was $184 million. As of June 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $601.8 million. Our borrowings under our revolving line of credit at June 30 was $1.922 billion. Excluding dividend payment, changes in borrowing levels and our acquisition-related activities, we expect our total cash generation to be approximately $175 million to $200 million in the September quarter.
Prior to the Atmel acquisition closing, we have provided a 3-year forecast for how we expects Microchip's total net to EBITDA to trend over time. In those prior forecasts, we have projected that our total net leverage at the closing of the Atmel transaction would be 3.51 and improve to 3.04 by March 2017. We are pleased to report that we are ahead of schedule on this plan with our total net leverage ending the June quarter being 3.22.
Capital spending was approximately $18.5 million in the June quarter. We expect about $30 million in capital spending in the September quarter, and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 to be about $110 million. We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $30.6 million.
For several years prior to fiscal 2016, Microchip's dividends paid to its shareholders have been treated as return of capital, as Microchip did not have earnings and profits in the United States. In fiscal 2016, about 60% were treated as taxable dividends and about 40% were treated as return of capital. In fiscal 2017, we expect our dividends paid to shareholders to be treated as return of capital. Please note that the first quarter of calendar year 2016 will have approximately the same 60% taxable dividend and 40% return of capital split as of fiscal 2016 dividends I mentioned earlier. We will keep investors updated, if anything changes on our expectations of the dividend treatment as we progress throughout the year.
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter. Ganesh?"

With the addition of Atmel results for the June quarter and the significant size of Atmel's business, the normal quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year comparisons we have typically provided are not quite as meaningful. Therefore today, I shall give you more of a qualitative summary of our product line performance along with select quantitative summaries and also provide you an update as to how we're progressing with the Atmel integration.
Now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines starting with microcontrollers. Our core microcontroller business, excluding Atmel, as well as Atmel's microcontroller business were both up strongly in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter, as we continued to experience broad-based growth in our business. Strength in Atmel's microcontroller business was in part due to seasonal strength and in part because customers with completed designs felt reassured about Microchip's plans going forward and, therefore, launched their new product with confidence. All microcontroller business units for Microchip as well as for Atmel outperformed our expectations in the June quarter.
Microcontrollers at over $2.15 billion in annualized revenue represented 63.7% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. We made significant progress integrating Atmel's microcontroller business over the last quarter. We combined Atmel's 8-bit AVR microcontroller business, along with Microchip's 8-bit PIC microcontroller business under an experienced microcontroller leader. Atmel's 8-bit AVR microcontroller business, which is still very popular among a broad base of engineers, had been starved of investment and, hence, atrophied over the last 5 years. We have reprioritized resources to reinvigorate this product line, establish clear new product road maps, formed combined teams to execute the road maps and expect to release a steady stream of innovative new AVR microcontrollers that will lead us through resurgence. We have also received very positive feedback from AVR customers who have longed for more innovative new products and were concerned about support for the existing products. All this while we continued to develop and introduce innovative new 8-bit PIC microcontrollers at a steady pace as before.
We also combined Atmel's SAM 32-bit microcontroller business, along with Microchip's PIC 32-bit microcontroller business under an experienced Microchip leader. We have established clear joint product road maps, formed combined teams to execute the road maps and expect to continue to release a steady stream of new, innovative PIC32 and SAM32 microcontrollers to drive future growth. We carved out Atmel's 32-bit microprocessors as a separate business to give it additional focus. This business continues to be led by the Atmel executive who used to run the business before, who is working well with the Microchip leadership team to grow this very profitable business. This business is a good example of finding the right Microchip answer for the combined company, whereby Microchip terminated our investment in a microprocessor product family that started prior to the acquisition and instead adopted Atmel's microprocessor road map as our future road map.
We combined Atmel's wireless business and Microchip's wireless business under an experienced Microchip leader. This business was running at a large loss and required significant surgery to combine road maps, reduce redundant spending and rationalize priorities. We have made substantial progress towards this end and expect to finish the restructuring for this business in the December quarter.
Atmel's Touch business was organizationally and operationally split into an automotive and industrial business, which has consistent growth and profitability characteristics, which we will retain; and a mobile business, which does not fit our business goals, that we have been marketing for sale to interested buyers.
An area of opportunity we identified early in April, which we have worked diligently since, is pricing discipline. While Atmel has many strong products and technologies, tragically, in 2 many cases, these products were sold at prices that did not recognize the value of these products. We have implemented Microchip's disciplined pricing process to ensure that not only are we competitive, but that we also get appropriately rewarded for providing innovative solutions that enable our clients to achieve success in their business goals.
We remain pleased with the performance and competitiveness of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the broad-based market, which have been augmented by the addition of Atmel's products. We continue to gain market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to gain even more share as we further build the best performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.
Moving now to our analog business. Our analog business, excluding Atmel as well as including Atmel, were both up nicely in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter. Microchip's vast portfolio of analog products is one of our greatest growth opportunities as our sales teams and channel partners incrementally attached them to Atmel microcontrollers at customers and applications that otherwise did not have visibility into.
Our analog business at approximately $860 million in annualized revenue represented 25.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new, linear, mixed signal, power interface and timing products to fuel the future growth of our analog business, and now have the line of sight for analog to be a greater than $1 billion revenue business for Microchip.
Moving to our memory products. Our combined Microchip and Atmel memory business, which is comprised of Serial E-squared memory products as well as SuperFlash Memory products, performed well in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter. We made significant progress integrating Atmel's memory business over the last quarter. We combined Atmel's memory business and Microchip's memory business under an experienced Microchip leader. The product lines offer many substitutable products. And while we will continue to support both product lines for customers who don't wish to switch, for the great majority of customers, we will converge to a best-of-breed memory product, which has the lowest overall cost and the best overall customer value. We have also rationalized the going-forward R&D investment to eliminate redundant projects either at Microchip or at Atmel, established clear new product road maps and formed combined teams to execute the road maps.
In the memory business too, we identified early in April that pricing discipline was a significant improvement opportunity. We have, therefore, implemented Microchip's disciplined pricing process for this business, too, to ensure that we are competitive and don't chase bad business in the pursuit of profitless prosperity.
Our sales integration is well underway with Microchip and Atmel teams reporting to common leadership in every region of the world. We have begun extensive cross-training of the teams, and we're actively working to ensure that we maximize the cross-selling of products for new customer design activity.
We have also started franchising Microchip channel partners to carry Atmel products and Atmel channel partners to carry Microchip products. We're in the midst of planning to integrate our business systems and are working towards making this happen in the December quarter. We're also systematically reviewing our internal and outsourced manufacturing activities as well as our overall procurement activities to find the efficiencies that will reduce costs and also position us better for future growth.
All in all, I have to say that our first quarter of integrating Atmel has gone well despite challenges along the way. Our thanks go out to the many employees across the globe who have gone above and beyond to contribute to the rapid integration and help deliver synergy results that are ahead of forecast.
Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, our guidance going forward and some more about the Atmel integration. Steve?"

Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2017 and then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2017. I will also make comments on the progress of integration for Micrel and make extensive comments on Atmel.
Our June quarter financial results were extremely strong. Our non-GAAP net sales, gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share were all above the high end of our guidance. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.095 per share better than the midpoint of our guidance and up 19.6% sequentially from the March quarter, due to improving sales, gross margin, operating expense leverage and accretion from both Micrel and Atmel. We achieved excellent results, both from our core business at Microchip as well as from Atmel. This was also our 103rd consecutive profitable quarter.
Last month, we made our first 100-day assessment of Atmel, its products and its operations, and we shared them with the employees of Atmel. Today, I would summarize and share that first 100-day assessment with the investors and analysts. First, let me cover Atmel's strength. Atmel has good products and technologies. This is what was visible to us from the outside when we competed with Atmel, and we have confirmed that, in general, Atmel has very good products in microcontrollers, microprocessors, memory, wireless, high-voltage analog, car access, security and touch products.
As we have come up with common road map and common technologies to design future products, Atmel's products and technologies have strong presence in those joint road maps. The vast majority of the people left at Atmel after our initial restructuring, we have found are strong in their areas of expertise, recognize that the business was run poorly and are eager to adopt our culture and create a strong results-based future for the combined company.
Then, as we look into Atmel's weaknesses, we have summarized those weaknesses in 6 major areas. First is accountability. Atmel had a culture of poor accountability. The dismal financial results for the last few years say it all. That is why we had to make drastic leadership changes at Atmel early on.
Second area was poor teamwork. Atmel do not have a culture of teamwork, instead the company was highly siloed into various business units and other functional groups. The business units, sales and operations did not constantly communicate to adjust the factory build rates to changing demand. This routinely resulted in very high inventory buildup and significant inventory write-offs. We have put the entire company on a Microchip type of common incentive program that values sales growth, gross margins, operating expense and operating profit. With our managers role modeling the culture of accountability and teamwork, we believe that we will turn the situation around rapidly.
Third area was that Atmel had a culture of high operating expenses, which routinely ran over 40% of sales. The culture was one of spending what is needed versus what can be afforded. Atmel had a very top-heavy management structure with very poor accountability, leading to significant underperformance. Since the acquisition, we have removed 33 of the 41 vice presidents in the company. That layer is not needed and will not be replaced.
Second, Atmel had a very poor operating expense discipline in R&D. Many R&D projects were continuing despite low gross margins and poor return on investment. Combining the road maps of Microchip and Atmel, we terminated many projects with poor return on investment and restructured the expenses that were no longer needed. The worst performance of any business unit was in wireless where Atmel lost $32 million on sales of $40 million in 2015, all in the name of the buzzword, IoT or Internet of Things. Microchip's IoT portfolio is very strong, and we merged Atmel's wireless road map with Microchip's. We have been doing substantial restructuring to get the expenses in line with what the business can afford and which is consistent with the merged road map.
And third, on the operating expense side was sales and distribution. Atmel had a sell-in driven sales model and a commission-driven sales force that made commissions irrespective of company profitability. A few former sales employees have told us that the customers liked Atmel. Well, if you allow me to sell a large amounts of $1 bills for $0.90, I can get a lot of love from the customers, too. Microchip's customer relations are built on charging a fair price for our proprietary, value-added products. There's nothing wrong with some healthy and constructive tension with customers on the pricing front. Our customer relations are generally healthy, and our success can be seen in our numbers and our market share. We have received some criticism from ex-employees that we're happy shipping at low prices and low margins. We believe that such criticism was expected from the employees who are vested in the status quo.
The fourth area is swinging for home run. Atmel had a culture of swinging for the fences in terms of going after large accounts and often signed onerous contracts with them. Atmel often struck out and lost many of the designs or won them at very low gross margin. Microchip will expand Atmel's customer base and target a very broad base of 100,000 plus customers like at Microchip.
The fifth area is the lack of pricing discipline that Ganesh also commented on. Atmel had a very poor pricing discipline. We immediately expired a lot of low-margin and negative-margin quotes to bring some sanity to the pricing. We have also implemented a new price book beginning July 1, and we now begin the hard work of implementing the new prices customer-by-customer. We will see the positive effects on gross margins in the coming quarters. This is something we have done successfully in our previous acquisitions. In case of Atmel, most of the products are proprietary, and therefore, we will not be concerned about losing a lot of business.
We have also heard a concern that customers would have bought a lot of product early ahead of the price increases. At the direct OEM customers, the pattern of customer orders and shipments into July has continued after the new prices went into effect. So the concern is unfounded.
In case of distribution, we only recognize non-GAAP revenue on sell-through basis, and we wrote up the distribution inventory to the new prices on July 1. So any previously purchased inventory is still in the distribution shelf would have been marked up on July 1. The point of sales trends in July  are not showing any noticeable negative effects from the pricing changes.
And number six, Atmel made no investment in training and development of employees. At the higher level of the company, it was largely a revolving door with an average tenure of executives at less than 3 years. In contrast, the average tenure of executives at Microchip is over 20 years. We make substantial investment in training and development of employees and then promote largely from within, thus retaining substantial talents -- talent base and experience. We have begun implementing Microchip's training and development curriculum at Atmel.
Now after giving you this 100-day assessment of Atmel, now let me continue with deciphering the financial results of Microchip from the fiscal first quarter of 2017. While we recognize that some analysts have interest in breaking down organic and nonorganic net sales, we have made a decision to not provide the breakdown between organic and nonorganic sales. We have seen such data largely misinterpreted. In some of my interactions with the investors, I have seen them taking our GAAP sales from the SEC filings, subtracting the non-GAAP sales from acquisitions that we broke out previously, and then conclude that organic sales were down or flat.
GAAP net sales in the SEC filings ignored the sales out from distribution that are from the products shipped into distribution prior to the close of the acquisition. This confuses investors since GAAP net sales look lower. And if you then make the assumption that the sales from an acquisition was a given number that we provide, then the natural and wrong conclusion that you reach is that organic sales were down. This confusion is partially the results of wacky accounting rules on acquisitions related to distribution sales. In case of Atmel, this will be even more confusing because GAAP net sales in the SEC filings will be based on sell-in revenue recognition in Asia, while the non-GAAP net sales that we are focusing on is based on sell-through revenue recognition in Asia.
Now when we acquire the company, our focus is to grow their sales and earnings of the new joint company. And we focus over resources on the best opportunities from the combined company. For example, in case of Atmel, as Ganesh also pointed out, we have fully combined each of the 8-bit microcontrollers, 32-bit microcontrollers, wireless and memory businesses of both companies. Each of these business units are now headed by a Microchip executive who's managing it as one business, taking the lowest-cost product, manufacturing it to the lowest-cost supply chain and then shipping it at the highest ASP opportunity irrespective of whether the die, assembly or tests comes from core Microchip side or Atmel side.
Trying to artificially balance both businesses of Microchip and Atmel is less than optimum solution and makes no business sense once we are one company and we will not do it. Therefore, we will refrain from providing a line-by-line breakdown of our results between core Microchip and Atmel. We will, however, provide some useful nuggets of information on Atmel as well as Microchip. So here are some of those nuggets.
We achieved all-time record net sales in our core Microchip business. Gross margin from core Microchip business was very strong at 59.75%, up 130 basis points sequentially, and operating profit from our core Microchip business was 33.4% of sales. Gross margin on Atmel improved significantly from the March 2016 quarter prior to the acquisition. March 2016 quarter, while never formally announced, was a very weak quarter in sales as well as gross margin percentage.
Now let us decipher the operating expense where we made very significant progress. Microchip's operating expense in the March quarter was $153.5 million, and Atmel's operating expense in the March quarter was $100 million. So adding them together, our starting point is $253.5 million.
The total operating expense in the June quarter was $246.4 million, a reduction of $7.1 million for the quarter or $28.4 million annualized. Out of this $246.4 million OpEx, $6.4 million was attributed to Mobile Touch business, which is an asset held for sale. Therefore, the operating expense on a continuing basis was $240 million per quarter or 28.4% of continuing sale.
With the combined effect of better-than-expected net sales, higher gross margin percentage and lower OpEx, we achieved an accretion from Atmel of $0.08 per share versus our guidance of $0.00 to $0.05 per share. We worked very hard to make up for how much Atmel's business had atrophied prior to the close of the acquisition.
On the core Microchip side, without Atmel, we achieved a record net -- we achieved a record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.76 per share versus the $0.72 per share midpoint that was embedded in our guidance.
So again, summarizing, we achieved $0.08 accretion from Atmel. And the non-GAAP earnings per share on the Microchip side was $0.76 versus $0.72 per share, which was embedded in our guidance. By any measure, our June quarter results were stellar. We performed excellently on our organic business as well as from Atmel, and we reversed the sales decline for Atmel marking the March 2016 quarter as a bottom. One quarter does not make a trend. So we are working hard to make sure that it does become a trend.
So now let us go into the non-GAAP guidance for September quarter. We expect total net sales, including Atmel, to be up between 0% and 4% sequentially. We expect gross margin to be between 55.6% and 56.2%. We expect overall operating expenses from continuing operations to be between 27.2% and 27.9% of sales, making -- marking another significant reduction in Atmel's operating expenses. We expect operating profit percentage to be between 27.7% and 29% of sales. And we expect earnings per share to be between $0.83 and $0.91 per share. The earnings per share guidance includes an accretion from Atmel of between $0.09 and $0.11 per share.
Now if you combine the accretion from Atmel for first quarter, which was $0.08, and the midpoint for the second quarter, which is $0.10, then $0.18 of accretion from the first 2 quarters against our guidance of $0.25 accretion from Atmel for the entire fiscal year 2017, the fiscal year 2017 guidance seems like a gimme. So we are increasing the accretion target from Atmel on $0.25 previously to $0.40 now for our fiscal year 2017.
We are not changing Atmel accretion guidance for the outer years yet. We have not yet completely analyzed how much of the upside is pulling of the accretion and how much is upside, and there's likely some of each.
Moving to Micrel. We are essentially in the final stages of completing the integration. The last wafer starts in the Micrel 6-inch fab are being made this week. With the last wafer starts this week, we should be closing the Micrel fab in late October. This is about 2 months ahead of what we guided last quarter.
After closing the Micrel fab, we save approximately $26 million in annual wafer costs, which will find its way into the profit and loss statement over the coming quarters as we ship more and more 8-inch wafers and deplete the 6-inch inventory. After we close the fab, the final operating profit model for Micrel will meet or exceed our long-term target of 33%.
I also have an update on the sale process for the Mobile Touch business unit. As of the deadline to receive offers for that business last week, we have several offers for the Mobile Touch business unit. We have a board review of the process later this week. And depending on the party we select and depending on the remaining diligence needed, we expect to be able to complete the sale of the Mobile Touch business unit well before the end of the calendar year.

Microchip has a culture of not obsoleting products and providing long-term service to their clients. The only business we put on sale was just this Mobile Touch business, which was relatively small business. And the other concerns, which actually investors have more than the customers, was what was going to happen to the 8-bit AVR business? What was going to happen to Atmel's microcontroller, together with Microchip's microcontroller, which were competitive? All that has worked out extremely well. We have given customers the confidence that we're going to continue promoting those products, introduce new products. In fact, take many of the great features that we have added on our 8-bit microcontrollers, while Atmel's 8-bit microcontroller has atrophied. We're introducing new products with many great features and giving the messages that the brand of Atmel AVR is here to stay."

This is a fairly very competitive fab, so after a very thorough analysis and we've got good manufacturing ahead on us, I think you have seen it over the years, we have decided and told the Colorado fab people and the community that we will keep Colorado fabs with some of the rumors where something else could happen. That's a very, very good fab. We're going to keep it. We have also using Atmel's 6-inch fab to transfer some of the more sticky Micrel 6-inch products where we had, had trouble bringing them on to 8 inch. It seems like the 6-inch to 6-inch transfer has been smoother than the 6-inch to 8-inch transfer on just a handful of products. We're talking about 2 process technologies and a few products. 85%, 90% of the products for Micrel really have been transferred to Microchip 8-inch fabs.

We're going to let it go, bottom 15% of our revenue, which will be a huge number. This is not the bottom 15% of our revenue. There's no change in our revenue. Our revenue is not going to go down. This is in terms of activity, so projects. So we are doing some projects as some higher-priority projects. There are some lower-priority projects. We will take the lowest priority project of ours and substitute by the acquired company's better projects which meld in. So overall, the portfolio becomes stronger and generates even higher revenue, more competitive pricing, better margins and all that.

And go back a year ago, if you will ask an average investor who had a stronger IoT portfolio, Atmel or Microchip, the answer probably would have been Atmel. And as we look at their business, it was a disaster. As I said, it was losing $32 million on sales of $40 million, and our business was more than 2, 2.5x the size and much better performing and all that, so a lot of that restructuring has been on their side. So that doesn't mean we're not going well in those areas. We had Microchip navigate a very, very broad beachfront. We're calling on 100,000 customers. We got to do all these things. So we can't take all of our microcontroller business and rename it IoT like somebody else has done. That doesn't mean we are shy of IoT applications or not competitive or don't have the products and don't have the focus. We've got all of that."

And then there is attach rate, let's say, attaching analog and all that. If you'll take those 4 major components where the long-term accretion would have come from, the upside in the quarters from a revenue side was real. That's not a pull-in. That's a real revenue upside which will continue quarter after quarter. The OpEx piece is there's a certain amount of OpEx you need to take out and remove the bad R&D and remove the bad stuff. So any accretion we would get on OpEx if we get the job done in 1 year rather than 2 or 3 years, then that push-in will not have further upside because there's a certain amount of OpEx equation we got to do, and we're doing it much faster than we talked. And honestly, one of the reason for that, in my mind, is our earlier expectation was that we will find a disaster in Europe. And Europe is harder to restructure, as you all know, with European laws and Works Council and all that. And that's not what we found. We found very good running businesses in Europe, and we found a disaster in the U.S. on the business unit side. And that's why we were able to do a lot of the restructuring in a very rapid fashion, and that's largely working ahead of the OpEx goal there. On the gross margin, we haven't gotten upside in the gross margin side yet. As we talked earlier, it takes a while for price increases and cost reductions to take place, so that, so far, is on pace with what we guided earlier. But if we get ahead, we'll let you know. And the last one is attach. There, attach is not at a revenue stage today, it's only at the funnel stage. So maybe that helps you a little bit."

We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our first quarter fiscal 2017 financial performance. And Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on the integration activities associated with the Atmel acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the June quarter of $844 million were well above the high end of our guidance and were up 48.5% sequentially and -- form net sales of $568.4 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Non-GAAP net sales were $44.6 million higher than GAAP net sales, as we are reporting non-GAAP net sales on a full sell-through revenue recognition basis, while GAAP does not recognize revenue on sell-through of product sitting in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs, and additionally, some of the Atmel distribution network is on selling revenue recognition for GAAP, primarily in Asia. We will convert the Atmel sell-in distributors to the Microchip contracts when business systems integrate later this year.
Our non-GAAP results are being presented on a full sell-through basis to provide investors with a better view of the true end-market demand for our product. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference.
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 55.8% in the June quarter and above the high end of our guidance, which was 55.2%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 28.4% of sales, below the bottom end of our guidance range of 29.1%. And non-GAAP operating income was 27.4%, well above the high end of our guidance of 26.1%.
Non-GAAP net income was a record $194 million, resulting in record earnings per diluted share of $0.84. This was $0.05 higher than the high end of our guidance of $0.79.
On a GAAP basis, net sales were $799.4 million. And gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 43.6% in the June quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $7.9 million of share-based compensation, $23.4 million of GAAP gross margin effect from the distributor revenue adjustments I mentioned earlier, $90.5 million acquired inventory valuation costs and $0.8 million of other items.
Total operating expenses were $407.6 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $80.2 million, share-based compensation of $51.7 million, $13.7 million of acquisition-related and other costs and special charges of $22 million.
With all the purchase accounting adjustments, the Atmel acquisition-related charges and the related tax impact, we had a GAAP net loss from continuing operations of $109.2 million or $0.51 per diluted share.
In the June quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 8.3% and the GAAP tax rate was negative 20.4%. We expect our long-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 8% and 9%.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our inventory balance at June 30, 2016, was $518.4 million, including $80.9 million of fair value markup on the Atmel inventory as required for GAAP purchase accounting. Excluding the purchase accounting adjustments, Microchip had 107 days of inventory at June 30, 2016, which puts our inventory in an outstanding position. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, inventory at our distributors was at 32 days, which is flat to the March quarter levels.
The cash generation in the June quarter, excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit was $184 million. As of June 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $601.8 million. Our borrowings under our revolving line of credit at June 30 was $1.922 billion. Excluding dividend payment, changes in borrowing levels and our acquisition-related activities, we expect our total cash generation to be approximately $175 million to $200 million in the September quarter.
Prior to the Atmel acquisition closing, we have provided a 3-year forecast for how we expects Microchip's total net to EBITDA to trend over time. In those prior forecasts, we have projected that our total net leverage at the closing of the Atmel transaction would be 3.51 and improve to 3.04 by March 2017. We are pleased to report that we are ahead of schedule on this plan with our total net leverage ending the June quarter being 3.22.
Capital spending was approximately $18.5 million in the June quarter. We expect about $30 million in capital spending in the September quarter, and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 to be about $110 million. We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. Depreciation expense in the June quarter was $30.6 million.
For several years prior to fiscal 2016, Microchip's dividends paid to its shareholders have been treated as return of capital, as Microchip did not have earnings and profits in the United States. In fiscal 2016, about 60% were treated as taxable dividends and about 40% were treated as return of capital. In fiscal 2017, we expect our dividends paid to shareholders to be treated as return of capital. Please note that the first quarter of calendar year 2016 will have approximately the same 60% taxable dividend and 40% return of capital split as of fiscal 2016 dividends I mentioned earlier. We will keep investors updated, if anything changes on our expectations of the dividend treatment as we progress throughout the year.
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the June quarter. Ganesh?"

With the addition of Atmel results for the June quarter and the significant size of Atmel's business, the normal quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year comparisons we have typically provided are not quite as",1277,"Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. With the addition of Atmel results for the June quarter and the significant size of Atmel's business, the normal quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year comparisons we have typically provided are not quite as meaningful. Therefore today, I shall give you more of a qualitative summary of our product line performance along with select quantitative summaries and also provide you an update as to how we're progressing with the Atmel integration.
Now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines starting with microcontrollers. Our core microcontroller business, excluding Atmel, as well as Atmel's microcontroller business were both up strongly in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter, as we continued to experience broad-based growth in our business. Strength in Atmel's microcontroller business was in part due to seasonal strength and in part because customers with completed designs felt reassured about Microchip's plans going forward and, therefore, launched their new product with confidence. All microcontroller business units for Microchip as well as for Atmel outperformed our expectations in the June quarter.
Microcontrollers at over $2.15 billion in annualized revenue represented 63.7% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. We made significant progress integrating Atmel's microcontroller business over the last quarter. We combined Atmel's 8-bit AVR microcontroller business, along with Microchip's 8-bit PIC microcontroller business under an experienced microcontroller leader. Atmel's 8-bit AVR microcontroller business, which is still very popular among a broad base of engineers, had been starved of investment and, hence, atrophied over the last 5 years. We have reprioritized resources to reinvigorate this product line, establish clear new product road maps, formed combined teams to execute the road maps and expect to release a steady stream of innovative new AVR microcontrollers that will lead us through resurgence. We have also received very positive feedback from AVR customers who have longed for more innovative new products and were concerned about support for the existing products. All this while we continued to develop and introduce innovative new 8-bit PIC microcontrollers at a steady pace as before.
We also combined Atmel's SAM 32-bit microcontroller business, along with Microchip's PIC 32-bit microcontroller business under an experienced Microchip leader. We have established clear joint product road maps, formed combined teams to execute the road maps and expect to continue to release a steady stream of new, innovative PIC32 and SAM32 microcontrollers to drive future growth. We carved out Atmel's 32-bit microprocessors as a separate business to give it additional focus. This business continues to be led by the Atmel executive who used to run the business before, who is working well with the Microchip leadership team to grow this very profitable business. This business is a good example of finding the right Microchip answer for the combined company, whereby Microchip terminated our investment in a microprocessor product family that started prior to the acquisition and instead adopted Atmel's microprocessor road map as our future road map.
We combined Atmel's wireless business and Microchip's wireless business under an experienced Microchip leader. This business was running at a large loss and required significant surgery to combine road maps, reduce redundant spending and rationalize priorities. We have made substantial progress towards this end and expect to finish the restructuring for this business in the December quarter.
Atmel's Touch business was organizationally and operationally split into an automotive and industrial business, which has consistent growth and profitability characteristics, which we will retain; and a mobile business, which does not fit our business goals, that we have been marketing for sale to interested buyers.
An area of opportunity we identified early in April, which we have worked diligently since, is pricing discipline. While Atmel has many strong products and technologies, tragically, in 2 many cases, these products were sold at prices that did not recognize the value of these products. We have implemented Microchip's disciplined pricing process to ensure that not only are we competitive, but that we also get appropriately rewarded for providing innovative solutions that enable our clients to achieve success in their business goals.
We remain pleased with the performance and competitiveness of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the broad-based market, which have been augmented by the addition of Atmel's products. We continue to gain market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to gain even more share as we further build the best performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.
Moving now to our analog business. Our analog business, excluding Atmel as well as including Atmel, were both up nicely in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter. Microchip's vast portfolio of analog products is one of our greatest growth opportunities as our sales teams and channel partners incrementally attached them to Atmel microcontrollers at customers and applications that otherwise did not have visibility into.
Our analog business at approximately $860 million in annualized revenue represented 25.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the June quarter. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new, linear, mixed signal, power interface and timing products to fuel the future growth of our analog business, and now have the line of sight for analog to be a greater than $1 billion revenue business for Microchip.
Moving to our memory products. Our combined Microchip and Atmel memory business, which is comprised of Serial E-squared memory products as well as SuperFlash Memory products, performed well in the June quarter as compared to the March quarter. We made significant progress integrating Atmel's memory business over the last quarter. We combined Atmel's memory business and Microchip's memory business under an experienced Microchip leader. The product lines offer many substitutable products. And while we will continue to support both product lines for customers who don't wish to switch, for the great majority of customers, we will converge to a best-of-breed memory product, which has the lowest overall cost and the best overall customer value. We have also rationalized the going-forward R&D investment to eliminate redundant projects either at Microchip or at Atmel, established clear new product road maps and formed combined teams to execute the road maps.
In the memory business too, we identified early in April that pricing discipline was a significant improvement opportunity. We have, therefore, implemented Microchip's disciplined pricing process for this business, too, to ensure that we are competitive and don't chase bad business in the pursuit of profitless prosperity.
Our sales integration is well underway with Microchip and Atmel teams reporting to common leadership in every region of the world. We have begun extensive cross-training of the teams, and we're actively working to ensure that we maximize the cross-selling of products for new customer design activity.
We have also started franchising Microchip channel partners to carry Atmel products and Atmel channel partners to carry Microchip products. We're in the midst of planning to integrate our business systems and are working towards making this happen in the December quarter. We're also systematically reviewing our internal and outsourced manufacturing activities as well as our overall procurement activities to find the efficiencies that will reduce costs and also position us better for future growth.
All in all, I have to say that our first quarter of integrating Atmel has gone well despite challenges along the way. Our thanks go out to the many employees across the globe who have gone above and beyond to contribute to the rapid integration and help deliver synergy results that are ahead of forecast.
Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, our guidance going forward and some more about the Atmel integration. Steve?"

Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal first quarter of 2017 and then provide guidance for the fiscal second quarter of 2017. I will also make comments on the progress of integration for Micrel and make extensive comments on Atmel.
Our June quarter financial results were extremely strong. Our non-GAAP net sales, gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage and earnings per share were all above the high end of our guidance. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.095 per share better than the midpoint of our guidance and up 19.6% sequentially from the March quarter, due to improving sales, gross margin, operating expense leverage and accretion from both Micrel and Atmel. We achieved excellent results, both from our core business at Microchip as well as from Atmel. This was also our 103rd consecutive profitable quarter.
Last month, we made our first 100-day assessment of Atmel, its products and its operations, and we shared them with the employees of Atmel. Today, I would summarize and share that first 100-day assessment with the investors and analysts. First, let me cover Atmel's strength. Atmel has good products and technologies. This is what was visible to us from the outside when we competed with Atmel, and we have confirmed that, in general, Atmel has very good products in microcontrollers, microprocessors, memory, wireless, high-voltage analog, car access, security and touch products.
As we have come up with common road map and common technologies to design future products, Atmel's products and technologies have strong presence in those joint road maps. The vast majority of the people left at Atmel after our initial restructuring, we have found are strong in their areas of expertise, recognize that the business was run poorly and are eager to adopt our culture and create a strong results-based future for the combined company.
Then, as we look into Atmel's weaknesses, we have summarized those weaknesses in 6 major areas. First is accountability. Atmel had a culture of poor accountability. The dismal financial results for the last few years say it all. That is why we had to make drastic leadership changes at Atmel early on.
Second area was poor teamwork. Atmel do not have a culture of teamwork, instead the company was highly siloed into various business units and other functional groups. The business units, sales and operations did not constantly communicate to adjust the factory build rates to changing demand. This routinely resulted in very high inventory buildup and significant inventory write-offs. We have put the entire company on a Microchip type of common incentive program that values sales growth, gross margins, operating expense and operating profit. With our managers role modeling the culture of accountability and teamwork, we believe that we will turn the situation around rapidly.
Third area was that Atmel had a culture of high operating expenses, which routinely ran over 40% of sales. The culture was one of spending what is needed versus what can be afforded. Atmel had a very top-heavy management structure with very poor accountability, leading to significant underperformance. Since the acquisition, we have removed 33 of the 41 vice presidents in the company. That layer is not needed and will not be replaced.
Second, Atmel had a very poor operating expense discipline in R&D. Many R&D projects were continuing despite low gross margins and poor return on investment. Combining the road maps of Microchip and Atmel, we terminated many projects with poor return on investment and restructured the expenses that were no longer needed. The worst performance of any business unit was in wireless where Atmel lost $32 million on sales of $40 million in 2015, all in the name of the buzzword, IoT or Internet of Things. Microchip's IoT portfolio is very strong, and we merged Atmel's wireless road map with Microchip's. We have been doing substantial restructuring to get the expenses in line with what the business can afford and which is consistent with the merged road map.
And third, on the operating expense side was sales and distribution. Atmel had a sell-in driven sales model and a commission-driven sales force that made commissions irrespective of company profitability. A few former sales employees have told us that the customers liked Atmel. Well, if you allow me to sell a large amounts of $1 bills for $0.90, I can get a lot of love from the customers, too. Microchip's customer relations are built on charging a fair price for our proprietary, value-added products. There's nothing wrong with some healthy and constructive tension with customers on the pricing front. Our customer relations are generally healthy, and our success can be seen in our numbers and our market share. We have received some criticism from ex-employees that we're happy shipping at low prices and low margins. We believe that such criticism was expected from the employees who are vested in the status quo.
The fourth area is swinging for home run. Atmel had a culture of swinging for the fences in terms of going after large accounts and often signed onerous contracts with them. Atmel often struck out and lost many of the designs or won them at very low gross margin. Microchip will expand Atmel's customer base and target a very broad base of 100,000 plus customers like at Microchip.
The fifth area is the lack of pricing discipline that Ganesh also commented on. Atmel had a very poor pricing discipline. We immediately expired a lot of low-margin and negative-margin quotes to bring some sanity to the pricing. We have also implemented a new price book beginning July 1, and we now begin the hard work of implementing the new prices customer-by-customer. We will see the positive effects on gross margins in the coming quarters. This is something we have done successfully in our previous acquisitions. In case of Atmel, most of the products are proprietary, and therefore, we will not be concerned about losing a lot of business.
We have also heard a concern that customers would have bought a lot of product early ahead of the price increases. At the direct OEM customers, the pattern of customer orders and shipments into July has continued after the new prices went into effect. So the concern is unfounded.
In case of distribution, we only recognize non-GAAP revenue on sell-through basis, and we wrote up the distribution inventory to the new prices on July 1. So any previously purchased inventory is still in the distribution shelf would have been marked up on July 1. The point of sales trends in July  are not showing any noticeable negative effects from the pricing changes.
And number six, Atmel made no investment in training and development of employees. At the higher level of the company, it was largely a revolving door with an average tenure of executives at less than 3 years. In contrast, the average tenure of executives at Microchip is over 20 years. We make substantial investment in training and development of employees and then promote largely from within, thus retaining substantial talents -- talent base and experience. We have begun implementing Microchip's training and development curriculum at Atmel.
Now after giving you this 100-day assessment of Atmel, now let me continue with deciphering the financial results of Microchip from the fiscal first quarter of 2017. While we recognize that some analysts have interest in breaking down organic and nonorganic net sales, we have made a decision to not provide the breakdown between organic and nonorganic sales. We have seen such data largely misinterpreted. In some of my interactions with the investors, I have seen them taking our GAAP sales from the SEC filings, subtracting the non-GAAP sales from acquisitions that we broke out previously, and then conclude that organic sales were down or flat.
GAAP net sales in the SEC filings ignored the sales out from distribution that are from the products shipped into distribution prior to the close of the acquisition. This confuses investors since GAAP net sales look lower. And if you then make the assumption that the sales from an acquisition was a given number that we provide, then the natural and wrong conclusion that you reach is that organic sales were down. This confusion is partially the results of wacky accounting rules on acquisitions related to distribution sales. In case of Atmel, this will be even more confusing because GAAP net sales in the SEC filings will be based on sell-in revenue recognition in Asia, while the non-GAAP net sales that we are focusing on is based on sell-through revenue recognition in Asia.
Now when we acquire the company, our focus is to grow their sales and earnings of the new joint company. And we focus over resources on the best opportunities from the combined company. For example, in case of Atmel, as Ganesh also pointed out, we have fully combined each of the 8-bit microcontrollers, 32-bit microcontrollers, wireless and memory businesses of both companies. Each of these business units are now headed by a Microchip executive who's managing it as one business, taking the lowest-cost product, manufacturing it to the lowest-cost supply chain and then shipping it at the highest ASP opportunity irrespective of whether the die, assembly or tests comes from core Microchip side or Atmel side.
Trying to artificially balance both businesses of Microchip and Atmel is less than optimum solution and makes no business sense once we are one company and we will not do it. Therefore, we will refrain from providing a line-by-line breakdown of our results between core Microchip and Atmel. We will, however, provide some useful nuggets of information on Atmel as well as Microchip. So here are some of those nuggets.
We achieved all-time record net sales in our core Microchip business. Gross margin from core Microchip business was very strong at 59.75%, up 130 basis points sequentially, and operating profit from our core Microchip business was 33.4% of sales. Gross margin on Atmel improved significantly from the March 2016 quarter prior to the acquisition. March 2016 quarter, while never formally announced, was a very weak quarter in sales as well as gross margin percentage.
Now let us decipher the operating expense where we made very significant progress. Microchip's operating expense in the March quarter was $153.5 million, and Atmel's operating expense in the March quarter was $100 million. So adding them together, our starting point is $253.5 million.
The total operating expense in the June quarter was $246.4 million, a reduction of $7.1 million for the quarter or $28.4 million annualized. Out of this $246.4 million OpEx, $6.4 million was attributed to Mobile Touch business, which is an asset held for sale. Therefore, the operating expense on a continuing basis was $240 million per quarter or 28.4% of continuing sale.
With the combined effect of better-than-expected net sales, higher gross margin percentage and lower OpEx, we achieved an accretion from Atmel of $0.08 per share versus our guidance of $0.00 to $0.05 per share. We worked very hard to make up for how much Atmel's business had atrophied prior to the close of the acquisition.
On the core Microchip side, without Atmel, we achieved a record net -- we achieved a record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.76 per share versus the $0.72 per share midpoint that was embedded in our guidance.
So again, summarizing, we achieved $0.08 accretion from Atmel. And the non-GAAP earnings per share on the Microchip side was $0.76 versus $0.72 per share, which was embedded in our guidance. By any measure, our June quarter results were stellar. We performed excellently on our organic business as well as from Atmel, and we reversed the sales decline for Atmel marking the March 2016 quarter as a bottom. One quarter does not make a trend. So we are working hard to make sure that it does become a trend.
So now let us go into the non-GAAP guidance for September quarter. We expect total net sales, including Atmel, to be up between 0% and 4% sequentially. We expect gross margin to be between 55.6% and 56.2%. We expect overall operating expenses from continuing operations to be between 27.2% and 27.9% of sales, making -- marking another significant reduction in Atmel's operating expenses. We expect operating profit percentage to be between 27.7% and 29% of sales. And we expect earnings per share to be between $0.83 and $0.91 per share. The earnings per share guidance includes an accretion from Atmel of between $0.09 and $0.11 per share.
Now if you combine the accretion from Atmel for first quarter, which was $0.08, and the midpoint for the second quarter, which is $0.10, then $0.18 of accretion from the first 2 quarters against our guidance of $0.25 accretion from Atmel for the entire fiscal year 2017, the fiscal year 2017 guidance seems like a gimme. So we are increasing the accretion target from Atmel on $0.25 previously to $0.40 now for our fiscal year 2017.
We are not changing Atmel accretion guidance for the outer years yet. We have not yet completely analyzed how much of the upside is pulling of the accretion and how much is upside, and there's likely some of each.
Moving to Micrel. We are essentially in the final stages of completing the integration. The last wafer starts in the Micrel 6-inch fab are being made this week. With the last wafer starts this week, we should be closing the Micrel fab in late October. This is about 2 months ahead of what we guided last quarter.
After closing the Micrel fab, we save approximately $26 million in annual wafer costs, which will find its way into the profit and loss statement over the coming quarters as we ship more and more 8-inch wafers and deplete the 6-inch inventory. After we close the fab, the final operating profit model for Micrel will meet or exceed our long-term target of 33%.
I also have an update on the sale process for the Mobile Touch business unit. As of the deadline to receive offers for that business last week, we have several offers for the Mobile Touch business unit. We have a board review of the process later this week. And depending on the party we select and depending on the remaining diligence needed, we expect to be able to complete the sale of the Mobile Touch business unit well before the end of the calendar year.

Microchip has a culture of not obsoleting products and providing long-term service to their clients. The only business we put on sale was just this Mobile Touch business, which was relatively small business. And the other concerns, which actually investors have more than the customers, was what was going to happen to the 8-bit AVR business? What was going to happen to Atmel's microcontroller, together with Microchip's microcontroller, which were competitive? All that has worked out extremely well. We have given customers the confidence that we're going to continue promoting those products, introduce new products. In fact, take many of the great features that we have added on our 8-bit microcontrollers, while Atmel's 8-bit microcontroller has atrophied. We're introducing new products with many great features and giving the messages that the brand of Atmel AVR is here to stay."

We have also using Atmel's 6-inch fab to transfer some of the more sticky Micrel 6-inch products where we had, had trouble bringing them on to 8 inch.

To make the assumption that all of our 100 opportunities are better than all of the 100 opportunities, then they should be at the bottom would be highly egotistical and would be incorrect. So what I said is that many times we find that the top 50% of the acquired company's opportunities are actually better opportunities than the bottom 15% of ours. And therefore, when we mishmash it together, it results into taking some of Microchip resources. And rather than harvesting the bottom 15% of our opportunities, it's better to harvest top 15% of the other company's opportunities because they may be better in whatever way. I think that's what I said. It was just a metaphor. It was not an exact number."

It's a joint road map. The joint teams work together and accelerating those road maps of -- and there are some redundant resources, which I let go. So all that process is going very well. I think on a 8-bit micro, 32-bit micro and memory were largely done. Wireless, as Ganesh said, will take us through the end of the year, calendar year, which was very complex. And on the analog, high voltage, RF front, it's in the same time frame, end of the year or early next year. So that process is really going very, very well. Where I cautioned investors and analysts is, if I remember reading the commentary on what said, they kind of look at -- they looked at it as like so Microchip's bottom 15% of their revenue would go away or something like that. We're going to let it go, bottom 15% of our revenue, which will be a huge number. This is not the bottom 15% of our revenue. There's no change in our revenue. Our revenue is not going to go down. This is in terms of activity, so projects. So we are doing some projects as some higher-priority projects. There are some lower-priority projects. We will take the lowest priority project of ours and substitute by the acquired company's better projects which meld in. So overall, the portfolio becomes stronger and generates even higher revenue, more competitive pricing, better margins and all that. And not equate that to all, we should take a combined company and take 15% of their revenue and say it's going to go away. That's where it was highly misinterpreted."

And then there is attach rate, let's say, attaching analog and all that. If you'll take those 4 major components where the long-term accretion would have come from, the upside in the quarters from a revenue side was real. That's not a pull-in. That's a real revenue upside which will continue quarter after quarter. The OpEx piece is there's a certain amount of OpEx you need to take out and remove the bad R&D and remove the bad stuff. So any accretion we would get on OpEx if we get the job done in 1 year rather than 2 or 3 years, then that push-in will not have further upside because there's a certain amount of OpEx equation we got to do, and we're doing it much faster than we talked. And honestly, one of the reason for that, in my mind, is our earlier expectation was that we will find a disaster in Europe. And Europe is harder to restructure, as you all know, with European laws and Works Council and all that. And that's not what we found. We found very good running businesses in Europe, and we found a disaster in the U.S. on the business unit side. And that's why we were able to do a lot of the restructuring in a very rapid fashion, and that's largely working ahead of the OpEx goal there. On the gross margin, we haven't gotten upside in the gross margin side yet. As we talked earlier, it takes a while for price increases and cost reductions to take place, so that, so far, is on pace with what we guided earlier. But if we get ahead, we'll let you know. And the last one is attach. There, attach is not at a revenue stage today, it's only at the funnel stage. So maybe that helps you a little bit."

Non-GAAP net sales in the September quarter were a record $873.8 million, they were well above the high end of our guidance and we're 8.5% [ph] sequentially from net sales of $844 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Non-GAAP net sales were $2.5 million higher GAAP net sales as we are reporting non-GAAP net sales on a full sell-through revenue recognition basis while GAAP recognizes the Atmel Asia distribution network as having sell-in revenue recognition.
Our non-GAAP results are being presented on a full sell-through basis to provide investors with a better view of the through end market demand for our products. We will start recognizing revenue on a sell-through basis for the Atmel Asia distributors effective October 1. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference.
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 57.2% in the September quarter and significantly above the high end of our guidance, which was 56.2%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 26.7% of sales, significantly below the bottom end of our guidance range of 27.2% and non-GAAP operating income was 30.5%, well above the high-end of our guidance of 29%.
Non-GAAP net income was a record $219.6 million, resulting in record earnings per diluted share of $0.94, which was $0.05 higher than the high-end of our guidance of $0.89, up 11.6% on a sequential basis and up 42.6% as compared to the same quarter last year.
On a GAAP basis, net sales were $871.4 million and gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 47.1% in the September quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $4.1 million of share based compensation, $1.5 million of gross margin impact from the distributor revenue adjustments I mentioned earlier, and $84.3 million in acquired inventory valuation costs. Total operating expenses were $347.9 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $80.4 million, share-based compensation of $20.3 million, $4.1 million of acquisition-related and other costs and special charges of $9.5 million. With all the purchase accounting adjustments, the Atmel acquisition-related charges and the related tax impacts, GAAP net income from continuing operations was $35.6 million or $0.15 per diluted share.
In the September quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 9.1% and the GAAP tax rate was negative 40.9%. We expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 8.5% and 9.5%.
The share-based compensation for Microchip in the June 2016 quarter was extraordinarily high at $59.6 million related to the restructuring we had with the Atmel acquisition. The share-based compensations came down significantly in the September quarter to $24.4 million, and we expect the share-based compensation to be about $23 million in the December quarter, which is more indicative of the ongoing run rate for these expenses.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our inventory balance at September 30, 2016, was $424.7 million and all of the fair value markup on the Atmel inventory as required by GAAP purchase accounting, is now off of the balance sheet. There are still $12 million of fair value mark up relating to Atmel sitting in the distribution inventory balance at the end of September. Excluding the purchase accounting adjustments, Microchip had 103 days of inventory at September 30, 2016, down 4 days from the end of the June quarter. Excluding first accounting adjustments, inventory at our distributors was at 31 days, which is down from the June quarter level of 32 days.
The cash generation in the September quarter, excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit, was a record $211.2 million. As of September 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $490.8 million. Our borrowings under our revolving line of credit as of September 30, were $1.678 billion and will result in a 25 basis point reduction on our borrowing rate once we file our September quarter 10-Q later this week.
Excluding dividend payments, changes in borrowing levels in our acquisition-related activities, we expect our total cash generation to be approximately $170 million to $200 million in the December quarter.
We continue to make good progress on our leverage with our net debt to EBITDA ending the September quarter at 2.91. This is down from 3.22 at the end of the June quarter and better than our projection we have shared with The Street last quarter of 3.02. We expect our net debt to EBITDA to be about 2.35 by the end of fiscal year 2017.
Capital spending was approximately $18.2 million in the September quarter. We expect about $30 million in capital spending in the December quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 to be about $110 million. We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $30 million.
For several years, prior to fiscal 2016, Microchip's dividends paid to its shareholders had been treated as return of capital as Microchip did not have earnings and profits in the United States. In fiscal 2016, about 60% were treated as taxable dividends and about 40% were treated as return of capital. In fiscal 2017, we expect our dividends paid to shareholders to be treated as a return of capital. Please note that the first quarter of calendar year 2016 will have approximately the same 60% taxable dividend and 40% return of capital split as of fiscal 2016 dividends. We will continue to keep investors updated if anything changes on our expectations of the dividend treatment as we progress throughout the year.
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter. Ganesh?"

Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers.Our microcontroller business in the September quarter was up 3% sequentially as compared to the June",954,"Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers.
Our microcontroller business in the September quarter was up 3% sequentially as compared to the June quarter, setting a new record in the process. Our microcontroller business, excluding Atmel, as well as Atmel's microcontroller business, were each up nicely in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter as we continue to experience broad-based growth in our business. In addition, each of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller businesses were up sequentially and achieved new records to revenue.
Even as we grow our 16-bit and 32-bit business, in leaps and bounds, Microchip's overall 8-bit microcontroller business as well as Microchip's 8-bit microcontroller business, excluding Atmel, achieved new records for revenue in the September quarter. Once again, demonstrating the resilience and consistency of this business. We believe that reports of the debt of the 8-bit microcontroller market are greatly exaggerated and limited only by the imagination and willingness to offer innovative new solutions.
During the quarter, Atmel's customers continue to feel reassured about Microchip's microcontroller road maps going forward, exemplified by the introduction of the first new AVR microcontrollers and SAM32 microcontrollers on Microchip's watch. As a result, we are seeing continued growth in our design and funnel and expect us to drive future growth as these designs progress into production over time.
In regards to the microcontroller business units integration, we have already made significant progress in the June quarter and largely completed the remaining integration efforts in the September quarter. The wireless business restructuring, which was still a work in progress, at the end of June, has progressed significantly since then and will be completed by the end of December. This business was running at a large loss and required significant and rapid surgery to combine road maps, reduce redundant spending and rationalize priorities.
The business focused on automotive, industrial and commercial markets took further shape in the September quarter and we are driving opportunities with the strongest set of customers and channel relationships as well as a stronger combined sales team. Steve will give you an update a little detail later on the sale of the Mobile Touch business, which did not fit our business goals that we had been marketing for sale to interested buyers.
We implemented Microchip's disciplined pricing process to ensure that not only are we being competitive, but that we're also getting appropriately rewarded for providing innovative solutions that enable our clients to successfully achieve their business goals. The benefits of the pricing changes we made were partially seen in the September quarter and will have some residual benefit in future quarters.
Finally, microcontrollers at over $2.2 billion in annualized revenue, represented 63.4% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. We remain pleased with the performance and competitiveness of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the broad-based market, which have been augmented by the addition of Atmel's portfolio. We continue to gain market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we further build the best performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.
Moving now to our analog products. Our analog business was up 4.7% sequentially in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter, and also set a new record. At approximately $900 million in annualized revenue, our analog business represented 25.7% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. During the quarter, we continued an active effort to find opportunities to attach Microchip's vast portfolio of analog products to Atmel microcontrollers at customers and applications that we otherwise did not have visibility into. This effort is progressing well and will pay dividends over time as new design wins go to production. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear mixed-signal, power, interface, timing and security products to fuel the future growth of our analog business as we march relentlessly towards making analog a greater than $1 billion revenue business for Microchip.
Moving to our memory products. Our combined Microchip and Atmel memory businesses we were down 2% in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter. In this business too, we implemented Microchip's disciplined pricing process to the Atmel business to ensure that while we are competitive, we're not chasing bad business in the pursuit of profitless prosperity.
Summarizing some of the other Atmel integration elements. Our sales integration is progressing well with extensive crosstraining of our direct sales teams as well as our channel partners sales teams. Microchip's major channel partners are now franchised to carry Atmel products and most Atmel channel partners are franchised to carry Microchip products. Between training and enabling our channel partners, we won't leave no stone unturned as we work to ensure that we maximize the cross-selling of products with new custom design activity.
We're in the midst of planning for and testing to integrate our business systems and expect to go live on the Microchip systems on January 1, 2017. This is the largest and most complex acquisition we have done, and we are taking extra time to ensure we thoroughly test the changes before we go live.
All in all, the second quarter of integrating Atmel has progressed on or ahead of our plans. Our thanks go out to the many employees across the globe who have gone above and beyond to contribute to the rapid integration and help deliver synergy results that are well ahead of forecast.
Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, our guidance going forward and more about the Atmel integration. Steve?"

Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal second quarter of 2017 and then provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2017. I will also make comments on the progress of integration for Micrel and make extensive comments on Atmel.
Our September quarter financial results were extremely strong. Our non-GAAP net sales, gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage were all better than the high end of our guidance, while our non-GAAP operating expenses were less than the low-end of our guidance. Additionally, our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.07 per share better than the midpoint of our guidance and up 11.6% sequentially and up 42.6% from the September quarter of the year ago, due to improved gross margin percentage, operating expense leverage and accretion from both Micrel and Atmel.
We achieved record results from our core business and sequentially grew both in our core business at Microchip as well as from Atmel. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip, including acquired employees from Micrel and Atmel worldwide, for delivering a record quarter in every respect.  This was also our 104th consecutive profitable quarter.
In the last quarter's conference call, we shared with you our first 100 days assessment of Atmel, its products and its operations. Now with 200-plus days behind us, I will update you on what we have done to correct Atmel's weaknesses in order of priority.  Number 1, lack of pricing discipline. We have completely turned the situation around. There are no low-price, low margin courts being given anywhere in the world. It seems that Atmel's prices were well below the market prices and there was an air gap between the Atmel selling price and the market price. Our price increases, while painful for some customers, are largely filling the air gap as we bring prices closer to the market price. Most of the products are proprietary and therefore we would not be concerned about losing business.
On the distribution front, we got a lucky break as one of our largest competitor has changed their distribution program where they will be using distribution only for fulfillment and are terminating their registration program, under which their distribution on the higher margin for demand creation. This is having a very positive effect on Microchip as the distribution sees a very strong portfolio from the combined Microchip and Atmel franchises and is increasing their commitment for demand creation for Microchip.
Number 2, high operating expense culture. Atmel had a culture of high operating expenses, which routinely ran over 40% of sales. In the September quarter, Atmel's operating expense was below 28% of sales and many of the expense reductions done were not for the entire quarter. So you will see the operating expenses continue to drop.
Number 3, swinging for home runs and getting large customers at low margins. This has now been corrected as we are aligning many of Atmel's sales focus consistent with that of Microchip.
Number 4, accountability. I said at the last conference call that Atmel had a culture of poor accountability with a broad-based implementation of Microchip type of bonus plans, which are based on overall company growth and profitability. We are rapidly changing that culture. In our presentations at Atmel, our communications with them and classes at Atmel, we are teaching that at Microchip, management is accountable.
Number 5, poor teamwork. Atmel did not have a culture of teamwork. Bonus and equity grants were very large at the top at Atmel and less than 30% of the employees had bonus and equity. At Microchip, 100% of our employees are on a bonus program, and nearly 100% of our non-Thailand labor employees are on equity program. Rather than large equity grants at the top, Microchip's spreads equity throughout the organization so that the share and the responsibility and rewards of having a stake in the company. We have also implemented Microchip's style of quarterly business unit reviews. With the entire company on a Microchip type of common incentive program that values sales growth, gross margin, operating expense and operating profit and with our manager's role modeling the culture of accountability and teamwork, we believe that we are turning the situation around rapidly.
Number 6, Atmel made no investment in training and development of employees. In a short 6 months, over 2,200 Atmel employees or over 2/3 of the employee base have gone through at least 1 training class at Microchip. We are putting Atmel's sales and field applications engineers to a 2-week extensive training that we call Boot Camp, in which, we train the employees on Microchip's client engagement process, our values, our culture and align them with our goals and rewards system. With no training for more than a decade at Atmel, we have much work to do but rapid changes are taking place and employees are bonding to the superior systems at Microchip and the results are starting to improve.
Now let us continue with the deciphering the financial results of Microchip from the fiscal second quarter. While we will refrain from providing a line-by-line breakdown of our results, between core Microchip and Atmel, we will provide some useful negative information on Atmel as well as Microchip. So here are those nuggets. We achieved all-time record net sales in our core Microchip business and the gross margins and operating margins in the core business were both stellar and sequentially up from the June quarter.
Now on Atmel, probably one of the best accomplishments is that gross margin on Atmel improved dramatically by approximately 400 basis points sequentially and was the highest gross margin achieved at Atmel in over 5 years. There are a lot of moving parts but price is a big one. Price increases, the new price book, changing worldwide prices to U.S. dollars and tagging a debt to win the contracts were done and protecting Microchip from a large euro and pound depreciation against the dollar were significant items. Beyond that, there was a very favorable mix also with higher growth in MCUs memory business and there are plenty of cost reductions next year.
Regarding Atmel's operating expense, I mentioned earlier that Atmel's operating expense in March quarter was over 40% of net sales. Atmel's operating expense in September quarter was below 28% of net sales. With the combined effect of better-than-expected net sales, substantially higher gross margin percentage and substantially lower OpEx, we achieved Atmel's operating margin of over 23% of sales, which is again the highest operating margin achieved at Atmel in over 5 years. We achieved an accretion from Atmel of $0.145 per share, which is our guidance of $0.09 to $0.11 per share.
By any measure, our September quarter results were stellar. Going into Atmel acquisition, the investors and analysts had 3 major concerns. They were: Can we grow Atmel's business, can we improve Atmel's gross and operating margins, and can we improve Atmel's execution? The answers to those questions are yes, yes and yes. We have grown Atmel's business. We have dramatically improved Atmel's gross and operating margins, and we are improving the executions. And when I say we, it does not mean we at classic Microchip. We means the new Microchip that includes all the worldwide employees of Atmel that are doing a great job improving the financial results of Atmel.
So now let us go into the non-GAAP guidance for the December quarter. We expect total net sales to be sequentially flat-to-down 6%. We expect gross margin to be between 56.6% and 57.2%. We expect overall operating expenses from continuing operations to be between 26.5% and 27% of sales. We expect operating profit percentage to be between 29.6% and 30.7% of sales. And we expect earnings per share to be between $0.85 and $0.95 per share. The earnings per share guidance include an accretion from Atmel of between $0.13 and $0.17 per share.
Last quarter, we increased the fiscal year '17 accretion target from Atmel from $0.25 at the deal announcement to $0.40. We are again increasing the accretion target from Atmel from $0.40 to $0.50 per share for fiscal year '17. We have also assessed whether the upside and accretion from Atmel is pulling off long-term accretion or upside. As I said last quarter, there is some of both, so let me catch up the math for everyone.
Our original accretion target for fiscal year '17, '18 and '19 was $0.33, $0.66 and $0.90, respectively, all with full stock buyback of shares issued in the Atmel transaction. This is the target we gave you at deal announcement for fiscal year '17, '18 and '19 to be $0.33, $0.66 and $0.90, respectively, all with full stock buyback of shares issued in the transaction. Now after we decided not to buy the stock back, the accretion math took the accretion to $0.25, $0.53 and $0.75 for fiscal year '17, '18 and '19, respectively. Now we believe that the opportunity for stock buyback when the stock was under $40 is now past. So we're not going to buy the stock back and instead, create the balance sheet for the future acquisition. So our reference point for accretion for fiscal year '17, '18, '19 is $0.25, $0.53 and $0.75 without any stock buyback. So once again, our reference point for accretion for fiscal year '17, '18 and '19 is $0.25, $0.53 and $0.75, without any stock buyback.
So now our new accretion target. For fiscal year '17, without any stock buyback I already gave you, is $0.50, which is up from $0.25 originally, almost a full year ahead of schedule. The new accretion target for fiscal year '18 goes from $0.53 originally to $0.70 now. And for fiscal year '19, the accretion target goes from original $0.75 to $0.90 now. In fact, our new accretion targets are now at/or above our original targets when we assume the buying back stock. For fiscal year '17, our new accretion target is 100% higher than our initial estimate, excluding stock buyback and 50% higher than our initial estimate, including the stock buyback. This is all accustomed into how well the Microchip team has executed the Atmel integration in the first 7 months since the close of the transaction.
On Micrel said, the integration is complete. The fab will close at the end of next week. The last of wafers are coming through the fab as we speak. A large number of fab employees have already been let go. After closing the Micrel fab, we saved approximately $26 million in annual wafer costs, which will find its way into the profit and loss statement over the coming quarters as we ship more and more 8-inch wafers and deplete the 6-inch inventory. After we close the fab, the final operating profit margin -- model for Micrel will meet or exceed our long-term target of 33%.
We also announced last week the result of the sale process for the Mobile Touch business unit. We sold the business unit in a cross-border transaction, consisting of an asset purchase, an AP license agreement, a sales agreement for the inventory of Mobile Touch business unit and a transition services agreement. We expect this deal to close later this week.
Finally, with the success we have seen so far with Atmel and Microchip and with great results from the core Microchip business, we now expect that we will achieve our long-term financial model at the end of fiscal year '18 versus 3 to 4 years that was embedded in our forecast when we announced the Atmel deal. To remind everyone, that financial model is 59% gross margin, 26% operating expense and 33% in operating margins.

But we're not shutting that Atmel since a Colorado Fab. That is a very, very nice Fab. Note when you look at the back end, Atmel big majority of the assembly and test all of the subcontractors. They did the assembly themselves and 90% of the test was outside. The only did some way for probe in the Philippines. If you compare that to Microchip, we do all of our wafer probe in about 60%, 70% for assembly, and about 90%-plus for test ourselves. So that's where we see some opportunities where as we compare the assembly and test costs structure, Microchip's testing technology, substantially technology a lot lower costs than some of it that Atmel is using.

There are number of players we compete with an assets, NXP, and expectation, Microchip and other some smaller players, the market remains and competitive, and Qualcomm purchasing NXP and expectation weren't really change anything because Qualcomm was not a microcontroller supplier. So the same product line that NXP had will continue, and we're not seeing any change now, although the closing of the acquisition is 1 year away, we're not expecting to see any change coming out of that."

I think given companies acquired in the last year, especially Altera, NXP-Freescale that we would not have -- and Linear, we would not have expected those mergers to happen. So if of those can happen, I'm sure there will be more mergers. But what we're not seeing is that these mergers are changing competitive landscape in any way. Companies are getting larger, and we're getting larger ourselves and have a much, much larger product portfolio, full product portfolio across many dimensions, a lot of automotive, industrial, computing, IoT so on and so forth. So there are formidable competitor ourselves today. But NXPI and Qualcomm merging together doesn't make NXPI anymore scarier or not scary. NXPI and Freescale margin together didn't change anything."

And then the Atmel inventory when we bought them, which was very, very high inventory and over the last years, 7, 8 months, we have brought Atmel inventory down significantly there it's almost corrected not across the board but there are places where it's really pretty much corrected. So over the next quarter or so, I think you could see basically wafer starts going up in all 3 fabs possibly, and that's really what you're asking.

We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP to non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the September quarter were a record $873.8 million. They were well above the high end of our guidance and were [indiscernible] sequentially from net sales of $844 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Non-GAAP net sales were $2.5 million higher than GAAP net sales as we are reporting non-GAAP net sales on a full sell-through revenue recognition basis while GAAP recognizes the Atmel Asia distribution network as having sell-in revenue recognition.
Our non-GAAP results are being presented on a full sell-through basis to provide investors with a better view of the true end market demand for our products. We will start recognizing revenue on a sell-through basis for the Atmel Asia distributors effective October 1. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference.
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 57.2% in the September quarter and significantly above the high end of our guidance, which was 56.2%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 26.7% of sales, significantly below the bottom end of our guidance range of 27.2% and non-GAAP operating income was 30.5%, well above the high-end of our guidance of 29%.
Non-GAAP net income was a record $219.6 million, resulting in record earnings per diluted share of $0.94, which was $0.05 higher than the high-end of our guidance of $0.89, up 11.6% on a sequential basis and up 42.6% as compared to the same quarter last year.
On a GAAP basis, net sales were $871.4 million and gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 47.1% in the September quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $4.1 million of share based compensation, $1.5 million of gross margin impact from the distributor revenue adjustments I mentioned earlier, and $84.3 million in acquired inventory valuation costs.
Total operating expenses were $347.9 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $80.4 million, share-based compensation of $20.3 million, $4.1 million of acquisition-related and other costs and special charges of $9.5 million. With all the purchase accounting adjustments, the Atmel acquisition-related charges and the related tax impacts, GAAP net income from continuing operations was $35.6 million or $0.15 per diluted share.
In the September quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 9.1% and the GAAP tax rate was negative 40.9%. We expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 8.5% and 9.5%.
Share-based compensation for Microchip in the June 2016 quarter was extraordinarily high at $59.6 million related to the restructuring we had with the Atmel acquisition. The share-based compensation came down significantly in the September quarter to $24.4 million, and we expect the share-based compensation to be about $23 million in the December quarter, which is more indicative of the ongoing run rate for these expenses.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our inventory balance at September 30, 2016, was $424.7 million and all of the fair value markup on the Atmel inventory as required by GAAP purchase accounting is now off of the balance sheet. There is still $12 million of fair value markup relating to Atmel sitting in the distribution inventory balance at the end of September. Excluding the purchase accounting adjustments, Microchip had 103 days of inventory at September 30, 2016, down 4 days from the end of the June quarter. Excluding first accounting adjustments, inventory at our distributors was at 31 days, which is down from the June quarter level of 32 days.
The cash generation in the September quarter, excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit, was a record $211.2 million. As of September 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $490.8 million. Our borrowings under our revolving line of credit as of September 30, were $1.678 billion and will result in a 25 basis point reduction on our borrowing rate once we file our September quarter 10-Q later this week.
Excluding dividend payments, changes in borrowing levels and our acquisition-related activities, we expect our total cash generation to be approximately $170 million to $200 million in the December quarter.
We continue to make good progress on our leverage with our net debt-to-EBITDA ending the September quarter at 2.91. This is down from 3.22 at the end of the June quarter and better than our projection we had shared with The Street last quarter of 3.02. We expect our net debt-to-EBITDA to be about 2.35 by the end of fiscal year 2017.
Capital spending was approximately $18.2 million in the September quarter. We expect about $30 million in capital spending in the December quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 to be about $110 million. We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $30 million.
For several years prior to fiscal 2016, Microchip's dividends paid to its shareholders had been treated as return of capital as Microchip did not have earnings and profits in the United States. In fiscal 2016, about 60% were treated as taxable dividends and about 40% were treated as return of capital. In fiscal 2017, we expect our dividends paid to shareholders to be treated as return of capital. Please note that the first quarter of calendar year 2016 will have approximately the same 60% taxable dividend and 40% return of capital split as of fiscal 2016 dividends. We will continue to keep investors updated if anything changes on our expectations of the dividend treatment as we progress throughout the year.
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter. Ganesh?"

Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers.Our microcontroller business in the September quarter was up 3% sequentially as compared to the June",960,"Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers.
Our microcontroller business in the September quarter was up 3% sequentially as compared to the June quarter, setting a new record in the process. Our microcontroller business, excluding Atmel, as well as Atmel's microcontroller business, were each up nicely in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter as we continue to experience broad-based growth in our business. In addition, each of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller businesses were up sequentially and achieved new records for revenue.
Even as we grow our 16-bit and 32-bit business in leaps and bounds, Microchip's overall 8-bit microcontroller business as well as Microchip's 8-bit microcontroller business, excluding Atmel, achieved new records for revenue in the September quarter. Once again demonstrating the resilience and consistency of this business. We believe that reports of the death of the 8-bit microcontroller market are greatly exaggerated and limited only by the imagination and willingness to offer innovative new solutions.
During the quarter, Atmel's customers continued to feel reassured about Microchip's microcontroller road maps going forward, exemplified by the introduction of the first new AVR microcontrollers and SAM 32 microcontrollers on Microchip's watch. As a result, we are seeing continued growth in our design-in funnel and expect us to drive future growth as these designs progress into production over time.
In regards to the microcontroller business unit's integration, we had already made significant progress in the June quarter and largely completed the remaining integration efforts in the September quarter. The wireless business restructuring, which was still a work in progress, at the end of June, has progressed significantly since then and will be completed by the end of December. This business was running at a large loss and required significant and rapid surgery to combine road maps, reduce redundant spending and rationalize priorities.
The tough and gesture business focused on automotive, industrial and commercial markets took further shape in the September quarter, and we are driving our opportunities with a stronger set of customers and channel relationships as well as a stronger combined sales team. Steve will give you an update a little later on the sale of the mobile touch business, which did not fit our business goals that we had been marketing for sale to interested buyers.
We implemented Microchip's disciplined pricing process to ensure that not only are we being competitive, but that we are also getting -- appropriately rewarded for providing innovative solutions that enable our clients to successfully achieve their business goals. The benefits of the pricing changes we made were partially seen in the September quarter and will have some residual benefit in future quarters.
Finally, microcontrollers at over $2.2 billion in annualized revenue represented 63.4% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. We remain pleased with the performance and competitiveness of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the broad-based market, which have been augmented by the addition of Atmel's portfolio. We continue to gain market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we further build the best performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.
Moving now to our analog products. Our analog business was up 4.7% sequentially in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter, and also set a new record. At approximately $900 million in annualized revenue, our analog business represented 25.7% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. During the quarter, we continued an active effort to find opportunities to attach Microchip's vast portfolio of analog products to Atmel microcontrollers at customers and applications that we otherwise did not have visibility into. This effort is progressing well and will pay dividends over time as new design wins go to production. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear mixed-signal, power, interface, timing and security products to fuel the future growth of our analog business as we march relentlessly towards making analog a greater than $1 billion revenue business for Microchip.
Moving to our memory products. Our combined Microchip and Atmel memory businesses were down 2% in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter. In this business too, we implemented Microchip's disciplined pricing process to the Atmel business to ensure that while we are competitive, we are not chasing bad business in the pursuit of profitless prosperity.
Summarizing some of the other Atmel integration elements. Our sales integration is progressing well with extensive cross-training of our direct sales teams as well as our channel partner sales teams. Microchip's major channel partners are now franchised to carry Atmel products, and most Atmel channel partners are franchised to carry Microchip products. Between training and enabling our channel partners, we won't leave no stone unturned as we work to ensure that we maximize the cross-selling of products with new custom design activity.
We are in the midst of planning for and testing to integrate our business systems and expect to go live on the Microchip systems on January 1, 2017. This is the largest and most complex acquisition we have done, and we are taking extra time to ensure we thoroughly test the changes before we go live.
All in all, the second quarter of integrating Atmel has progressed on or ahead of our plans. Our thanks go out to the many employees across the globe who have gone above and beyond to contribute to the rapid integration and help deliver synergy results that are well ahead of forecast.
Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, our guidance going forward and more about the Atmel integration. Steve?"

Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal second quarter of 2017 and then provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2017. I will also make comments on the progress of integration for Micrel and make extensive comments on Atmel.
Our September quarter financial results were extremely strong. Our non-GAAP net sales, gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage were all better than the high end of our guidance, while our non-GAAP operating expenses were less than the low-end of our guidance. Additionally, our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.07 per share better than the midpoint of our guidance and up 11.6% sequentially and up 42.6% from the September quarter of a year ago, due to improved gross margin percentage, operating expense leverage and accretion from both Micrel and Atmel.
We achieved record results from our core business and sequentially grew both in our core business at Microchip as well as from Atmel. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip, including acquired employees from Micrel and Atmel worldwide, for delivering a record quarter in every respect. This was also our 104th consecutive profitable quarter.
In the last quarter's conference call, we shared with you our first 100-day assessment of Atmel, its products and its operations. Now with 200-plus days behind us, I would update you on what we have done to correct Atmel's weaknesses in order of priority.  Number one, lack of pricing discipline. We have completely turned the situation around. There are no low-price, low-margin quotes being given anywhere in the world. It seems that Atmel's prices were well below their market prices and there was an air gap between the Atmel selling price and the market price. Our price increases, while painful for some customers, are largely filling the air gap as we bring prices closer to the market price. Most of the products are proprietary and therefore, we would not be concerned about losing business.
On the distribution front, we got a lucky break as one of our largest competitor has changed their distribution program where they will be using distribution only for fulfillment and are terminating their registration program, under which their distribution on the higher margin for demand creation. This is having a very positive effect on Microchip as the distribution sees a very strong portfolio from the combined Microchip and Atmel franchises and is increasing their commitment for demand creation for Microchip.
Number two, high operating expense culture. Atmel had a culture of high operating expenses, which routinely ran over 40% of sales. In the September quarter, Atmel's operating expense was below 28% of sales and many of the expense reductions done were not for the entire quarter. So you will see the operating expenses continue to drop.
Number three, swinging for home runs and getting large customers at low margins. This has now been corrected as we are aligning many of Atmel's sales focus consistent with that of Microchip.
Number four, accountability. I said at the last conference call that Atmel had a culture of poor accountability. With a broad-based implementation of Microchip type of bonus plans, which are based on overall company growth and profitability, we are rapidly changing that culture. In our presentations at Atmel, our communications with them and classes at Atmel, we are teaching that at Microchip, management is accountable.
Number five, poor teamwork. Atmel did not have a culture of teamwork. Bonus and equity grants were very large at the top at Atmel and less than 30% of the employees had bonus and equity. At Microchip, 100% of our employees are on a bonus program, and nearly 100% of our non-Thailand labor employees are on equity program. Rather than large equity grants at the top, Microchip spreads equity throughout the organization so that they share in the responsibility and rewards of having a stake in the company. We have also implemented Microchip's style of quarterly business unit reviews. With the entire company on a Microchip type of common incentive program that values sales growth, gross margin, operating expense and operating profit and with our manager's role modeling the culture of accountability and teamwork, we believe that we are turning the situation around rapidly.
Number six, Atmel made no investment in training and development of employees. In a short 6 months, over 2,200 Atmel employees or over 2/3 of the employee base have gone through at least 1 training class at Microchip. We are putting Atmel's sales and field applications engineers through a 2-week extensive training that we call Boot Camp, in which, we train the employees on Microchip's client engagement process, our values, our culture and align them with our goals and reward system. With no training for more than a decade at Atmel, we have much work to do. But rapid changes are taking place and employees are bonding to the superior systems at Microchip and the results are starting to improve.
Now let us continue with the deciphering of financial results of Microchip from the fiscal second quarter. While we will refrain from providing a line-by-line breakdown of our results between core Microchip and Atmel, we will provide some useful negative information on Atmel as well as Microchip. So here are those nuggets. We achieved all-time record net sales in our core Microchip business and the gross margins and operating margins in the core business were both stellar and sequentially up from the June quarter.
Now on Atmel, probably one of the best accomplishments is that gross margin on Atmel improved dramatically by approximately 400 basis points sequentially and was the highest gross margin achieved at Atmel in over 5 years. There are a lot of moving parts, but price is a big one. Price increases, the new price book, changing worldwide prices to U.S. dollars and pegging it back to win the contracts were done in protecting Microchip from a large euro and pound depreciation against the dollar were significant items. Beyond that, there was a very favorable mix also with higher growth in MCUs than the memory business, and there are plenty of cost reductions mixed in.
Regarding Atmel's operating expense, I mentioned earlier that Atmel's operating expense in March quarter was over 40% of net sales. Atmel's operating expense in September quarter was below 28% of net sales. With the combined effect of better-than-expected net sales, substantially higher gross margin percentage and substantially lower OpEx, we achieved Atmel's operating margin of over 23% of sales, which is again the highest operating margin achieved at Atmel in over 5 years. We achieved an accretion from Atmel of $0.145 per share versus our guidance of $0.09 to $0.11 per share.
By any measure, our September quarter results was stellar. Going into Atmel acquisition, the investors and analysts had 3 major concerns. They were: Can we grow Atmel's business, can we improve Atmel's gross and operating margins, and can we improve Atmel's execution? The answers to those questions are yes, yes and yes. We have grown Atmel's business. We have dramatically improved Atmel's gross and operating margins, and we are improving the executions. And when I say we, it does not mean we at classic Microchip. We, means the new Microchip that includes all the worldwide employees of Atmel that are doing a great job improving the financial results of Atmel.
So now let us go into the non-GAAP guidance for the December quarter. We expect total net sales to be sequentially flat-to-down 6%. We expect gross margin to be between 56.6% and 57.2%. We expect overall operating expenses from continuing operations to be between 26.5% and 27% of sales. We expect operating profit percentage to be between 29.6% and 30.7% of sales. And we expect earnings per share to be between $0.85 and $0.95 per share. The earnings per share guidance include an accretion from Atmel of between $0.13 and $0.17 per share.
Last quarter, we increased the fiscal year '17 accretion target from Atmel from $0.25 at the deal announcement to $0.40. We are again increasing the accretion target from Atmel from $0.40 to $0.50 per share for fiscal year '17. We have also assessed whether the upside in accretion from Atmel is pulling up long-term accretion or upside. As I said last quarter, there is some of both, so let me catch up the math for everyone.
Our original accretion target for fiscal year '17, '18 and '19 was $0.33, $0.66 and $0.90, respectively, all with full stock buyback of shares issued in the Atmel transaction. This is the target we gave you at deal announcement for fiscal year '17, '18 and '19 to be $0.33, $0.66 and $0.90, respectively, all with full stock buyback of shares issued in the transaction. Now after we decided not to buy the stock back, the accretion math took the accretion to $0.25, $0.53 and $0.75 for fiscal year '17, '18 and '19, respectively. Now we believe that the opportunity for stock buyback when the stock was under $40 has now passed. So we are not going to buy the stock back and instead, create the balance sheet for a future acquisition. So our reference point for accretion for fiscal year '17, '18, '19 is $0.25, $0.53 and $0.75 without any stock buyback. So once again, our reference point for accretion for fiscal year '17, '18 and '19 is $0.25, $0.53 and $0.75 without any stock buyback.
So now our new accretion target. For fiscal year '17, without any stock buyback I already gave you, is $0.50, which is up from $0.25 originally, almost a full year ahead of schedule. The new accretion target for fiscal year '18 goes from $0.53 originally to $0.70 now. And for fiscal year '19, the accretion target goes from original $0.75 to $0.90 now. In fact, our new accretion targets are now at or above our original target when we assumed buying back stock. For fiscal year '17, our new accretion target is 100% higher than our initial estimate, excluding stock buyback, and 50% higher than our initial estimate, including the stock buyback. This is all a testament to how well the Microchip team has executed the Atmel integration in the first 7 months since the close of the transaction.
On Micrel's side, the integration is complete. The fab will close at the end of next week. The last of wafers are coming through the fab as we speak. A large number of fab employees have already been let go. After closing the Micrel fab, we saved approximately $26 million in annual wafer cost, which will find its way into the profit and loss statement over the coming quarters as we ship more and more 8-inch wafers and deplete the 6-inch inventory. After we close the fab, the final operating profit margin model for Micrel will meet or exceed our long-term target of 33%.
We also announced last week the result of the sale process for the mobile touch business unit. We sold the business unit in a cross-border transaction, consisting of an asset purchase, an IP license agreement, a sales agreement for the inventory of mobile touch business unit and a transition services agreement. We expect this deal to close later this week.
Finally, with the success we have seen so far with Atmel and Microchip and with great results on the core Microchip business, we now expect that we will achieve our long-term financial model at the end of fiscal year '18 versus 3 to 4 years that was embedded in our forecast when we announced the Atmel deal. To remind everyone, that financial model is 59% gross margin, 26% operating expense and 33% in operating margins.

We have done this traditionally with Microchip microcontroller products where there's a large amount of analog that goes around it and to the best of our ability, we try to capture that attach. But getting all these Atmel microcontroller business gives us new fresh opportunity to identify all the analog attach opportunity around it. And our sales force is identifying opportunities, we're adding them to the funnel. In many cases, they are substitute products. In many cases, they are design-in products, which will take a year or so to go to production. But in the coming quarters, you will see significant impact from analog attach to the Atmel products."

So we're not going to do anything. There were Street expectations that we're going to shut down that fab. We never said that, and we don't know where that came from. But we're not shutting down Atmel's 6-inch Colorado fab. It's a very, very nice fab. Now when you look at the back end, Atmel did majority of the assembly and test all at the subcontractors. They did no assembly themselves, and 90% of the test was outside. They only did some wafer probe in the Philippines. If you compare that to Microchip, we do all of our wafer probe and about 60%, 70% of our assembly, and about 90%-plus of our test ourselves. So that's where we see some opportunities where as we compare the assembly and test cost structure, Microchip's testing technology, assembly technology is a lot lower cost than some of it that Atmel is using. And we have put plans together, and some of the lead products are already getting qualified and would be in production next quarter where we're going to be shipping many of these products through Microchip's back end at much lower cost than they currently are. We have not given any guidance on what the impact of all that would be in the coming years, and I think as we get further down, we'll give you more update on that."

Because parts get built in Asia, so whatever is being built, equipment -- an equipment gets built by the end of September and gets on ships for a 6 weeks journey to U.S. over the ocean and arrives here in time for Thanksgiving when the stores are then full of merchandise. That used to be the case. Increasingly, in the last 5 years-plus, what we have seen is the Christmas build is later and later and later. Nobody rushes to build it in September anymore. Parts get built all the time in October and November, a lot of it gets shipped by air rather than getting shipped by sea. And even the heavy items sometimes get shipped by the sea, and they arrive in November and December. And many times, there are IOUs were certain product is not available before Christmas and you put an IOU under the Christmas tree and then you take delivery in January. A lot of the gift card giving has driven that also where people kind of get gift cards and then they're actually buying the merchandise in January.

They asked us the same question when Renesas was forming with NEC Hitachi and Mitsubishi. And now we're getting the same question with NXP. And I think microcontroller market remains competitive. There are a number of players. We compete with Renesas, NXP, STMicro, Microchip and others, some smaller players. The market remains wide range and competitive, and QUALCOMM purchasing NXPI will not really change anything because QUALCOMM was not a microcontroller supplier. So the same product line that NXP had will continue, and we're not seeing any change now. Although the close of the acquisition is about 1 year away, we're not expecting to see any change coming out of that."

I think there have companies acquired in the last year, especially Altera, NXP, Freescale, that we would not have -- and Linear, we would not have expected those mergers to happen. So if of those can happen, I'm sure there'll be more mergers. But what we are not seeing is that these mergers are changing competitive landscape in any way. The players -- companies are getting larger, and we're getting larger ourselves and have a much, much larger product portfolio -- full product portfolio across many dimensions, for automotive, industrial, computing, IoT, so on and so forth. So we are a formidable competitor ourselves today. But NXPI and QUALCOMM merging together doesn't make NXPI anymore scarier or not scary. NXPI and Freescale merging together didn't change anything."

So since then, we have seen a substantial desire on the part of distribution to bond with Microchip. And our combined product line is formidable, Microchip and Atmel combined, so we're getting a lot of that focus and it will have the usual lead time of design-in, which is 1.5 years or so in this business. Although there are always some shorter-term opportunities where either the product was designed on both sides or a customer has the option to build the Model A versus Model B, and Model A was designed with that company, Model B is designed with us.

The yield has been good. We were up sequentially in the March quarter, June quarter, September quarter. So in inventory, we just reported as 103 days of inventory, which is kind of not high by any standards, it's kind of lower by any standards we gave you before, which was more in the 115 days range. And then the Atmel inventory when we bought them, which was very, very high inventory and over the last year, 7, 8 months, we have brought Atmel inventory down significantly where it's almost corrected, not across the board but there are places where it's really pretty much corrected. So over the next quarter or so, I think you could see basically wafer starts going up in all 3 fabs possibly. And that's really what you're asking. And when that starts to happen, then you have wind on the back.

During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statement regarding future event or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our second quarter fiscal 2017 financial performance and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on the integration activities associated with the Atmel acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP to non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the September quarter were a record $873.8 million. They were well above the high end of our guidance and were [indiscernible] sequentially from net sales of $844 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Non-GAAP net sales were $2.5 million higher than GAAP net sales as we are reporting non-GAAP net sales on a full sell-through revenue recognition basis while GAAP recognizes the Atmel Asia distribution network as having sell-in revenue recognition.
Our non-GAAP results are being presented on a full sell-through basis to provide investors with a better view of the true end market demand for our products. We will start recognizing revenue on a sell-through basis for the Atmel Asia distributors effective October 1. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference.
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 57.2% in the September quarter and significantly above the high end of our guidance, which was 56.2%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 26.7% of sales, significantly below the bottom end of our guidance range of 27.2% and non-GAAP operating income was 30.5%, well above the high-end of our guidance of 29%.
Non-GAAP net income was a record $219.6 million, resulting in record earnings per diluted share of $0.94, which was $0.05 higher than the high-end of our guidance of $0.89, up 11.6% on a sequential basis and up 42.6% as compared to the same quarter last year.
On a GAAP basis, net sales were $871.4 million and gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 47.1% in the September quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $4.1 million of share based compensation, $1.5 million of gross margin impact from the distributor revenue adjustments I mentioned earlier, and $84.3 million in acquired inventory valuation costs.
Total operating expenses were $347.9 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $80.4 million, share-based compensation of $20.3 million, $4.1 million of acquisition-related and other costs and special charges of $9.5 million. With all the purchase accounting adjustments, the Atmel acquisition-related charges and the related tax impacts, GAAP net income from continuing operations was $35.6 million or $0.15 per diluted share.
In the September quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 9.1% and the GAAP tax rate was negative 40.9%. We expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 8.5% and 9.5%.
Share-based compensation for Microchip in the June 2016 quarter was extraordinarily high at $59.6 million related to the restructuring we had with the Atmel acquisition. The share-based compensation came down significantly in the September quarter to $24.4 million, and we expect the share-based compensation to be about $23 million in the December quarter, which is more indicative of the ongoing run rate for these expenses.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our inventory balance at September 30, 2016, was $424.7 million and all of the fair value markup on the Atmel inventory as required by GAAP purchase accounting is now off of the balance sheet. There is still $12 million of fair value markup relating to Atmel sitting in the distribution inventory balance at the end of September. Excluding the purchase accounting adjustments, Microchip had 103 days of inventory at September 30, 2016, down 4 days from the end of the June quarter. Excluding first accounting adjustments, inventory at our distributors was at 31 days, which is down from the June quarter level of 32 days.
The cash generation in the September quarter, excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit, was a record $211.2 million. As of September 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $490.8 million. Our borrowings under our revolving line of credit as of September 30, were $1.678 billion and will result in a 25 basis point reduction on our borrowing rate once we file our September quarter 10-Q later this week.
Excluding dividend payments, changes in borrowing levels and our acquisition-related activities, we expect our total cash generation to be approximately $170 million to $200 million in the December quarter.
We continue to make good progress on our leverage with our net debt-to-EBITDA ending the September quarter at 2.91. This is down from 3.22 at the end of the June quarter and better than our projection we had shared with The Street last quarter of 3.02. We expect our net debt-to-EBITDA to be about 2.35 by the end of fiscal year 2017.
Capital spending was approximately $18.2 million in the September quarter. We expect about $30 million in capital spending in the December quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 to be about $110 million. We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $30 million.
For several years prior to fiscal 2016, Microchip's dividends paid to its shareholders had been treated as return of capital as Microchip did not have earnings and profits in the United States. In fiscal 2016, about 60% were treated as taxable dividends and about 40% were treated as return of capital. In fiscal 2017, we expect our dividends paid to shareholders to be treated as return of capital. Please note that the first quarter of calendar year 2016 will have approximately the same 60% taxable dividend and 40% return of capital split as of fiscal 2016 dividends. We will continue to keep investors updated if anything changes on our expectations of the dividend treatment as we progress throughout the year.
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter. Ganesh?"

Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers.Our microcontroller business in the September quarter was up 3% sequentially as compared to the June",960,"Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers.
Our microcontroller business in the September quarter was up 3% sequentially as compared to the June quarter, setting a new record in the process. Our microcontroller business, excluding Atmel, as well as Atmel's microcontroller business, were each up nicely in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter as we continue to experience broad-based growth in our business. In addition, each of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller businesses were up sequentially and achieved new records for revenue.
Even as we grow our 16-bit and 32-bit business in leaps and bounds, Microchip's overall 8-bit microcontroller business as well as Microchip's 8-bit microcontroller business, excluding Atmel, achieved new records for revenue in the September quarter. Once again demonstrating the resilience and consistency of this business. We believe that reports of the death of the 8-bit microcontroller market are greatly exaggerated and limited only by the imagination and willingness to offer innovative new solutions.
During the quarter, Atmel's customers continued to feel reassured about Microchip's microcontroller road maps going forward, exemplified by the introduction of the first new AVR microcontrollers and SAM 32 microcontrollers on Microchip's watch. As a result, we are seeing continued growth in our design-in funnel and expect us to drive future growth as these designs progress into production over time.
In regards to the microcontroller business unit's integration, we had already made significant progress in the June quarter and largely completed the remaining integration efforts in the September quarter. The wireless business restructuring, which was still a work in progress, at the end of June, has progressed significantly since then and will be completed by the end of December. This business was running at a large loss and required significant and rapid surgery to combine road maps, reduce redundant spending and rationalize priorities.
The Touch and Gesture business focused on automotive, industrial and commercial markets took further shape in the September quarter, and we are driving our opportunities with a stronger set of customers and channel relationships as well as a stronger combined sales team. Steve will give you an update a little later on the sale of the mobile touch business, which did not fit our business goals that we had been marketing for sale to interested buyers.
We implemented Microchip's disciplined pricing process to ensure that not only are we being competitive, but that we are also getting -- appropriately rewarded for providing innovative solutions that enable our clients to successfully achieve their business goals. The benefits of the pricing changes we made were partially seen in the September quarter and will have some residual benefit in future quarters.
Finally, microcontrollers at over $2.2 billion in annualized revenue represented 63.4% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. We remain pleased with the performance and competitiveness of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the broad-based market, which have been augmented by the addition of Atmel's portfolio. We continue to gain market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we further build the best performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.
Moving now to our analog products. Our analog business was up 4.7% sequentially in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter, and also set a new record. At approximately $900 million in annualized revenue, our analog business represented 25.7% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. During the quarter, we continued an active effort to find opportunities to attach Microchip's vast portfolio of analog products to Atmel microcontrollers at customers and applications that we otherwise did not have visibility into. This effort is progressing well and will pay dividends over time as new design wins go to production. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear mixed-signal, power, interface, timing and security products to fuel the future growth of our analog business as we march relentlessly towards making analog a greater than $1 billion revenue business for Microchip.
Moving to our memory products. Our combined Microchip and Atmel memory businesses were down 2% in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter. In this business too, we implemented Microchip's disciplined pricing process to the Atmel business to ensure that while we are competitive, we are not chasing bad business in the pursuit of profitless prosperity.
Summarizing some of the other Atmel integration elements. Our sales integration is progressing well with extensive cross-training of our direct sales teams as well as our channel partner sales teams. Microchip's major channel partners are now franchised to carry Atmel products, and most Atmel channel partners are franchised to carry Microchip products. Between training and enabling our channel partners, we won't leave no stone unturned as we work to ensure that we maximize the cross-selling of products with new custom design activity.
We are in the midst of planning for and testing to integrate our business systems and expect to go live on the Microchip systems on January 1, 2017. This is the largest and most complex acquisition we have done, and we are taking extra time to ensure we thoroughly test the changes before we go live.
All in all, the second quarter of integrating Atmel has progressed on or ahead of our plans. Our thanks go out to the many employees across the globe who have gone above and beyond to contribute to the rapid integration and help deliver synergy results that are well ahead of forecast.
Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, our guidance going forward and more about the Atmel integration. Steve?"

Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal second quarter of 2017 and then provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2017. I will also make comments on the progress of integration for Micrel and make extensive comments on Atmel.
Our September quarter financial results were extremely strong. Our non-GAAP net sales, gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage were all better than the high end of our guidance, while our non-GAAP operating expenses were less than the low-end of our guidance. Additionally, our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.07 per share better than the midpoint of our guidance and up 11.6% sequentially and up 42.6% from the September quarter of a year ago, due to improved gross margin percentage, operating expense leverage and accretion from both Micrel and Atmel.
We achieved record results from our core business and sequentially grew both in our core business at Microchip as well as from Atmel. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip, including acquired employees from Micrel and Atmel worldwide, for delivering a record quarter in every respect. This was also our 104th consecutive profitable quarter.
In the last quarter's conference call, we shared with you our first 100-day assessment of Atmel, its products and its operations. Now with 200-plus days behind us, I would update you on what we have done to correct Atmel's weaknesses in order of priority.  Number one, lack of pricing discipline. We have completely turned the situation around. There are no low-price, low-margin quotes being given anywhere in the world. It seems that Atmel's prices were well below their market prices and there was an air gap between the Atmel selling price and the market price. Our price increases, while painful for some customers, are largely filling the air gap as we bring prices closer to the market price. Most of the products are proprietary and therefore, we would not be concerned about losing business.
On the distribution front, we got a lucky break as one of our largest competitor has changed their distribution program where they will be using distribution only for fulfillment and are terminating their registration program, under which their distribution earned higher margin for demand creation. This is having a very positive effect on Microchip as the distribution sees a very strong portfolio from the combined Microchip and Atmel franchises and is increasing their commitment for demand creation for Microchip.
Number two, high operating expense culture. Atmel had a culture of high operating expenses, which routinely ran over 40% of sales. In the September quarter, Atmel's operating expense was below 28% of sales and many of the expense reductions done were not for the entire quarter. So you will see the operating expenses continue to drop.
Number three, swinging for home runs and getting large customers at low margins. This has now been corrected as we are aligning many of Atmel's sales focus consistent with that of Microchip.
Number four, accountability. I said at the last conference call that Atmel had a culture of poor accountability. With a broad-based implementation of Microchip type of bonus plans, which are based on overall company growth and profitability, we are rapidly changing that culture. In our presentations at Atmel, our communications with them and classes at Atmel, we are teaching that at Microchip, management is accountable.
Number five, poor teamwork. Atmel did not have a culture of teamwork. Bonus and equity grants were very large at the top at Atmel and less than 30% of the employees had bonus and equity. At Microchip, 100% of our employees are on a bonus program, and nearly 100% of our non-Thailand labor employees are on equity program. Rather than large equity grants at the top, Microchip spreads equity throughout the organization so that they share in the responsibility and rewards of having a stake in the company. We have also implemented Microchip's style of quarterly business unit reviews. With the entire company on a Microchip type of common incentive program that values sales growth, gross margin, operating expense and operating profit and with our manager's role modeling the culture of accountability and teamwork, we believe that we are turning the situation around rapidly.
Number six, Atmel made no investment in training and development of employees. In a short 6 months, over 2,200 Atmel employees or over 2/3 of the employee base have gone through at least 1 training class at Microchip. We are putting Atmel's sales and field applications engineers through a 2-week extensive training that we call Boot Camp, in which, we train the employees on Microchip's client engagement process, our values, our culture and align them with our goals and reward system. With no training for more than a decade at Atmel, we have much work to do. But rapid changes are taking place and employees are bonding to the superior systems at Microchip and the results are starting to improve.
Now let us continue with the deciphering of financial results of Microchip from the fiscal second quarter. While we will refrain from providing a line-by-line breakdown of our results between core Microchip and Atmel, we will provide some useful nuggets of information on Atmel as well as Microchip. So here are those nuggets. We achieved all-time record net sales in our core Microchip business and the gross margins and operating margins in the core business were both stellar and sequentially up from the June quarter.
Now on Atmel, probably one of the best accomplishments is that gross margin on Atmel improved dramatically by approximately 400 basis points sequentially and was the highest gross margin achieved at Atmel in over 5 years. There are a lot of moving parts, but price is a big one. Price increases, the new price book, changing worldwide prices to U.S. dollars and pegging it back to when the contracts were done in protecting Microchip from a large euro and pound depreciation against the dollar were significant items. Beyond that, there was a very favorable mix also with higher growth in MCUs than the memory business, and there are plenty of cost reductions mixed in.
Regarding Atmel's operating expense, I mentioned earlier that Atmel's operating expense in March quarter was over 40% of net sales. Atmel's operating expense in September quarter was below 28% of net sales. With the combined effect of better-than-expected net sales, substantially higher gross margin percentage and substantially lower OpEx, we achieved Atmel's operating margin of over 23% of sales, which is again the highest operating margin achieved at Atmel in over 5 years. We achieved an accretion from Atmel of $0.145 per share versus our guidance of $0.09 to $0.11 per share.
By any measure, our September quarter results were stellar. Going into Atmel acquisition, the investors and analysts had 3 major concerns. They were: Can we grow Atmel's business, can we improve Atmel's gross and operating margins, and can we improve Atmel's execution? The answers to those questions are yes, yes and yes. We have grown Atmel's business. We have dramatically improved Atmel's gross and operating margins, and we are improving the executions. And when I say we, it does not mean we at classic Microchip. We means the new Microchip that includes all the worldwide employees of Atmel that are doing a great job improving the financial results of Atmel.
So now let us go into the non-GAAP guidance for the December quarter. We expect total net sales to be sequentially flat-to-down 6%. We expect gross margin to be between 56.6% and 57.2%. We expect overall operating expenses from continuing operations to be between 26.5% and 27% of sales. We expect operating profit percentage to be between 29.6% and 30.7% of sales. And we expect earnings per share to be between $0.85 and $0.95 per share. The earnings per share guidance include an accretion from Atmel of between $0.13 and $0.17 per share.
Last quarter, we increased the fiscal year '17 accretion target from Atmel from $0.25 at the deal announcement to $0.40. We are again increasing the accretion target from Atmel from $0.40 to $0.50 per share for fiscal year '17. We have also assessed whether the upside in accretion from Atmel is pulling up long-term accretion or upside. As I said last quarter, there is some of both, so let me catch up the math for everyone.
Our original accretion target for fiscal year '17, '18 and '19 was $0.33, $0.66 and $0.90, respectively, all with full stock buyback of shares issued in the Atmel transaction. This is the target we gave you at deal announcement for fiscal year '17, '18 and '19 to be $0.33, $0.66 and $0.90, respectively, all with full stock buyback of shares issued in the transaction. Now after we decided not to buy the stock back, the accretion math took the accretion to $0.25, $0.53 and $0.75 for fiscal year '17, '18 and '19, respectively. Now we believe that the opportunity for stock buyback when the stock was under $40 has now passed. So we are not going to buy the stock back and instead, create the balance sheet for a future acquisition. So our reference point for accretion for fiscal year '17, '18, '19 is $0.25, $0.53 and $0.75 without any stock buyback. So once again, our reference point for accretion for fiscal year '17, '18 and '19 is $0.25, $0.53 and $0.75 without any stock buyback.
So now our new accretion target. For fiscal year '17, without any stock buyback I already gave you, is $0.50, which is up from $0.25 originally, almost a full year ahead of schedule. The new accretion target for fiscal year '18 goes from $0.53 originally to $0.70 now. And for fiscal year '19, the accretion target goes from original $0.75 to $0.90 now. In fact, our new accretion targets are now at or above our original target when we assumed buying back stock. For fiscal year '17, our new accretion target is 100% higher than our initial estimate, excluding stock buyback, and 50% higher than our initial estimate, including the stock buyback. This is all a testament to how well the Microchip team has executed the Atmel integration in the first 7 months since the close of the transaction.
On Micrel's side, the integration is complete. The fab will close at the end of next week. The last of wafers are coming through the fab as we speak. A large number of fab employees have already been let go. After closing the Micrel fab, we saved approximately $26 million in annual wafer cost, which will find its way into the profit and loss statement over the coming quarters as we ship more and more 8-inch wafers and deplete the 6-inch inventory. After we close the fab, the final operating profit margin model for Micrel will meet or exceed our long-term target of 33%.
We also announced last week the result of the sale process for the mobile touch business unit. We sold the business unit in a cross-border transaction, consisting of an asset purchase, an IP license agreement, a sales agreement for the inventory of mobile touch business unit and a transition services agreement. We expect this deal to close later this week.
Finally, with the success we have seen so far with Atmel and Microchip and with great results on the core Microchip business, we now expect that we will achieve our long-term financial model at the end of fiscal year '18 versus 3 to 4 years that was embedded in our forecast when we announced the Atmel deal. To remind everyone, that financial model is 59% gross margin, 26% operating expense and 33% in operating margins.

So we're not going to do anything. There were Street expectations that we're going to shut down that fab. We never said that, and we don't know where that came from. But we're not shutting down Atmel's 6-inch Colorado fab. It's a very, very nice fab. Now when you look at the back end, Atmel did majority of the assembly and test all at the subcontractors. They did no assembly themselves, and 90% of the test was outside. They only did some wafer probe in the Philippines. If you compare that to Microchip, we do all of our wafer probe and about 60%, 70% of our assembly, and about 90%-plus of our test ourselves. So that's where we see some opportunities where as we compare the assembly and test cost structure, Microchip's testing technology, assembly technology is a lot lower cost than some of it that Atmel is using. And we have put plans together, and some of the lead products are already getting qualified and would be in production next quarter where we're going to be shipping many of these products through Microchip's back end at much lower cost than they currently are.

Because parts get built in Asia, so whatever is being built, equipment -- an equipment gets built by the end of September and gets on ships for a 6 weeks journey to U.S. over the ocean and arrives here in time for Thanksgiving when the stores are then full of merchandise. That used to be the case. Increasingly, in the last 5 years-plus, what we have seen is the Christmas build is later and later and later. Nobody rushes to build it in September anymore. Parts get built all the time in October and November, a lot of it gets shipped by air rather than getting shipped by sea. And even the heavy items sometimes get shipped by the sea, and they arrive in November and December. And many times, there are IOUs were certain product is not available before Christmas and you put an IOU under the Christmas tree and then you take delivery in January. A lot of the gift card giving has driven that also where people kind of get gift cards and then they're actually buying the merchandise in January.

And our combined product line is formidable, Microchip and Atmel combined, so we're getting a lot of that focus and it will have the usual lead time of design-in, which is 1.5 years or so in this business. Although there are always some shorter-term opportunities where either the product was designed on both sides or a customer has the option to build the Model A versus Model B, and Model A was designed with that company, Model B is designed with us.

The yield has been good. We were up sequentially in the March quarter, June quarter, September quarter. So in inventory, we just reported as 103 days of inventory, which is kind of not high by any standards, it's kind of lower by any standards we gave you before, which was more in the 115 days range. And then the Atmel inventory when we bought them, which was very, very high inventory and over the last year, 7, 8 months, we have brought Atmel inventory down significantly where it's almost corrected, not across the board but there are places where it's really pretty much corrected. So over the next quarter or so, I think you could see basically wafer starts going up in all 3 fabs possibly. And that's really what you're asking. And when that starts to happen, then you have wind on the back. Now when you increase the wafer starts, the wafer cost comes down but first, it goes into inventory, first in, first out, and its real impact on gross margin is a couple of quarters later when you ship that product. Does that make sense?"

During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statement regarding future event or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press releases of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our second quarter fiscal 2017 financial performance and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance and provide an update on the integration activities associated with the Atmel acquisition. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP to non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis, prior to the effects of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the September quarter were a record $873.8 million. They were well above the high end of our guidance and were [indiscernible] sequentially from net sales of $844 million in the immediately preceding quarter. Non-GAAP net sales were $2.5 million higher than GAAP net sales as we are reporting non-GAAP net sales on a full sell-through revenue recognition basis while GAAP recognizes the Atmel Asia distribution network as having sell-in revenue recognition.
Our non-GAAP results are being presented on a full sell-through basis to provide investors with a better view of the true end market demand for our products. We will start recognizing revenue on a sell-through basis for the Atmel Asia distributors effective October 1. We have posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference.
On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 57.2% in the September quarter and significantly above the high end of our guidance, which was 56.2%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 26.7% of sales, significantly below the bottom end of our guidance range of 27.2% and non-GAAP operating income was 30.5%, well above the high-end of our guidance of 29%.
Non-GAAP net income was a record $219.6 million, resulting in record earnings per diluted share of $0.94, which was $0.05 higher than the high-end of our guidance of $0.89, up 11.6% on a sequential basis and up 42.6% as compared to the same quarter last year.
On a GAAP basis, net sales were $871.4 million and gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 47.1% in the September quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $4.1 million of share based compensation, $1.5 million of gross margin impact from the distributor revenue adjustments I mentioned earlier, and $84.3 million in acquired inventory valuation costs.
Total operating expenses were $347.9 million and include acquisition intangible amortization of $80.4 million, share-based compensation of $20.3 million, $4.1 million of acquisition-related and other costs and special charges of $9.5 million. With all the purchase accounting adjustments, the Atmel acquisition-related charges and the related tax impacts, GAAP net income from continuing operations was $35.6 million or $0.15 per diluted share.
In the September quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 9.1% and the GAAP tax rate was negative 40.9%. We expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 8.5% and 9.5%.
Share-based compensation for Microchip in the June 2016 quarter was extraordinarily high at $59.6 million related to the restructuring we had with the Atmel acquisition. The share-based compensation came down significantly in the September quarter to $24.4 million, and we expect the share-based compensation to be about $23 million in the December quarter, which is more indicative of the ongoing run rate for these expenses.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our inventory balance at September 30, 2016, was $424.7 million and all of the fair value markup on the Atmel inventory as required by GAAP purchase accounting is now off of the balance sheet. There is still $12 million of fair value markup relating to Atmel sitting in the distribution inventory balance at the end of September. Excluding the purchase accounting adjustments, Microchip had 103 days of inventory at September 30, 2016, down 4 days from the end of the June quarter. Excluding first accounting adjustments, inventory at our distributors was at 31 days, which is down from the June quarter level of 32 days.
The cash generation in the September quarter, excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit, was a record $211.2 million. As of September 30, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $490.8 million. Our borrowings under our revolving line of credit as of September 30, were $1.678 billion and will result in a 25 basis point reduction on our borrowing rate once we file our September quarter 10-Q later this week.
Excluding dividend payments, changes in borrowing levels and our acquisition-related activities, we expect our total cash generation to be approximately $170 million to $200 million in the December quarter.
We continue to make good progress on our leverage with our net debt-to-EBITDA ending the September quarter at 2.91. This is down from 3.22 at the end of the June quarter and better than our projection we had shared with The Street last quarter of 3.02. We expect our net debt-to-EBITDA to be about 2.35 by the end of fiscal year 2017.
Capital spending was approximately $18.2 million in the September quarter. We expect about $30 million in capital spending in the December quarter and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 to be about $110 million. We are selectively adding capital to support the growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. Depreciation expense in the September quarter was $30 million.
For several years prior to fiscal 2016, Microchip's dividends paid to its shareholders had been treated as return of capital as Microchip did not have earnings and profits in the United States. In fiscal 2016, about 60% were treated as taxable dividends and about 40% were treated as return of capital. In fiscal 2017, we expect our dividends paid to shareholders to be treated as return of capital. Please note that the first quarter of calendar year 2016 will have approximately the same 60% taxable dividend and 40% return of capital split as of fiscal 2016 dividends. We will continue to keep investors updated if anything changes on our expectations of the dividend treatment as we progress throughout the year.
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the September quarter. Ganesh?"

Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers.Our microcontroller business in the September quarter was up 3% sequentially as compared to the June",960,"Thank you, Eric, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers.
Our microcontroller business in the September quarter was up 3% sequentially as compared to the June quarter, setting a new record in the process. Our microcontroller business, excluding Atmel, as well as Atmel's microcontroller business, were each up nicely in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter as we continue to experience broad-based growth in our business. In addition, each of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller businesses were up sequentially and achieved new records for revenue.
Even as we grow our 16-bit and 32-bit business in leaps and bounds, Microchip's overall 8-bit microcontroller business as well as Microchip's 8-bit microcontroller business, excluding Atmel, achieved new records for revenue in the September quarter. Once again demonstrating the resilience and consistency of this business. We believe that reports of the death of the 8-bit microcontroller market are greatly exaggerated and limited only by the imagination and willingness to offer innovative new solutions.
During the quarter, Atmel's customers continued to feel reassured about Microchip's microcontroller road maps going forward, exemplified by the introduction of the first new AVR microcontrollers and SAM 32 microcontrollers on Microchip's watch. As a result, we are seeing continued growth in our design-in funnel and expect us to drive future growth as these designs progress into production over time.
In regards to the microcontroller business unit's integration, we had already made significant progress in the June quarter and largely completed the remaining integration efforts in the September quarter. The wireless business restructuring, which was still a work in progress, at the end of June, has progressed significantly since then and will be completed by the end of December. This business was running at a large loss and required significant and rapid surgery to combine road maps, reduce redundant spending and rationalize priorities.
The Touch and Gesture business focused on automotive, industrial and commercial markets took further shape in the September quarter, and we are driving our opportunities with a stronger set of customers and channel relationships as well as a stronger combined sales team. Steve will give you an update a little later on the sale of the mobile touch business, which did not fit our business goals that we had been marketing for sale to interested buyers.
We implemented Microchip's disciplined pricing process to ensure that not only are we being competitive, but that we are also getting -- appropriately rewarded for providing innovative solutions that enable our clients to successfully achieve their business goals. The benefits of the pricing changes we made were partially seen in the September quarter and will have some residual benefit in future quarters.
Finally, microcontrollers at over $2.2 billion in annualized revenue represented 63.4% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. We remain pleased with the performance and competitiveness of our 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers in the broad-based market, which have been augmented by the addition of Atmel's portfolio. We continue to gain market share and have the new product momentum and customer engagement to continue to gain even more share as we further build the best performing microcontroller franchise in the industry.
Moving now to our analog products. Our analog business was up 4.7% sequentially in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter, and also set a new record. At approximately $900 million in annualized revenue, our analog business represented 25.7% of Microchip's overall revenue in the September quarter. During the quarter, we continued an active effort to find opportunities to attach Microchip's vast portfolio of analog products to Atmel microcontrollers at customers and applications that we otherwise did not have visibility into. This effort is progressing well and will pay dividends over time as new design wins go to production. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new linear mixed-signal, power, interface, timing and security products to fuel the future growth of our analog business as we march relentlessly towards making analog a greater than $1 billion revenue business for Microchip.
Moving to our memory products. Our combined Microchip and Atmel memory businesses were down 2% in the September quarter as compared to the June quarter. In this business too, we implemented Microchip's disciplined pricing process to the Atmel business to ensure that while we are competitive, we are not chasing bad business in the pursuit of profitless prosperity.
Summarizing some of the other Atmel integration elements. Our sales integration is progressing well with extensive cross-training of our direct sales teams as well as our channel partner sales teams. Microchip's major channel partners are now franchised to carry Atmel products, and most Atmel channel partners are franchised to carry Microchip products. Between training and enabling our channel partners, we won't leave no stone unturned as we work to ensure that we maximize the cross-selling of products with new custom design activity.
We are in the midst of planning for and testing to integrate our business systems and expect to go live on the Microchip systems on January 1, 2017. This is the largest and most complex acquisition we have done, and we are taking extra time to ensure we thoroughly test the changes before we go live.
All in all, the second quarter of integrating Atmel has progressed on or ahead of our plans. Our thanks go out to the many employees across the globe who have gone above and beyond to contribute to the rapid integration and help deliver synergy results that are well ahead of forecast.
Let me now pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business, our guidance going forward and more about the Atmel integration. Steve?"

Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal second quarter of 2017 and then provide guidance for the fiscal third quarter of 2017. I will also make comments on the progress of integration for Micrel and make extensive comments on Atmel.
Our September quarter financial results were extremely strong. Our non-GAAP net sales, gross margin percentage, operating profit percentage were all better than the high end of our guidance, while our non-GAAP operating expenses were less than the low-end of our guidance. Additionally, our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.07 per share better than the midpoint of our guidance and up 11.6% sequentially and up 42.6% from the September quarter of a year ago, due to improved gross margin percentage, operating expense leverage and accretion from both Micrel and Atmel.
We achieved record results from our core business and sequentially grew both in our core business at Microchip as well as from Atmel. I want to thank all the employees of Microchip, including acquired employees from Micrel and Atmel worldwide, for delivering a record quarter in every respect. This was also our 104th consecutive profitable quarter.
In the last quarter's conference call, we shared with you our first 100-day assessment of Atmel, its products and its operations. Now with 200-plus days behind us, I would update you on what we have done to correct Atmel's weaknesses in order of priority.  Number one, lack of pricing discipline. We have completely turned the situation around. There are no low-price, low-margin quotes being given anywhere in the world. It seems that Atmel's prices were well below their market prices and there was an air gap between the Atmel selling price and the market price. Our price increases, while painful for some customers, are largely filling the air gap as we bring prices closer to the market price. Most of the products are proprietary and therefore, we would not be concerned about losing business.
On the distribution front, we got a lucky break as one of our largest competitor has changed their distribution program where they will be using distribution only for fulfillment and are terminating their registration program, under which their distribution earned higher margin for demand creation. This is having a very positive effect on Microchip as the distribution sees a very strong portfolio from the combined Microchip and Atmel franchises and is increasing their commitment for demand creation for Microchip.
Number two, high operating expense culture. Atmel had a culture of high operating expenses, which routinely ran over 40% of sales. In the September quarter, Atmel's operating expense was below 28% of sales and many of the expense reductions done were not for the entire quarter. So you will see the operating expenses continue to drop.
Number three, swinging for home runs and getting large customers at low margins. This has now been corrected as we are aligning many of Atmel's sales focus consistent with that of Microchip.
Number four, accountability. I said at the last conference call that Atmel had a culture of poor accountability. With a broad-based implementation of Microchip type of bonus plans, which are based on overall company growth and profitability, we are rapidly changing that culture. In our presentations at Atmel, our communications with them and classes at Atmel, we are teaching that at Microchip, management is accountable.
Number five, poor teamwork. Atmel did not have a culture of teamwork. Bonus and equity grants were very large at the top at Atmel and less than 30% of the employees had bonus and equity. At Microchip, 100% of our employees are on a bonus program, and nearly 100% of our non-Thailand labor employees are on equity program. Rather than large equity grants at the top, Microchip spreads equity throughout the organization so that they share in the responsibility and rewards of having a stake in the company. We have also implemented Microchip's style of quarterly business unit reviews. With the entire company on a Microchip type of common incentive program that values sales growth, gross margin, operating expense and operating profit and with our manager's role modeling the culture of accountability and teamwork, we believe that we are turning the situation around rapidly.
Number six, Atmel made no investment in training and development of employees. In a short 6 months, over 2,200 Atmel employees or over 2/3 of the employee base have gone through at least 1 training class at Microchip. We are putting Atmel's sales and field applications engineers through a 2-week extensive training that we call Boot Camp, in which, we train the employees on Microchip's client engagement process, our values, our culture and align them with our goals and reward system. With no training for more than a decade at Atmel, we have much work to do. But rapid changes are taking place and employees are bonding to the superior systems at Microchip and the results are starting to improve.
Now let us continue with the deciphering of financial results of Microchip from the fiscal second quarter. While we will refrain from providing a line-by-line breakdown of our results between core Microchip and Atmel, we will provide some useful nuggets of information on Atmel as well as Microchip. So here are those nuggets. We achieved all-time record net sales in our core Microchip business and the gross margins and operating margins in the core business were both stellar and sequentially up from the June quarter.
Now on Atmel, probably one of the best accomplishments is that gross margin on Atmel improved dramatically by approximately 400 basis points sequentially and was the highest gross margin achieved at Atmel in over 5 years. There are a lot of moving parts, but price is a big one. Price increases, the new price book, changing worldwide prices to U.S. dollars and pegging it back to when the contracts were done in protecting Microchip from a large euro and pound depreciation against the dollar were significant items. Beyond that, there was a very favorable mix also with higher growth in MCUs than the memory business, and there are plenty of cost reductions mixed in.
Regarding Atmel's operating expense, I mentioned earlier that Atmel's operating expense in March quarter was over 40% of net sales. Atmel's operating expense in September quarter was below 28% of net sales. With the combined effect of better-than-expected net sales, substantially higher gross margin percentage and substantially lower OpEx, we achieved Atmel's operating margin of over 23% of sales, which is again the highest operating margin achieved at Atmel in over 5 years. We achieved an accretion from Atmel of $0.145 per share versus our guidance of $0.09 to $0.11 per share.
By any measure, our September quarter results were stellar. Going into Atmel acquisition, the investors and analysts had 3 major concerns. They were: Can we grow Atmel's business, can we improve Atmel's gross and operating margins, and can we improve Atmel's execution? The answers to those questions are yes, yes and yes. We have grown Atmel's business. We have dramatically improved Atmel's gross and operating margins, and we are improving the executions. And when I say we, it does not mean we at classic Microchip. We means the new Microchip that includes all the worldwide employees of Atmel that are doing a great job improving the financial results of Atmel.
So now let us go into the non-GAAP guidance for the December quarter. We expect total net sales to be sequentially flat-to-down 6%. We expect gross margin to be between 56.6% and 57.2%. We expect overall operating expenses from continuing operations to be between 26.5% and 27% of sales. We expect operating profit percentage to be between 29.6% and 30.7% of sales. And we expect earnings per share to be between $0.85 and $0.95 per share. The earnings per share guidance include an accretion from Atmel of between $0.13 and $0.17 per share.
Last quarter, we increased the fiscal year '17 accretion target from Atmel from $0.25 at the deal announcement to $0.40. We are again increasing the accretion target from Atmel from $0.40 to $0.50 per share for fiscal year '17. We have also assessed whether the upside in accretion from Atmel is pulling up long-term accretion or upside. As I said last quarter, there is some of both, so let me catch up the math for everyone.
Our original accretion target for fiscal year '17, '18 and '19 was $0.33, $0.66 and $0.90, respectively, all with full stock buyback of shares issued in the Atmel transaction. This is the target we gave you at deal announcement for fiscal year '17, '18 and '19 to be $0.33, $0.66 and $0.90, respectively, all with full stock buyback of shares issued in the transaction. Now after we decided not to buy the stock back, the accretion math took the accretion to $0.25, $0.53 and $0.75 for fiscal year '17, '18 and '19, respectively. Now we believe that the opportunity for stock buyback when the stock was under $40 has now passed. So we are not going to buy the stock back and instead, create the balance sheet for a future acquisition. So our reference point for accretion for fiscal year '17, '18, '19 is $0.25, $0.53 and $0.75 without any stock buyback. So once again, our reference point for accretion for fiscal year '17, '18 and '19 is $0.25, $0.53 and $0.75 without any stock buyback.
So now our new accretion target. For fiscal year '17, without any stock buyback I already gave you, is $0.50, which is up from $0.25 originally, almost a full year ahead of schedule. The new accretion target for fiscal year '18 goes from $0.53 originally to $0.70 now. And for fiscal year '19, the accretion target goes from original $0.75 to $0.90 now. In fact, our new accretion targets are now at or above our original target when we assumed buying back stock. For fiscal year '17, our new accretion target is 100% higher than our initial estimate, excluding stock buyback, and 50% higher than our initial estimate, including the stock buyback. This is all a testament to how well the Microchip team has executed the Atmel integration in the first 7 months since the close of the transaction.
On Micrel's side, the integration is complete. The fab will close at the end of next week. The last of wafers are coming through the fab as we speak. A large number of fab employees have already been let go. After closing the Micrel fab, we saved approximately $26 million in annual wafer cost, which will find its way into the profit and loss statement over the coming quarters as we ship more and more 8-inch wafers and deplete the 6-inch inventory. After we close the fab, the final operating profit margin model for Micrel will meet or exceed our long-term target of 33%.
We also announced last week the result of the sale process for the mobile touch business unit. We sold the business unit in a cross-border transaction, consisting of an asset purchase, an IP license agreement, a sales agreement for the inventory of mobile touch business unit and a transition services agreement. We expect this deal to close later this week.
Finally, with the success we have seen so far with Atmel and Microchip and with great results on the core Microchip business, we now expect that we will achieve our long-term financial model at the end of fiscal year '18 versus 3 to 4 years that was embedded in our forecast when we announced the Atmel deal. To remind everyone, that financial model is 59% gross margin, 26% operating expense and 33% in operating margins.

But the 400 basis points impact on Atmel gross margin, I broke it out for you, was a result of pricing increases, setting back many of the customer contacts in U.S. dollars back to where the contract was originally done, taking away the impact of weak euro, weak pound and those kind of things. And there was a better mix on Atmel's side also. So again, lots of moving parts."

But we're not shutting down Atmel's 6-inch Colorado fab. It's a very, very nice fab. Now when you look at the back end, Atmel did majority of the assembly and test all at the subcontractors. They did no assembly themselves, and 90% of the test was outside. They only did some wafer probe in the Philippines. If you compare that to Microchip, we do all of our wafer probe and about 60%, 70% of our assembly, and about 90%-plus of our test ourselves. So that's where we see some opportunities where as we compare the assembly and test cost structure, Microchip's testing technology, assembly technology is a lot lower cost than some of it that Atmel is using. And we have put plans together, and some of the lead products are already getting qualified and would be in production next quarter where we're going to be shipping many of these products through Microchip's back end at much lower cost than they currently are.

Because parts get built in Asia, so whatever is being built, equipment -- an equipment gets built by the end of September and gets on ships for a 6 weeks journey to U.S. over the ocean and arrives here in time for Thanksgiving when the stores are then full of merchandise. That used to be the case. Increasingly, in the last 5 years-plus, what we have seen is the Christmas build is later and later and later. Nobody rushes to build it in September anymore. Parts get built all the time in October and November, a lot of it gets shipped by air rather than getting shipped by sea. And even the heavy items sometimes get shipped by the sea, and they arrive in November and December. And many times, there are IOUs were certain product is not available before Christmas and you put an IOU under the Christmas tree and then you take delivery in January. A lot of the gift card giving has driven that also where people kind of get gift cards and then they're actually buying the merchandise in January. So the entire Christmas buying, which largely used to happen prior to the end of September, is now really spread out."

And our combined product line is formidable, Microchip and Atmel combined, so we're getting a lot of that focus and it will have the usual lead time of design-in, which is 1.5 years or so in this business. Although there are always some shorter-term opportunities where either the product was designed on both sides or a customer has the option to build the Model A versus Model B, and Model A was designed with that company, Model B is designed with us.

The yield has been good. We were up sequentially in the March quarter, June quarter, September quarter. So in inventory, we just reported as 103 days of inventory, which is kind of not high by any standards, it's kind of lower by any standards we gave you before, which was more in the 115 days range. And then the Atmel inventory when we bought them, which was very, very high inventory and over the last year, 7, 8 months, we have brought Atmel inventory down significantly where it's almost corrected, not across the board but there are places where it's really pretty much corrected. So over the next quarter or so, I think you could see basically wafer starts going up in all 3 fabs possibly. And that's really what you're asking. And when that starts to happen, then you have wind on the back. Now when you increase the wafer starts, the wafer cost comes down but first, it goes into inventory, first in, first out, and its real impact on gross margin is a couple of quarters later when you ship that product. Does that make sense?"

During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company.
We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are: Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal 2016 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, provide an update on the integration activities associated with the Micrel acquisition and provide some additional commentary on our announced acquisition of Atmel. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effect of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the December quarter were above the midpoint of our guidance at $552 million and were down 1.3% sequentially from net sales of $559.4 million in the immediately preceding quarter. 
Non-GAAP net sales were $11.7 million higher than GAAP net sales, as we are reporting non-GAAP net sales on a full sell-through revenue recognition basis while GAAP does not recognize revenue on the sell-through of products sitting in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs and when distributor contracts are changed to the standard Microchip format compared to the sell-in revenue recognition contract that Micrel previously had for certain of their distribution partners.
We posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 57.9% in the December quarter and at the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 28.5% of sales, below the bottom end of our guidance range. And non-GAAP operating income was 29.5% of sales, which was above the high end of our guidance. 
Non-GAAP net income was $138.4 million, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $0.64, which was higher than our preannounced results from January 19.
On a GAAP basis, net sales were $540.3 million and gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 54.2% in the December quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $2.3 million of share-based compensation, $6.9 million of gross margin impacts from the distributor revenue adjustments I mentioned earlier, and $17.8 million in acquired inventory valuation cost and acquisition-related restructuring costs.
Total operating expenses were $216.6 million or 40.1% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $48.3 million, share-based compensation of $14.7 million, $1.5 million of acquisition-related expenses and special income of $5 million. GAAP net income was $61.2 million or $0.28 per diluted share. 
In the December quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 10%, and the GAAP tax benefit rate was 22%. The non-GAAP tax rate reflects the benefits in the December quarter for the R&D tax credit reinstatement, but we are including the benefit from R&D tax credit from previous quarters that were reinstated only in the GAAP results to make future periods more comparable. We expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 10% and 11%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at December 31, 2015, was $319.5 million and includes $11 million of fair value markup on Micrel's inventory required by GAAP purchase accounting. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, Microchip had 120 days of inventory at December 31, 2015, which is down by 5 days from the levels at the end of the September quarter. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, inventory at our distributors was at 34 days, which is down 1 day from September quarter levels. I want to remind you that historically, Microchip's distribution revenues throughout the world has been recognized on a sell-through basis.
Micrel has some distributors that historically recognize revenue on a sell-in basis. Microchip changed substantially all the contractual relationships with these distributors during the December quarter, which has resulted in sell-through revenue recognition in the future. Our non-GAAP revenue guidance provided in our release today is based on sell-through revenue recognition for the Micrel distributors for the entire March quarter in order to continue to provide investors with the view of the true end-market demand for our products.
There will be a difference in GAAP revenue recognition as the inventory in the distribution channel at the end of the conversion to sell-through accounting will not be recognized as revenue for GAAP accounting purposes.
The cash generation in the December quarter, excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit, was $172 million. As of December 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.398 billion, our borrowings under our revolving line of credit at December 31 were $1.008 billion, $288 million lower than it was on September 30, as we paid down a portion of the revolving line of credit. Excluding dividend payments, changes in borrowing levels and our acquisition activity, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $140 million to $160 million in the March quarter.
Capital spending was approximately $17.9 million in the December quarter. We expect about $28 million in capital spending in the March quarter, and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 to be about $110 million, well below our previous guidance to The Street of $125 million. We are selectively adding capital to support growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. 
Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $26.7 million.
Over the past several years, Microchip's dividend paid to the shareholders has been treated as a return of capital, as Microchip did not have earnings and profits in the United States. As indicated in last quarter's earnings call, due to the integration of Micrel into Microchip's global tax structure, Microchip will have earnings and profits in the United States in fiscal year 2016. For this transaction, Microchip brought back about $250 million of offshore cash to the U.S. and we don't anticipate paying any U.S. cash taxes on the amount as we will use net operating losses to offset the income.
As a result, a portion of Microchip's calendar year 2015 dividends are taxable to shareholders versus the return of capital treatment from the last few years. We have posted a copy of IRS Form 8937 on the Investor Relations page of our website, which indicates the split between taxable dividend and return of capital for each dividend payment made during calendar year 2015. 
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?"

It has been the journey of a lifetime to have witnessed and contributed to the growth and success of Microchip, and I look forward to continuing that journey with the Microchip team as we scale new heights and achieve new business milestones in the years to come.
Now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller revenue was down 3.5% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter, as we experienced the same broad-based weakness that the industry experienced. In calendar year 2015, our microcontroller business was down 1.4% as compared to calendar year 2014. And while we're not happy about the decline, we are confident that we're gaining market share in every microcontroller segment that we compete, in what was a difficult year for the overall industry. The official Gartner microcontroller rankings, we expect will be available in time for our next earnings conference call.
We are continuing to deliver innovative new 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers, as well as software and developed contour solutions to complement them, which we believe will enable us to grow faster than the market and gain further market share. 
As we mentioned at our January 19 conference call, the addition of Atmel's 8-bit AVR microcontroller family and 32-bit ARM microcontroller family, we expect will enhance Microchip's industry-leading 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller offerings. Microcontrollers represented 58.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. 
Moving to analog. Our analog business, which includes Micrel results, was up 4.1% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter and was up 3.6% compared to the year-ago quarter.
In calendar year 2015, our analog business was up 22.4% as compared to calendar year 2014. The strong growth and increase in market share in 2015 was the result of our organic growth efforts as well as the Micrel acquisition. Our Analog business represented 31.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter, the highest percentage of our total revenue it has ever been. To put the size of our analog business in perspective, in the December quarter, Microchip's analog business alone was almost the same size as all of Microchip was in the March quarter of 2009. And at an almost $700 million annual revenue run rate, it is emerging as one of the larger analog franchises serving the embedded control market. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products that fuel the future the growth of our analog business complemented by the products added to our portfolio through acquisition.
Now moving to the memory business. Our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory products, was down 8.3% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. 
Now let me pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?"

Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016, including comments [indiscernible] since the conference call about acquisition of A",2518,"Thank you, Ganesh. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016, including comments [indiscernible] since the conference call about acquisition of Atmel. Our December quarter results were strong amidst a very turbulent macro and semiconductor industry backdrop. The quarterly results in non-GAAP revenue, gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage and operating profit percentage were all better than the midpoint of our guidance. Additionally, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came in at $0.64, which is above the $0.62 to $0.63 upwardly revised guidance we provided in the announcement of our preliminary results on January 19, 2016.
I will now provide guidance for the March 2016 quarter. We believe that our business has stabilized and that the majority of the inventory correction is behind us. The March quarter is impacted negatively by the Chinese New Year holiday in Asia, but it is also the strongest quarter of the year for Microchip in Europe. Based on our analysis of economic and semiconductor industry conditions, as well as our own business indicators, we are guiding the March quarter non-GAAP net sales to be between flat to up 3% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 57.9% and 58.1% of sales, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 27.3% and 27.9% of sales, and we expect the non-GAAP operating profit to be between 30% and 30.8% of sales. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be $0.65 to $0.69 per share.
Now let me provide you with an update on the integration of Micrel. The integration continues to progress as planned. There were 7 main elements of integration we had defined. 5 of them are complete, which are: number one, financial and business systems consolidation; number two, consolidation of Micrel's wafer fab starts planning; number three, integration of sales force, rep and distribution network; number four, integration of product lines and R&D activities; and number five, integration of human resources systems, equity plans, 401(k), medical benefits, bonus plans, et cetera. The remaining 2 areas, which are progressing well, but are not complete yet are: number one, the closure of Micrel's San Jose fab, which is on schedule for August 2016; and number two, the integration of back-end operational systems, which also remain on schedule for August of 2016.
With this, let me now provide guidance for accretion from the acquisition of Micrel. Micrel acquisition was about $0.007 accretive in the September quarter and was $0.038 accretive in the December quarter to non-GAAP EPS.
This accretion will continue to increase and we now achieve $0.30 of EPS accretion run rate from Micrel by the end of fiscal year 2017. This is up from $0.25 accretion target that we provided in the prior conference calls. These numbers depend upon the speed of integration efforts and the health of the underlying economy in general.
Now some update about Atmel. I have visited Atmel's headquarter location in San Jose and fab location in Colorado Springs and held all employee communication meetings and one-on-one meetings with the executive. Ganesh and I had headed to Europe in mid-February to visit Atmel's European locations in France, Germany, Norway and the U.K. We completed the U.S. antitrust filing last week, and the filings in Germany and Korea are scheduled for next week. We are also targeting the S-4 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in about a week. We continue to expect to close this transaction in the second calendar quarter of 2016.
Since the announcement of the Atmel transaction in our conference call on January 19, most of the feedback from investors and analysts have been very positive, that the deal makes sense. However, there are also areas where either we were not sufficiently clear or investors have further question. We would like to provide more clarification regarding these concerns today. The general view that we have heard is that the current slow growth environment -- that in the current slow growth environment, investors like the self-help stories that can continue to generate growth despite the challenging macro environment. We have recently shared with investors Microchip's organic and total growth in the last 6 years. To repeat just 1 metric, from calendar year 2009 to calendar year 2015, Microchip's organic compounded annual growth rate has been 8.3% per year and the total compounded annual growth, including acquisitions, had been 17.3% per year. 
Investors have commented that our management team has the best chance of turning around Atmel and making them successful. Now let us go into some of the concerns that investors and analysts have raised.
First is leverage. Investors have raised the concern that the Atmel acquisition increases Microchip's debt-to-EBITDA leverage quite a bit and, understandably, have questions about the cash cushion and potential risk to the dividend. We have said in the conference call that after the stock buyback, our senior debt-to-EBITDA leverage will be 2.7 and our total leverage will be 4.5. We would like to point out that these numbers are before synergies. Once you factor in synergies, consistent with what companies like NXP and Avago have done in their quoted leverage numbers, we expect our debt-to-EBITDA leverage to drop rapidly as follows. After the first year, the senior leverage will drop from 2.7 to 2.3 and the total leverage will drop from 4.5 to 4. After 2 years, the senior leverage drops to 1.9 and the total leverage drops to 3.4. And after 3 years, the senior leverage will drop to 1.7 and the total leverage will drop to 3.1. As you can see -- as you can clearly see, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage drops rapidly over the first 3 years after the close of the Atmel acquisition. Additionally, Microchip's management and the board is fully committed to the dividend and does not see any risks to the dividend.
The second question that has been raised is multiple architectures. We received this question at the last conference call also, but we have continued to receive follow-on questions about this. The comment from investors had been that Microchip in the past has been dismissive of the ARM architecture, so what has changed now? When Microchip was dismissive of the ARM architecture, it was in response to investors' question about replacing our PIC32 architecture, which is mixed-based. In that regard, nothing has changed. We continue to hear from distributors and our customers that ARM has commoditized this market and Microchip's PIC32-based solutions are differentiated and superior products in the marketplace. Therefore, Microchip has no plans to shelf one or the other architecture. We will be the only company that will have ARM architecture when the customer demands an ARM solution and we will have PIC32 when we can sell a differentiated solution like we have been doing for several years.
By the way, Atmel does not consider its ARM-based products to be a commodity nor do any of the other suppliers who are also trying to differentiate their products using different peripherals. This is consistent with what we have been saying for years that it is not about the core, it's about the total solution. Atmel's ARM 32-based products and Microchip's PIC32 products are both successful in their own right and we believe have strong ecosystems and market momentum to continue to be successful. As far as AVR and PIC are concerned, at the 8-bit architecture level, these are both very mature solutions with fully developed product portfolios, development tools and ecosystems and they can continue to coexist. There are PIC head engineers who like PICs. And there are AvrFreaks, a group on the web, who like AVR. We cannot disappoint either and will continue to support both of these groups. But as we mentioned during our conference call, we do expect to find synergies by not having to duplicate the investment in IP building blocks that make up our microcontrollers. We believe that the investors are making the same mistake that they made when they believed that SMSC's vertical product lines in automotive and personal computer business was an issue for us because we were based on horizontal market in sales. Investors have routinely underestimated Microchip's management's ability to transform the company's organization and resources to take on the challenge at hand.
The third question raised has been revenue dissynergies. Investors believe that not all of Atmel's product lines will meet Microchip's margin criteria and some segments will be exited or divested. Investors have pointed to our attempt to purchase Atmel in 2008 when we were going to divest a couple of segments to ON Semiconductor while, in 2008, Microchip was planning to sell the memory business and automotive business to ON Semiconductor. I must point out, that while the memory business was a lower margin business for Atmel at that time, the primary reason for Microchip to divest those 2 businesses was affordability not the margin. 
ON Semiconductor was going to bring $1 billion of cash into the deal. Without that, Microchip could not afford to buy Atmel at the size Microchip was then. Since then, Microchip has grown tremendously and with a large market capitalization. Today, we can afford the entire Atmel business ourselves. Secondly, Atmel has divested many of the low margin businesses namely smart card, Serial Flash memory business, and some others. Today, we see only 5% of Atmel business that is in mobile consumer electronics touch segment that is very low gross margin. We believe that there are significant positive synergies in this acquisition to easily override any potential negative synergy out of this 5% business, which has declined very significantly already under Atmel's clock.
Fourth question raised has been dissynergy through multi-sourcing. There seems to be a misconception that both Microchip and Atmel microcontrollers are designed into the same socket and, therefore, there will be some dissynergy. We do not understand this concern. Due to different architectures, Microchip's and Atmel's microcontrollers are never designed into the same socket. There is also a concern that distributors will not sell a broad portfolio. We don't understand that either. If that line of thinking was to be true, then distributors should give all of Texas Instruments' business to me as they have a much broader portfolio than we do. 
Microchip and Atmel combined will do approximately $2 billion through the distribution channel. The combined product lines of Microchip and Atmel will be one of the most sought-after broad-based product lines with multiple opportunities for distribution for attaching analog, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, memory, USB, Ethernet, timing products and others.
The fifth concern raised has been our target is $0.33 accretion in fiscal year '17 and then $0.90 in fiscal year '19. This bridge is somewhat misunderstood. So let me clarify that. Let me first remind you about that accretion numbers again. They are $0.33 in fiscal year '17, $0.67 in fiscal year '18 and $0.90 in fiscal year '19. The accretion is coming from 3 factors: first, the operating expense reduction; second, the gross margin improvement and third, the revenue growth. The operating expense reduction is not a 1-year job. Because of the size of the transaction, we believe it will be a continuous effort over a 3-year period to rationalize the R&D as well as SG&A expenses and bring them into Microchip's cost structure. The gross margin improvement is also gradual through improvement of manufacturing efficiency as well as higher or lower emphasis on product lines based on their gross margin. And then, there will be revenue synergy also contributing to the EPS synergy. Atmel's revenue has been declining for the last 5 years as they have restructured out of the very large touch business and they also sold the Serial Flash business to a company called Adesto. We are confident that Atmel's revenue will bottom in the first half of 2016 and then grow afterwards. We also see a significant opportunity to attach analog and other connectivity products to Atmel's microcontrollers like we have been successful with Microchip's microcontrollers. In fact, I see the analog attach opportunities with Atmel's microcontrollers to be a bonanza for our analog business. The combination of all these factors build the accretion from $0.33 in fiscal '17 to $0.67 in fiscal year '18 to $0.90 in fiscal year '19.
The final concern we have heard about is the size of the deal. Microchip has been successful in smaller deals, can we duplicate that success with this larger deal? Now I must say that we heard of this concern when we bought SMSC also. SMSC was 4x larger than any deal we had done prior to that. Microchip today is at $2.2 billion company and it's capable of taking on a larger acquisition compared to what we could do a few years ago. Atmel's business is also quite familiar to us, which was unlike the case with SST, SMSC, et cetera. 
As I said before, Microchip management is capable of transforming its organization, resources and strategies to meet the challenges at a given time. Just today, we announced the promotion of Ganesh Moorthy to President and COO. In addition to Ganesh deserving of a promotion, it is also a recognition of the fact that we are taking on an acquisition that's about 47% of our own size, and it will require Ganesh and I both to manage this enterprise with all of the travel involved worldwide. We're also adjusting the organization below us to adapt to this new reality. Microchip is an incredible executive development machine. You may not know this, but Microchip has not hired a VP level person from outside the company for over 15 years, although we have gained some VPs through our acquisitions. 
Through training, mentoring and developing, we have groomed our own executives that have replaced some of the retirements that have taken place, as well as provided the leadership bandwidth required to effectively manage the growth that we have experienced. You cannot imagine the familiarity, understanding, cohesiveness, speed of execution and constancy of purpose that it builds in the organization. This culture has been one of the hallmarks of our success. We have been able to extend this culture to our many acquisitions and we believe that we will be able to achieve the same with Atmel. I hope that it alleviates some of your concerns. In closing, I would like to say that the December quarter marks the bottom for this correction and we're expecting a low single-digit sequential growth in the March quarter. Beyond the March quarter, we get into 2 back-to-back seasonally stronger quarters for Microchip. These quarters, beyond organic growth, will also have incremental accretion from the restructuring of Micrel and these quarters will begin to have accretion from the closing of the Atmel transaction.

We have declined some in the memory business, we declined in some of the other miscellaneous. When we have acquired these companies, these companies all did some of the foundry business. Supertex had some foundry business where any companies with their 6-inch fabs, they underload it and they tend to take odds and ins of the foundry business doing some work for other people, which goes on for years because nobody wants to move it. It's going to be a small amount of work. When you close the fab, that part of the business atrophies because nobody wants to transfer it to another fab. Atmel has some foundry business also. Supertex had it. Micrel had it. We put that all in the others. So I think when you look at it, all that, our core businesses have all done well. You can compare our core business to Atmel, you can compare it to Renesas, you can compare it to anybody else. And when the numbers come out from Gartner, we can share that with you. I think, other thing, John, I would say, is that we had largely broken out the organic versus inorganic numbers based on your request, you may recall. And I don't think it has helped us. The thing the investors and analysts have to recognize is that these acquisitions are an enormous amount of work. We take an enormous amount of Microchip executives and our people and our energy to bring these acquisitions, which were underperforming, really doing nothing. Micrel had done 6.7% operating profit in the quarter we bought them. And now their operating profits are approaching 20% and will be 30% or higher by the time we are done. All that effort will have gone into our business. In many cases -- take the case of Micrel, for example, we terminated one of our product, gigabit Ethernet, and we decided to take a gigabit Ethernet from Micrel and market it further because they were farther along in the development of that product. So when you look at it a year, 2 years, 3 years down the line, when you guys -- the way you interpret organic versus inorganic, you basically take all the earnings that we have produced, all the revenue that we have produced, all the work that we have done to take these acquisitions, which were essentially making no money and make hundreds and millions of dollars from this acquisitions to bring them into 30%-plus operating profit and you take them out from the top and saying our core business isn't doing well.

We put less focus on the product lines that have lower margin and we change the model mix, we change the factory strategy, we shut down factories, we move things around. In every acquisition, we have gotten those results. Two weeks after announcing the acquisition and the one in which, basically, we got very little insight into the company because of competitive factors compared to any of our acquisitions. Why do you guys always assume that the gross margin improvement has to happen only from discontinuing these product lines? Those pieces have been there before and they've been always wrong. We didn't do that in the prior acquisitions and, yet, we got them into -- last quarter, the December quarter, Supertex gross margin was 70%. That's actual data."

And obviously, neither you nor I can predict what the macro does over the next kind of 2, 3 years. But how would you look at this through a bunch of different market conditions? I know in the past, when we've hit a downturn, you've been able to ramp back OpEx for Microchip in order to protect EPS. Do you feel the same confidence in the ability to do that on Microchip with some leverage as you're in the process of paying down that leverage from the deal?"

And I think I spoke about it in the last conference call. I mean, do you really think a conservative management like Microchip will take on this acquisition and leverage without doing a real heavyweight downside analysis? And seeing in there where the leverage gets to, is there any threat to the dividend? What happens to the cash flow? What happens to the capital? Do you think we really would do that? So trust us that we did a real bottoms up analysis. And what happens in every downside is our capital needs dry up, and we have shared with you before in graphs that our capital needs some sustaining. A very small amount of capital is sustaining. But on the rest of the capital going to grow through new technologies and all that. And what we find is in a down environment, the capital needs dry up. When the capital needs dry up, there's a huge cash flow that comes up because you don't have to really spend all that money on capital. So yes, we did a downside analysis and the total leverage metric is 5 and the senior leverage hurdle is 3.0. And we don't really get close to those by taking all those factors into account."

That's the first thing we would do to take all of their block diagrams worldwide that exist at the customers and really see whose analog is around."

And a lot of people put their entire microcontrollers in IoT and, if you do that, you got well over a $1 billion of business. But a very strict definition of IoT would be really not counting the microcontroller, but when really the application is really connected on the Internet wirelessly, either through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth or whatever. So I mean, our IoT business is approximately twice the size of Atmel's IoT business. Again, somebody could count it differently how you define it, but counting apples-to-apple. So it grows our business by 50%. We had all the functionality. We had the Wi-Fi, the Bluetooth, the BLE. So we had all the functionality. From that standpoint, we don't really get something new but when you get it scaled, 50% larger scale. And secondly, when you get into individual specs and products, people could argue, ""My product is better"" and ""Mine is lower power"" and ""Mine is larger range"" and this and that and that, and the combination of those we're going to get.

We competed with Freescale when they were a multi-billion dollar revenue company, $4 billion, $5 million company, and Microchip was just a $100 million, $200 million, then $500 million then $1 billion. And we have constantly competed, being a much smaller company, whether Renesas, with TI, with Freescale and with STMicro and others.

For years, yes, we have had a common development tool because we could. All these things were developed internally at 8-bit and 16-bit with an internal architecture. And one of the thing -- reasons -- part of the reason we also choose MIPS was because we were able to work with them in a way that we could bring them into a common development environment, and Microchip tool set we were to extend to a MIPS architecture. But no other company has it. Freescale has a number of development environments for a power PC, for ARM architecture, for their 8-bit product line, 16-bit product line. Atmel has then -- they have AVR, they have ARM. A number of other companies have similar. Silicon Labs has an 8051 for 8-bit, then its ARM for 32-bit. So no other company has it. Those companies aren't dead. Now true, if we had bought a company with the same architecture, it will be incrementally better. But I think street is looking at it like it's dead, like it breaks that tool and then it's the end of the world. These are highly successful product lines in their own right. At other companies, they have existed with multiple architectures. They can exist under multiple architectures at Microchip. We already have -- we have an ARM development tool that sells products from SMSC. Roving Networks had it. So we used other architecture, we use AD51, we use ARC, we use ARM. But it's predominantly our own architecture, we would agree with it. But we have already, in the last few years, with other smaller acquisitions, already introduced ARM-based products. And if you were taking an ARM-based product that had no momentum, that was nowhere, then that would be a formidable challenge to develop it. But it's a successful product line, and so is the AVR 8-bit. So I just think -- look at it in that light. And on the ARM itself, for 8 years, you guys have hounded us for not having ARM, that it was a negative. Now we have ARM, and somehow it's negative again. You can't have it both ways."

During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company.
We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are: Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal 2016 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, provide an update on the integration activities associated with the Micrel acquisition and provide some additional commentary on our announced acquisition of Atmel. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effect of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the December quarter were above the midpoint of our guidance at $552 million and were down 1.3% sequentially from net sales of $559.4 million in the immediately preceding quarter. 
Non-GAAP net sales were $11.7 million higher than GAAP net sales, as we are reporting non-GAAP net sales on a full sell-through revenue recognition basis while GAAP does not recognize revenue on the sell-through of products sitting in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs and when distributor contracts are changed to the standard Microchip format compared to the sell-in revenue recognition contract that Micrel previously had for certain of their distribution partners.
We posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 57.9% in the December quarter and at the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 28.5% of sales, below the bottom end of our guidance range. And non-GAAP operating income was 29.5% of sales, which was above the high end of our guidance. 
Non-GAAP net income was $138.4 million, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $0.64, which was higher than our preannounced results from January 19.
On a GAAP basis, net sales were $540.3 million and gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 54.2% in the December quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $2.3 million of share-based compensation, $6.9 million of gross margin impacts from the distributor revenue adjustments I mentioned earlier, and $17.8 million in acquired inventory valuation cost and acquisition-related restructuring costs.
Total operating expenses were $216.6 million or 40.1% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $48.3 million, share-based compensation of $14.7 million, $1.5 million of acquisition-related expenses and special income of $5 million. GAAP net income was $61.2 million or $0.28 per diluted share. 
In the December quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 10%, and the GAAP tax benefit rate was 22%. The non-GAAP tax rate reflects the benefits in the December quarter for the R&D tax credit reinstatement, but we are including the benefit from R&D tax credit from previous quarters that were reinstated only in the GAAP results to make future periods more comparable. We expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 10% and 11%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at December 31, 2015, was $319.5 million and includes $11 million of fair value markup on Micrel's inventory required by GAAP purchase accounting. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, Microchip had 120 days of inventory at December 31, 2015, which is down by 5 days from the levels at the end of the September quarter. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, inventory at our distributors was at 34 days, which is down 1 day from September quarter levels. I want to remind you that historically, Microchip's distribution revenues throughout the world has been recognized on a sell-through basis.
Micrel has some distributors that historically recognize revenue on a sell-in basis. Microchip changed substantially all the contractual relationships with these distributors during the December quarter, which has resulted in sell-through revenue recognition in the future. Our non-GAAP revenue guidance provided in our release today is based on sell-through revenue recognition for the Micrel distributors for the entire March quarter in order to continue to provide investors with the view of the true end-market demand for our products.
There will be a difference in GAAP revenue recognition as the inventory in the distribution channel at the end of the conversion to sell-through accounting will not be recognized as revenue for GAAP accounting purposes.
The cash generation in the December quarter, excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit, was $172 million. As of December 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.398 billion, our borrowings under our revolving line of credit at December 31 were $1.008 billion, $288 million lower than it was on September 30, as we paid down a portion of the revolving line of credit. Excluding dividend payments, changes in borrowing levels and our acquisition activity, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $140 million to $160 million in the March quarter.
Capital spending was approximately $17.9 million in the December quarter. We expect about $28 million in capital spending in the March quarter, and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 to be about $110 million, well below our previous guidance to The Street of $125 million. We are selectively adding capital to support growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. 
Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $26.7 million.
Over the past several years, Microchip's dividend paid to the shareholders has been treated as a return of capital, as Microchip did not have earnings and profits in the United States. As indicated in last quarter's earnings call, due to the integration of Micrel into Microchip's global tax structure, Microchip will have earnings and profits in the United States in fiscal year 2016. For this transaction, Microchip brought back about $250 million of offshore cash to the U.S. and we don't anticipate paying any U.S. cash taxes on the amount as we will use net operating losses to offset the income.
As a result, a portion of Microchip's calendar year 2015 dividends are taxable to shareholders versus the return of capital treatment from the last few years. We have posted a copy of IRS Form 8937 on the Investor Relations page of our website, which indicates the split between taxable dividend and return of capital for each dividend payment made during calendar year 2015. 
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?"

Before I start my prepared remarks, I'd like to take a moment to thank Steve, our Board of Directors, the Microchip executive team and the over 10,000 employees of Microchip worldwide for the high honor and the distinct privilege they have bestowed on me to be the next President of Microchip. It has been the journey of a lifetime to have witnessed and contributed to the growth and success of Microchip, and I look forward to continuing that journey with the Microchip team as we scale new heights and achieve new business milestones in the years to come.
Now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller revenue was down 3.5% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter, as we experienced the same broad-based weakness that the industry experienced. In calendar year 2015, our microcontroller business was down 1.4% as compared to calendar year 2014. And while we're not happy about the decline, we are confident that we're gaining market share in every microcontroller segment that we compete, in what was a difficult year for the overall industry. The official Gartner microcontroller rankings, we expect will be available in time for our next earnings conference call.
We are continuing to deliver innovative new 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers, as well as software and developed contour solutions to complement them, which we believe will enable us to grow faster than the market and gain further market share. 
As we mentioned at our January 19 conference call, the addition of Atmel's 8-bit AVR microcontroller family and 32-bit ARM microcontroller family, we expect will enhance Microchip's industry-leading 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller offerings. Microcontrollers represented 58.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. 
Moving to analog. Our analog business, which includes Micrel results, was up 4.1% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter and was up 3.6% compared to the year-ago quarter.
In calendar year 2015, our analog business was up 22.4% as compared to calendar year 2014. The strong growth and increase in market share in 2015 was the result of our organic growth efforts as well as the Micrel acquisition. Our Analog business represented 31.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter, the highest percentage of our total revenue it has ever been. To put the size of our analog business in perspective, in the December quarter, Microchip's analog business alone was almost the same size as all of Microchip was in the March quarter of 2009. And at an almost $700 million annual revenue run rate, it is emerging as one of the larger analog franchises serving the embedded control market. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products that fuel the future the growth of our analog business complemented by the products added to our portfolio through acquisition.
Now moving to the memory business. Our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory products, was down 8.3% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. 
Now let me pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?"
31500,322516638,2475789,"Microchip Technology Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Microchip Technology Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ganesh. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016, including comments [indiscernible] since the conference call about acquisition of A",2518,"Thank you, Ganesh. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016, including comments [indiscernible] since the conference call about acquisition of Atmel. Our December quarter results were strong amidst a very turbulent macro and semiconductor industry backdrop. The quarterly results in non-GAAP revenue, gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage and operating profit percentage were all better than the midpoint of our guidance. Additionally, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came in at $0.64, which is above the $0.62 to $0.63 upwardly revised guidance we provided in the announcement of our preliminary results on January 19, 2016.
I will now provide guidance for the March 2016 quarter. We believe that our business has stabilized and that the majority of the inventory correction is behind us. The March quarter is impacted negatively by the Chinese New Year holiday in Asia, but it is also the strongest quarter of the year for Microchip in Europe. Based on our analysis of economic and semiconductor industry conditions, as well as our own business indicators, we are guiding the March quarter non-GAAP net sales to be between flat to up 3% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 57.9% and 58.1% of sales, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 27.3% and 27.9% of sales, and we expect the non-GAAP operating profit to be between 30% and 30.8% of sales. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be $0.65 to $0.69 per share.
Now let me provide you with an update on the integration of Micrel. The integration continues to progress as planned. There were 7 main elements of integration we had defined. 5 of them are complete, which are: number one, financial and business systems consolidation; number two, consolidation of Micrel's wafer fab starts planning; number three, integration of sales force, rep and distribution network; number four, integration of product lines and R&D activities; and number five, integration of human resources systems, equity plans, 401(k), medical benefits, bonus plans, et cetera. The remaining 2 areas, which are progressing well, but are not complete yet are: number one, the closure of Micrel's San Jose fab, which is on schedule for August 2016; and number two, the integration of back-end operational systems, which also remain on schedule for August of 2016.
With this, let me now provide guidance for accretion from the acquisition of Micrel. Micrel acquisition was about $0.007 accretive in the September quarter and was $0.038 accretive in the December quarter to non-GAAP EPS.
This accretion will continue to increase and we now achieve $0.30 of EPS accretion run rate from Micrel by the end of fiscal year 2017. This is up from $0.25 accretion target that we provided in the prior conference calls. These numbers depend upon the speed of integration efforts and the health of the underlying economy in general.
Now some update about Atmel. I have visited Atmel's headquarter location in San Jose and fab location in Colorado Springs and held all employee communication meetings and one-on-one meetings with the executive. Ganesh and I had headed to Europe in mid-February to visit Atmel's European locations in France, Germany, Norway and the U.K. We completed the U.S. antitrust filing last week, and the filings in Germany and Korea are scheduled for next week. We are also targeting the S-4 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in about a week. We continue to expect to close this transaction in the second calendar quarter of 2016.
Since the announcement of the Atmel transaction in our conference call on January 19, most of the feedback from investors and analysts have been very positive, that the deal makes sense. However, there are also areas where either we were not sufficiently clear or investors have further question. We would like to provide more clarification regarding these concerns today. The general view that we have heard is that the current slow growth environment -- that in the current slow growth environment, investors like the self-help stories that can continue to generate growth despite the challenging macro environment. We have recently shared with investors Microchip's organic and total growth in the last 6 years. To repeat just 1 metric, from calendar year 2009 to calendar year 2015, Microchip's organic compounded annual growth rate has been 8.3% per year and the total compounded annual growth, including acquisitions, had been 17.3% per year. 
Investors have commented that our management team has the best chance of turning around Atmel and making them successful. Now let us go into some of the concerns that investors and analysts have raised.
First is leverage. Investors have raised the concern that the Atmel acquisition increases Microchip's debt-to-EBITDA leverage quite a bit and, understandably, have questions about the cash cushion and potential risk to the dividend. We have said in the conference call that after the stock buyback, our senior debt-to-EBITDA leverage will be 2.7 and our total leverage will be 4.5. We would like to point out that these numbers are before synergies. Once you factor in synergies, consistent with what companies like NXP and Avago have done in their quoted leverage numbers, we expect our debt-to-EBITDA leverage to drop rapidly as follows. After the first year, the senior leverage will drop from 2.7 to 2.3 and the total leverage will drop from 4.5 to 4. After 2 years, the senior leverage drops to 1.9 and the total leverage drops to 3.4. And after 3 years, the senior leverage will drop to 1.7 and the total leverage will drop to 3.1. As you can see -- as you can clearly see, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage drops rapidly over the first 3 years after the close of the Atmel acquisition. Additionally, Microchip's management and the board is fully committed to the dividend and does not see any risks to the dividend.
The second question that has been raised is multiple architectures. We received this question at the last conference call also, but we have continued to receive follow-on questions about this. The comment from investors had been that Microchip in the past has been dismissive of the ARM architecture, so what has changed now? When Microchip was dismissive of the ARM architecture, it was in response to investors' question about replacing our PIC32 architecture, which is mixed-based. In that regard, nothing has changed. We continue to hear from distributors and our customers that ARM has commoditized this market and Microchip's PIC32-based solutions are differentiated and superior products in the marketplace. Therefore, Microchip has no plans to shelf one or the other architecture. We will be the only company that will have ARM architecture when the customer demands an ARM solution and we will have PIC32 when we can sell a differentiated solution like we have been doing for several years.
By the way, Atmel does not consider its ARM-based products to be a commodity nor do any of the other suppliers who are also trying to differentiate their products using different peripherals. This is consistent with what we have been saying for years that it is not about the core, it's about the total solution. Atmel's ARM 32-based products and Microchip's PIC32 products are both successful in their own right and we believe have strong ecosystems and market momentum to continue to be successful. As far as AVR and PIC are concerned, at the 8-bit architecture level, these are both very mature solutions with fully developed product portfolios, development tools and ecosystems and they can continue to coexist. There are PIC head engineers who like PICs. And there are AvrFreaks, a group on the web, who like AVR. We cannot disappoint either and will continue to support both of these groups. But as we mentioned during our conference call, we do expect to find synergies by not having to duplicate the investment in IP building blocks that make up our microcontrollers. We believe that the investors are making the same mistake that they made when they believed that SMSC's vertical product lines in automotive and personal computer business was an issue for us because we were based on horizontal market in sales. Investors have routinely underestimated Microchip's management's ability to transform the company's organization and resources to take on the challenge at hand.
The third question raised has been revenue dissynergies. Investors believe that not all of Atmel's product lines will meet Microchip's margin criteria and some segments will be exited or divested. Investors have pointed to our attempt to purchase Atmel in 2008 when we were going to divest a couple of segments to ON Semiconductor while, in 2008, Microchip was planning to sell the memory business and automotive business to ON Semiconductor. I must point out, that while the memory business was a lower margin business for Atmel at that time, the primary reason for Microchip to divest those 2 businesses was affordability not the margin. 
ON Semiconductor was going to bring $1 billion of cash into the deal. Without that, Microchip could not afford to buy Atmel at the size Microchip was then. Since then, Microchip has grown tremendously and with a large market capitalization. Today, we can afford the entire Atmel business ourselves. Secondly, Atmel has divested many of the low margin businesses namely smart card, Serial Flash memory business, and some others. Today, we see only 5% of Atmel business that is in mobile consumer electronics touch segment that is very low gross margin. We believe that there are significant positive synergies in this acquisition to easily override any potential negative synergy out of this 5% business, which has declined very significantly already under Atmel's clock.
Fourth question raised has been dissynergy through multi-sourcing. There seems to be a misconception that both Microchip and Atmel microcontrollers are designed into the same socket and, therefore, there will be some dissynergy. We do not understand this concern. Due to different architectures, Microchip's and Atmel's microcontrollers are never designed into the same socket. There is also a concern that distributors will not sell a broad portfolio. We don't understand that either. If that line of thinking was to be true, then distributors should give all of Texas Instruments' business to me as they have a much broader portfolio than we do. 
Microchip and Atmel combined will do approximately $2 billion through the distribution channel. The combined product lines of Microchip and Atmel will be one of the most sought-after broad-based product lines with multiple opportunities for distribution for attaching analog, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, memory, USB, Ethernet, timing products and others.
The fifth concern raised has been our target is $0.33 accretion in fiscal year '17 and then $0.90 in fiscal year '19. This bridge is somewhat misunderstood. So let me clarify that. Let me first remind you about that accretion numbers again. They are $0.33 in fiscal year '17, $0.67 in fiscal year '18 and $0.90 in fiscal year '19. The accretion is coming from 3 factors: first, the operating expense reduction; second, the gross margin improvement and third, the revenue growth. The operating expense reduction is not a 1-year job. Because of the size of the transaction, we believe it will be a continuous effort over a 3-year period to rationalize the R&D as well as SG&A expenses and bring them into Microchip's cost structure. The gross margin improvement is also gradual through improvement of manufacturing efficiency as well as higher or lower emphasis on product lines based on their gross margin. And then, there will be revenue synergy also contributing to the EPS synergy. Atmel's revenue has been declining for the last 5 years as they have restructured out of the very large touch business and they also sold the Serial Flash business to a company called Adesto. We are confident that Atmel's revenue will bottom in the first half of 2016 and then grow afterwards. We also see a significant opportunity to attach analog and other connectivity products to Atmel's microcontrollers like we have been successful with Microchip's microcontrollers. In fact, I see the analog attach opportunities with Atmel's microcontrollers to be a bonanza for our analog business. The combination of all these factors build the accretion from $0.33 in fiscal '17 to $0.67 in fiscal year '18 to $0.90 in fiscal year '19.
The final concern we have heard about is the size of the deal. Microchip has been successful in smaller deals, can we duplicate that success with this larger deal? Now I must say that we heard of this concern when we bought SMSC also. SMSC was 4x larger than any deal we had done prior to that. Microchip today is at $2.2 billion company and it's capable of taking on a larger acquisition compared to what we could do a few years ago. Atmel's business is also quite familiar to us, which was unlike the case with SST, SMSC, et cetera. 
As I said before, Microchip management is capable of transforming its organization, resources and strategies to meet the challenges at a given time. Just today, we announced the promotion of Ganesh Moorthy to President and COO. In addition to Ganesh deserving of a promotion, it is also a recognition of the fact that we are taking on an acquisition that's about 47% of our own size, and it will require Ganesh and I both to manage this enterprise with all of the travel involved worldwide. We're also adjusting the organization below us to adapt to this new reality. Microchip is an incredible executive development machine. You may not know this, but Microchip has not hired a VP level person from outside the company for over 15 years, although we have gained some VPs through our acquisitions. 
Through training, mentoring and developing, we have groomed our own executives that have replaced some of the retirements that have taken place, as well as provided the leadership bandwidth required to effectively manage the growth that we have experienced. You cannot imagine the familiarity, understanding, cohesiveness, speed of execution and constancy of purpose that it builds in the organization. This culture has been one of the hallmarks of our success. We have been able to extend this culture to our many acquisitions and we believe that we will be able to achieve the same with Atmel. I hope that it alleviates some of your concerns. In closing, I would like to say that the December quarter marks the bottom for this correction and we're expecting a low single-digit sequential growth in the March quarter. Beyond the March quarter, we get into 2 back-to-back seasonally stronger quarters for Microchip. These quarters, beyond organic growth, will also have incremental accretion from the restructuring of Micrel and these quarters will begin to have accretion from the closing of the Atmel transaction. This triple effect coming from organic growth, accretion from Micrel and accretion from Atmel will set up the earnings growth momentum that we expect will lead us to a 23% non-GAAP EPS growth from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017. With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?"

We have declined some in the memory business, we declined in some of the other miscellaneous. When we have acquired these companies, these companies all did some of the foundry business. Supertex had some foundry business where any companies with their 6-inch fabs, they underload it and they tend to take odds and ins of the foundry business doing some work for other people, which goes on for years because nobody wants to move it. It's going to be a small amount of work. When you close the fab, that part of the business atrophies because nobody wants to transfer it to another fab. Atmel has some foundry business also. Supertex had it. Micrel had it. We put that all in the others. So I think when you look at it, all that, our core businesses have all done well. You can compare our core business to Atmel, you can compare it to Renesas, you can compare it to anybody else. And when the numbers come out from Gartner, we can share that with you. I think, other thing, John, I would say, is that we had largely broken out the organic versus inorganic numbers based on your request, you may recall. And I don't think it has helped us. The thing the investors and analysts have to recognize is that these acquisitions are an enormous amount of work. We take an enormous amount of Microchip executives and our people and our energy to bring these acquisitions, which were underperforming, really doing nothing. Micrel had done 6.7% operating profit in the quarter we bought them. And now their operating profits are approaching 20% and will be 30% or higher by the time we are done. All that effort will have gone into our business. In many cases -- take the case of Micrel, for example, we terminated one of our product, gigabit Ethernet, and we decided to take a gigabit Ethernet from Micrel and market it further because they were farther along in the development of that product. So when you look at it a year, 2 years, 3 years down the line, when you guys -- the way you interpret organic versus inorganic, you basically take all the earnings that we have produced, all the revenue that we have produced, all the work that we have done to take these acquisitions, which were essentially making no money and make hundreds and millions of dollars from this acquisitions to bring them into 30%-plus operating profit and you take them out from the top and saying our core business isn't doing well. Well, thank you very much."

And I think I spoke about it in the last conference call. I mean, do you really think a conservative management like Microchip will take on this acquisition and leverage without doing a real heavyweight downside analysis? And seeing in there where the leverage gets to, is there any threat to the dividend? What happens to the cash flow? What happens to the capital? Do you think we really would do that? So trust us that we did a real bottoms up analysis. And what happens in every downside is our capital needs dry up, and we have shared with you before in graphs that our capital needs some sustaining. A very small amount of capital is sustaining. But on the rest of the capital going to grow through new technologies and all that. And what we find is in a down environment, the capital needs dry up. When the capital needs dry up, there's a huge cash flow that comes up because you don't have to really spend all that money on capital. So yes, we did a downside analysis and the total leverage metric is 5 and the senior leverage hurdle is 3.0. And we don't really get close to those by taking all those factors into account."

We have done them because we found them -- we would be able to get them either at a reasonable price or we're able to build a model where it would make sense, but you've seen us walk away from acquisition like we walked away from CSR, we walked away from many, many others that did not come in the public domain. We competed with Freescale when they were a multi-billion dollar revenue company, $4 billion, $5 million company, and Microchip was just a $100 million, $200 million, then $500 million then $1 billion. And we have constantly competed, being a much smaller company, whether Renesas, with TI, with Freescale and with STMicro and others. Scale is important, but just scale for the sake of scale with not good product lines and not good execution and all that, a lot of larger companies have terrible business models. So we didn't do Atmel to compete with NXP or Freescale. We could compete with both of them individually and together also is fine. We did Atmel for the reasons we have described earlier."

Development tools to the engineers are very touchy subject and it's one that -- it's important for them to feel comfortable designing with our entire portfolio with what they've gotten used to. And I think there are ways to slowly, over time, build in the ability for each other's products to be fit underneath the development tools that are available. So more to come on that. But I think both companies have strong development tools. Microchip, obviously, has had them over the entire 8-, 16-, 32-bit portfolio. And Atmel has one for the AVR products and one for the ARM products. And we'll look for ways to make it so that design engineers find it sticky using our development tools."

For years, yes, we have had a common development tool because we could. All these things were developed internally at 8-bit and 16-bit with an internal architecture. And one of the thing -- reasons -- part of the reason we also choose MIPS was because we were able to work with them in a way that we could bring them into a common development environment, and Microchip tool set we were to extend to a MIPS architecture. But no other company has it. Freescale has a number of development environments for a power PC, for ARM architecture, for their 8-bit product line, 16-bit product line. Atmel has then -- they have AVR, they have ARM. A number of other companies have similar. Silicon Labs has an 8051 for 8-bit, then its ARM for 32-bit. So no other company has it. Those companies aren't dead. Now true, if we had bought a company with the same architecture, it will be incrementally better. But I think street is looking at it like it's dead, like it breaks that tool and then it's the end of the world. These are highly successful product lines in their own right. At other companies, they have existed with multiple architectures. They can exist under multiple architectures at Microchip. We already have -- we have an ARM development tool that sells products from SMSC. Roving Networks had it. So we used other architecture, we use AD51, we use ARC, we use ARM. But it's predominantly our own architecture, we would agree with it. But we have already, in the last few years, with other smaller acquisitions, already introduced ARM-based products. And if you were taking an ARM-based product that had no momentum, that was nowhere, then that would be a formidable challenge to develop it. But it's a successful product line, and so is the AVR 8-bit. So I just think -- look at it in that light. And on the ARM itself, for 8 years, you guys have hounded us for not having ARM, that it was a negative. Now we have ARM, and somehow it's negative again. You can't have it both ways."

During the course of this conference call, we will be making projections and other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company.
We wish to caution you that such statements are predictions and that actual events or results may differ materially. We refer you to our press release as of today as well as our recent filings with the SEC that identify important risk factors that may impact Microchip's business and results of operations.
In attendance with me today are: Steve Sanghi, Microchip's Chairman and CEO; and Ganesh Moorthy, Microchip's President and COO. I will comment on our third quarter fiscal 2016 financial performance, and Steve and Ganesh will then give their comments on the results, discuss the current business environment as well as our guidance, provide an update on the integration activities associated with the Micrel acquisition and provide some additional commentary on our announced acquisition of Atmel. We will then be available to respond to specific investor and analyst questions.
I want to remind you that we are including information in our press release and in this conference call on various GAAP and non-GAAP measures. We have posted a full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.microchip.com, which we believe you will find useful when comparing GAAP and non-GAAP results.
I will now go through some of the operating results, including net sales, gross margin and operating expenses. I will be referring to these results on a non-GAAP basis prior to the effect of our acquisition activities and share-based compensation.
Non-GAAP net sales in the December quarter were above the midpoint of our guidance at $552 million and were down 1.3% sequentially from net sales of $559.4 million in the immediately preceding quarter. 
Non-GAAP net sales were $11.7 million higher than GAAP net sales, as we are reporting non-GAAP net sales on a full sell-through revenue recognition basis while GAAP does not recognize revenue on the sell-through of products sitting in the distribution channel on the date an acquisition occurs and when distributor contracts are changed to the standard Microchip format compared to the sell-in revenue recognition contract that Micrel previously had for certain of their distribution partners.
We posted a summary of our revenue by product line and geography on our website for your reference. On a non-GAAP basis, gross margins were 57.9% in the December quarter and at the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 28.5% of sales, below the bottom end of our guidance range. And non-GAAP operating income was 29.5% of sales, which was above the high end of our guidance. 
Non-GAAP net income was $138.4 million, resulting in earnings per diluted share of $0.64, which was higher than our preannounced results from January 19.
On a GAAP basis, net sales were $540.3 million and gross margins, including share-based compensation and acquisition-related expenses, were 54.2% in the December quarter. GAAP gross margins include the impact of $2.3 million of share-based compensation, $6.9 million of gross margin impacts from the distributor revenue adjustments I mentioned earlier, and $17.8 million in acquired inventory valuation cost and acquisition-related restructuring costs.
Total operating expenses were $216.6 million or 40.1% of sales and include acquisition intangible amortization of $48.3 million, share-based compensation of $14.7 million, $1.5 million of acquisition-related expenses and special income of $5 million. GAAP net income was $61.2 million or $0.28 per diluted share. 
In the December quarter, the non-GAAP tax rate was 10%, and the GAAP tax benefit rate was 22%. The non-GAAP tax rate reflects the benefits in the December quarter for the R&D tax credit reinstatement, but we are including the benefit from R&D tax credit from previous quarters that were reinstated only in the GAAP results to make future periods more comparable. We expect our longer-term forward-looking non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 10% and 11%. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated inventory at December 31, 2015, was $319.5 million and includes $11 million of fair value markup on Micrel's inventory required by GAAP purchase accounting. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, Microchip had 120 days of inventory at December 31, 2015, which is down by 5 days from the levels at the end of the September quarter. Excluding purchase accounting adjustments, inventory at our distributors was at 34 days, which is down 1 day from September quarter levels. I want to remind you that historically, Microchip's distribution revenues throughout the world has been recognized on a sell-through basis.
Micrel has some distributors that historically recognize revenue on a sell-in basis. Microchip changed substantially all the contractual relationships with these distributors during the December quarter, which has resulted in sell-through revenue recognition in the future. Our non-GAAP revenue guidance provided in our release today is based on sell-through revenue recognition for the Micrel distributors for the entire March quarter in order to continue to provide investors with the view of the true end-market demand for our products.
There will be a difference in GAAP revenue recognition as the inventory in the distribution channel at the end of the conversion to sell-through accounting will not be recognized as revenue for GAAP accounting purposes.
The cash generation in the December quarter, excluding our acquisition activities, our dividend payment and changes in borrowing levels under our revolving line of credit, was $172 million. As of December 31, the consolidated cash and total investment position was $2.398 billion, our borrowings under our revolving line of credit at December 31 were $1.008 billion, $288 million lower than it was on September 30, as we paid down a portion of the revolving line of credit. Excluding dividend payments, changes in borrowing levels and our acquisition activity, we expect our total cash and investment position to grow by approximately $140 million to $160 million in the March quarter.
Capital spending was approximately $17.9 million in the December quarter. We expect about $28 million in capital spending in the March quarter, and overall capital expenditures for fiscal year 2016 to be about $110 million, well below our previous guidance to The Street of $125 million. We are selectively adding capital to support growth of our production capabilities for our fast-growing new products and technologies and to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced. 
Depreciation expense in the December quarter was $26.7 million.
Over the past several years, Microchip's dividend paid to the shareholders has been treated as a return of capital, as Microchip did not have earnings and profits in the United States. As indicated in last quarter's earnings call, due to the integration of Micrel into Microchip's global tax structure, Microchip will have earnings and profits in the United States in fiscal year 2016. For this transaction, Microchip brought back about $250 million of offshore cash to the U.S. and we don't anticipate paying any U.S. cash taxes on the amount as we will use net operating losses to offset the income.
As a result, a portion of Microchip's calendar year 2015 dividends are taxable to shareholders versus the return of capital treatment from the last few years. We have posted a copy of IRS Form 8937 on the Investor Relations page of our website, which indicates the split between taxable dividend and return of capital for each dividend payment made during calendar year 2015. 
I will now ask Ganesh to give his comments on the performance of the business in the December quarter. Ganesh?"

It has been the journey of a lifetime to have witnessed and contributed to the growth and success of Microchip, and I look forward to continuing that journey with the Microchip team as we scale new heights and achieve new business milestones in the years to come.
Now let's take a closer look at the performance of each of our product lines, starting with microcontrollers. Our microcontroller revenue was down 3.5% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter, as we experienced the same broad-based weakness that the industry experienced. In calendar year 2015, our microcontroller business was down 1.4% as compared to calendar year 2014. And while we're not happy about the decline, we are confident that we're gaining market share in every microcontroller segment that we compete, in what was a difficult year for the overall industry. The official Gartner microcontroller rankings, we expect will be available in time for our next earnings conference call.
We are continuing to deliver innovative new 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers, as well as software and developed contour solutions to complement them, which we believe will enable us to grow faster than the market and gain further market share. 
As we mentioned at our January 19 conference call, the addition of Atmel's 8-bit AVR microcontroller family and 32-bit ARM microcontroller family, we expect will enhance Microchip's industry-leading 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontroller offerings. Microcontrollers represented 58.5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. 
Moving to analog. Our analog business, which includes Micrel results, was up 4.1% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter and was up 3.6% compared to the year-ago quarter.
In calendar year 2015, our analog business was up 22.4% as compared to calendar year 2014. The strong growth and increase in market share in 2015 was the result of our organic growth efforts as well as the Micrel acquisition. Our Analog business represented 31.2% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter, the highest percentage of our total revenue it has ever been. To put the size of our analog business in perspective, in the December quarter, Microchip's analog business alone was almost the same size as all of Microchip was in the March quarter of 2009. And at an almost $700 million annual revenue run rate, it is emerging as one of the larger analog franchises serving the embedded control market. We continue to develop and introduce a wide range of innovative and proprietary new products that fuel the future the growth of our analog business complemented by the products added to our portfolio through acquisition.
Now moving to the memory business. Our memory business, which is comprised of our Serial E-squared memory products as well as our SuperFlash Memory products, was down 8.3% in the December quarter as compared to the September quarter. We continue to run our memory business in a disciplined fashion that maintains consistently high profitability, enables our licensing business and serves our microcontroller customers to complete their solutions. Our memory business represented 5% of Microchip's overall revenue in the December quarter. 
Now let me pass it to Steve for some general comments about our business as well as our guidance going forward. Steve?"

Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016, including comments [indiscernible] since the conference call about acquisition of A",2518,"Thank you, Ganesh. Today, I would like to first comment on the results of the fiscal third quarter of 2016 and then provide guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016, including comments [indiscernible] since the conference call about acquisition of Atmel. Our December quarter results were strong amidst a very turbulent macro and semiconductor industry backdrop. The quarterly results in non-GAAP revenue, gross margin percentage, operating expense percentage and operating profit percentage were all better than the midpoint of our guidance. Additionally, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came in at $0.64, which is above the $0.62 to $0.63 upwardly revised guidance we provided in the announcement of our preliminary results on January 19, 2016.
I will now provide guidance for the March 2016 quarter. We believe that our business has stabilized and that the majority of the inventory correction is behind us. The March quarter is impacted negatively by the Chinese New Year holiday in Asia, but it is also the strongest quarter of the year for Microchip in Europe. Based on our analysis of economic and semiconductor industry conditions, as well as our own business indicators, we are guiding the March quarter non-GAAP net sales to be between flat to up 3% sequentially. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 57.9% and 58.1% of sales, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be between 27.3% and 27.9% of sales, and we expect the non-GAAP operating profit to be between 30% and 30.8% of sales. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be $0.65 to $0.69 per share.
Now let me provide you with an update on the integration of Micrel. The integration continues to progress as planned. There were 7 main elements of integration we had defined. 5 of them are complete, which are: number one, financial and business systems consolidation; number two, consolidation of Micrel's wafer fab starts planning; number three, integration of sales force, rep and distribution network; number four, integration of product lines and R&D activities; and number five, integration of human resources systems, equity plans, 401(k), medical benefits, bonus plans, et cetera. The remaining 2 areas, which are progressing well, but are not complete yet are: number one, the closure of Micrel's San Jose fab, which is on schedule for August 2016; and number two, the integration of back-end operational systems, which also remain on schedule for August of 2016.
With this, let me now provide guidance for accretion from the acquisition of Micrel. Micrel acquisition was about $0.007 accretive in the September quarter and was $0.038 accretive in the December quarter to non-GAAP EPS.
This accretion will continue to increase and we now achieve $0.30 of EPS accretion run rate from Micrel by the end of fiscal year 2017. This is up from $0.25 accretion target that we provided in the prior conference calls. These numbers depend upon the speed of integration efforts and the health of the underlying economy in general.
Now some update about Atmel. I have visited Atmel's headquarter location in San Jose and fab location in Colorado Springs and held all employee communication meetings and one-on-one meetings with the executive. Ganesh and I had headed to Europe in mid-February to visit Atmel's European locations in France, Germany, Norway and the U.K. We completed the U.S. antitrust filing last week, and the filings in Germany and Korea are scheduled for next week. We are also targeting the S-4 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in about a week. We continue to expect to close this transaction in the second calendar quarter of 2016.
Since the announcement of the Atmel transaction in our conference call on January 19, most of the feedback from investors and analysts have been very positive, that the deal makes sense. However, there are also areas where either we were not sufficiently clear or investors have further question. We would like to provide more clarification regarding these concerns today. The general view that we have heard is that the current slow growth environment -- that in the current slow growth environment, investors like the self-help stories that can continue to generate growth despite the challenging macro environment. We have recently shared with investors Microchip's organic and total growth in the last 6 years. To repeat just 1 metric, from calendar year 2009 to calendar year 2015, Microchip's organic compounded annual growth rate has been 8.3% per year and the total compounded annual growth, including acquisitions, had been 17.3% per year. 
Investors have commented that our management team has the best chance of turning around Atmel and making them successful. Now let us go into some of the concerns that investors and analysts have raised.
First is leverage. Investors have raised the concern that the Atmel acquisition increases Microchip's debt-to-EBITDA leverage quite a bit and, understandably, have questions about the cash cushion and potential risk to the dividend. We have said in the conference call that after the stock buyback, our senior debt-to-EBITDA leverage will be 2.7 and our total leverage will be 4.5. We would like to point out that these numbers are before synergies. Once you factor in synergies, consistent with what companies like NXP and Avago have done in their quoted leverage numbers, we expect our debt-to-EBITDA leverage to drop rapidly as follows. After the first year, the senior leverage will drop from 2.7 to 2.3 and the total leverage will drop from 4.5 to 4. After 2 years, the senior leverage drops to 1.9 and the total leverage drops to 3.4. And after 3 years, the senior leverage will drop to 1.7 and the total leverage will drop to 3.1. As you can see -- as you can clearly see, our debt-to-EBITDA leverage drops rapidly over the first 3 years after the close of the Atmel acquisition. Additionally, Microchip's management and the board is fully committed to the dividend and does not see any risks to the dividend.
The second question that has been raised is multiple architectures. We received this question at the last conference call also, but we have continued to receive follow-on questions about this. The comment from investors had been that Microchip in the past has been dismissive of the ARM architecture, so what has changed now? When Microchip was dismissive of the ARM architecture, it was in response to investors' question about replacing our PIC32 architecture, which is mixed-based. In that regard, nothing has changed. We continue to hear from distributors and our customers that ARM has commoditized this market and Microchip's PIC32-based solutions are differentiated and superior products in the marketplace. Therefore, Microchip has no plans to shelf one or the other architecture. We will be the only company that will have ARM architecture when the customer demands an ARM solution and we will have PIC32 when we can sell a differentiated solution like we have been doing for several years.
By the way, Atmel does not consider its ARM-based products to be a commodity nor do any of the other suppliers who are also trying to differentiate their products using different peripherals. This is consistent with what we have been saying for years that it is not about the core, it's about the total solution. Atmel's ARM 32-based products and Microchip's PIC32 products are both successful in their own right and we believe have strong ecosystems and market momentum to continue to be successful. As far as AVR and PIC are concerned, at the 8-bit architecture level, these are both very mature solutions with fully developed product portfolios, development tools and ecosystems and they can continue to coexist. There are PIC head engineers who like PICs. And there are AvrFreaks, a group on the web, who like AVR. We cannot disappoint either and will continue to support both of these groups. But as we mentioned during our conference call, we do expect to find synergies by not having to duplicate the investment in IP building blocks that make up our microcontrollers. We believe that the investors are making the same mistake that they made when they believed that SMSC's vertical product lines in automotive and personal computer business was an issue for us because we were based on horizontal market in sales. Investors have routinely underestimated Microchip's management's ability to transform the company's organization and resources to take on the challenge at hand.
The third question raised has been revenue dissynergies. Investors believe that not all of Atmel's product lines will meet Microchip's margin criteria and some segments will be exited or divested. Investors have pointed to our attempt to purchase Atmel in 2008 when we were going to divest a couple of segments to ON Semiconductor while, in 2008, Microchip was planning to sell the memory business and automotive business to ON Semiconductor. I must point out, that while the memory business was a lower margin business for Atmel at that time, the primary reason for Microchip to divest those 2 businesses was affordability not the margin. 
ON Semiconductor was going to bring $1 billion of cash into the deal. Without that, Microchip could not afford to buy Atmel at the size Microchip was then. Since then, Microchip has grown tremendously and with a large market capitalization. Today, we can afford the entire Atmel business ourselves. Secondly, Atmel has divested many of the low margin businesses namely smart card, Serial Flash memory business, and some others. Today, we see only 5% of Atmel business that is in mobile consumer electronics touch segment that is very low gross margin. We believe that there are significant positive synergies in this acquisition to easily override any potential negative synergy out of this 5% business, which has declined very significantly already under Atmel's clock.
Fourth question raised has been dissynergy through multi-sourcing. There seems to be a misconception that both Microchip and Atmel microcontrollers are designed into the same socket and, therefore, there will be some dissynergy. We do not understand this concern. Due to different architectures, Microchip's and Atmel's microcontrollers are never designed into the same socket. There is also a concern that distributors will not sell a broad portfolio. We don't understand that either. If that line of thinking was to be true, then distributors should give all of Texas Instruments' business to me as they have a much broader portfolio than we do. 
Microchip and Atmel combined will do approximately $2 billion through the distribution channel. The combined product lines of Microchip and Atmel will be one of the most sought-after broad-based product lines with multiple opportunities for distribution for attaching analog, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, memory, USB, Ethernet, timing products and others.
The fifth concern raised has been our target is $0.33 accretion in fiscal year '17 and then $0.90 in fiscal year '19. This bridge is somewhat misunderstood. So let me clarify that. Let me first remind you about that accretion numbers again. They are $0.33 in fiscal year '17, $0.67 in fiscal year '18 and $0.90 in fiscal year '19. The accretion is coming from 3 factors: first, the operating expense reduction; second, the gross margin improvement and third, the revenue growth. The operating expense reduction is not a 1-year job. Because of the size of the transaction, we believe it will be a continuous effort over a 3-year period to rationalize the R&D as well as SG&A expenses and bring them into Microchip's cost structure. The gross margin improvement is also gradual through improvement of manufacturing efficiency as well as higher or lower emphasis on product lines based on their gross margin. And then, there will be revenue synergy also contributing to the EPS synergy. Atmel's revenue has been declining for the last 5 years as they have restructured out of the very large touch business and they also sold the Serial Flash business to a company called Adesto. We are confident that Atmel's revenue will bottom in the first half of 2016 and then grow afterwards. We also see a significant opportunity to attach analog and other connectivity products to Atmel's microcontrollers like we have been successful with Microchip's microcontrollers. In fact, I see the analog attach opportunities with Atmel's microcontrollers to be a bonanza for our analog business. The combination of all these factors build the accretion from $0.33 in fiscal '17 to $0.67 in fiscal year '18 to $0.90 in fiscal year '19.
The final concern we have heard about is the size of the deal. Microchip has been successful in smaller deals, can we duplicate that success with this larger deal? Now I must say that we heard of this concern when we bought SMSC also. SMSC was 4x larger than any deal we had done prior to that. Microchip today is at $2.2 billion company and it's capable of taking on a larger acquisition compared to what we could do a few years ago. Atmel's business is also quite familiar to us, which was unlike the case with SST, SMSC, et cetera. 
As I said before, Microchip management is capable of transforming its organization, resources and strategies to meet the challenges at a given time. Just today, we announced the promotion of Ganesh Moorthy to President and COO. In addition to Ganesh deserving of a promotion, it is also a recognition of the fact that we are taking on an acquisition that's about 47% of our own size, and it will require Ganesh and I both to manage this enterprise with all of the travel involved worldwide. We're also adjusting the organization below us to adapt to this new reality. Microchip is an incredible executive development machine. You may not know this, but Microchip has not hired a VP level person from outside the company for over 15 years, although we have gained some VPs through our acquisitions. 
Through training, mentoring and developing, we have groomed our own executives that have replaced some of the retirements that have taken place, as well as provided the leadership bandwidth required to effectively manage the growth that we have experienced. You cannot imagine the familiarity, understanding, cohesiveness, speed of execution and constancy of purpose that it builds in the organization. This culture has been one of the hallmarks of our success. We have been able to extend this culture to our many acquisitions and we believe that we will be able to achieve the same with Atmel. I hope that it alleviates some of your concerns. In closing, I would like to say that the December quarter marks the bottom for this correction and we're expecting a low single-digit sequential growth in the March quarter. Beyond the March quarter, we get into 2 back-to-back seasonally stronger quarters for Microchip. These quarters, beyond organic growth, will also have incremental accretion from the restructuring of Micrel and these quarters will begin to have accretion from the closing of the Atmel transaction. This triple effect coming from organic growth, accretion from Micrel and accretion from Atmel will set up the earnings growth momentum that we expect will lead us to a 23% non-GAAP EPS growth from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017. With this, operator, will you please poll for questions?"

We have declined some in the memory business, we declined in some of the other miscellaneous. When we have acquired these companies, these companies all did some of the foundry business. Supertex had some foundry business where any companies with their 6-inch fabs, they underload it and they tend to take odds and ins of the foundry business doing some work for other people, which goes on for years because nobody wants to move it. It's going to be a small amount of work. When you close the fab, that part of the business atrophies because nobody wants to transfer it to another fab. Atmel has some foundry business also. Supertex had it. Micrel had it. We put that all in the others. So I think when you look at it, all that, our core businesses have all done well. You can compare our core business to Atmel, you can compare it to Renesas, you can compare it to anybody else. And when the numbers come out from Gartner, we can share that with you. I think, other thing, John, I would say, is that we had largely broken out the organic versus inorganic numbers based on your request, you may recall. And I don't think it has helped us. The thing the investors and analysts have to recognize is that these acquisitions are an enormous amount of work. We take an enormous amount of Microchip executives and our people and our energy to bring these acquisitions, which were underperforming, really doing nothing. Micrel had done 6.7% operating profit in the quarter we bought them. And now their operating profits are approaching 20% and will be 30% or higher by the time we are done. All that effort will have gone into our business. In many cases -- take the case of Micrel, for example, we terminated one of our product, gigabit Ethernet, and we decided to take a gigabit Ethernet from Micrel and market it further because they were farther along in the development of that product. So when you look at it a year, 2 years, 3 years down the line, when you guys -- the way you interpret organic versus inorganic, you basically take all the earnings that we have produced, all the revenue that we have produced, all the work that we have done to take these acquisitions, which were essentially making no money and make hundreds and millions of dollars from this acquisitions to bring them into 30%-plus operating profit and you take them out from the top and saying our core business isn't doing well.

And I think I spoke about it in the last conference call. I mean, do you really think a conservative management like Microchip will take on this acquisition and leverage without doing a real heavyweight downside analysis? And seeing in there where the leverage gets to, is there any threat to the dividend? What happens to the cash flow? What happens to the capital? Do you think we really would do that? So trust us that we did a real bottoms up analysis. And what happens in every downside is our capital needs dry up, and we have shared with you before in graphs that our capital needs some sustaining. A very small amount of capital is sustaining. But on the rest of the capital going to grow through new technologies and all that. And what we find is in a down environment, the capital needs dry up. When the capital needs dry up, there's a huge cash flow that comes up because you don't have to really spend all that money on capital. So yes, we did a downside analysis and the total leverage metric is 5 and the senior leverage hurdle is 3.0. And we don't really get close to those by taking all those factors into account."

And a lot of people put their entire microcontrollers in IoT and, if you do that, you got well over a $1 billion of business.

We competed with Freescale when they were a multi-billion dollar revenue company, $4 billion, $5 million company, and Microchip was just a $100 million, $200 million, then $500 million then $1 billion. And we have constantly competed, being a much smaller company, whether Renesas, with TI, with Freescale and with STMicro and others.

For years, yes, we have had a common development tool because we could. All these things were developed internally at 8-bit and 16-bit with an internal architecture. And one of the thing -- reasons -- part of the reason we also choose MIPS was because we were able to work with them in a way that we could bring them into a common development environment, and Microchip tool set we were to extend to a MIPS architecture. But no other company has it. Freescale has a number of development environments for a power PC, for ARM architecture, for their 8-bit product line, 16-bit product line. Atmel has then -- they have AVR, they have ARM. A number of other companies have similar. Silicon Labs has an 8051 for 8-bit, then its ARM for 32-bit. So no other company has it. Those companies aren't dead. Now true, if we had bought a company with the same architecture, it will be incrementally better. But I think street is looking at it like it's dead, like it breaks that tool and then it's the end of the world. These are highly successful product lines in their own right. At other companies, they have existed with multiple architectures. They can exist under multiple architectures at Microchip. We already have -- we have an ARM development tool that sells products from SMSC. Roving Networks had it. So we used other architecture, we use AD51, we use ARC, we use ARM. But it's predominantly our own architecture, we would agree with it. But we have already, in the last few years, with other smaller acquisitions, already introduced ARM-based products. And if you were taking an ARM-based product that had no momentum, that was nowhere, then that would be a formidable challenge to develop it. But it's a successful product line, and so is the AVR 8-bit. So I just think -- look at it in that light. And on the ARM itself, for 8 years, you guys have hounded us for not having ARM, that it was a negative. Now we have ARM, and somehow it's negative again. You can't have it both ways."
