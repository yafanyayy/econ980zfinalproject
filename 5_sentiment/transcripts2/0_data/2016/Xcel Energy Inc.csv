I'll begin by reviewing some of the highlights from 2015. We had another successful year at Xcel Energy, delivering ongoing earnings of $2.09 per share, despite some challenging weather, weak sales and some regulatory setbacks. We have now met or exceeded our earnings guidance for 11 consecutive years. We also increased the dividend 6.7% and raised the dividend growth objective to 5% to 7%. This marks the 12th consecutive annual dividend increase. Finally, we maintained our strong credit ratings and delivered a 3.8% total return in 2015, outperforming most of the utilities and moving to a premium valuation. We had a busy and overall successful regulatory calendar, resolving rate cases in Minnesota, Colorado, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Texas in addition to the Monticello Prudence Review. In 2015, we continue to pursue multiyear which support our strategic plan and provide certainty to the company, our customers and our shareholders. We were successful in implementing a second 3-year plan in Colorado and we filed a comprehensive multiyear plan in Minnesota. We were also encouraged by the legislation that was passed in Minnesota and Texas, which provides us with additional tools to reduce regulatory lag. In Minnesota, we filed a resource plan that will achieve a 60% carbon reduction by 2030. This plan advances the addition of renewables on our system, preserves reliability while ensuring customers benefit and affordability, creates ownership opportunities for us and positions us well to meet the requirements of the EPA's Clean Power Plan. We are encouraged by the broad stakeholder support that we've received. 
In 2015, we continue to demonstrate strong operational performance, particularly in storm restoration. For example, in December, SPS experienced an horrific winter storm with sustained winds between 50 to 80 miles per hour below zero windshield wideout conditions and inaccessible roads due to 6- to 10-foot snow Now even with these challenging conditions, we were able to restore service to 84% of our customers within 12 hours and 98% of our customers within 24 hours. This remarkable feat was accomplished as a result of our proactive planning, which began days before the event and, of course, our dedicated employees who sacrificed time with families during the holidays. Our industry-leading strong response was recently recognized by EEI, which gave us Emergency Recovery Award for our response towards severe weather in Minnesota that impacted 250,000 customers just last summer. 
In 2015, our employees not only provided best-in-class storm response, but also achieved record levels of safety resulting in an eighth consecutive best year ever. Safety is a critical priority to Xcel Energy and we're committed to sending all employees home every day without injury. Clearly, we believe there is a strong correlation between safety and employee engagement and productivity. We also had an excellent start to the construction of the 200-megawatt Courtenay wind project in North Dakota. We expect the wind farm to be in service by year-end ahead of schedule and on budget. 
Moving to 2016, earlier this week field an application with the Colorado Commission to establish a framework for potential investments in natural gas reserves. This filing proposes a plan and take advantage of historically low natural gas prices, provides a long-term hedge against market fluctuations and offers predictable natural gas prices for the long-term benefit of our customers. The Colorado Commission will have 240 days to reach with this decision on the regulatory framework. If the commission approves the framework, we will then seek approval for our potential investment assuming it is beneficial for our customers. It's important to recognize that market conditions need to be conducive for an investment to be made, but having an established framework in place will allow us to opportunistic. As a reminder, the potential investment rate base in a natural gas resource is not included in our base capital forecast and represents another growth initiative as part of our upside capital forecast. 
Finally, while Teresa will go into more detail, I wanted to address the high-level impact of the Based on our initial analysis, we find it to be a net positive, despite some reduction in rate base growth and here is why. First, we don't anticipate a material act -- rather a material impact on EPS for the 2016 to 2018 time frame. This is due to multiyear plans and existing NOL tax positions in our major jurisdictions. Second, beyond the 2018 time frame, the bill reduces revenue requirements and lowers bill increases for our customers. This reduces regulatory risk, which increases our ability to close the ROE gap. Frankly, I believe, it gives us an opportunity to go beyond the 50 basis points of ROE improvement. It also increases headroom for additional capital investment. Finally, we view the extensions of PTC and ITC favorably as its make large-scale renewables become even more affordable for our customers. As a result, we continue to be very confident in our ability to deliver ongoing earnings consistent with our 4 to 6 EPS growth objective. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook in addition to our regulatory update. Teresa?"

We had another strong year and delivered 2015 ongoing earnings of $2.09 per share compared with $2.03 in 2014. The key takeaway is that we implemented significant cost initiatives and management action to offset negative weather, sluggish sales and certain unfavorable regulatory outcomes allowing us to deliver earnings within our guidance range. The following key drivers positively impacted earnings. Electric increases in riders, a lower earnings in Colorado and reduced O&M expenses. These positive factors were partially offset by several items. We experienced unfavorable weather, which reduced earnings by $0.07 per share compared with last year and reduced earnings by $0.04 per share when compared to normal weather condition. In addition, we had higher depreciation, property taxes and interest expense as well as lower. 
Turning to sales, our weather normalized electric sales were down two-tenths of a percent for the year. The decline was primarily attributable to the impact of lower oil and natural gas prices and lower use per customer. This was partially offset by strong customer additions of nearly 1%. The economies in our service territories remain healthy with average unemployment of 3.4% compared to the national rate of 5%. While sales declined slightly in 2015, we are expecting modest sales growth of 0.5% to 1% in 2016. Our projections are based on the following factors. 2016 is a leap year and the extra day accounts for three-tenths of a percent of growth. In addition, growth in the number of customers is projected to outpace the decline in use per customer, providing positive growth in residential sale. Finally, several large C&I customers experienced reduced load in 2015 that we expect to stabilize. We did see growth for other C&I customers, but at a slower rate. O&M expenses decreased $4.7 million or two-tenths of a percent in 2015, exceeding our guidance range of an increase of 0% to 2%. As I previously mentioned, we experienced some headwinds during the year and the management team responded by reducing cost to deliver earnings consistent with investor expectations. These actions demonstrate our commitment to bending the cost curve and meeting our financial objective. 
Now I'll provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. Yesterday, the commission moved in our Colorado natural gas rate case, while written order has yet to be issued and we haven't had a chance to fully analyze the results, we wanted to give you a high-level overview of the verbal decision. The commission largely proved the ALJ's recommended decision, but with a couple of changes. Key decisions include, a single year rate plan versus our request for multiyear plan, a 3-year extension of the PSIA rider and ROE of 9.5% and an equity ratio of 56.5%. We will file an 8-K with more details after we have fully analyzed the results. In our Texas electric rate case, the commission ordered a rate decrease of $4 million compared with our request for a rate increase of $42 million. The commission's decision was very disappointing and significantly lower than the ALJ recommendation. Key elements include rejection of SPS's request for post test year capital addition, disallowance of SPS's proposed known and measurable adjustment for updated allocation factor between customer classes related to load reductions of a fulfilled customer effective June 2015, this allowance of incentive compensation and a reduction in the equity ratio. We've been very upfront that the earned ROE's need to improve at SPS. And while we made improvements in the ROE, we're still not earning at an acceptable level. As you know, it is a high priority for us to close the ROE gap. We have filed for rehearing and plan to file a new rate case this quarter that will incorporate provisions of the recently passed legislation, designed to reduce regulatory lag. As a reminder, this new legislation provides for an inclusion of post test year capital addition, timely implementation of new rates and enhance recovery for new natural gas plant investment. We believe this will help us achieve a more constructive outcome in the upcoming case. 
In November, we filed a multiyear rate case in Minnesota that provides for various implementation alternatives. In December, the commission approved our 2016 interim rate request of approximately $164 million. The commission deferred a decision on our proposed 2017 interim rate and indicated NSP-Minnesota could resume its interim request in the third quarter for consideration. The procedure of schedule has been established, which provides for a final decision in June of 2017. However, as part of the schedule, we have outlined the path for meaningful settlement discussion, which may shorten the time line to reach resolution in the case. 
Next I'd like to discuss the impact of the recently passed 5-year extension of bonus depreciation. At our Analyst Meeting in December, we provided our updated 5-year base capital forecast of $15.2 billion. The extension of bonus depreciation will reduce the rate case CAGR by approximately 70 to 80 basis points resulting in a rate base growth of about 3.7% for a base capital plan. While bonus depreciation reduces rate base growth it also reduces the impact on the customer bill and creates more headroom for a potential investment. At our Analyst Meeting, we also presented an upside scenario to our capital forecast, which included incremental investment for renewables related to the Minnesota resource plan, distribution grid modernization and natural gas reserves in Colorado. In addition, earlier this week, we announced our energy future plan in Colorado, which creates some further investment opportunity. As a result, we have increased our upside capital forecast to $2.5 billion. This forecast reflects potential investments having a reasonable probability of coming to provision over the next 5 years. The upside capital forecast of $17.7 billion over the 5-year time frame results in an annual rate base growth of approximately 5.5%, including the impact of bonus depreciation. As a result of our robust capital investment opportunity and our actions to improve our ROE, we remain very confident in our ability to deliver on our 4% to 6% earnings growth objective, even with the impact of the bonus depreciation extension. 
In summary, 2015 was another excellent year for Xcel Energy. We delivered earnings within our guidance range for the 11th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 12th straight year, we initiated cost management actions, which resulted in a decline in O&M expenses, new legislation was passed in Minnesota and Texas, which will provide more tools to reduce regulatory lag. We resolved regulatory proceedings in numerous jurisdictions. We filed a resource plan in Minnesota with significant carbon reduction. We are reaffirming our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance of $2.12 to $2.27 per share. 
Finally, we are well-positioned to deliver on our value proposition, which includes earnings growth of 4% to 6% annually and dividend growth of 5% to 7% annually with the payout target of 60% to 70%. Operator, we'll now take questions."

But probably be most of it will probably be in the back end of our capital forecast. But Ali let me just reiterate, you've got solid transparency for the first 3 years. Bonus depreciation is not having impact on us in the first 3 years and we explained the reasons why for that. You look at years 4 and 5 and what I see and why I'm bullish on what happened with the extenders bill is I see reduced regulatory risk, which I think is upside to exceed our gap closure on ROE of 50 basis points. I see more customer bills. I think, that plays well to our multiyear plan discussions here at Minnesota. But then as an environmental leader that we've been and with the amount of renewables that are now been made so much more affordable by the ITC and PTC extension, I think we're being conservative, but I think, we can capture with credibility that capital upside. I mean, there's a lot of renewables that are going to be built in our jurisdiction and if we follow with policy mandates and do it with large-scale renewables in mind, it's going to be very affordable and you're basically going to trade off natural gas expense for renewable and we're really -- we're excited about it.

I'll begin by reviewing some of the highlights from 2015. We had another successful year at Xcel Energy, delivering ongoing earnings of $2.09 per share, despite some challenging weather, weak sales and some regulatory setbacks. We have now met or exceeded our earnings guidance for 11 consecutive years. 
We also increased the dividend 6.7% and raised the dividend growth objective to 5% to 7%. This marks the 12th consecutive annual dividend increase. Finally, we maintained our strong credit ratings and delivered a 3.8% total return in 2015, outperforming most of the utilities and moving to a premium valuation. We had a busy and overall successful regulatory calendar, resolving rate cases in Minnesota, Colorado, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Texas in addition to the Monticello Prudence review. 
In 2015, we continue to pursue multiyear compacts, which support our strategic plan and provide certainty to the company, our customers and our shareholders. We were successful in implementing a second 3-year plan in Colorado and we filed a comprehensive multiyear plan in Minnesota. We were also encouraged by the legislation that was passed in Minnesota and Texas, which provides us with additional tools to reduce regulatory lag. In Minnesota, we filed a bold resource plan that will achieve a 60% carbon reduction by 2030. This plan advances the addition of renewables on our system, preserves reliability while ensuring customer benefit and affordability, creates ownership opportunities for us and positions us well to meet the requirements of the EPA's Clean Power Plan. We are encouraged by the broad stakeholder support that we've received. 
In 2015, we continue to demonstrate strong operational performance, particularly in storm restoration. For example, in December, SPS experienced an horrific winter storm with sustained winds between 50 to 80 miles per hour below zero windshield, whiteout conditions and inaccessible roads due to 6- to 10-foot snow drifts. Now even with these challenging conditions, we were able to restore service to 84% of our customers within 12 hours and 98% of our customers within 24 hours. 
This remarkable feat was accomplished as a result of our proactive planning, which began days before the event and, of course, our dedicated employees who sacrificed time with families during the holidays. Our industry-leading storm response was recently recognized by EEI, which gave us our Emergency Recovery Award for our response towards severe weather in Minnesota that impacted 250,000 customers just last summer. 
In 2015, our employees not only provided best-in-class storm response, but also achieved record levels of safety resulting in our eighth consecutive best year ever. Safety is a critical priority to Xcel Energy and we're committed to sending all employees home every day without injury. Clearly, we believe there's a strong correlation between safety and employee engagement and productivity. We also had an excellent start to the construction of the 200-megawatt Courtenay  Wind project in North Dakota. We expect the wind farm to be in service by year end ahead of schedule and on budget. 
Moving to 2016. Earlier this week PSCo filed an application with the Colorado Commission to establish a framework for potential investments in natural gas reserves. This filing proposes a plan to take advantage of historically low natural gas prices, provides a long-term hedge against market fluctuations and offers predictable natural gas prices for the long-term benefit of our customers. The Colorado Commission will have 240 days to reach a decision on the regulatory framework. If the commission approves the framework, we would then seek approval for our potential investment assuming it is beneficial for our customers. It's important to recognize that market conditions need to be conducive for investment to be made but having an established framework in place will allow us to be opportunistic. As a reminder, the potential investment for rate basing of natural gas reserve is not included in our base capital forecast and represents another growth initiative as part of our upside capital forecast. 
Finally, while Teresa will go into more detail, I wanted to address the high-level impact of the  Extenders Bill. Based on our initial analysis, we find it to be a net positive, despite some reduction in rate base growth, and here is why. First, we don't anticipate a material act -- rather a material impact on EPS for the 2016 to 2018 time frame. This is due to multiyear plans and existing NOL tax positions at our major jurisdictions. Second, beyond the 2018 time frame, the bill reduces revenue requirements and lowers bill increases for our customers. This reduces regulatory risk, which increases our ability to close the ROE gap. Frankly, I believe, it gives us an opportunity to go beyond the 50 basis points of ROE improvement. It also increases headroom for additional capital investment. Finally, we view the extensions of PTC and ITC favorably as it makes large-scale renewables become even more affordable for our customers. As a result, we continue to be very confident in our ability to deliver ongoing earnings consistent with our 4 to 6 EPS growth objective. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook in addition to our regulatory update. Teresa?"

We had another strong year and delivered 2015 ongoing earnings of $2.09 per share compared with $2.03 in 2014. The key takeaway is that we implemented significant cost initiatives and management action to offset negative weather, sluggish sales and certain unfavorable regulatory outcomes allowing us to deliver earnings within our guidance range. The following key drivers positively impacted earnings: electric rate increases in riders; a lower earnings tax refund in Colorado; and reduced O&M expenses. These positive factors were partially offset by several items. We experienced unfavorable weather, which reduced earnings by $0.07 per share compared with last year and reduced earnings by $0.04 per share when compared to normal weather condition. In addition, we had higher depreciation, property taxes and interest expense as well as lower AFUDC.
Turning to sales, our weather normalized electric sales were down 0.2% for the year. The decline was primarily attributable to the impact of lower oil and natural gas prices and lower use per customer. This was partially offset by strong customer additions of nearly 1%. The economies in our service territories remain healthy with average unemployment of 3.4% compared to the national rate of 5%. While sales declined slightly in 2015, we are expecting modest sales growth of 0.5% to 1% in 2016. 
Our projections are based on the following factors. 2016 is a leap year and the extra day accounts for 0.3% of growth. In addition, growth in the number of customers is projected to outpace the decline in use per customer, providing positive growth in residential sale. Finally, several large C&I customers experienced reduced load in 2015 that we expect to stabilize. We did see growth for other C&I customers but at a slower rate. O&M expenses decreased $4.7 million or 0.2% in 2015, exceeding our guidance range of an increase of 0% to 2%. 
As I previously mentioned, we experienced some headwinds during the year and the management team responded by reducing cost to deliver earnings consistent with investor expectations. These actions demonstrate our commitment to bending the cost curve and meeting our financial objective. 
Now I'll provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. Yesterday, the commission moved in our Colorado natural gas rate case, while written order has yet to be issued and we haven't had a chance to fully analyze the results, we wanted to give you a high-level overview of the verbal decision. The commission largely approved the ALJ's recommended decision with a couple of changes. Key decisions include: a single year rate plan versus our request for a multiyear plan; a 3-year extension of the PSIA rider; and ROE of 9.5% and an equity ratio of 56.5%. We will file an 8-K with more details after we have fully analyzed the results. In our Texas electric rate case, the commission ordered a rate decrease of $4 million compared with our request for a rate increase of $42 million. 
The commission's decision was very disappointing and significantly lower than the ALJ recommendation. Key elements include: rejection of SPS's request for post test year capital addition; disallowance of SPS's proposed known and measurable adjustment for updated allocation factors between customer classes related to load reductions of a wholesale customer effective June 2015; disallowance of incentive compensation; and a reduction in the equity ratio. We've been very upfront that the earned ROEs need to improve at SPS. And while we made improvements in the ROE, we are still not earning at an acceptable level. As you know, it is a high priority for us to close the ROE gap. We have filed for rehearing and plan to file a new rate case this quarter that will incorporate provisions of the recently passed legislation, designed to reduce regulatory lag. As a reminder, this new legislation provides for: inclusion of post test year capital addition; timelier implementation of new rates and enhanced recovery for new natural gas plant investment. We believe this will help us achieve a more constructive outcome in the upcoming case. 
In November, we filed a multiyear rate case in Minnesota that provides for various implementation alternative. In December, the commission approved our 2016 interim rate request of approximately $164 million. The commission deferred a decision on our proposed 2017 interim rate and indicated NSP-Minnesota could resume its interim request in the third quarter for consideration. The procedure of schedule has been established, which provides for a final decision in June of 2017. However, as part of the schedule, we have outlined the path for meaningful settlement discussion, which may shorten the time line to reach resolution in the case. 
Next I'd like to discuss the impact of the recently passed 5-year extension of bonus depreciation. At our Analyst Meeting in December, we provided our updated 5-year base capital forecast of $15.2 billion. The extension of bonus depreciation will reduce the rate case CAGR by approximately 70 to 80 basis points resulting in rate base growth of about 3.7% for a base capital plan. While bonus depreciation reduces rate base growth it also reduces the impact on the customer bill and creates more headroom for potential investment. 
At our Analyst Meeting, we also presented an upside scenario to our capital forecast, which included: incremental investment for renewables related to the Minnesota resource plan; distribution grid modernization; and natural gas reserves in Colorado. In addition, earlier this week, we announced our energy future plan in Colorado, which creates some further investment opportunity. As a result, we have increased our upside capital forecast to $2.5 billion. This forecast reflects potential investments having a reasonable probability of coming to fruition over the next 5 years. The upside capital forecast of $17.7 billion over the 5-year time frame results in an annual rate base growth of approximately 5.5%, including the impact of bonus depreciation. As a result of our robust capital investment opportunity and our actions to improve our ROE, we remain very confident in our ability to deliver on our 4% to 6% earnings growth objective, even with the impact of the bonus depreciation extension. 
In summary, 2015 was another excellent year for Xcel Energy. We delivered earnings within our guidance range for the 11th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 12th straight year. We initiated cost management actions, which resulted in a decline in O&M expenses. New legislation was passed in Minnesota and Texas, which will provide more tools to reduce regulatory lag. We resolved regulatory proceedings in numerous jurisdictions. We filed a bold resource plan in Minnesota with significant carbon reduction, we are reaffirming our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance of $2.12 to $2.27 per share. 
Finally, we are well-positioned to deliver on our value proposition, which includes earnings growth of 4% to 6% annually and dividend growth of 5% to 7% annually with the payout target of 60% to 70%. Operator, we'll now take questions."

But Ali let me just reiterate, you've got solid transparency for the first 3 years. Bonus depreciation is not having an impact on us in the first 3 years and we explained the reasons why for that. You look at years 4 and 5 and what I see and why I'm bullish on what happened with the Extenders Bill is I see reduced regulatory risk, which I think is upside to exceed our gap closure on ROE of 50 basis points. I see more affordable customer bills. I think that plays well to our multiyear plan discussions here in Minnesota but then as an environmental leader that we've been and with the amount of renewables that are now been made so much more affordable by the ITC and PTC extension, I think we're being conservative, but I think we can capture with credibility that capital upside. I mean, there's a lot of renewables that are going to be built in our jurisdiction and if we follow good policy mandates and do it with large-scale renewables in mind, it's going to be very affordable and you're basically going to trade off natural gas expense for renewable and we're really -- we're excited about it. And I think it's going to -- it's done a lot for us. And so as you know, we were the first, I think, the first utility to talk about the impact of bonus depreciation and we've been thinking about how we would turn that into an upside for us and I'm really confident in our plans."

Remember, we talked about how we would pursue a capital upside forecast at our Analyst Day and what we've done is with the filing of the Colorado energy plan, have updated that capital forecast, because we didn't have renewables from Colorado in that Analyst Day presentation and we should. And I'm confident that you're going to see more renewables because of the ITC, PTC has been extended. In fact, if you think about it, the PTC, it does phase down quicker than the ITC. So if you're staging it, you probably focus on more wind initially. And you don't -- you've got to look at the NOLs, too, as I think Teresa was talking about at the OpCo level specifically then it rolls up to the HoldCo.

I'll begin by reviewing some of the highlights from 2015. We had another successful year at Xcel Energy, delivering ongoing earnings of $2.09 per share, despite some challenging weather, weak sales and some regulatory setbacks. We have now met or exceeded our earnings guidance for 11 consecutive years. 
We also increased the dividend 6.7% and raised the dividend growth objective to 5% to 7%. This marks the 12th consecutive annual dividend increase. Finally, we maintained our strong credit ratings and delivered a 3.8% total return in 2015, outperforming most of the utilities and moving to a premium valuation. We had a busy and overall successful regulatory calendar, resolving rate cases in Minnesota, Colorado, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Texas in addition to the Monticello Prudence review. 
In 2015, we continue to pursue multiyear compacts, which support our strategic plan and provide certainty to the company, our customers and our shareholders. We were successful in implementing a second 3-year plan in Colorado and we filed a comprehensive multiyear plan in Minnesota. We were also encouraged by the legislation that was passed in Minnesota and Texas, which provides us with additional tools to reduce regulatory lag. In Minnesota, we filed a bold resource plan that will achieve a 60% carbon reduction by 2030. This plan advances the addition of renewables on our system, preserves reliability while ensuring customer benefit and affordability, creates ownership opportunities for us and positions us well to meet the requirements of the EPA's Clean Power Plan. We are encouraged by the broad stakeholder support that we've received. 
In 2015, we continue to demonstrate strong operational performance, particularly in storm restoration. For example, in December, SPS experienced an horrific winter storm with sustained winds between 50 to 80 miles per hour below zero wind chill, whiteout conditions and inaccessible roads due to 6- to 10-foot snow drifts. Now even with these challenging conditions, we were able to restore service to 84% of our customers within 12 hours and 98% of our customers within 24 hours. 
This remarkable feat was accomplished as a result of our proactive planning, which began days before the event and, of course, our dedicated employees who sacrificed time with families during the holidays. Our industry-leading storm response was recently recognized by EEI, which gave us our Emergency Recovery Award for our response towards severe weather in Minnesota that impacted 250,000 customers just last summer. 
In 2015, our employees not only provided best-in-class storm response, but also achieved record levels of safety resulting in our eighth consecutive best year ever. Safety is a critical priority to Xcel Energy and we're committed to sending all employees home every day without injury. Clearly, we believe there's a strong correlation between safety and employee engagement and productivity. We also had an excellent start to the construction of the 200-megawatt Courtenay  Wind project in North Dakota. We expect the wind farm to be in service by year end ahead of schedule and on budget. 
Moving to 2016. Earlier this week PSCo filed an application with the Colorado Commission to establish a framework for potential investments in natural gas reserves. This filing proposes a plan to take advantage of historically low natural gas prices, provides a long-term hedge against market fluctuations and offers predictable natural gas prices for the long-term benefit of our customers. The Colorado Commission will have 240 days to reach a decision on the regulatory framework. If the commission approves the framework, we would then seek approval for our potential investment assuming it is beneficial for our customers. It's important to recognize that market conditions need to be conducive for an investment to be made but having an established framework in place will allow us to be opportunistic. As a reminder, the potential investment for rate basing of natural gas reserves is not included in our base capital forecast and represents another growth initiative as part of our upside capital forecast. 
Finally, while Teresa will go into more detail, I wanted to address the high-level impact of the  Extenders Bill. Based on our initial analysis, we find it to be a net positive, despite some reduction in rate base growth, and here is why. First, we don't anticipate a material act -- rather a material impact on EPS for the 2016 to 2018 time frame. This is due to multiyear plans and existing NOL tax positions at our major jurisdictions. Second, beyond the 2018 time frame, the bill reduces revenue requirements and lowers bill increases for our customers. This reduces regulatory risk, which increases our ability to close the ROE gap. Frankly, I believe, it gives us an opportunity to go beyond the 50 basis points of ROE improvement. It also increases headroom for additional capital investment. Finally, we view the extensions of PTC and ITC favorably as it makes large-scale renewables become even more affordable for our customers. As a result, we continue to be very confident in our ability to deliver ongoing earnings consistent with our 4 to 6 EPS growth objective. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook in addition to our regulatory update. Teresa?"

We had another strong year and delivered 2015 ongoing earnings of $2.09 per share compared with $2.03 in 2014. The key takeaway is that we implemented significant cost initiatives and management actions to offset negative weather, sluggish sales and certain unfavorable regulatory outcomes allowing us to deliver earnings within our guidance range. The following key drivers positively impacted earnings: electric rate increases in riders; a lower earnings tax refund in Colorado; and reduced O&M expenses. These positive factors were partially offset by several items. We experienced unfavorable weather, which reduced earnings by $0.07 per share compared with last year and reduced earnings by $0.04 per share when compared to normal weather conditions. In addition, we had higher depreciation, property taxes and interest expense as well as lower AFUDC.
Turning to sales, our weather normalized electric sales were down 0.2% for the year. The decline was primarily attributable to the impact of lower oil and natural gas prices and lower use per customer. This was partially offset by strong customer additions of nearly 1%. The economies in our service territories remain healthy with average unemployment of 3.4% compared to the national rate of 5%. While sales declined slightly in 2015, we are expecting modest sales growth of 0.5% to 1% in 2016. 
Our projections are based on the following factors. 2016 is a leap year and the extra day accounts for 0.3% of growth. In addition, growth in the number of customers is projected to outpace the decline in use per customer, providing positive growth in residential sale. Finally, several large C&I customers experienced reduced load in 2015 that we expect to stabilize. We did see growth for other C&I customers but at a slower rate. O&M expenses decreased $4.7 million or 0.2% in 2015, exceeding our guidance range of an increase of 0% to 2%. 
As I previously mentioned, we experienced some headwinds during the year and the management team responded by reducing cost to deliver earnings consistent with investor expectations. These actions demonstrate our commitment to bending the cost curve and meeting our financial objective. 
Now I'll provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. Yesterday, the commission moved in our Colorado natural gas rate case, while written order has yet to be issued and we haven't had a chance to fully analyze the results, we wanted to give you a high-level overview of the verbal decision. The commission largely approved the ALJ's recommended decision with a couple of changes. Key decisions include: a single year rate plan versus our request for a multiyear plan; a 3-year extension of the PSIA rider; and ROE of 9.5% and an equity ratio of 56.5%. We will file an 8-K with more details after we have fully analyzed the results. In our Texas electric rate case, the commission ordered a rate decrease of $4 million compared with our request for a rate increase of $42 million. 
The commission's decision was very disappointing and significantly lower than the ALJ recommendation. Key elements include: rejection of SPS's request for post test year capital addition; disallowance of SPS's proposed known and measurable adjustment for updated allocation factors between customer classes related to load reductions of a wholesale customer effective June 2015; disallowance of incentive compensation; and a reduction in the equity ratio. We've been very upfront that the earned ROEs need to improve at SPS. And while we made improvements in the ROE, we are still not earning at an acceptable level. As you know, it is a high priority for us to close the ROE gap. We have filed for rehearing and plan to file a new rate case this quarter that will incorporate provisions of the recently passed legislation, designed to reduce regulatory lag. As a reminder, this new legislation provides for: inclusion of post test year capital addition; timelier implementation of new rates and enhanced recovery for new natural gas plant investment. We believe this will help us achieve a more constructive outcome in the upcoming case. 
In November, we filed a multiyear rate case in Minnesota that provides for various implementation alternatives. In December, the commission approved our 2016 interim rate request of approximately $164 million. The commission deferred a decision on our proposed 2017 interim rate and indicated NSP-Minnesota could resubmit its interim request in the third quarter for consideration. The procedure of schedule has been established, which provides for a final decision in June of 2017. However, as part of the schedule, we have outlined the path for meaningful settlement discussion, which may shorten the time line to reach resolution in the case. 
Next I'd like to discuss the impact of the recently passed 5-year extension of bonus depreciation. At our Analyst Meeting in December, we provided our updated 5-year base capital forecast of $15.2 billion. The extension of bonus depreciation will reduce the rate base CAGR by approximately 70 to 80 basis points resulting in rate base growth of about 3.7% for a base capital plan. While bonus depreciation reduces rate base growth it also reduces the impact on the customer bill and creates more headroom for potential investment. 
At our Analyst Meeting, we also presented an upside scenario to our capital forecast, which included: incremental investment for renewables related to the Minnesota resource plan; distribution grid modernization; and natural gas reserves in Colorado. In addition, earlier this week, we announced our energy future plan in Colorado, which creates some further investment opportunity. As a result, we have increased our upside capital forecast to $2.5 billion. This forecast reflects potential investments having a reasonable probability of coming to fruition over the next 5 years. The upside capital forecast of $17.7 billion over the 5-year time frame results in an annual rate base growth of approximately 5.5%, including the impact of bonus depreciation. As a result of our robust capital investment opportunity and our actions to improve our ROE, we remain very confident in our ability to deliver on our 4% to 6% earnings growth objective, even with the impact of the bonus depreciation extension. 
In summary, 2015 was another excellent year for Xcel Energy. We delivered earnings within our guidance range for the 11th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 12th straight year. We initiated cost management actions, which resulted in a decline in O&M expenses. New legislation was passed in Minnesota and Texas, which will provide more tools to reduce regulatory lag. We resolved regulatory proceedings in numerous jurisdictions. We filed a bold resource plan in Minnesota with significant carbon reduction, we are reaffirming our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance of $2.12 to $2.27 per share. 
Finally, we are well-positioned to deliver on our value proposition, which includes earnings growth of 4% to 6% annually and dividend growth of 5% to 7% annually with the payout target of 60% to 70%. Operator, we'll now take questions."

But Ali let me just reiterate, you've got solid transparency for the first 3 years. Bonus depreciation is not having an impact on us in the first 3 years and we explained the reasons why for that. You look at years 4 and 5 and what I see and why I'm bullish on what happened with the Extenders Bill is I see reduced regulatory risk, which I think get us upside to exceed our gap closure on ROE of 50 basis points. I see more affordable customer bills. I think that plays well to our multiyear plan discussions here in Minnesota but then as an environmental leader that we've been and with the amount of renewables that are now been made so much more affordable by the ITC and PTC extension, I think we're being conservative, but I think we can capture with credibility that capital upside. I mean, there's a lot of renewables that are going to be built in our jurisdiction and if we follow good policy mandates and do it with large-scale renewables in mind, it's going to be very affordable and you're basically going to trade off natural gas expense for renewable and we're really -- we're excited about it. And I think it's going to -- it's done a lot for us. And so as you know, we were the first, I think, the first utility to talk about the impact of bonus depreciation and we've been thinking about how we would turn that into an upside for us and I'm really confident in our plans."

Remember, we talked about how we would pursue a capital upside forecast at our Analyst Day and what we've done is with the filing of the Colorado energy plan, have updated that capital forecast, because we didn't have renewables from Colorado in that Analyst Day presentation and we should. And I'm confident that you're going to see more renewables because of the ITC, PTC has been extended. In fact, if you think about it, the PTC, it does phase down quicker than the ITC. So if you're staging it, you probably focus on more wind initially. And you don't -- you've got to look at the NOLs, too, as I think Teresa was talking about at the OpCo level specifically then it rolls up to the HoldCo.

I'll begin by reviewing some of the highlights from 2015. We had another successful year at Xcel Energy, delivering ongoing earnings of $2.09 per share, despite some challenging weather, weak sales and some regulatory setbacks. We have now met or exceeded our earnings guidance for 11 consecutive years. 
We also increased the dividend 6.7% and raised the dividend growth objective to 5% to 7%. This marks the 12th consecutive annual dividend increase. Finally, we maintained our strong credit ratings and delivered a 3.8% total return in 2015, outperforming most of the utilities and moving to a premium valuation. We had a busy and overall successful regulatory calendar, resolving rate cases in Minnesota, Colorado, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Texas in addition to the Monticello Prudence review. 
In 2015, we continue to pursue multiyear compacts, which support our strategic plan and provide certainty to the company, our customers and our shareholders. We were successful in implementing a second 3-year plan in Colorado and we filed a comprehensive multiyear plan in Minnesota. We were also encouraged by the legislation that was passed in Minnesota and Texas, which provides us with additional tools to reduce regulatory lag. In Minnesota, we filed a bold resource plan that will achieve a 60% carbon reduction by 2030. This plan advances the addition of renewables on our system, preserves reliability while ensuring customer benefit and affordability, creates ownership opportunities for us and positions us well to meet the requirements of the EPA's Clean Power Plan. We are encouraged by the broad stakeholder support that we've received. 
In 2015, we continue to demonstrate strong operational performance, particularly in storm restoration. For example, in December, SPS experienced an horrific winter storm with sustained winds between 50 to 80 miles per hour below zero wind chill, whiteout conditions and inaccessible roads due to 6- to 10-foot snow drifts. Now even with these challenging conditions, we were able to restore service to 84% of our customers within 12 hours and 98% of our customers within 24 hours. 
This remarkable feat was accomplished as a result of our proactive planning, which began days before the event and, of course, our dedicated employees who sacrificed time with families during the holidays. Our industry-leading storm response was recently recognized by EEI, which gave us our Emergency Recovery Award for our response towards severe weather in Minnesota that impacted 250,000 customers just last summer. 
In 2015, our employees not only provided best-in-class storm response, but also achieved record levels of safety resulting in our eighth consecutive best year ever. Safety is a critical priority to Xcel Energy and we're committed to sending all employees home every day without injury. Clearly, we believe there's a strong correlation between safety and employee engagement and productivity. We also had an excellent start to the construction of the 200-megawatt Courtenay Wind project in North Dakota. We expect the wind farm to be in service by year end ahead of schedule and on budget. 
Moving to 2016. Earlier this week PSCo filed an application with the Colorado Commission to establish a framework for potential investments in natural gas reserves. This filing proposes a plan to take advantage of historically low natural gas prices, provides a long-term hedge against market fluctuations and offers predictable natural gas prices for the long-term benefit of our customers. The Colorado Commission will have 240 days to reach a decision on the regulatory framework. If the commission approves the framework, we would then seek approval for our potential investment assuming it is beneficial for our customers. It's important to recognize that market conditions need to be conducive for an investment to be made but having an established framework in place will allow us to be opportunistic. As a reminder, the potential investment for rate basing of natural gas reserves is not included in our base capital forecast and represents another growth initiative as part of our upside capital forecast. 
Finally, while Teresa will go into more detail, I wanted to address the high-level impact of the Extenders Bill. Based on our initial analysis, we find it to be a net positive, despite some reduction in rate base growth, and here is why. First, we don't anticipate a material act -- rather a material impact on EPS for the 2016 to 2018 time frame. This is due to multiyear plans and existing NOL tax positions at our major jurisdictions. Second, beyond the 2018 time frame, the bill reduces revenue requirements and lowers bill increases for our customers. This reduces regulatory risk, which increases our ability to close the ROE gap. Frankly, I believe, it gives us an opportunity to go beyond the 50 basis points of ROE improvement. It also increases headroom for additional capital investment. Finally, we view the extensions of PTC and ITC favorably as it makes large-scale renewables become even more affordable for our customers. As a result, we continue to be very confident in our ability to deliver ongoing earnings consistent with our 4 to 6 EPS growth objective. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook in addition to our regulatory update. Teresa?"

We had another strong year and delivered 2015 ongoing earnings of $2.09 per share compared with $2.03 in 2014. The key takeaway is that we implemented significant cost initiatives and management actions to offset negative weather, sluggish sales and certain unfavorable regulatory outcomes allowing us to deliver earnings within our guidance range. The following key drivers positively impacted earnings: electric rate increases in riders; a lower earnings tax refund in Colorado; and reduced O&M expenses. These positive factors were partially offset by several items. We experienced unfavorable weather, which reduced earnings by $0.07 per share compared with last year and reduced earnings by $0.04 per share when compared to normal weather conditions. In addition, we had higher depreciation, property taxes and interest expense as well as lower AFUDC.
Turning to sales, our weather normalized electric sales were down 0.2% for the year. The decline was primarily attributable to the impact of lower oil and natural gas prices and lower use per customer. This was partially offset by strong customer additions of nearly 1%. The economies in our service territories remain healthy with average unemployment of 3.4% compared to the national rate of 5%. While sales declined slightly in 2015, we are expecting modest sales growth of 0.5% to 1% in 2016. 
Our projections are based on the following factors. 2016 is a leap year and the extra day accounts for 0.3% of growth. In addition, growth in the number of customers is projected to outpace the decline in use per customer, providing positive growth in residential sale. Finally, several large C&I customers experienced reduced load in 2015 that we expect to stabilize. We did see growth for other C&I customers but at a slower rate. O&M expenses decreased $4.7 million or 0.2% in 2015, exceeding our guidance range of an increase of 0% to 2%. 
As I previously mentioned, we experienced some headwinds during the year and the management team responded by reducing cost to deliver earnings consistent with investor expectations. These actions demonstrate our commitment to bending the cost curve and meeting our financial objective. 
Now I'll provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. Yesterday, the commission moved in our Colorado natural gas rate case, while written order has yet to be issued and we haven't had a chance to fully analyze the results, we wanted to give you a high-level overview of the verbal decision. The commission largely approved the ALJ's recommended decision with a couple of changes. Key decisions include: a single year rate plan versus our request for a multiyear plan; a 3-year extension of the PSIA rider; and ROE of 9.5% and an equity ratio of 56.5%. We will file an 8-K with more details after we have fully analyzed the results. In our Texas electric rate case, the commission ordered a rate decrease of $4 million compared with our request for a rate increase of $42 million. 
The commission's decision was very disappointing and significantly lower than the ALJ recommendation. Key elements include: rejection of SPS's request for post test year capital addition; disallowance of SPS's proposed known and measurable adjustment for updated allocation factors between customer classes related to load reductions of a wholesale customer effective June 2015; disallowance of incentive compensation; and a reduction in the equity ratio. We've been very upfront that the earned ROEs need to improve at SPS. And while we made improvements in the ROE, we are still not earning at an acceptable level. As you know, it is a high priority for us to close the ROE gap. We have filed for rehearing and plan to file a new rate case this quarter that will incorporate provisions of the recently passed legislation, designed to reduce regulatory lag. As a reminder, this new legislation provides for: inclusion of post test year capital addition; timelier implementation of new rates and enhanced recovery for new natural gas plant investment. We believe this will help us achieve a more constructive outcome in the upcoming case. 
In November, we filed a multiyear rate case in Minnesota that provides for various implementation alternatives. In December, the commission approved our 2016 interim rate request of approximately $164 million. The commission deferred a decision on our proposed 2017 interim rate and indicated NSP-Minnesota could resubmit its interim request in the third quarter for consideration. The procedure of schedule has been established, which provides for a final decision in June of 2017. However, as part of the schedule, we have outlined the path for meaningful settlement discussion, which may shorten the time line to reach resolution in the case. 
Next I'd like to discuss the impact of the recently passed 5-year extension of bonus depreciation. At our Analyst Meeting in December, we provided our updated 5-year base capital forecast of $15.2 billion. The extension of bonus depreciation will reduce the rate base CAGR by approximately 70 to 80 basis points resulting in rate base growth of about 3.7% for a base capital plan. While bonus depreciation reduces rate base growth it also reduces the impact on the customer bill and creates more headroom for potential investment. 
At our Analyst Meeting, we also presented an upside scenario to our capital forecast, which included: incremental investment for renewables related to the Minnesota resource plan; distribution grid modernization; and natural gas reserves in Colorado. In addition, earlier this week, we announced our energy future plan in Colorado, which creates some further investment opportunity. As a result, we have increased our upside capital forecast to $2.5 billion. This forecast reflects potential investments having a reasonable probability of coming to fruition over the next 5 years. The upside capital forecast of $17.7 billion over the 5-year time frame results in an annual rate base growth of approximately 5.5%, including the impact of bonus depreciation. As a result of our robust capital investment opportunity and our actions to improve our ROE, we remain very confident in our ability to deliver on our 4% to 6% earnings growth objective, even with the impact of the bonus depreciation extension. 
In summary, 2015 was another excellent year for Xcel Energy. We delivered earnings within our guidance range for the 11th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 12th straight year. We initiated cost management actions, which resulted in a decline in O&M expenses. New legislation was passed in Minnesota and Texas, which will provide more tools to reduce regulatory lag. We resolved regulatory proceedings in numerous jurisdictions. We filed a bold resource plan in Minnesota with significant carbon reduction, we are reaffirming our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance of $2.12 to $2.27 per share. 
Finally, we are well-positioned to deliver on our value proposition, which includes earnings growth of 4% to 6% annually and dividend growth of 5% to 7% annually with the payout target of 60% to 70%. Operator, we'll now take questions."

But Ali let me just reiterate, you've got solid transparency for the first 3 years. Bonus depreciation is not having an impact on us in the first 3 years and we explained the reasons why for that. You look at years 4 and 5 and what I see and why I'm bullish on what happened with the Extenders Bill is I see reduced regulatory risk, which I think get us upside to exceed our gap closure on ROE of 50 basis points. I see more affordable customer bills. I think that plays well to our multiyear plan discussions here in Minnesota but then as an environmental leader that we've been and with the amount of renewables that are now been made so much more affordable by the ITC and PTC extension, I think we're being conservative, but I think we can capture with credibility that capital upside. I mean, there's a lot of renewables that are going to be built in our jurisdiction and if we follow good policy mandates and do it with large-scale renewables in mind, it's going to be very affordable and you're basically going to trade off natural gas expense for renewable and we're really -- we're excited about it. And I think it's going to -- it's done a lot for us. And so as you know, we were the first, I think, the first utility to talk about the impact of bonus depreciation and we've been thinking about how we would turn that into an upside for us and I'm really confident in our plans."

I mean, it's also in Minnesota. Remember, we talked about how we would pursue a capital upside forecast at our Analyst Day and what we've done is with the filing of the Colorado energy plan, have updated that capital forecast, because we didn't have renewables from Colorado in that Analyst Day presentation and we should. And I'm confident that you're going to see more renewables because of the ITC, PTC has been extended. In fact, if you think about it, the PTC, it does phase down quicker than the ITC. So if you're staging it, you probably focus on more wind initially. And you don't -- you've got to look at the NOLs, too, as I think Teresa was talking about at the OpCo level specifically then it rolls up to the HoldCo. I think what you're referring to, Julien, is maybe something -- if you don't have a tax appetite some of those things got to -- put on the balance sheet for a period of time. And they do, but that's okay. I mean, it turns around and we're very much prepared to wait for that turnaround, because these opportunities, I think, are extremely compelling, realistic and they're right in front of us and they're in our backyard and it's organic growth."

As a leader in renewables, as a leader in converting aging coal plants to natural gas, if you take a look at what we're doing right here in the Upper Midwest with our plan, we'll have reduced carbon emissions by 2030 by 60%, that will exceed the Clean Power Plan targets.

I'll begin by reviewing some of the highlights from 2015. We had another successful year at Xcel Energy, delivering ongoing earnings of $2.09 per share despite some challenging weather, weak sales and some regulatory setbacks. We have now met or exceeded our earnings guidance for 11 consecutive years. We also increased the dividend 6.7% and raised the dividend growth objective to 5% to 7% and this marks the 12th consecutive annual dividend increase. Finally, we maintained our strong credit ratings and delivered a 3.8% total return in 2015, outperforming most other utilities and moving to a premium valuation. We had a busy and overall successful regulatory calendar, resolving rate cases in Minnesota, Colorado, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Texas in addition to the Monticello prudence review. 
In 2015, we continued to pursue multiyear compacts which support our strategic plan and provide certainty to the company, our customers and our shareholders. We were successful in implementing a second 3-year plan in Colorado and we filed a comprehensive multiyear plan in Minnesota. We were also encouraged by the legislation that was passed in Minnesota and Texas which provides us with additional tools to reduce regulatory lag. In Minnesota, we filed a bold resource plan that will achieve a 60% carbon reduction by 2030. This plan advances the addition of renewables on our system, preserves reliability while ensuring customer benefits and affordability, creates ownership opportunities for us and positions us well to meet the requirements of the EPA's Clean Power Plan. We are encouraged by the broad stakeholder support that we've received. 
In 2015, we continued to demonstrate strong operational performance, particularly in storm restoration. For example, in December, SPS experienced an horrific winter storm with sustained winds between 50 to 80 miles per hour below zero wind chill, white-out conditions and inaccessible roads due to 6- to 10-foot snow drifts. Now even with these challenging conditions, we were able to restore service to 84% of our customers within 12 hours and 98% of our customers within 24 hours. 
This remarkable feat was accomplished as a result of our proactive planning, which began days before the event and, of course, our dedicated employees who sacrificed time with families during the holidays. Our industry-leading storm response was recently recognized by EEI, which gave us our Emergency Recovery Award for our response towards severe weather in Minnesota that impacted 250,000 customers just last summer. 
In 2015, our employees not only provided best-in-class storm response, but also achieved record levels of safety resulting in our eighth consecutive best year ever. Safety is a critical priority to Xcel Energy and we're committed to sending all employees home every day without injury. Clearly, we believe there's a strong correlation between safety and employee engagement and productivity. We also had an excellent start to the construction of the 200-megawatt Courtenay wind project in North Dakota. We expect the wind farm to be in service by year-end ahead of schedule and on budget. 
Moving to 2016. Earlier this week PSCo filed an application with the Colorado Commission to establish a framework for potential investments in natural gas reserves. This filing proposes a plan to take advantage of historically low natural gas prices, provides a long-term hedge against market fluctuations and offers predictable natural gas prices for the long-term benefit of our customers. The Colorado Commission will have 240 days to reach a decision on the regulatory framework. If the commission approves the framework, we would then seek approval for a potential investment assuming it is beneficial for our customers. It's important to recognize that market conditions need to be conducive for an investment to be made, but having an established framework in place will allow us to be opportunistic. As a reminder, the potential investment for rate basing of natural gas reserves is not included in our base capital forecast and represents another growth initiative as part of our upside capital forecast. 
Finally, while Teresa will go into more detail, I wanted to address the high level impact of the Extenders Bill. Based on our initial analysis, we find it to be a net positive despite some reduction in rate base growth and here is why. First, we don't anticipate a material act -- rather a material impact on EPS for the 2016 to 2018 time frame. This is due to multiyear plans and existing NOL tax positions at our major jurisdictions. Second, beyond the 2018 time frame, the bill reduces revenue requirements and lowers bill increases for our customers. This reduces regulatory risk, which increases our ability to close the ROE gap. Frankly, I believe it gives us an opportunity to go beyond the 50 basis points of ROE improvement. It also increases headroom for additional capital investment. Finally, we view the extensions of PTC and ITC favorably as it makes large-scale renewables become even more affordable for our customers. As a result, we continue to be very confident in our ability to deliver ongoing earnings consistent with our 4% to 6% EPS growth objective. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook in addition to our regulatory update. Teresa?"

We had another strong year and delivered 2015 ongoing earnings of $2.09 per share compared with $2.03 in 2014. The key takeaway is that we implemented significant cost initiatives and management actions to offset negative weather, sluggish sales and certain unfavorable regulatory outcomes allowing us to deliver earnings within our guidance range. The following key drivers positively impacted earnings: electric rate increases in riders, a lower earnings test refund in Colorado and reduced O&M expenses. These positive factors were partially offset by several items. We experienced unfavorable weather, which reduced earnings by $0.07 per share compared with last year and reduced earnings by $0.04 per share when compared to normal weather conditions. In addition, we had higher depreciation, property taxes and interest expense as well as lower AFUDC.
Turning to sales. Our weather normalized electric sales were down 0.2% for the year. The decline was primarily attributable to the impact of lower oil and natural gas prices and lower use per customer. This was partially offset by strong customer additions of nearly 1%. The economies in our service territories remain healthy with average unemployment of 3.4% compared to the national rate of 5%. While sales declined slightly in 2015, we are expecting modest sales growth of 0.5% to 1% in 2016. 
Our projections are based on the following factors. 2016 is a leap year and the extra day accounts for 0.3% of growth. In addition, growth in the number of customers is projected to outpace the decline in use per customer, providing positive growth in residential sales. Finally, several large C&I customers experienced reduced load in 2015 that we expect to stabilize. We did see growth for other C&I customers but at a slower rate. O&M expenses decreased $4.7 million or 0.2% in 2015, exceeding our guidance range of an increase of 0% to 2%. 
As I previously mentioned, we experienced some headwinds during the year and the management team responded by reducing cost to deliver earnings consistent with investor expectations. These actions demonstrate our commitment to bending the cost curve and meeting our financial objective. 
Now I'll provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. Yesterday, the commission ruled in our Colorado natural gas rate case. While a written order has yet to be issued and we haven't had a chance to fully analyze the results, we wanted to give you a high level overview of the verbal decision. The commission largely approved the ALJ's recommended decision with a couple of changes. Key decisions include: a single year rate plan versus our request for a multiyear plan, a 3-year extension of the PSIA rider and ROE of 9.5% and an equity ratio of 56.5%. We will file an 8-K with more details after we have fully analyzed the results. 
In our Texas electric rate case, the commission ordered a rate decrease of $4 million compared with our request for a rate increase of $42 million. The commission decision was very disappointing and significantly lower than the ALJ recommendation. Key elements include: rejection of SPS's request for post test year capital addition, disallowance of SPS's proposed known and measurable adjustment for updated allocation factors between customer classes related to load reductions of a wholesale customer effective June 2015, disallowance of incentive compensation and a reduction in the equity ratio. We've been very upfront that the earned ROEs need to improve at SPS. And while we made improvements in the earned ROE, we are still not earning at an acceptable level. As you know, it is a high priority for us to close the ROE gap. 
We have filed for rehearing and plan to file a new rate case this quarter that will incorporate provisions of the recently passed legislation designed to reduce regulatory lag. As a reminder, this new legislation provides for inclusion of post test year capital addition, timelier implementation of new rates and enhanced recovery for new natural gas plant investments. We believe this will help us achieve a more constructive outcome in the upcoming case. 
In November, we filed a multiyear rate case in Minnesota that provides for various implementation alternatives. In December, the commission approved our 2016 interim rate request of approximately $164 million. The commission deferred a decision on our proposed 2017 interim rate and indicated NSP-Minnesota could resubmit its interim request in the third quarter for consideration. The procedural schedule has been established which provides for a final decision in June of 2017. However, as part of the schedule, we have outlined a path for meaningful settlement discussion, which may shorten the time line to reach resolution in the case. 
Next, I'd like to discuss the impact of the recently passed 5-year extension of bonus depreciation. At our analyst meeting in December, we provided our updated 5-year base capital forecast of $15.2 billion. The extension of bonus depreciation will reduce the rate base CAGR by approximately 70 to 80 basis points resulting in rate base growth of about 3.7% for our base capital plan. While bonus depreciation reduces rate base growth, it also reduces the impact on the customer bill and creates more headroom for potential investment. At our analyst meeting, we also presented an upside scenario to our capital forecast, which included incremental investment for renewables related to the Minnesota resource plan, distribution grid modernization and natural gas reserves in Colorado. 
In addition, earlier this week, we announced our energy future plan in Colorado, which creates some further investment opportunities. As a result, we have increased our upside capital forecast to $2.5 billion. This forecast reflects potential investment having a reasonable probability of coming to fruition over the next 5 years. The upside capital forecast of $17.7 billion over the 5-year time frame results in an annual rate base growth of approximately 5.5%, including the impact of bonus depreciation. As a result of our robust capital investment opportunities and our actions to improve our ROE, we remain very confident in our ability to deliver on our 4% to 6% earnings growth objective, even with the impact of the bonus depreciation extension. 
In summary, 2015 was another excellent year for Xcel Energy. We delivered earnings within our guidance range for the 11th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 12th straight year. We initiated cost management actions which resulted in a decline in O&M expenses. New legislation was passed in Minnesota and Texas which will provide more tools to reduce regulatory lag. We resolved regulatory proceedings in numerous jurisdictions. We filed a bold resource plan in Minnesota with significant carbon reductions. We are reaffirming our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance of $2.12 to $2.27 per share. 
Finally, we are well positioned to deliver on our value proposition which includes earnings growth of 4% to 6% annually and dividend growth of 5% to 7% annually with the payout target of 60% to 70%.

But Ali, let me just reiterate, you've got solid transparency for the first 3 years. Bonus depreciation is not having an impact on us in the first 3 years and we explained the reasons why for that. You look at years 4 and 5 and what I see and why I'm bullish on what happened with the Extenders Bill is I see reduced regulatory risk, which I think gives us upside to exceed our gap closure on ROE of 50 basis points. I see more affordable customer bills. I think that plays well to our multiyear plan discussions here in Minnesota, but then as an environmental leader that we've been and with the amount of renewables that have now been made so much more affordable by the ITC and PTC extension, I think we're being conservative but I think we can capture with credibility that capital upside. I mean, there's a lot of renewables that are going to be built in our jurisdiction and if we follow good policy mandates and do it with large-scale renewables in mind, it's going to be very affordable and you're basically going to trade off natural gas expense for renewable and we're really -- we're excited about it. And I think it's going to -- it's done a lot for us. And so I guess you know, we were the first -- I think the first utility to talk about the impacts of bonus depreciation and we've been thinking about how we would turn that into an upside for us and I'm really confident in our plans."

And remember, we talked about how we would pursue a capital upside forecast at our analyst day and what we've done is with the filing of the Colorado energy plan, have updated that capital forecast because we didn't have renewables from Colorado in that analyst day presentation and we should. And I'm confident that you're going to see more renewables because of the ITC, PTC has been extended. In fact, if you think about it, the PTC is, it does phase down quicker than the ITC. So if you were staging it, you'd probably focus on more wind initially. And you don't -- you've got to look at the NOLs too, as I think Teresa was talking about at the OpCo level specifically then it rolls up to the HoldCo. I think what you're referring to, Julien, is maybe some -- if you don't have a tax appetite, some of those things get put on the balance sheet for a period of time and they do, but that's okay.

I'll begin by reviewing some of the highlights from 2015. We had another successful year at Xcel Energy, delivering ongoing earnings of $2.09 per share despite some challenging weather, weak sales and some regulatory setbacks. We have now met or exceeded our earnings guidance for 11 consecutive years. We also increased the dividend 6.7% and raised the dividend growth objective to 5% to 7% and this marks the 12th consecutive annual dividend increase. Finally, we maintained our strong credit ratings and delivered a 3.8% total return in 2015, outperforming most other utilities and moving to a premium valuation. We had a busy and overall successful regulatory calendar, resolving rate cases in Minnesota, Colorado, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Texas in addition to the Monticello prudence review. 
In 2015, we continued to pursue multiyear compacts which support our strategic plan and provide certainty to the company, our customers and our shareholders. We were successful in implementing a second 3-year plan in Colorado and we filed a comprehensive multiyear plan in Minnesota. We were also encouraged by the legislation that was passed in Minnesota and Texas which provides us with additional tools to reduce regulatory lag. In Minnesota, we filed a bold resource plan that will achieve a 60% carbon reduction by 2030. This plan advances the addition of renewables on our system, preserves reliability while ensuring customer benefits and affordability, creates ownership opportunities for us and positions us well to meet the requirements of the EPA's Clean Power Plan. We are encouraged by the broad stakeholder support that we've received. 
In 2015, we continued to demonstrate strong operational performance, particularly in storm restoration. For example, in December, SPS experienced an horrific winter storm with sustained winds between 50 to 80 miles per hour below 0 wind chill, white-out conditions and inaccessible roads due to 6- to 10-foot snow drifts. Now even with these challenging conditions, we were able to restore service to 84% of our customers within 12 hours and 98% of our customers within 24 hours. 
This remarkable feat was accomplished as a result of our proactive planning, which began days before the event and, of course, our dedicated employees who sacrificed time with families during the holidays. Our industry-leading storm response was recently recognized by EEI, which gave us our Emergency Recovery Award for our response towards severe weather in Minnesota that impacted 250,000 customers just last summer. 
In 2015, our employees not only provided best-in-class storm response, but also achieved record levels of safety resulting in our eighth consecutive best year ever. Safety is a critical priority to Xcel Energy and we're committed to sending all employees home every day without injury. Clearly, we believe there's a strong correlation between safety and employee engagement and productivity. We also had an excellent start to the construction of the 200-megawatt Courtenay wind project in North Dakota. We expect the wind farm to be in service by year-end ahead of schedule and on budget. 
Moving to 2016. Earlier this week PSCo filed an application with the Colorado Commission to establish a framework for potential investments in natural gas reserves. This filing proposes a plan to take advantage of historically low natural gas prices, provides a long-term hedge against market fluctuations and offers predictable natural gas prices for the long-term benefit of our customers. The Colorado Commission will have 240 days to reach a decision on the regulatory framework. If the commission approves the framework, we would then seek approval for a potential investment assuming it is beneficial for our customers. It's important to recognize that market conditions need to be conducive for an investment to be made, but having an established framework in place will allow us to be opportunistic. As a reminder, the potential investment for rate basing of natural gas reserves is not included in our base capital forecast and represents another growth initiative as part of our upside capital forecast. 
Finally, while Teresa will go into more detail, I wanted to address the high level impact of the Extenders Bill. Based on our initial analysis, we find it to be a net positive despite some reduction in rate base growth and here is why. First, we don't anticipate a material act -- rather a material impact on EPS for the 2016 to 2018 time frame. This is due to multiyear plans and existing NOL tax positions at our major jurisdictions. Second, beyond the 2018 time frame, the bill reduces revenue requirements and lowers bill increases for our customers. This reduces regulatory risk, which increases our ability to close the ROE gap. Frankly, I believe it gives us an opportunity to go beyond the 50 basis points of ROE improvement. It also increases headroom for additional capital investment. Finally, we view the extensions of PTC and ITC favorably as it makes large-scale renewables become even more affordable for our customers. As a result, we continue to be very confident in our ability to deliver ongoing earnings consistent with our 4% to 6% EPS growth objective. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Teresa to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook in addition to our regulatory update. Teresa?"

We had another strong year and delivered 2015 ongoing earnings of $2.09 per share compared with $2.03 in 2014. The key takeaway is that we implemented significant cost initiatives and management actions to offset negative weather, sluggish sales and certain unfavorable regulatory outcomes allowing us to deliver earnings within our guidance range. The following key drivers positively impacted earnings: electric rate increases in riders, a lower earnings test refund in Colorado and reduced O&M expenses. These positive factors were partially offset by several items. We experienced unfavorable weather, which reduced earnings by $0.07 per share compared with last year and reduced earnings by $0.04 per share when compared to normal weather conditions. In addition, we had higher depreciation, property taxes and interest expense as well as lower AFUDC.
Turning to sales. Our weather normalized electric sales were down 0.2% for the year. The decline was primarily attributable to the impact of lower oil and natural gas prices and lower use per customer. This was partially offset by strong customer additions of nearly 1%. The economies in our service territories remain healthy with average unemployment of 3.4% compared to the national rate of 5%. While sales declined slightly in 2015, we are expecting modest sales growth of 0.5% to 1% in 2016. 
Our projections are based on the following factors. 2016 is a leap year and the extra day accounts for 0.3% of growth. In addition, growth in the number of customers is projected to outpace the decline in use per customer, providing positive growth in residential sales. Finally, several large C&I customers experienced reduced load in 2015 that we expect to stabilize. We did see growth for other C&I customers but at a slower rate. O&M expenses decreased $4.7 million or 0.2% in 2015, exceeding our guidance range of an increase of 0% to 2%. 
As I previously mentioned, we experienced some headwinds during the year and the management team responded by reducing cost to deliver earnings consistent with investor expectations. These actions demonstrate our commitment to bending the cost curve and meeting our financial objective. 
Now I'll provide an update on several regulatory proceedings. Additional details are included in our earnings release. Yesterday, the commission ruled in our Colorado natural gas rate case. While a written order has yet to be issued and we haven't had a chance to fully analyze the results, we wanted to give you a high level overview of the verbal decision. The commission largely approved the ALJ's recommended decision with a couple of changes. Key decisions include: a single year rate plan versus our request for a multiyear plan, a 3-year extension of the PSIA rider and ROE of 9.5% and an equity ratio of 56.5%. We will file an 8-K with more details after we have fully analyzed the results. 
In our Texas electric rate case, the commission ordered a rate decrease of $4 million compared with our request for a rate increase of $42 million. The commission decision was very disappointing and significantly lower than the ALJ recommendation. Key elements include: rejection of SPS's request for post test year capital addition, disallowance of SPS's proposed known and measurable adjustment for updated allocation factors between customer classes related to load reductions of a wholesale customer effective June 2015, disallowance of incentive compensation and a reduction in the equity ratio. We've been very upfront that the earned ROEs need to improve at SPS. And while we made improvements in the earned ROE, we are still not earning at an acceptable level. As you know, it is a high priority for us to close the ROE gap. 
We have filed for rehearing and plan to file a new rate case this quarter that will incorporate provisions of the recently passed legislation designed to reduce regulatory lag. As a reminder, this new legislation provides for inclusion of post test year capital addition, timelier implementation of new rates and enhanced recovery for new natural gas plant investments. We believe this will help us achieve a more constructive outcome in the upcoming case. 
In November, we filed a multiyear rate case in Minnesota that provides for various implementation alternatives. In December, the commission approved our 2016 interim rate request of approximately $164 million. The commission deferred a decision on our proposed 2017 interim rate and indicated NSP-Minnesota could resubmit its interim request in the third quarter for consideration. The procedural schedule has been established which provides for a final decision in June of 2017. However, as part of the schedule, we have outlined a path for meaningful settlement discussion, which may shorten the time line to reach resolution in the case. 
Next, I'd like to discuss the impact of the recently passed 5-year extension of bonus depreciation. At our analyst meeting in December, we provided our updated 5-year base capital forecast of $15.2 billion. The extension of bonus depreciation will reduce the rate base CAGR by approximately 70 to 80 basis points resulting in rate base growth of about 3.7% for our base capital plan. While bonus depreciation reduces rate base growth, it also reduces the impact on the customer bill and creates more headroom for potential investment. At our analyst meeting, we also presented an upside scenario to our capital forecast, which included incremental investment for renewables related to the Minnesota resource plan, distribution grid modernization and natural gas reserves in Colorado. 
In addition, earlier this week, we announced our energy future plan in Colorado, which creates some further investment opportunities. As a result, we have increased our upside capital forecast to $2.5 billion. This forecast reflects potential investment having a reasonable probability of coming to fruition over the next 5 years. The upside capital forecast of $17.7 billion over the 5-year time frame results in an annual rate base growth of approximately 5.5%, including the impact of bonus depreciation. As a result of our robust capital investment opportunities and our actions to improve our ROE, we remain very confident in our ability to deliver on our 4% to 6% earnings growth objective, even with the impact of the bonus depreciation extension. 
In summary, 2015 was another excellent year for Xcel Energy. We delivered earnings within our guidance range for the 11th consecutive year. We increased our dividend for the 12th straight year. We initiated cost management actions which resulted in a decline in O&M expenses. New legislation was passed in Minnesota and Texas which will provide more tools to reduce regulatory lag. We resolved regulatory proceedings in numerous jurisdictions. We filed a bold resource plan in Minnesota with significant carbon reductions. We are reaffirming our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance of $2.12 to $2.27 per share. 
Finally, we are well positioned to deliver on our value proposition which includes earnings growth of 4% to 6% annually and dividend growth of 5% to 7% annually with the payout target of 60% to 70%.

But Ali, let me just reiterate, you've got solid transparency for the first 3 years. Bonus depreciation is not having an impact on us in the first 3 years and we explained the reasons why for that. You look at years 4 and 5 and what I see and why I'm bullish on what happened with the Extenders Bill is I see reduced regulatory risk, which I think gives us upside to exceed our gap closure on ROE of 50 basis points. I see more affordable customer bills. I think that plays well to our multiyear plan discussions here in Minnesota, but then as an environmental leader that we've been and with the amount of renewables that have now been made so much more affordable by the ITC and PTC extension, I think we're being conservative but I think we can capture with credibility that capital upside. I mean, there's a lot of renewables that are going to be built in our jurisdiction and if we follow good policy mandates and do it with large-scale renewables in mind, it's going to be very affordable and you're basically going to trade off natural gas expense for renewable and we're really -- we're excited about it. And I think it's going to -- it's done a lot for us. And so I guess you know, we were the first -- I think the first utility to talk about the impacts of bonus depreciation and we've been thinking about how we would turn that into an upside for us and I'm really confident in our plans."

And remember, we talked about how we would pursue a capital upside forecast at our Analyst Day and what we've done is with the filing of the Colorado energy plan, have updated that capital forecast because we didn't have renewables from Colorado in that Analyst Day presentation and we should. And I'm confident that you're going to see more renewables because of the ITC, PTC has been extended. In fact, if you think about it, the PTC is, it does phase down quicker than the ITC. So if you were staging it, you'd probably focus on more wind initially. And you don't -- you've got to look at the NOLs too, as I think Teresa was talking about at the OpCo level specifically then it rolls up to the HoldCo. I think what you're referring to, Julien, is maybe some -- if you don't have a tax appetite, some of those things get put on the balance sheet for a period of time and they do, but that's okay.

One, there's anticipated to be a lot of shakeout if the current oil and gas prices remain and maybe that will create some opportunities for us at reasonable cost, reasonable cost being underscored out there and we'll also continuing to look for organic type, pipeline type growth opportunities in our own regions in part due to the Clean Power Plan and the need for more gas redundancy. But don't look for us to jump into what I would -- which I think you would consider classic midstream assets. I'd also tell you, as we mentioned on the call, that while we're interested in rate base in gas reserves, in today's very low natural gas environment it's difficult to find those opportunities that make sense from a consumer standpoint. But our thought is, as you know, things cycle, commodity prices change and you got to have a framework in place so you can execute on it quickly, opportunistically and that's what we're seeking to accomplish initially in Colorado."

We're pleased to report that everything went very well with the implementation.

GAAP earnings for the first quarter of 2015 were $0.30 per share. As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Ben."

But in summary, we reported ongoing earnings of $0.47 per share for the quarter compared to $0.46 per share last year. Overall, it was a solid quarter in which declining O&M expenses offset unfavorable weather and lower-than-expected sales. While electric sales in the first quarter were below expectations, we expect sales to improve in the second half of the year, and we remain very confident in our ability to deliver earnings within our guidance range. As a result, we are reaffirming our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance of $2.27 per share. As we previously discussed, we are executing on our upside capital investment plan. Later this month, we'll make a filing with the Colorado Commission to add 600 megawatts of wind generation and associated transmission. This represents a rate base investment of just over $1 billion. In April, the commission confirmed our interpretation of a Colorado law that allows you to at least to own 25% to 50% of incremental renewables without going through a competitive bid process. If the project is developed at a reasonable cost compared to similar renewable sources available in the market the cost of this wind project, including transmission, is projected to be below any other existing wind PPAs in the portfolio. We, therefore, believe, we'll be able to demonstrate to the commission and the independent evaluator that this project meets and exceeds the reasonable cost standard and represents tremendous value to our customers. We plan to request the commission's decision by November, so that we can capture the full production credit benefit for our customers. This capital investment is currently reflected in our upside capital If the commission approves this project, we will move it to our base capital forecast, which will result in rate base growth of 4.5%. It's a great example of organic and disciplined growth that provides value to shareholders, customers and the economy in our service territory. You should expect us to continue to find investment opportunities of this nature that will drive us to our upside capital goals. 
Next, I'd like to spend a few minutes recognizing the outstanding efforts of our employees in responding to a major snowstorm in Colorado. In March, Denver and Northern Colorado were hit with a blizzard with 12 to 18 inches of snow and wind gust of over 60 miles per hour that caused approximately 350,000 outages. As a result of proactive planning prior to the storm, and the work of over 950 employees in contract crews, we were able to restore service to 90% of our customers within 12 hours, 98% of our customers within 36 hours and 100% of our customers within 60 hours. This was another example of our world-class storm restoration, and I want to thank all of our employees for their dedication and tremendous efforts to provide excellent customer service and reliability to our customers. 
Turning now to our accomplishments. We recently received several awards that are worth mentioning. In March, the EPA and others recognized Xcel Energy with a 2016 Climate Leadership Award for excellence in greenhouse gas management. The award acknowledges our commitment and progress in reducing CO2 commissions. Military times ranked Xcel Energy as one of the top employers of veterans in 2016. Finally, in April named Xcel Energy is the #1 wind provider of energy for the 12th consecutive year. 
Finally, we recently announced the hiring of Bob Frenzel as our new Executive Vice President and CFO. Bob brings more than 17 years of experience in energy, banking and consulting in addition to 6 years of experience as an officer in the U.S. maybe. He most recently served as Senior Vice President and CFO for Bob brings a wealth of experience that complements our strategies and our business. He understands our industry and has a proven track record of driving excellent performance and solid growth. Some of the key attributes that Bob brings to the table includes strong financial and commercial acumen, excellent strategic vision and execution in engineering and nuclear background, and outstanding experience in managing cost. We have valuable addition to the Xcel Energy team. And it's important to recognize that our strategic plans and priorities are not changing. We will continue to focus on organically growing our regulated operations and maintaining the disciplined financial approach spectrum us I also want to recognize the outstanding service and contributions of Teresa who is retiring after a career spanning 36 years. Teresa played a major role in building our track record of delivering on our value proposition, and she leaves a solid platform for continued strong results. We're very grateful for our many contributions, and we wish her much happiness in here retirement. We'll now turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook in addition to our regulatory update. Bob?"
527542,329506035,978077,"Xcel Energy Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 09, 2016",2016-05-09,"Earnings Calls","Xcel Energy Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ben, for that introduction.

I'm very excited to join Xcel, and I'm honored to follow in the Teresa's footsteps. I commit to continuing Xcel's long tradition of delivering on our financial objectives in growing earnings in a low-risk, transparent and predictable manner. 
Now let's get to the details of the quarter. As Ben indicated, we reported ongoing earnings of $0.47 per share for the quarter as compared to $0.46 per share last year. The most significant drivers in the quarter, include the following: improved electric margins, increased earnings by $0.06 per share. This was largely due to interim rates in Minnesota and capital rider revenue from recovery of capital investment, partially offset by unfavorable weather.  Higher margins in our gas segment increased earnings by $0.01 per share, which was primarily due to rate increases from higher rate base, partially offset by unfavorable weather. Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.01 per share, which reflects cost management and some timing related issues. Partially offsetting these positive drivers, with a higher depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share, primarily reflecting depreciation from new capital investments. 
Turning to our sales results economy in our region remains strong and we continue to add customers, our weather adjusted electric sales declined by 0.3%. Further adjusting for the impact of an extra day of sales in the quarter due to leap year, our weather adjusted electric sales actually declined by 1.4%. The decline in sales is largely driven by lower use per customer from energy efficiency, an increase in the number of multifamily units, the impact of distributed solar and the impact on consumption of lower oil and natural gas prices on some of our larger customers. As a result, we have lowered our full year electric sales growth assumption to 0.5%, from 0.5% to 1% range. We continue to expect positive sales growth for the full year in all jurisdictions due to customer growth as well as planned expansion from some of our larger customers. In addition to lowering our sales assumptions, we've also taken actions to lower our full year O&M expenses. We implemented plans early in the year to offset the impact of the rate reduction in Texas as well as unfavorable weather and lower sales growth. As a result, we now expect to limit our annual O&M expenses to 0% to 1% increase for the full year. As we continue to strive to close our ROE gap, we've been pretty active on the regulatory front. 
Let me provide you a quick update. There are additional details included in our earnings release. In Wisconsin, we recently filed a case seeking an electric rate increase of $17.4 million and a natural gas increase from $4.8 million. This is a limited in ROE and capital structure not expected to be an issue. Decision is expected by December with final rates effective of January of 2017. We also have pending rate cases in Minnesota and in Texas, both cases are in the discovery stage, and as a result, they are attaining material new developments. Finally, we recently filed a settlement in our rate case which was reached between SPS, staff and other parties. The Black Box Settlement reflects a nonfuel base rate increase of $23.5 million. Settlement represents a compromise, which we think is reasonable. The New Mexico Commission is expected to rule in a settlement later this year and new rates are expected to go into effect in August. 
As been mentioned, we are reaffirming our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance with no changes. However, as I previously mentioned, we have updated several of the key assumptions, including electric sales and O&M expenses, as detailed in our earnings release. Also, please note that we've reduced our assumption for capital rider recovery to reflect the transfer some pipeline recovery from the rider to base rates as part of our last Colorado natural gas rate case. The transfer has no material impact on earnings. 
In summary, it was a good quarter for the company, continued vigilance on cost management resulted in lower O&M expenses, which offset unfavorable weather and sluggish sales to deliver solid first quarter earnings. We made significant progress to convert some of our upside capital to base capital with a plan filing to 600 megawatts of wind in Colorado. We anticipate the commission's decision later this year. Finally, we remain on track to deliver ongoing earnings solidly within our 2016 guidance range. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions."

This morning, we will review our 2016 first quarter results and update you on recent business and regulatory developments. You may have noticed that our earnings call is a bit later than normal this quarter. We just implemented a new general ledger system, so we built a little extra time into the schedule. We're pleased to report that everything went very well with the implementation. 
Today's press release refers to both ongoing and GAAP earnings. 2015 first quarter ongoing earnings were $0.46 per share, which exclude a charge of $0.16 per share following a decision by the Minnesota Commission and the Monticello nuclear prudence review. GAAP earnings for the first quarter of 2015 were $0.30 per share. 
As a reminder, some of the comments during today's conference call may contain forward-looking information. Significant factors that could cause results to differ from those anticipated are described in our earnings release and our filings with the SEC. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ben."

But in summary, we reported ongoing earnings of $0.47 per share for the quarter compared to $0.46 per share last year. Overall, it was a solid quarter in which declining O&M expenses offset unfavorable weather and lower-than-expected sales. While electric sales in the first quarter were below expectations, we expect sales to improve in the second half of the year, and we remain very confident in our ability to deliver earnings within our guidance range. As a result, we are reaffirming our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance of $2.12 to $2.27 per share. 
As we've previously discussed, we are executing on our upside capital investment plan. Later this month, we'll make a filing with the Colorado Commission to add 600 megawatts of wind generation and associated transmission. This represents a rate base investment of just over $1 billion. 
In April, the commission confirmed our interpretation of a Colorado law that allows utilities to own 25% to 50% of incremental renewables without going through a competitive bid process. If the project is developed at a reasonable cost compared to similar renewable sources available in the market, the levelized cost of this wind project, including transmission, is projected to be below any other existing wind PPAs in the PSCo portfolio. We therefore believe we'll be able to demonstrate to the commission and the independent evaluator that this project meets and exceeds the reasonable cost standard and represents tremendous value to our customers. We plan to request the commission decision by November so that we can capture the full production tax credit benefit for our customers. This capital investment is currently reflected in our upside capital 4Ks. If the commission approves this project, we will move it to our base capital forecast, which will result in rate base growth of 4.5%. It's a great example of organic and disciplined growth that provides value to shareholders, customers and the economy in our service territory. You should expect us to continue to find investment opportunities of this nature that will drive us to our upside capital goals. 
Next, I'd like to spend a few minutes recognizing the outstanding efforts of our employees in responding to a major snowstorm in Colorado. In March, Denver and Northern Colorado were hit with a blizzard with 12 to 18 inches of snow and wind gust over 60 miles per hour that caused approximately 350,000 outages. As a result of proactive planning prior to the storm and the work of over 950 employees and contract crews, we were able to restore service to 90% of our customers within 12 hours, 98% of our customers within 36 hours and 100% of our customers within 60 hours. This was another example of our world-class storm restoration, and I want to thank all of our employees for their dedication and tremendous efforts to provide excellent customer service and reliability to our customers. 
Turning now to our accomplishments. We recently received several awards that are worth mentioning. In March, the EPA and others recognized Xcel Energy with a 2016 Climate Leadership Award for Excellence in Greenhouse Gas Management. The award acknowledges our commitment and progress in reducing CO2 commissions. Military times ranked Xcel Energy as one of the top employers for veterans in 2016. Finally, in April, AWEA named Xcel Energy the #1 wind provider of energy for the 12th consecutive year. 
Finally, we recently announced the hiring of Bob Frenzel as our new Executive Vice President and CFO. Bob brings more than 17 years of experience in energy, banking and consulting in addition to 6 years of experience as an officer in the U.S. Navy. He most recently served as Senior Vice President and CFO for Luminant. Bob brings a wealth of experience that complements our strategies and our business. He understands our industry and has a proven track record of driving excellent performance and solid growth. Some of the key attributes that Bob brings to the table include strong financial and commercial acumen, excellent strategic vision and execution, an engineering and nuclear background, an outstanding experience at managing cost. He'll be a valuable addition to the Xcel Energy team. 
I think it's important to recognize that our strategic plans and priorities are not changing. We will continue to focus on organically growing our regulated operations and maintaining the disciplined financial approach you've come to expect from us. 
I also want to recognize the outstanding service and contributions of Teresa Madden, who is retiring after a career spanning 36 years. Teresa played a major role in building our track record of delivering on our value proposition, and she leaves a solid platform for continued strong results. We're very grateful for her many contributions, and we wish her much happiness in her retirement. 
We'll now turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook, in addition to our regulatory update. Bob?"

I'm very excited to join Xcel, and I'm honored to follow in Teresa's footsteps. I commit to continuing Xcel's long tradition of delivering on our financial objectives in growing earnings in a low-risk, transparent and predictable manner. 
Now let's get to the details of the quarter. As Ben indicated, we reported ongoing earnings of $0.47 per share for the quarter as compared to $0.46 per share last year. The most significant drivers in the quarter include the following: improved electric margins, increased earnings by $0.06 per share. This was largely due to interim rates in Minnesota and capital rider revenue for recovery of capital investment, partially offset by unfavorable weather. 
Higher gas margins in our gas segment increased earnings by $0.01 per share, which was primarily due to rate increases from higher rate base, partially offset by unfavorable weather. 
Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.01 per share, which reflects cost management and some timing-related issues. Partially offsetting these positive drivers was higher depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share, primarily reflecting depreciation from new capital investments. 
Turning to our sales results. Although the economy in our region remained strong and we continue to add customers, our weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 0.3%. Further adjusting for the impact of an extra day of sales in the quarter due to leap year, our weather-adjusted electric sales actually declined by 1.4%. The decline in sales is largely driven by lower use per customer from energy efficiency, an increase in the number of multifamily units, the impact of distributed solar and the impact on consumption of lower oil and natural gas prices on some of our larger customers. As a result, we have lowered our full year electric sales growth assumption to 0.5% from 0.5% to 1% range. We continue to expect positive sales growth for the full year in all jurisdictions due to customer growth as well as planned expansion from some of our larger customers. 
In addition to lowering our sales assumptions, we have also taken actions to lower our full year O&M expenses. We implemented plans early in the year to offset the impact of the rate reduction in Texas as well as unfavorable weather and lower sales growth. As a result, we now expect to limit our annual O&M expenses to 0% to 1% increase for the full year. 
As we continue to strive to close our ROE gap,  we have been pretty active on the regulatory front. Let me provide you a quick update. There are additional details included in our earnings release. In Wisconsin, we recently filed a case, seeking an electric rate increase of $17.4 million and a natural gas increase of $4.8 million. This is a limited scope case, and ROE and capital structure are not expected to be an issue. A decision is expected by December with final rates effective in January of 2017. We also have pending rate cases in Minnesota and in Texas. Both cases are in the discovery stage, and as a result, they aren't any material new developments. 
Finally, we recently filed a settlement in our New Mexico rate case, which was reached between SPS, the staff and other parties. The black box settlement reflects a nonfuel base rate increase of $23.5 million. The settlement represents a compromise which we think is reasonable. The New Mexico Commission is expected to rule on the settlement later this year, and new rates are expected to go into effect in August. 
As Ben mentioned, we are reaffirming our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance with no changes. However, as I've previously mentioned, we have updated several of the key assumptions, including electric sales and O&M expenses, as detailed in our earnings release. Also, please note that we've reduced our assumption for capital rider recovery to reflect the transfer of some pipeline recovery from the rider to base rates as part of our last Colorado natural gas rate case. The transfer has no material impact on earnings. 
In summary, it was a good quarter for the company. Continued vigilance on cost management resulted in lower O&M expenses, which offset unfavorable weather and sluggish sales to deliver solid first quarter earnings. We made significant progress to convert some of our upside capital to base capital with a plan filing to own 600 megawatts of wind in Colorado. We anticipate a commission decision later this year. Finally, we remain on track to deliver ongoing earnings solidly within our 2016 guidance range. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions."

This morning, we will review our 2016 first quarter results and update you on recent business and regulatory developments.

Today's press release refers to both ongoing and GAAP earnings. 2015 first quarter ongoing earnings were $0.46 per share, which exclude a charge of $0.16 per share following a decision by the Minnesota Commission and the Monticello nuclear prudence review. GAAP earnings for the first quarter of 2015 were $0.30 per share.

But in summary, we reported ongoing earnings of $0.47 per share for the quarter compared to $0.46 per share last year. Overall, it was a solid quarter in which declining O&M expenses offset unfavorable weather and lower-than-expected sales. While electric sales in the first quarter were below expectations, we expect sales to improve in the second half of the year, and we remain very confident in our ability to deliver earnings within our guidance range. As a result, we are reaffirming our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance of $2.12 to $2.27 per share. 
As we've previously discussed, we are executing on our upside capital investment plan. Later this month, we'll make a filing with the Colorado Commission to add 600 megawatts of wind generation and associated transmission. This represents a rate base investment of just over $1 billion. 
In April, the commission confirmed our interpretation of a Colorado law that allows utilities to own 25% to 50% of incremental renewables without going through a competitive bid process. If the project is developed at a reasonable cost compared to similar renewable sources available in the market, the levelized cost of this wind project, including transmission, is projected to be below any other existing wind PPAs in the PSCo portfolio. We therefore believe we'll be able to demonstrate to the commission and the independent evaluator that this project meets and exceeds the reasonable cost standard and represents tremendous value to our customers. We plan to request a commission decision by November so that we can capture the full production tax credit benefit for our customers. This capital investment is currently reflected in our upside capital 4 case [ph] . If the commission approves this project, we will move it to our base capital forecast, which will result in rate base growth of 4.5%. It's a great example of organic and disciplined growth that provides value to shareholders, customers and the economy in our service territory. You should expect us to continue to find investment opportunities of this nature that will drive us to our upside capital goals. 
Next, I'd like to spend a few minutes recognizing the outstanding efforts of our employees in responding to a major snowstorm in Colorado. In March, Denver and Northern Colorado were hit with a blizzard with 12 to 18 inches of snow and wind gusts over 60 miles per hour that caused approximately 350,000 outages. As a result of proactive planning prior to the storm and the work of over 950 employees and contract crews, we were able to restore service to 90% of our customers within 12 hours, 98% of our customers within 36 hours and 100% of our customers within 60 hours. This was another example of our world-class storm restoration, and I want to thank all of our employees for their dedication and tremendous efforts to provide excellent customer service and reliability to our customers. 
Turning now to our accomplishments. We recently received several awards that are worth mentioning. In March, the EPA and others recognized Xcel Energy with a 2016 Climate Leadership Award for Excellence in Greenhouse Gas Management. The award acknowledges our commitment and progress in reducing CO2 commissions. Military Times ranked Xcel Energy as one of the top employers of veterans in 2016. Finally, in April, AWEA named Xcel Energy the #1 wind provider of energy for the 12th consecutive year. 
Finally, we recently announced the hiring of Bob Frenzel as our new Executive Vice President and CFO. Bob brings more than 17 years of experience in energy, banking and consulting in addition to 6 years of experience as an officer in the U.S. Navy. He most recently served as Senior Vice President and CFO for Luminant. Bob brings a wealth of experience that complements our strategies and our business. He understands our industry and has a proven track record of driving excellent performance and solid growth. Some of the key attributes that Bob brings to the table include strong financial and commercial acumen, excellent strategic vision and execution, an engineering and nuclear background, and outstanding experience at managing cost. He'll be a valuable addition to the Xcel Energy team. 
I think it's important to recognize that our strategic plans and priorities are not changing. We will continue to focus on organically growing our regulated operations and maintaining the disciplined financial approach you've come to expect from us. 
I also want to recognize the outstanding service and contributions of Teresa Madden, who is retiring after a career spanning 36 years. Teresa played a major role in building our track record of delivering on our value proposition, and she leaves a solid platform for continued strong results. We're very grateful for her many contributions, and we wish her much happiness in her retirement. 
We'll now turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook, in addition to our regulatory update. Bob?"

I'm very excited to join Xcel, and I'm honored to follow in Teresa's footsteps. I commit to continuing Xcel's long tradition of delivering on our financial objectives and growing earnings in a low-risk, transparent and predictable manner. 
Now let's get to the details of the quarter. As Ben indicated, we reported ongoing earnings of $0.47 per share for the quarter as compared to $0.46 per share last year. The most significant drivers in the quarter include the following: improved electric margins, increased earnings by $0.06 per share. This was largely due to interim rates in Minnesota and capital rider revenue for recovery of capital investment, partially offset by unfavorable weather. 
Higher gas margins in our gas segment increased earnings by $0.01 per share, which was primarily due to rate increases from higher rate base, partially offset by unfavorable weather. 
Lower O&M expenses increased earnings by $0.01 per share, which reflects cost management and some timing-related issues. Partially offsetting these positive drivers was higher depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share, primarily reflecting depreciation from new capital investments. 
Turning to our sales results. Although the economy in our region remained strong and we continue to add customers, our weather-adjusted electric sales declined by 0.3%. Further adjusting for the impact of an extra day of sales in the quarter due to leap year, our weather-adjusted electric sales actually declined by 1.4%. The decline in sales is largely driven by lower use per customer from energy efficiency, an increase in the number of multifamily units, the impact of distributed solar and the impact on consumption of lower oil and natural gas prices on some of our larger customers. As a result, we have lowered our full year electric sales growth assumption to 0.5% from 0.5% to 1% range. We continue to expect positive sales growth for the full year in all jurisdictions due to customer growth as well as planned expansion from some of our larger customers. 
In addition to lowering our sales assumptions, we have also taken actions to lower our full year O&M expenses. We implemented plans early in the year to offset the impact of the rate reduction in Texas as well as unfavorable weather and lower sales growth. As a result, we now expect to limit our annual O&M expenses to 0% to 1% increase for the full year. 
As we continue to strive to close our ROE gap, we have been pretty active on the regulatory front. Let me provide you a quick update. There are additional details included in our earnings release. In Wisconsin, we recently filed a case, seeking an electric rate increase of $17.4 million and a natural gas increase of $4.8 million. This is a limited scope case, and ROE and capital structure are not expected to be an issue. A decision is expected by December with final rates effective in January of 2017. We also have pending rate cases in Minnesota and in Texas. Both cases are in the discovery stage, and as a result, they aren't any material new developments. 
Finally, we recently filed a settlement in our New Mexico rate case, which was reached between SPS, the staff and other parties. The black box settlement reflects a nonfuel base rate increase of $23.5 million. The settlement represents a compromise which we think is reasonable. The New Mexico Commission is expected to rule on the settlement later this year, and new rates are expected to go into effect in August. 
As Ben mentioned, we are reaffirming our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance with no changes. However, as I've previously mentioned, we have updated several of the key assumptions, including electric sales and O&M expenses, as detailed in our earnings release. Also, please note that we've reduced our assumption for capital rider recovery to reflect the transfer of some pipeline recovery from the rider to base rates as part of our last Colorado natural gas rate case. The transfer has no material impact on earnings. 
In summary, it was a good quarter for the company. Continued vigilance on cost management resulted in lower O&M expenses, which offset unfavorable weather and sluggish sales to deliver solid first quarter earnings. We made significant progress to convert some of our upside capital to base capital with a planned filing to own 600 megawatts of wind in Colorado. We anticipate a commission decision later this year. Finally, we remain on track to deliver ongoing earnings solidly within our 2016 guidance range. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions."

Today, we reported GAAP and ongoing earnings of $0.39 per share for the quarter, flat with last year. Our year-to-date earnings are slightly ahead of last year, but a bit behind expectations, reflecting lower-than-expected sales and some unfavorable weather. However, we have taken action to reduce O&M expenses and as a result, we are confident in our ability to deliver ongoing earnings solidly within our 2016 guidance range of $2.12, $2.27 per share, and Bob will provide more detail on our financial results in a few minutes. 
While it's been a busy quarter, we've made significant progress in our regulatory initiatives. Let me start out by addressing some of the highlights. We're making progress in the Minnesota rate case and have participated in several mediation sessions. As a result, we have reached a settlement in principle with several other parties, but the terms remain confidential until we reach a final agreement. The settlement is anticipated to address all revenue issues, any settlement, which still have to be reviewed by the ALJ as well as approved by the commission. We also recently received comments by 15 parties on our Minnesota resource plan. Feedback from the parties was generally supportive for our proposal for early retirement of the 2 units at our [indiscernible] coal plant call, replacement of that generation with natural gas combined cycle unit at [indiscernible] and moving forward, with significant wind additions in the next 5 years. A commission decision is expected later this year. 
Now turning to Colorado. Yesterday, we filed for the implementation of our advanced grid initiative, which comprises major projects to improve the customer experience, enhanced grid reliably and enable the implementation of new and innovative programs and rate structures. The project includes the installation of advanced meters and the implementation of hardware and software applications to enhance the distribution system. The estimated capital investment for the project is $500 million, which is included in our base capital forecast. We're excited about this project and view it as a template for advancing and enhancing our system to meet the needs of our customers. In July, we also filed a decoupling request with the Colorado Commission. The proposed decoupling mechanism would allow PSCo to adjust annual revenues based on changes in weather normalized used per customer for the residential and small C&I classes. And this is very similar to the program that was approved in Minnesota. We expect commission decisions for both the advanced grid initiative and the decoupling proposal by mid-2017. 
And finally, last week, we received testimony in our Rush Creek 600-megawatt wind proposal in Colorado, and in general, we had strong support for our project, including the staff. Colorado staff recommended approval of Rush Creek, subject to certain conditions, including the capital cost cap, a short depreciation life and changes to the timing of the in-service date to coincide with the transmission line. The staff also recommended a granting approval of interim cost recovery through the electric commodity adjustment cost, or the ECA, as we have requested for the project. 
Finally, in support of balance disclosure, I should would point out that of the 9 parties that filed testimony, 1 intervener, the sustainable power group, recommended the application should be denied. And we remain on an accelerated schedule and we expect a commission decision in November of this year. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail in our financial results and outlook in addition to our regulatory update.

Today, we reported GAAP in ongoing earnings of $0.39 per share for the quarter, comparable to the $0.39 per share earned last year. Most significant drivers in the quarter include the following. Electric margin i",772,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. 
Today, we reported GAAP in ongoing earnings of $0.39 per share for the quarter, comparable to the $0.39 per share earned last year. Most significant drivers in the quarter include the following. Electric margin increased earnings by $0.07 per share and natural gas margin increased earnings by $0.01 per share, largely due to rate increases and higher capital rider revenue in various jurisdictions. Offsetting the higher margins were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share, higher interest charges, which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share and increased property taxes, which reduced earnings by $0.01 per share. The higher fixed charges reflect our increased capital investment to have renewables and improve the reliability of the system for the benefit of our customers. Our year-to-date earnings are slightly below plan, largely due to lower-than-expected sales and mild weather experience in the first quarter. However, we have taken actions to hold the line on O&M expenses to offset these headwinds. As a result, we're confident in our ability to deliver ongoing earnings solidly within the 2016 guidance range. 
When we initiated guidance earlier this year, we were anticipating weather adjusted electric sales growth between 1.5% and 1%, this projection include the impact of leap year. However, despite the fact that we continue to see strong customer additions of approximately 1%, our year-to-date weather adjusted electric sales have actually declined about 0.6% or 1.1% when adjusted for the extra day of sales from leap year. Our sales continue to be impacted by lower commodity prices on some of our commercial and industrial customers and declining use per customer in the residential class, driven by conservation efforts and gains in home energy efficiency. And while we had expected some C&I growth in the back half of this year, we believe the commodity and economic backdrops make that unlikely. As a result, we revised our outlook for full year retail electric sales to be approximately 0.5% below 2015 results, which is consistent with where we are year-to-date. As you come to expect from the company, with low sales, we must prudently manage our operating expenses. We implemented various cost management efforts to limit expenses that partially offset some of our revenue headwinds. Our year-to-date O&M expenses are lower than last year, and we expect O&M to be in line at the conclusion of 2016. And we believe that our recent rate outcomes assume we actively manage our costs. Long-term, we continue to mitigate O&M increases through our efforts to improve productivity through capital investment and the use of technology. 
On the regulatory front, we remain busy and have made excellent process in various proceedings in our states. Details of these can be found in our earnings release, but let me provide some highlights. Last year, we filed a multiyear plan in Minnesota, which reflected a requested rate increase of approximately $300 million over 3 years. This is based on an ROE of 10% and equity ratio of 52.5%. Interim rates were implemented in January. As Ben noted, we are working to achieve a definitive settlement with several of the intervenors. The finalized settlement agreement would still require commission approval. 
In the Mexico, we reached a unanimous rate K settlement, which will increase rates by about $23 million. The commission is expected to rule on the settlement this month and rates will be implemented shortly after that decision. We also have a pending rate case in Texas, in which we're seeking a rate increase of approximately $69 million. We initiated settlement discussions and are hopeful that we will reach an agreement. Absent the settlement agreement, we would expect the commission decision in the first quarter of 2017. As a reminder, final rates are retroactive back to July of 2016. 
Finally, we have a pending rate case in Wisconsin. In aggregate, we've requested rate increases of approximately $32 million between electric and natural gas. We expect staff testimony later this month, with the commission decision in the fourth quarter and final rates implemented in January of next year. 
In summary, we continue to make strong progress on various initiatives. In Colorado, we filed our Rush Creek application, our resource plan, a decoupling proposal in our distribution grid modernization program. In Minnesota, we're seeking to finalize a settlement, in principle, in our rate case and are moving towards the constructive outcome in our resource plan. We are on track to deliver ongoing earnings solidly within our 2016 guidance range and we expect to grow earnings at 4% to 6% over the long-term.

Today, we reported GAAP and ongoing earnings of $0.39 per share for the quarter, flat with last year. Our year-to-date earnings are slightly ahead of last year, but a bit behind expectations, reflecting lower-than-expected sales and some unfavorable weather. However, we have taken action to reduce O&M expenses and as a result, we are confident in our ability to deliver ongoing earnings solidly within our 2016 guidance range of $2.12, $2.27 per share, and Bob will provide more detail on our financial results in a few minutes. 
While it's been a busy quarter, we've made significant progress in our regulatory initiatives. Let me start out by addressing some of the highlights. We're making progress in the Minnesota rate case and have participated in several mediation sessions. As a result, we have reached a settlement in principle with several other parties, but the terms remain confidential until we reach a final agreement. The settlement is anticipated to address all revenue issues, any settlement, which still have to be reviewed by the ALJ as well as approved by the Commission. We also recently received comments by 15 parties on our Minnesota resource plan. Feedback from the parties was generally supportive for our proposal for early retirement of the 2 units at our Sherco coal plant, replacement of that generation with natural gas combined cycle unit at Sherco and moving forward, with significant wind additions in the next 5 years. A commission decision is expected later this year. 
Now turning to Colorado. Yesterday, we filed for the implementation of our advanced grid initiative, which comprises major projects to improve the customer experience, enhance grid reliably and enable the implementation of new and innovative programs and rate structures. The project includes the installation of advanced meters and the implementation of hardware and software applications to enhance the distribution system. The estimated capital investment for the project is $500 million, which is included in our base capital forecast. We're excited about this project and view it as a template for advancing and enhancing our system to meet the needs of our customers. In July, we also filed a decoupling request with the Colorado Commission. The proposed decoupling mechanism would allow PSCo to adjust annual revenues based on changes in weather normalized used per customer for the residential and small C&I classes. And this is very similar to the program that was approved in Minnesota. We expect commission decisions for both the advanced grid initiative and the decoupling proposal by mid-2017. 
And finally, last week, we received testimony in our Rush Creek 600-megawatt wind proposal in Colorado. And in general, we had strong support for our project, including the staff. Colorado staff recommended approval of Rush Creek, subject to certain conditions, including the capital cost cap, a shortened depreciation life and changes to the timing of the in-service date to coincide with the Pawnee-Daniels transmission line. The staff also recommended a granting approval of interim cost recovery through the electric commodity adjustment cost, or the ECA, as we have requested for the project. 
Finally, in support of balance disclosure, I should point out that of the 9 parties that filed testimony, 1 intervener, the sustainable power group, recommended the application should be denied. And we remain on an accelerated schedule and we expect a Commission decision in November of this year. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail in our financial results and outlook in addition to our regulatory update.

Today, we reported GAAP in ongoing earnings of $0.39 per share for the quarter, comparable to the $0.39 per share earned last year. Most significant drivers in the quarter include the following. Electric margin increased earnings by $0.07 per share and natural gas margin increased earnings by $0.01 per share, largely due to rate increases and higher capital rider revenue in various jurisdictions. 
Offsetting the higher margins were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share, higher interest charges, which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share and increased property taxes, which reduced earnings by $0.01 per share. The higher fixed charges reflect our increased capital investment to have renewables and improve the reliability of the system for the benefit of our customers. 
Our year-to-date earnings are slightly below plan, largely due to lower-than-expected sales and mild weather experience in the first quarter. However, we have taken actions to hold the line on O&M expenses to offset these headwinds. As a result, we're confident in our ability to deliver ongoing earnings solidly within the 2016 guidance range. 
When we initiated guidance earlier this year, we were anticipating weather adjusted electric sales growth between 0.5% and 1%, this projection included the impact of leap year. However, despite the fact that we continue to see strong customer additions of approximately 1%, our year-to-date weather adjusted electric sales have actually declined about 0.6% or 1.1% when adjusted for the extra day of sales from leap year. Our sales continue to be impacted by lower commodity prices on some of our commercial and industrial customers and declining use per customer in the residential class, driven by conservation efforts and gains in home energy efficiency. And while we had expected some C&I growth in the back half of this year, we believe that commodity and economic backdrops make that unlikely. As a result, we revised our outlook for full year retail electric sales to be approximately 0.5% below 2015 results, which is consistent with where we are year-to-date. 
As you come to expect from the company, with lower sales, we must prudently manage our operating expenses. We've implemented various cost management efforts to limit expenses that partially offset some of our revenue headwinds. Our year-to-date O&M expenses are lower than last year, and we expect O&M to be in line at the conclusion of 2016. And we believe that our recent rate outcomes assume we actively manage our costs. Long-term, we continue to mitigate O&M increases through our efforts to improve productivity through capital investment and the use of technology. 
On the regulatory front, we remain busy and have made excellent process in various proceedings in our states. Details of these can be found in our earnings release, but let me provide some highlights. Last year, we filed a multiyear plan in Minnesota, which reflected a requested rate increase of approximately $300 million over 3 years. This is based on an ROE of 10% and equity ratio of 52.5%. Interim rates were implemented in January. As Ben noted, we are working to achieve a definitive settlement with several of the intervenors. The finalized settlement agreement would still require Commission approval. 
In New Mexico, we reached a unanimous rate case settlement, which will increase rates by about $23 million. The Commission is expected to rule on this settlement this month and rates will be implemented shortly after that decision. 
We also have a pending rate case in Texas, in which we're seeking a rate increase of approximately $69 million. We initiated settlement discussions and are hopeful that we will reach an agreement. Absent the settlement agreement, we would expect the Commission decision in the first quarter of 2017. As a reminder, final rates are retroactive back to July of 2016. 
Finally, we have a pending rate case in Wisconsin. In aggregate, we've requested rate increases of approximately $32 million between electric and natural gas. We expect staff testimony later this month, with the Commission decision in the fourth quarter and final rates implemented in January of next year. 
In summary, we continue to make strong progress on various initiatives. In Colorado, we filed our Rush Creek application, our resource plan, a decoupling proposal in our distribution grid modernization program. In Minnesota, we're seeking to finalize a settlement, in principle, in our rate case and are moving towards the constructive outcome in our resource plan. We are on track to deliver ongoing earnings solidly within our 2016 guidance range and we expect to grow earnings at 4% to 6% over the long-term.

While it's been a busy quarter, we've made significant progress in our regulatory initiatives. Let me start out by addressing some of the highlights. We're making progress in the Minnesota rate case and have participated in several mediation sessions. As a result, we have reached a settlement in principle with several of the parties, but the terms remain confidential until we reach a final agreement. The settlement is anticipated to address all revenue issues. Any settlement would still have to be reviewed by the ALJ as well as approved by the Commission. We also recently received comments by 15 parties on our Minnesota resource plan. Feedback from the parties was generally supportive for our proposal for early retirement of the 2 units at our Sherco coal plant, replacement of that generation with natural gas combined cycle unit at Sherco and moving forward with significant wind additions in the next 5 years. A commission decision is expected later this year. 
Now turning to Colorado. Yesterday, we filed for the implementation of our advanced grid initiative, which comprises major projects to improve the customer experience, enhance grid reliably and enable the implementation of new and innovative programs and rate structures. The project includes the installation of advanced meters and the implementation of hardware and software applications to enhance the distribution system. The estimated capital investment for the project is $500 million, which is included in our base capital forecast. We're excited about this project and view it as a template for advancing and enhancing our system to meet the needs of our customers. In July, we also filed a decoupling request with the Colorado Commission. The proposed decoupling mechanism would allow PSCo to adjust annual revenues based on changes in weather normalized use per customer for the residential and small C&I classes. And this is very similar to the program that was approved in Minnesota. We expect commission decisions for both the advanced grid initiative and the decoupling proposal by mid-2017. 
And finally, last week, we received testimony in our Rush Creek 600-megawatt wind proposal in Colorado. And in general, we had strong support for our project, including the staff. Colorado staff recommended approval of Rush Creek, subject to certain conditions, including a capital cost cap, a shortened depreciation life and changes to the timing of the in-service date to coincide with the Pawnee-Daniels transmission line. The staff also recommended a granting approval of interim cost recovery through the electric commodity adjustment clause, or the ECA, as we have requested for the project. 
Finally, in support of balance disclosure, I should point out that of the 9 parties that filed testimony, 1 intervener, the sustainable power group, recommended the application should be denied. But we remain on an accelerated schedule and we expect a Commission decision in November of this year. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail in our financial results and outlook in addition to a regulatory update.

Today, we reported GAAP in ongoing earnings of $0.39 per share for the quarter, comparable to the $0.39 per share earned last year. Most significant drivers in the quarter include the following. Electric margin i",772,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. 
Today, we reported GAAP in ongoing earnings of $0.39 per share for the quarter, comparable to the $0.39 per share earned last year. Most significant drivers in the quarter include the following. Electric margin increased earnings by $0.07 per share and natural gas margin increased earnings by $0.01 per share, largely due to rate increases and higher capital rider revenue in various jurisdictions. 
Offsetting the higher margins were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share, higher interest charges, which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share and increased property taxes, which reduced earnings by $0.01 per share. The higher fixed charges reflect our increased capital investment to add renewables and improve the reliability of the system for the benefit of our customers. 
Our year-to-date earnings are slightly below plan, largely due to lower-than-expected sales and mild weather experienced in the first quarter. However, we have taken actions to hold the line on O&M expenses to offset these headwinds. As a result, we're confident in our ability to deliver ongoing earnings solidly within the 2016 guidance range. 
When we initiated guidance earlier this year, we were anticipating weather-adjusted electric sales growth between 0.5% and 1%. This projection included the impact of leap year. However, despite the fact that we continue to see strong customer additions of approximately 1%, our year-to-date weather adjusted electric sales have actually declined about 0.6% or 1.1% when adjusted for the extra day of sales from leap year. Our sales continue to be impacted by lower commodity prices on some of our commercial and industrial customers and declining use per customer in the residential class, driven by conservation efforts and gains in home energy efficiency. And while we had expected some C&I growth in the back half of this year, we believe the commodity and economic backdrops make that unlikely. As a result, we revised our outlook for full year retail electric sales to be approximately 0.5% below 2015 results, which is consistent with where we are year-to-date. 
As you've come to expect from the company, with lower sales we must prudently manage our operating expenses. We've implemented various cost management efforts to limit expenses that partially offset some of our revenue headwinds. Our year-to-date O&M expenses are lower than last year, and we expect O&M to be in line at the conclusion of 2016. And we believe that our recent rate outcomes assume we actively manage our costs. Long-term, we continue to mitigate O&M increases through our efforts to improve productivity through capital investment and the use of technology. 
On the regulatory front, we remain busy and have made excellent process on various proceedings in our states. Details of these can be found in our earnings release, but let me provide some highlights. Last year, we filed a multiyear plan in Minnesota, which reflected a requested rate increase of approximately $300 million over 3 years. This was based on an ROE of 10% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. Interim rates were implemented in January. As Ben noted, we are working to achieve a definitive settlement with several of the intervenors. The finalized settlement agreement would still require Commission approval. 
In New Mexico, we reached a unanimous rate case settlement, which will increase rates by about $23 million. The Commission is expected to rule on this settlement this month, and rates would be implemented shortly after that decision. 
We also have a pending rate case in Texas, in which we're seeking a rate increase of approximately $69 million. We initiated settlement discussions and are hopeful that we will reach an agreement. Absent a settlement agreement, we would expect a Commission decision in the first quarter of 2017. As a reminder, final rates are retroactive back to July of 2016. 
Finally, we have a pending rate case in Wisconsin. In aggregate, we've requested rate increases of approximately $32 million between electric and natural gas. We expect staff testimony later this month, with a Commission decision in the fourth quarter and final rates implemented in January of next year. 
In summary, we continue to make strong progress on various initiatives. In Colorado, we filed our Rush Creek application, our resource plan, a decoupling proposal in our distribution grid modernization program. In Minnesota, we're seeking to finalize a settlement, in principle, in our rate case, and are moving towards a constructive outcome in our resource plan. We are on track to deliver ongoing earnings solidly within our 2016 guidance range and we expect to grow earnings at 4% to 6% over the long-term. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions."

Today, we reported GAAP and ongoing earnings of $0.39 per share for the quarter, flat with last year. Our year-to-date earnings are slightly ahead of last year, but a bit behind expectations, reflecting lower-than-expected sales and some unfavorable weather. However, we have taken action to reduce O&M expenses and as a result, we are confident in our ability to deliver ongoing earnings solidly within our 2016 guidance range of $2.12, $2.27 per share, and Bob will provide more detail on our financial results in a few minutes. 
While it's been a busy quarter, we've made significant progress in our regulatory initiatives. Let me start out by addressing some of the highlights. We're making progress in the Minnesota rate case and have participated in several mediation sessions. As a result, we have reached a settlement in principle with several of the parties, but the terms remain confidential until we reach a final agreement. The settlement is anticipated to address all revenue issues. Any settlement would still have to be reviewed by the ALJ as well as approved by the Commission. We also recently received comments by 15 parties on our Minnesota resource plan. Feedback from the parties was generally supportive for our proposal for early retirement of the 2 units at our Sherco coal plant, replacement of that generation with natural gas combined cycle unit at Sherco and moving forward with significant wind additions in the next 5 years. A commission decision is expected later this year. 
Now turning to Colorado. Yesterday, we filed for the implementation of our advanced grid initiative, which comprises major projects to improve the customer experience, enhance grid reliably and enable the implementation of new and innovative programs and rate structures. The project includes the installation of advanced meters and the implementation of hardware and software applications to enhance the distribution system. The estimated capital investment for the project is $500 million, which is included in our base capital forecast. We're excited about this project and view it as a template for advancing and enhancing our system to meet the needs of our customers. In July, we also filed a decoupling request with the Colorado Commission. The proposed decoupling mechanism would allow PSCo to adjust annual revenues based on changes in weather normalized use per customer for the residential and small C&I classes. And this is very similar to the program that was approved in Minnesota. We expect commission decisions for both the advanced grid initiative and the decoupling proposal by mid-2017. 
And finally, last week, we received testimony in our Rush Creek 600-megawatt wind proposal in Colorado. And in general, we had strong support for our project, including the staff. Colorado staff recommended approval of Rush Creek, subject to certain conditions, including a capital cost cap, a shortened depreciation life and changes to the timing of the in-service date to coincide with the Pawnee-Daniels transmission line. The staff also recommended a granting approval of interim cost recovery through the electric commodity adjustment clause, or the ECA, as we have requested for the project. 
Finally, in support of balance disclosure, I should point out that of the 9 parties that filed testimony, 1 intervener, the sustainable power group, recommended the application should be denied. But we remain on an accelerated schedule and we expect a Commission decision in November of this year. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail in our financial results and outlook in addition to a regulatory update. 
Bob?"

Today, we reported GAAP in ongoing earnings of $0.39 per share for the quarter, comparable to the $0.39 per share earned last year. Most significant drivers in the quarter include the following. Electric margin i",772,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. 
Today, we reported GAAP in ongoing earnings of $0.39 per share for the quarter, comparable to the $0.39 per share earned last year. Most significant drivers in the quarter include the following. Electric margin increased earnings by $0.07 per share and natural gas margin increased earnings by $0.01 per share, largely due to rate increases and higher capital rider revenue in various jurisdictions. 
Offsetting the higher margins were increased depreciation expense, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share, higher interest charges, which reduced earnings by $0.02 per share and increased property taxes, which reduced earnings by $0.01 per share. The higher fixed charges reflect our increased capital investment to add renewables and improve the reliability of the system for the benefit of our customers. 
Our year-to-date earnings are slightly below plan, largely due to lower-than-expected sales and mild weather experienced in the first quarter. However, we have taken actions to hold the line on O&M expenses to offset these headwinds. As a result, we're confident in our ability to deliver ongoing earnings solidly within the 2016 guidance range. 
When we initiated guidance earlier this year, we were anticipating weather-adjusted electric sales growth between 0.5% and 1%. This projection included the impact of leap year. However, despite the fact that we continue to see strong customer additions of approximately 1%, our year-to-date weather adjusted electric sales have actually declined about 0.6% or 1.1% when adjusted for the extra day of sales from leap year. Our sales continue to be impacted by lower commodity prices on some of our commercial and industrial customers and declining use per customer in the residential class, driven by conservation efforts and gains in home energy efficiency. And while we had expected some C&I growth in the back half of this year, we believe the commodity and economic backdrops make that unlikely. As a result, we revised our outlook for full year retail electric sales to be approximately 0.5% below 2015 results, which is consistent with where we are year-to-date. 
As you've come to expect from the company, with lower sales we must prudently manage our operating expenses. We've implemented various cost management efforts to limit expenses that partially offset some of our revenue headwinds. Our year-to-date O&M expenses are lower than last year, and we expect O&M to be in line at the conclusion of 2016. And we believe that our recent rate outcomes assume we actively manage our costs. Long-term, we continue to mitigate O&M increases through our efforts to improve productivity through capital investment and the use of technology. 
On the regulatory front, we remain busy and have made excellent process on various proceedings in our states. Details of these can be found in our earnings release, but let me provide some highlights. Last year, we filed a multiyear plan in Minnesota, which reflected a requested rate increase of approximately $300 million over 3 years. This was based on an ROE of 10% and an equity ratio of 52.5%. Interim rates were implemented in January. As Ben noted, we are working to achieve a definitive settlement with several of the intervenors. The finalized settlement agreement would still require Commission approval. 
In New Mexico, we reached a unanimous rate case settlement, which will increase rates by about $23 million. The Commission is expected to rule on this settlement this month, and rates would be implemented shortly after that decision. 
We also have a pending rate case in Texas, in which we're seeking a rate increase of approximately $69 million. We initiated settlement discussions and are hopeful that we will reach an agreement. Absent a settlement agreement, we would expect a Commission decision in the first quarter of 2017. As a reminder, final rates are retroactive back to July of 2016. 
Finally, we have a pending rate case in Wisconsin. In aggregate, we've requested rate increases of approximately $32 million between electric and natural gas. We expect staff testimony later this month, with a Commission decision in the fourth quarter and final rates implemented in January of next year. 
In summary, we continue to make strong progress on various initiatives. In Colorado, we filed our Rush Creek application, our resource plan, a decoupling proposal in our distribution grid modernization program. In Minnesota, we're seeking to finalize a settlement, in principle, in our rate case, and are moving towards a constructive outcome in our resource plan. We are on track to deliver ongoing earnings solidly within our 2016 guidance range and we expect to grow earnings at 4% to 6% over the long-term. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now take questions."

Today, we reported third quarter GAAP and ongoing earnings of $0.90 per share compared with $0.84 per share last year. Year-to-date, we're $0.07 per share ahead of last year and as a result, we're narrowing over 2016 guidance range to $2.17 to $2.22 per share from the previous range of $2.12 to $2.27 per share. We still anticipate earnings in the middle of the range. We're also initiating 2017 earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.35 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 4% to 6%. 
We had a productive quarter and we continue to make progress on investment plans and regulatory issues. I'll briefly touch on some of the highlights. 
Today, we are updating our 5-year capital forecast and you will notice a significant increase in renewable investments. Therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our steel for fuel strategy. Our service territory is unique and its concentration of renewable rich resources. For example, the capacity factors for wind generation are approximately 50% in Minnesota and Texas and about 45% in Colorado. When you combine high capacity factors, a strong transmission network and the extension of the Production Tax Credit, it all translates into low renewable energy cost for our customers. Today, we can add wind energy, which meets or beats the cost of [indiscernible] of generation resources. Because of the strong wind resources in our backyard, we have a unique opportunity to invest in renewable generation in which the capital costs are offset by fuel savings. Therefore, we are [indiscernible] the [indiscernible] profile of our generation fleet with significant fuel savings, which allows us to grow our renewable portfolio with no impact to customer goals. A [indiscernible] example of our steel for fuel strategy is the Rush Creek wind project in Colorado. In September, the Colorado Commission approved our request to develop the 600-megawatt wind farm with a capital investment of approximately $1 billion. We will start initial work on the project this year and it's expected to go into service in 2018. Another example is in Minnesota, where the commission recently approved our resource plan which includes in the early retirements of 2 coal units at our Sherco facility and the addition of a significant amount of renewable energy. In accordance with the resource plan, we have issued an RFP to add up to 1,500 megawatts of wind generation. This week, we filed a self-build proposal to develop 750 megawatts of wind generation, which will meet half of that resource need. We believe that our projects reflect competitive pricing and are confident that the commission will approve our proposal in the first half of 2017. We expect both of these wind projects will generate hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel savings for our customers, which will more than offset the capital cost, highlighting the benefit of our steel for fuel strategy. 
Turning to the operations side of the business. More than a decade ago, we partnered with a group of smaller utilities to form CapX2020 and transform the transmission grid in the upper Midwest. That transformation was made a reality with the recent completion and energizing of 156-mile Hampton Rochester lacrosse transmission line. CapX2020 has now invested $1.9 billion in completing 4 high-voltage transmission lines, totaling nearly 725 miles. The fifth project in South Dakota is scheduled for completion in 2017. These transmission projects are addressing [indiscernible] and increasing access to renewable energy across the Upper Midwest. 
I'll now turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook in addition to our regulatory update."

We reported GAAP and ongoing earnings of $0.90 per share for the quarter versus the $0.84 per share earned last year. The most significant earnings drivers in the quarter include: higher electric and natural gas",968,"Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. 
We reported GAAP and ongoing earnings of $0.90 per share for the quarter versus the $0.84 per share earned last year. The most significant earnings drivers in the quarter include: higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.15 per share, largely due to rate increases and capital rider recovery for infrastructure investments, along with sales growth and favorable weather; we also realized the lower effective income tax rate due to higher PTCs from wind projects, which increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Partially offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense largely due to capital additions and reductions in excess depreciation and reserves, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share and higher interest and O&M expenses, which, combined, reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. 
Our third quarter electric sales came in stronger than expected and increased 1.6% on a weather adjusted basis. We saw positive sales growth in the residential and C&I classes. We continue to experience strong customer growth of approximately 1% for both our electric and our natural gas businesses. While we're happy to see a quarter of strong sales, it's a little early to call it a trend and our year-to-date weather adjusted electric sales remain relatively flat. Therefore, we remain cautious on the sales outlook and anticipate flat year-over-year sales. 
We're very focused on managing our cost structure for the benefit of our customers. Our year-to-date O&M expenses are approximately 1% above last year. We experienced higher [indiscernible] cost and maintenance expense in the third quarter and expect full year O&M to be slightly above 2015 actuals. We continue to mitigate O&M increases through our efforts to improve productivity through capital investment and ease of technology, and we expect to carry this effort into the future. 
During the quarter, we made significant progress in a number of proceedings across our territories. You'll find more details in our earnings release, but let me provide some highlights. 
Consistent with our strategy to implement longer term rate plan in our jurisdictions, we reached a preliminary settlement with the majority of parties in our Minnesota electric rate case, which will provide revenue certainty through 2019. The terms for the full year plan include: an ROE of 9.2% and an equity ratio of 52.5%; an annual sales true-up that continued use of all existing riders; a 4-year rate case stay out provision; a property tax true-up; and a capital true-up mechanism. We expect an ALJ report in March of 2017 and a final commission decision in June of 2017. As a reminder, interim rates subject to refund are in place while the commission considers the case. 
We're pleased to announce that we reached a settlement and agreement principle in our Texas rate case and hearings have been vacated. We're working on documenting the settlement and plan to file it in the fourth quarter. Although we can't provide any details until the documentation is finalized, we believe that the settlement is positive and reflects a growing constructive regulatory environment in Texas and New Mexico. 
Finally, we also have a pending rate case in Wisconsin where we requested a revised rate increase of approximately $35 million between electric and natural gas. Just yesterday, the Wisconsin commission [indiscernible] approved the combined increase of approximately $27 million, which reflects complete recovery of our requested natural gas rate increase and an adjusted electric rate increase. Final rates will be implemented in January. 
Turning to earnings guidance. Based on our year-to-date results, we are narrowing our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance range to $2.17 to $2.22 per share. Previously, the range was $2.12 to $2.22 per share. We are also initiating our 2017 ongoing earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.35 per share, which is consistent with our objective of growing EPS of 4% to 6% annually. Please note, our guidance ranges are based on several key assumptions which are detailed in our earnings release. However, a couple of the 2017 assumptions are worth mentioning. We assume constructive regulatory outcomes in all proceedings. We're assuming sales growth of 0 to 0.5% in 2017 and O&M expenses are expected to stay flat with 2016 projections. This will mark a third year in a row of near flat O&M, reflecting our commitment to continuous improvement of our cost structure. 
Finally, we've updated our capital forecast and now expect to invest $18.4 billion over the next 5-year period, 2017 through 2021. This forecast drives annual rate based growth of 5.4%, using 2015 as a base. 
Capital plan reflects $3.5 billion of renewable investment, including the Rush Creek windfarm, our proposal to add 750 megawatts of wind in the Upper Midwest and incremental renewable generation to capitalize on our steel for fuel strategy. 
Again, it's important to point out that our capital investment in renewable generation is offset by fuel savings, so there's no impact on the customer build. Further, we don't plan to issue equity to fund this capital plan due to our strong balance sheet and credit metrics. 
In summary, we continue to execute on our strategic financial and operational plan. With a strong quarter and are on track to deliver ongoing earnings within our guidance range for the 12th consecutive year. We reached a rate settlement in Minnesota and settlement principle in our Texas rate case. We're executing on our steel for fuel strategy with the approval of the Rush Creek wind project and the submittal of our 750 megawatt wind proposal in Minnesota and North Dakota. We've established 2017 earnings guidance consistent with our long-term growth objective of 4% to 6%. And finally, we've updated our 5-year capital forecast to support continual infrastructure investment in our service territory and delivers rate base growth of 5.4%.

So you got -- so that would be 60 basis points of lag, all right? It's less than what we had before. Remember, when we first initiated that closed the gap, it was more like 100 basis points of lag. So I think the challenge and the opportunity for us, Ali, is to -- for example, in Minnesota, clearly, that was a compromise 9 2, it's not the ROE we would have preferred to have. However, when you look at the comprehensive settlement, we have a much better shot than we've ever had before of actually earning our allowed returns. And recall that in Minnesota, we have been lagging even frankly more than 100 basis points. So we'll get at it differently. We got a lower blended ROE base, but I think with multiyear plans, comprehensive multiyear plans, we can probably do better than just cut the lag in half. And that's the plan."

Today, we reported third quarter GAAP and ongoing earnings of $0.90 per share compared with $0.84 per share last year. Year-to-date, we're $0.07 per share ahead of last year, and as a result, we're narrowing over 2016 guidance range to $2.17 to $2.22 per share from the previous range of $2.12 to $2.27 per share. We still anticipate earnings in the middle of the range. We're also initiating 2017 earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.35 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 4% to 6%. 
We had a productive quarter, and we continue to make progress on investment plans and regulatory issues. I'll briefly touch on some of the highlights. 
Today, we are updating our 5-year capital forecast and you will notice a significant increase in renewable investments. Therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our steel-for-fuel strategy. Our service territory is unique in its concentration of renewable rich resources. For example, the capacity factors for wind generation are approximately 50% in Minnesota and Texas and about 45% in Colorado. When you combine high capacity factors, a strong transmission network and the extension of the production tax credit, it all translates into low renewable energy cost for our customers. Today, we can add wind energy, which meets or beats the cost of fossil generation resources. Because of the strong wind resources in our backyard, we have the unique opportunity to invest in renewable generation in which the capital costs are offset by fuel savings. Therefore, we are lowering the [indiscernible] profile of our generation fleet with significant fuel savings, which allows us to grow our renewable portfolio with no impact to customer goals. A prime example of our steel-for-fuel strategy is the Rush Creek wind project in Colorado. In September, the Colorado Commission approved our request to develop the 600-megawatt wind farm with a capital investment of approximately $1 billion. We will start initial work on the project this year, and it's expected to go into service in 2018. Another example is in Minnesota, where the commission recently approved our resource plan, which includes the early retirements of 2 coal units at our Sherco facility and the addition of a significant amount of renewable energy. In accordance with the resource plan, we have issued an RFP to add up to 1,500 megawatts of wind generation. This week, we filed a self-build proposal to develop 750 megawatts of wind generation, which will meet half of that resource need. We believe that our projects reflect competitive pricing and are confident that the commission will approve our proposal in the first half of 2017. We expect both of these wind projects will generate hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel savings for our customers, which will more than offset the capital cost, highlighting the benefit of our steel-for-fuel strategy. 
Turning to the operations side of the business. More than a decade ago, we partnered with a group of smaller utilities to form CapX2020 and transform the transmission grid in the upper Midwest. That transformation was made a reality with the recent completion and energizing of the 156-mile Hampton-Rochester-La Crosse transmission line. CapX2020 has now invested $1.9 billion in completing 4 high-voltage transmission lines, totaling nearly 725 miles. A fifth project in South Dakota is scheduled for completion in 2017. These transmission projects are addressing the liability needs and increasing access to renewable energy across the Upper Midwest. 
I'll now turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook in addition to our regulatory update."

Today, we reported GAAP and ongoing earnings of $0.90 per share for the quarter versus the $0.84 per share earned last year. The most significant earnings drivers in the quarter include: higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.15 per share, largely due to rate increases and capital rider recovery for infrastructure investments, along with sales growth and favorable weather. We also realized the lower effective income tax rate due to higher PTCs from wind projects, which increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Partially offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense largely due to capital additions and reductions in excess depreciation and reserves, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share and higher interest and O&M expenses, which, combined, reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. 
Our third quarter electric sales came in stronger than expected and increased 1.6% on a weather-adjusted basis. We saw positive sales growth in the residential and C&I classes. We continue to experience strong customer growth of approximately 1% for both our electric and our natural gas businesses. While we're happy to see a quarter of strong sales, it's a little early to call it a trend, and our year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales remain relatively flat. Therefore, we remain cautious on the sales outlook and anticipate flat year-over-year sales. 
We're very focused on managing our cost structure for the benefit of our customers. Our year-to-date O&M expenses are approximately 1% above last year. We experienced higher storm cost and maintenance expense in the third quarter and expect full year O&M to be slightly above 2015 actuals. We continue to mitigate O&M increases through our efforts to improve productivity through capital investment and ease of technology, and we expect to carry this effort into the future. 
During the quarter, we made significant progress in a number of proceedings across our territories. You'll find more details in our earnings release, but let me provide some highlights. 
Consistent with our strategy to implement longer term rate plan in our jurisdictions, we reached a preliminary settlement with the majority of parties in our Minnesota electric rate case, which will provide revenue certainty through 2019. The terms for the full year plan include: an ROE of 9.2% and an equity ratio of 52.5%, an annual sales true-up that continued use of all existing riders, a 4-year rate case stay-out provision, a property tax true-up and a capital true-up mechanism. We expect an ALJ report in March of 2017 and a final commission decision in June of 2017. As a reminder, interim rates subject to refund are in place while the commission considers the case. 
We're pleased to announce that we've reached a settlement and agreement in principle in our Texas rate case, and hearings have been vacated. We're working on documenting the settlement and plan to file it in the fourth quarter. Although we can't provide any details until the documentation is finalized, we believe that the settlement is positive and reflects a growing constructive regulatory environment in Texas and New Mexico. 
Finally, we also have a pending rate case in Wisconsin where we requested a revised rate increase of approximately $35 million between electric and natural gas. Just yesterday, the Wisconsin commission verbally approved a combined increase of approximately $27 million, which reflects complete recovery of our requested natural gas rate increase and an adjusted electric rate increase. Final rates will be implemented in January. 
Turning to earnings guidance. Based on our year-to-date results, we are narrowing our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance range to $2.17 to $2.22 per share. Previously, the range was $2.12 to $2.22 per share. We are also initiating our 2017 ongoing earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.35 per share, which is consistent with our objective of growing EPS of 4% to 6% annually. Please note, our guidance ranges are based on several key assumptions, which are detailed in our earnings release. However, a couple of the 2017 assumptions are worth mentioning. We assume constructive regulatory outcomes in all proceedings. We're assuming sales growth of 0 to 0.5% in 2017, and O&M expenses are expected to stay flat with 2016 projections. This will mark a third year in a row of near flat O&M, reflecting our commitment to continuous improvement of our cost structure. 
Finally, we've updated our capital forecast and now expect to invest $18.4 billion over the next 5-year period of 2017 through 2021. This forecast drives annual rate base growth of 5.4%, using 2015 as a base. 
Capital plan reflects $3.5 billion of renewable investment, including the Rush Creek wind farm, our proposal to add 750 megawatts of wind in the Upper Midwest and incremental renewable generation to capitalize on our steel-for-fuel strategy. 
Again, it's important to point out that our capital investment in renewable generation is offset by fuel savings. So there's no impact on the customer build. Further, we don't plan to issue equity to fund this capital plan due to our strong balance sheet and credit metrics. 
In summary, we continue to execute on our strategic, financial and operational plan, with a strong quarter and are on track to deliver ongoing earnings within our guidance range for the 12th consecutive year. We reached a rate settlement in Minnesota and settlement principle in our Texas rate case. We're executing on our steel-for-fuel strategy with the approval of the Rush Creek wind project and the submittal of our 750 megawatt wind proposal in Minnesota and North Dakota. We've established 2017 earnings guidance consistent with our long-term growth objective of 4% to 6%. And finally, we've updated our 5-year capital forecast, which supports continual infrastructure investment in our service territory and delivers rate base growth of 5.4%.

I think what we're really doing with wind particularly is just really buying the fuel we're going to use tomorrow on sale today. So when you think about it -- I mean, it's not that it doesn't open up the dialogue for early retirement of coal plants, but essentially, what you're doing is you're displacing fossil fuels with wind. So you might still have the generation plant, the fossil generation plant, but you don't have to use it as much natural gas, even coal, when you're displacing that fuel with wind fuel. Does that make sense to you?"

Today, we reported third quarter GAAP and ongoing earnings of $0.90 per share compared with $0.84 per share last year. Year-to-date, we're $0.07 per share ahead of last year, and as a result, we're narrowing over 2016 guidance range to $2.17 to $2.22 per share from the previous range of $2.12 to $2.27 per share. We still anticipate earnings in the middle of the range. We're also initiating 2017 earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.35 per share, which is consistent with our long-term EPS growth objective of 4% to 6%. 
We had a productive quarter, and we continue to make progress on investment plans and regulatory issues. I'll briefly touch on some of the highlights. 
Today, we are updating our 5-year capital forecast and you will notice a significant increase in renewable investments. Therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our steel-for-fuel strategy. Our service territory is unique in its concentration of renewable rich resources. For example, the capacity factors for wind generation are approximately 50% in Minnesota and Texas and about 45% in Colorado. When you combine high capacity factors, a strong transmission network and the extension of the production tax credit, it all translates into low renewable energy cost for our customers. Today, we can add wind energy, which meets or beats the cost of fossil generation resources. Because of the strong wind resources in our backyard, we have the unique opportunity to invest in renewable generation in which the capital costs are offset by fuel savings. Therefore, we are lowering the emission profile of our generation fleet with significant fuel savings, which allows us to grow our renewable portfolio with no impact to customer bills. A prime example of our steel-for-fuel strategy is the Rush Creek wind project in Colorado. In September, the Colorado Commission approved our request to develop the 600-megawatt wind farm with a capital investment of approximately $1 billion. We will start initial work on the project this year, and it's expected to go into service in 2018. Another example is in Minnesota, where the commission recently approved our resource plan, which includes the early retirements of 2 coal units at our Sherco facility and the addition of a significant amount of renewable energy. In accordance with the resource plan, we have issued an RFP to add up to 1,500 megawatts of wind generation. This week, we filed a self-build proposal to develop 750 megawatts of wind generation, which will meet half of that resource need. We believe that our projects reflect competitive pricing and are confident that the commission will approve our proposal in the first half of 2017. We expect both of these wind projects will generate hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel savings for our customers, which will more than offset the capital cost, highlighting the benefit of our steel-for-fuel strategy. 
Turning to the operations side of the business. More than a decade ago, we partnered with a group of smaller utilities to form CapX2020 and transform the transmission grid in the upper Midwest. That transformation was made a reality with the recent completion and energizing of the 156-mile Hampton-Rochester-La Crosse transmission line. CapX2020 has now invested $1.9 billion in completing 4 high-voltage transmission lines, totaling nearly 725 miles. A fifth project in South Dakota is scheduled for completion in 2017. These transmission projects are addressing the liability needs and increasing access to renewable energy across the Upper Midwest. 
I'll now turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook in addition to our regulatory update."

Today, we reported GAAP and ongoing earnings of $0.90 per share for the quarter versus the $0.84 per share earned last year. The most significant earnings drivers in the quarter include: higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.15 per share, largely due to rate increases and capital rider recovery for infrastructure investments, along with sales growth and favorable weather. We also realized the lower effective income tax rate due to higher PTCs from wind projects, which increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Partially offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense largely due to capital additions and reductions in excess depreciation and reserves, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share and higher interest and O&M expenses, which, combined, reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. 
Our third quarter electric sales came in stronger than expected and increased 1.6% on a weather-adjusted basis. We saw positive sales growth in the residential and C&I classes. We continue to experience strong customer growth of approximately 1% for both our electric and our natural gas businesses. While we're happy to see a quarter of strong sales, it's a little early to call it a trend, and our year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales remain relatively flat. Therefore, we remain cautious on the sales outlook and anticipate flat year-over-year sales. 
We're very focused on managing our cost structure for the benefit of our customers. Our year-to-date O&M expenses are approximately 1% above last year. We experienced higher storm cost and maintenance expense in the third quarter and expect full year O&M to be slightly above 2015 actuals. We continue to mitigate O&M increases through our efforts to improve productivity through capital investment and ease of technology, and we expect to carry this effort into the future. 
During the quarter, we made significant progress in a number of proceedings across our territories. You'll find more details in our earnings release, but let me provide some highlights. 
Consistent with our strategy to implement longer-term rate plan in our jurisdictions, we reached a preliminary settlement with the majority of parties in our Minnesota electric rate case, which will provide revenue certainty through 2019. The terms for the full year plan include: an ROE of 9.2% and an equity ratio of 52.5%, an annual sales true-up that continued use of all existing riders, a 4-year rate case stay-out provision, a property tax true-up and a capital true-up mechanism. We expect an ALJ report in March of 2017 and a final commission decision in June of 2017. As a reminder, interim rates subject to refund are in place while the commission considers the case. 
We're pleased to announce that we've reached a settlement and agreement in principle in our Texas rate case, and hearings have been vacated. We're working on documenting the settlement and plan to file it in the fourth quarter. Although we can't provide any details until the documentation is finalized, we believe that the settlement is positive and reflects a growing constructive regulatory environment in Texas and New Mexico. 
Finally, we also have a pending rate case in Wisconsin where we requested a revised rate increase of approximately $35 million between electric and natural gas. Just yesterday, the Wisconsin commission verbally approved a combined increase of approximately $27 million, which reflects complete recovery of our requested natural gas rate increase and an adjusted electric rate increase. Final rates will be implemented in January. 
Turning to earnings guidance. Based on our year-to-date results, we are narrowing our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance range to $2.17 to $2.22 per share. Previously, the range was $2.12 to $2.22 per share. We are also initiating our 2017 ongoing earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.35 per share, which is consistent with our objective of growing EPS of 4% to 6% annually. Please note, our guidance ranges are based on several key assumptions, which are detailed in our earnings release. However, a couple of the 2017 assumptions are worth mentioning. We assume constructive regulatory outcomes in all proceedings. We're assuming sales growth of 0 to 0.5% in 2017, and O&M expenses are expected to stay flat with 2016 projections. This will mark a third year in a row of near flat O&M, reflecting our commitment to continuous improvement of our cost structure. 
Finally, we've updated our capital forecast and now expect to invest $18.4 billion over the next 5-year period of 2017 through 2021. This forecast drives annual rate base growth of 5.4%, using 2015 as a base. 
Capital plan reflects $3.5 billion of renewable investment, including the Rush Creek wind farm, our proposal to add 750 megawatts of wind in the Upper Midwest and incremental renewable generation to capitalize on our steel-for-fuel strategy. 
Again, it's important to point out that our capital investment in renewable generation is offset by fuel savings. So there's no impact on the customer bills. Further, we don't plan to issue equity to fund this capital plan due to our strong balance sheet and credit metrics. 
In summary, we continue to execute on our strategic, financial and operational plan, with a strong quarter and are on track to deliver ongoing earnings within our guidance range for the 12th consecutive year. We reached a rate settlement in Minnesota and settlement principle in our Texas rate case. We're executing on our steel-for-fuel strategy with the approval of the Rush Creek wind project and the submittal of our 750 megawatt wind proposal in Minnesota and North Dakota. We've established 2017 earnings guidance consistent with our long-term growth objective of 4% to 6%. And finally, we've updated our 5-year capital forecast, which supports continual infrastructure investment in our service territory and delivers rate base growth of 5.4%.

So to Bob's point, we basically have achieved the upside CapEx just with renewables. And again, the clarity we'd seen with steel-for-fuel is really unique for us. And I think we'll continue to look for opportunities to transition the fleet, achieve remarkable carbon emission reductions at no additional price point to the consumer."

Therefore, I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing our steel-for-fuel strategy. Our service territory is unique in its concentration of renewable rich resources. For example, the capacity factors for wind generation are approximately 50% in Minnesota and Texas and about 45% in Colorado. When you combine high capacity factors, a strong transmission network and the extension of the production tax credit, it all translates into low renewable energy cost for our customers. Today, we can add wind energy, which meets or beats the cost of fossil generation resources. Because of the strong wind resources in our backyard, we have the unique opportunity to invest in renewable generation in which the capital costs are offset by fuel savings. Therefore, we are lowering the emission profile of our generation fleet with significant fuel savings, which allows us to grow our renewable portfolio with no impact to customer bills. A prime example of our steel-for-fuel strategy is the Rush Creek wind project in Colorado. In September, the Colorado Commission approved our request to develop the 600-megawatt wind farm with a capital investment of approximately $1 billion. We will start initial work on the project this year, and it's expected to go into service in 2018. Another example is in Minnesota, where the commission recently approved our resource plan, which includes the early retirements of 2 coal units at our Sherco facility and the addition of a significant amount of renewable energy. In accordance with the resource plan, we have issued an RFP to add up to 1,500 megawatts of wind generation. This week, we filed a self-build proposal to develop 750 megawatts of wind generation, which will meet half of that resource need. We believe that our projects reflect competitive pricing and are confident that the commission will approve our proposal in the first half of 2017. We expect both of these wind projects will generate hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel savings for our customers, which will more than offset the capital cost, highlighting the benefit of our steel-for-fuel strategy. 
Turning to the operations side of the business. More than a decade ago, we partnered with a group of smaller utilities to form CapX2020 and transform the transmission grid in the upper Midwest. That transformation was made a reality with the recent completion and energizing of the 156-mile Hampton-Rochester-La Crosse transmission line. CapX2020 has now invested $1.9 billion in completing 4 high-voltage transmission lines, totaling nearly 725 miles. A fifth project in South Dakota is scheduled for completion in 2017. These transmission projects are addressing the liability needs and increasing access to renewable energy across the Upper Midwest. 
I'll now turn the call over to Bob to provide more detail on our financial results and outlook in addition to our regulatory update."

Today, we reported GAAP and ongoing earnings of $0.90 per share for the quarter versus the $0.84 per share earned last year. The most significant earnings drivers in the quarter include: higher electric and natural gas margins, which increased earnings by $0.15 per share, largely due to rate increases and capital rider recovery for infrastructure investments, along with sales growth and favorable weather. We also realized the lower effective income tax rate due to higher PTCs from wind projects, which increased earnings by $0.02 per share. Partially offsetting these positive drivers were increased depreciation expense largely due to capital additions and reductions in excess depreciation and reserves, which reduced earnings by $0.06 per share and higher interest and O&M expenses, which, combined, reduced earnings by $0.05 per share. 
Our third quarter electric sales came in stronger than expected and increased 1.6% on a weather-adjusted basis. We saw positive sales growth in the residential and C&I classes. We continue to experience strong customer growth of approximately 1% for both our electric and our natural gas businesses. While we're happy to see a quarter of strong sales, it's a little early to call it a trend, and our year-to-date weather-adjusted electric sales remain relatively flat. Therefore, we remain cautious on the sales outlook and anticipate flat year-over-year sales. 
We're very focused on managing our cost structure for the benefit of our customers. Our year-to-date O&M expenses are approximately 1% above last year. We experienced higher storm cost and maintenance expense in the third quarter and expect full year O&M to be slightly above 2015 actuals. We continue to mitigate O&M increases through our efforts to improve productivity through capital investment and ease of technology, and we expect to carry this effort into the future. 
During the quarter, we made significant progress in a number of proceedings across our territories. You'll find more details in our earnings release, but let me provide some highlights. 
Consistent with our strategy to implement longer-term rate plan in our jurisdictions, we reached a preliminary settlement with the majority of parties in our Minnesota electric rate case, which will provide revenue certainty through 2019. The terms for the full year plan include: an ROE of 9.2% and an equity ratio of 52.5%, an annual sales true-up that continued use of all existing riders, a 4-year rate case stay-out provision, a property tax true-up and a capital true-up mechanism. We expect an ALJ report in March of 2017 and a final commission decision in June of 2017. As a reminder, interim rates subject to refund are in place while the commission considers the case. 
We're pleased to announce that we've reached a settlement and agreement in principle in our Texas rate case, and hearings have been vacated. We're working on documenting the settlement and plan to file it in the fourth quarter. Although we can't provide any details until the documentation is finalized, we believe that the settlement is positive and reflects a growing constructive regulatory environment in Texas and New Mexico. 
Finally, we also have a pending rate case in Wisconsin where we requested a revised rate increase of approximately $35 million between electric and natural gas. Just yesterday, the Wisconsin commission verbally approved a combined increase of approximately $27 million, which reflects complete recovery of our requested natural gas rate increase and an adjusted electric rate increase. Final rates will be implemented in January. 
Turning to earnings guidance. Based on our year-to-date results, we are narrowing our 2016 ongoing earnings guidance range to $2.17 to $2.22 per share. Previously, the range was $2.12 to $2.22 per share. We are also initiating our 2017 ongoing earnings guidance of $2.25 to $2.35 per share, which is consistent with our objective of growing EPS of 4% to 6% annually. Please note, our guidance ranges are based on several key assumptions, which are detailed in our earnings release. However, a couple of the 2017 assumptions are worth mentioning. We assume constructive regulatory outcomes in all proceedings. We're assuming sales growth of 0 to 0.5% in 2017, and O&M expenses are expected to stay flat with 2016 projections. This will mark a third year in a row of near flat O&M, reflecting our commitment to continuous improvement of our cost structure. 
Finally, we've updated our capital forecast and now expect to invest $18.4 billion over the next 5-year period of 2017 through 2021. This forecast drives annual rate base growth of 5.4%, using 2015 as a base. 
Capital plan reflects $3.5 billion of renewable investment, including the Rush Creek wind farm, our proposal to add 750 megawatts of wind in the Upper Midwest and incremental renewable generation to capitalize on our steel-for-fuel strategy. 
Again, it's important to point out that our capital investment in renewable generation is offset by fuel savings. So there's no impact on the customer bills. Further, we don't plan to issue equity to fund this capital plan due to our strong balance sheet and credit metrics. 
In summary, we continue to execute on our strategic, financial and operational plan, with a strong quarter and are on track to deliver ongoing earnings within our guidance range for the 12th consecutive year. We reached a rate settlement in Minnesota and settlement principle in our Texas rate case. We're executing on our steel-for-fuel strategy with the approval of the Rush Creek wind project and the submittal of our 750 megawatt wind proposal in Minnesota and North Dakota. We've established 2017 earnings guidance consistent with our long-term growth objective of 4% to 6%. And finally, we've updated our 5-year capital forecast, which supports continual infrastructure investment in our service territory and delivers rate base growth of 5.4%. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we'll now open the phone for questions."

However, when you look at the comprehensive settlement, we have a much better shot than we've ever had before of actually earning our allowed returns.
