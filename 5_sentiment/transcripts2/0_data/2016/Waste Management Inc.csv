We grew our income from operations and operatin",1415,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning, from Houston. 2015 was a very successful year as our commitment to core pricing, disciplined growth and controlling costs generated our highest adjusted earnings per share ever. We grew our income from operations and operating EBITDA and achieved the highest operating margins we've seen since 2010. We generated earnings per share of $2.61 in spite of the divestitures of our Wheelabrator in Puerto Rico and Eastern Canada operations, and headwinds from recycling commodity prices and foreign currency translation. 
In 2015 we saw the execution of pricing, productivity and growth strategies strengthen our foundation in a way that will lead to continued growth in 2016 and beyond. During 2015, our strong free cash flow allowed us to return almost $1.3 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. We've seen solid growth in cash generation in our business over the last few years and we're confident that our free cash flow has reached a new base of at least $1.4 billion per year, up from the $1.2 million to $1.3 billion level that was characterized the last several years. 
As a result of confidence in our cash flow, our board decided to increase the dividend by 6.5% in 2016 and authorized up to $1 billion of share repurchases. We acquired Deffenbaugh and several small solid waste companies in 2015 and in early 2016, we closed on the acquisition of Southern Waste Systems, or SWS. The acquisition of SWS and other smaller tuck-ins we expect to close in 2016 should generate between $50 million and $75 million of operating EBITDA in 2016. As we previously mentioned, the operating EBITDA from these acquisitions won't translate into earnings per share in 2016 because we'll have corresponding intangible amortization. However, the transactions will generate cash flow in 2016 and incremental earnings starting in the second half of 2017. 
Looking at our operations in 2015. Our pricing programs continue to drive earnings growth and margin expansion. When we gave initial guidance for 2015, we targeted core price of 3.8% for the full year and we exceeded that target. For the full year, our collection and disposal core price was 4.2% with yield at 1.8%. We've now seen 8 consecutive quarters with core price of 4% or greater. For the full year, core price in the commercial line of business was 6.1%, industrial was 8.6% and the landfill line of business was 2.4%. For 2016, we expect core price to be about 4% and a total revenue growth from yield should again be in the range of 1.5% to 2%. 
Our pricing teams continue to perform at high levels and we'll continue our focus on price in 2016. The pricing excellence is not a 1-year project at Waste Management. It's a way of life. We must get pricing to keep up with inflation and we have the tools and the people to do that indefinitely. Our traditional solid waste volumes, which include our collection, transfer and landfill volumes were a negative 0.5% for the full year. But importantly, we saw positive trends throughout 2015, with traditional solid waste volumes improving sequentially each quarter, culminating in a slightly positive fourth quarter. Although commercial and residential were still negative, we continue to see positive momentum in those volumes, particularly in our commercial line of business. 
In that line, we've seen 16 consecutive quarters in which the rate of decline has improved and commercial was down only 0.7% in the fourth quarter versus down 1.3% in the third quarter. Our continued focus on disciplined volume growth and customer service is paying dividends. Our churn was 10.1% for the full year, the lowest level since 2012. And the fourth quarter, it was 9%, the lowest levels since 2002. And we did all of this while reducing rollbacks in 2015. So we're keeping our customers through improved service, not price concessions. We saw our new business exceed our lost business for the eighth consecutive quarter. These are all positive signs that our volumes are headed in the right direction without resorting to lowering prices. 
Total company volume, which includes lower-margin recycling, brokered and non-solid waste volumes, declined 1.6% for the full year with the fourth quarter being the best quarter of the year declining only 0.9%. For 2016, we expect the traditional solid waste volumes will be positive. However, we do not see a recovery in recycling and non-solid waste volumes, which would lead to overall volumes being about flat. Of course, some of the recycling volume that we lose is a direct result of our efforts to shed unprofitable volume. So losing certain volumes in the recycling business is not such a bad thing. And we expect that overall volumes will turn positive in the second half of the year. 
As you can see, the pricing volume trade-off continues to be very positive. For the full year, the company's income from operations grew 4.6% and our income from operations margin grew 120 basis points. In addition, operating EBITDA increased about 3% and operating EBITDA margins increased 130 basis points to 26.5%. Our solid EPS growth was achieved despite a $0.09 per share decline from our energy and environmental services business, which has been affected by the sharp decrease in market prices for oil, a negative $0.04 impact from foreign currency translation and a negative $0.04 impact from recycling operations. 
Looking more closely at recycling. We made significant progress improving operating costs and on renegotiating contractual terms with our customers, including exiting some unprofitable contracts. Our recycling employees worked hard and reduced gross operating expenses by 15% and changed contracts were possible to allow us to charge a processing fee where we previously paid rebates. Without these operational contractual improvements, we have estimated that the recycling impact could be as much as a negative $0.08 to $0.10 per share as average commodity recycling prices declined 17.5% in 2015. However, the operational improvements less and that negative impact to negative $0.04 per share. 
On the recycling commodity price front, 2016 has seen a continuation of the downward slide and current prices are down $20 per ton or 23% from January of 2015. These are levels that we've not seen in nearly 7 years since the 2009 recession. If we do not see a normal seasonal up tick in commodity prices and prices remain at January levels, this would be a $0.02 to $0.03 headwind in 2016. We're committed to recycling and we'll continue to work to change the business model to generate revenue that covers our processing costs and drive out operating expenses so that the business is sustainable over the long-term. 
Turning to free cash flow. Our strong operating results, coupled with continued discipline in capital spending allowed us to generate $1.41 billion of free cash flow in 2015. Included in that free cash flow number was $150 million prepayment of 2016 cash taxes. We had mentioned on the third quarter conference call that we'd make this type of prepayment given that our cash flow was going to be above the high end of our $1.5 billion range. Consequently, we increased our 2016 guidance to between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. 
So when we look at our success in 2015 and our guidance for 2016, we look at 3 things: first, is price. In 2015, we exceeded our goals and for 2016, it's pretty much locked and loaded and already in process. So we're very confident we'll meet our 4% target in 2016. Second is costs. Again, we did well in 2015 and we believe there's plenty of room to improve in 2016. So again, we're very confident. And finally, volumes. In 2014 and 2015, we built momentum and for the first time in many years, I'm very confident that we'll see our volumes turn positive toward the end of 2016. So we go into 2016 with a lot of confidence and look forward to another strong year. 
We expect that our continued execution of the strategic priorities will drive 2016 adjusted EPS to between $2.74 and $2.79. And we expect operating EBITDA to grow at the fastest rate in 10 years, up 5% to $3.6 billion. But we can't do it without our people. I'd be remiss if I didn't thank them for their hard work and professionalism, and I know they will once again prove their value in 2016. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our fourth quarter results and our 2016 outlook in more detail."

We produced solid growth in earnings and cash flow in 2015 and it would've been even better when you realize that recycling is down $0.30 per share from its peak. That is why we need to maintain our focus on fixing recycling. As David said, we're committed to recycling and for the last 2 years, we've been working to improve our recycling business. We want to see recycling thrive because it's the right thing for our environment and it's the right thing for our customers. We just want to make sure it's the right thing for our shareholders. 
We performed well in 2015 navigating the recycling headwind wins, which I'll discuss in a moment. But we're in the fourth year of low recycling commodity prices and we're currently seeing these commodity prices at the lowest levels we've seen since the 2009 recession. Since there's little we can do to affect global market conditions, we're doubling down on those areas we can control. We've tightened our belt on investments, we're driving operational efficiencies, we're working with our community partners to reduce the amount of expensive contamination at our MERS. We're optimizing our mirth network and we're tackling the slow, difficult but necessary process of changing the terms of our contracts. 
Together, these actions produce real measurable results in 2015 and are expected to make recycling profitable over the long-term. Initially, we expected a headwind in our recycling line of business would be between $0.08 and $0.10 of EPS. However, the full-year impact ended up only $0.04 negative. That was not driven by an improvement in commodity prices. It was due to the actions that we took to improve recycling operations. Recycling was 1 of several market factors we overcame in 2015. In addition to the force and impact of recycling, we had a $0.09 per share headwind related to lower demands for energy and environmental services, a $0.04 impact from foreign currency changes. 
Despite these market pressures, our EPS grew more than 13% to $2.61 per share in 2015. We overcame those headwinds through cost controls and the strong growth in our traditional solid waste business and those efforts will continue into 2016. At the beginning of 2015, we expected to see a $60 million improvement in SG&A costs when compared to 2014. I'm pleased with our 2015 results as SG&A costs for the full year improved $68 million to $1.34 billion, and improved 8% of revenue by 20 basis points to 10.4%. For the fourth quarter, SG&A costs were $343 million, an improvement of $27 million compared to 2014. As a percent of revenue, SG&A costs improved 70 [ph] basis points to 10.6%. 
For 2016, we will continue to focus on managing anticipated wage increases, cost inflation and incremental SG&A brought on from the acquisitions. But despite these increases, we anticipate that SG&A costs should be flat when compared to 2015. Turning to cash flow. For the full year, we generated $1.41 billion of free cash flow. As we mentioned in our third quarter earnings call, we expect that we would have a strong year of free cash flow and that we would likely make tax payments assuming the tax extenders were not going to be enacted. Therefore, in the fourth quarter, we prepaid $150 million of 2016 cash taxes. 
For 2016, we now anticipate between $60 million and $70 million of cash tax savings from the impact of bonus depreciation, which was reinstated by Congress at the 11th hour. During 2016, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. In 2016, the impacts of organic earnings growth, bonus depreciation, acquisitions and higher capital spending should drive free cash flow to between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. 
In the fourth quarter, we returned $172 million to our shareholders through our dividends. For the full year 2015, we returned about $1.3 billion to our shareholders consisting of $695 million in dividends and share repurchases of $600 million. Our board has indicated its intention to increase dividends in 2016 by 6.5% to $1.64 per share on an annual basis and this is the 13th consecutive year of increased dividends. For 2016, our anticipated annual dividends will result in approximately $730 million being returned to our shareholders. 
We expect to spend around $100 million to $200 million on tuck in acquisitions in 2016 with the remainder of free cash flow allocated to share repurchases. We have authorization from our Board of Directors to repurchase $1 billion of our shares. We've already repurchased $150 million and expect to spend an additional $500 million for the full year. Fourth quarter revenues were $3.25 billion. We saw a $59 million increase in revenues from acquisitions and a $50 million increase in our traditional solid waste business due to the combined impacts of pricing and volume. We saw an overall revenue decline of $163 million from divestitures, $43 [ph] million in lower fuel surcharge revenues, a $34 million decline from lower recycling revenues and a $33 million decline in foreign currency. 
Looking at internal revenue growth. For the total company in the fourth quarter, our collection of core price was $0.42 and yield was 1.7%, with total volumes declining 0.9%. This led to total company income from operations growing $42 million. Operating income margin, expanding 150 basis points to 17.7%, operating EBITDA growing $37 million and operating EBITDA margin growing 150 basis points to 27%. For the full year, income from operations grew $97 million, operating income margin expanded 120 basis points and operating EBITDA grew $86 million and operating EBITDA margin grew 130 basis points to 26.5%.
Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefits of our disciplined pricing programs in the fourth quarter. Our commercial core price was 5.8% with yield of 2.9%. Our industrial core price was 8.7% with yield of 2.3%. And residential achieved 2.2% core price and 1.5%yield. Overall, collection core price was 5.3% and yield was 2.2%. Our focus on customer service, which helped reduce our churn and disciplined growth also benefited our volume trends in the fourth quarter as volume declined only 0.6%. 
The volume change was a 90 basis points improvement sequentially from the third quarter and 190 basis points improvement from the fourth quarter of 2014. This core price and volume led to operating EBITDA growing $11.7 million and margin expanding 30 basis points. In the landfill line of business. We saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive yield in the fourth quarter just as we have all year. We saw same-store average MSW rates increase year-over-year by 2.4% from Q4 of 2014. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year MSW rates increases. 
Total landfill volumes increased 0.5%. MSW volumes grew by 11.1% and CNB volumes grew 15.8%. While special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes declined 7.4%. The special waste decline was predominantly driven by the decline in our energy services business. The positive volume and yield led to income from operations growing $15 million, margins growing 160 basis points, operating EBITDA increasing $14 million and operating EBITDA margins increasing 120 basis points. 
Moving now to operating expenses. These expenses improved by $50 million in the fourth quarter and as a percent of revenue improved 80 basis points to 62.4%. For the full year, operating expenses improved $328 million and as a percent of revenue, improved 100 basis points to 63.1%. In 2015, our focus on improving operating costs saw significant traction and we expect that to continue into 2016. For the full year, we saw improvements of $187 million in fuel costs, $102 million in cost of goods sold and $35 million in labor costs as we continue to see the benefits from our routing and logistics program. 
Finally, looking at our other financial metrics. At the end of the fourth quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.66 and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.32%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 8% at the end of the quarter. The effective tax rate was approximately 32.4% in the fourth quarter and 32.3% for the full year. Taxes were a $0.01 headwind to EPS in the fourth quarter. 
In conclusion, 2015 was a very good year for Waste Management as our employees did a great job of focusing on price, disciplined growth and cost controls. I want to say thank you to our employees for their hard work in delivering a successful 2015 and positioning us to continue that into 2016. We're excited about continued growth in '16 ahead and beyond. And with that, Karneisha, let's open the line for questions."

And so we know exactly how to do them. We know exactly how to get the dollars out. It takes a little bit of time but we know exactly how to do them. So the more of those that we can do, the better. We thought there might be a few more of those in the pipeline. But those -- call them those $400 million to 500 million transactions, we really don't see a lot of those on the near horizon right now. So I think 2016 will be a year where it's mostly driven by tuck in acquisitions. But again, we'd love to do some larger acquisitions like those 3 that we did in Montréal, Kansas City and South Florida. Pricing. I don't think it's changed dramatically. We've said it many times, we generally pay a little bit lower price for the smaller tuck ins. And it's because you can pay a little bit higher price when you get that bigger bulk of business like we did down at SWS. Although even with SWS, our post synergy basis, we'll end up being sort of 6 to 7x EBITDA."

If I talk about free cash flow and if I don't answer your question, let me know. But if I talk about free cash flow for 2016, I have a starting point of, let's call it 1.41 from this year, and then I'm adding in EBITDA growth, you mentioned $160 million, we're kind of calling it $170 million in EBITDA growth year-over-year, which includes -- that includes organic growth, that includes some of the benefit of acquisitions. I add in the impact of bonus depreciation, which I mentioned was, let's call it $70 [ph] million. And then our CapEx is going to be a bit higher this year, I mentioned the 1 3 to 1 4 range, so back out $100 million in added CapEx and I arrive in the building of that range of 1 5 to 1 6. And keep in mind there, Corey that the prepayments that we made in cash taxes is really offset by the benefit we got from the Q1 '15 debt transaction. So those 2 kind of offset each other, so that walk forward works without a cash tax -- the cash tax difference."

And so the biggest thing that we think drove the disparity between the core price and yield was the fact that our energy services business was down fairly dramatically and those are very high-priced halls. Compared to -- if you look at Energy Service hall compared to an industrial container at a shopping mall, the price per hall difference is dramatic. And so the fact that energy services dropped of as we said, $0.09 for the year, when you saw that dramatic drop off in energy services, you lost a lot of those very high-priced polls.

The large retailers, we're pretty solid as was manufacturing and industrial. It looks like industrial production figures came out today, it looks like they're decent. And that's kind of what we saw as well pretty solid in manufacturing and industrial. The one real soft spot, and you'll hear it several times today was energy services, and it got worse throughout the year. So we were down 32% in our energy services business albeit on a kind of a small base there, but down 32% and down 45% in the fourth quarter.

But when they built up the inventory and then they work down the inventory, they don't shut down their plants. They still operate their plants. So that really just doesn't have that big of an effect on us. It doesn't have an effect on us until they shut down the plants and I don't think anyone seeing a shutdown of plants. I think they're seeing a little bit of a slowdown of the plants. And so when we look at our industrial waste, it really isn't going to be affected by the manufacturing and industrial space and in the final pieces, that a lot of the low energy prices are a big boon to a lot of the industrial manufacturing industrial customers that we have in the chemical quarter all the way from Beaumont Texas up through the Midwest. And so we see the manufacturing and industrial volumes actually being very strong. As Jim said, we've got a wide spectrum from extremely strong construction to week on the energy services side and manufacturing and industrial I'd say what comes in I'd say slightly positive side of that spectrum.

So we're doing some standardization around the fleet that's helped us in that regard, and some commitments to our suppliers that helped us with that reduction. In '16, we'll buy 1,234 trucks according to the current plan and about 10% more than '15, but we'll only spend about 4% more in dollars than we did in '15.

Because you can't look at just a volume number. You've got to look at what is that volume made up of, right? If that volume is made up of brokered volumes, you're not making any money on it. If that volume is",348,"Yes. Look, this is an easy question to answer. Because you can't look at just a volume number. You've got to look at what is that volume made up of, right? If that volume is made up of brokered volumes, you're not making any money on it. If that volume is made up of recycling volumes, you're not making any money on it. So when I look at the volumes, I don't say look at the overall volume number. I say look where the volumes are coming from. So for us, we've got positive volumes in the industrial line, which is a very high margin line for us. We've got positive volumes in the landfill line, which is the highest margin business that we have. And we're about to turn churn the corner to get positive volumes on the commercial line where we're at negative 0.7% in the quarter. I would expect to see that turn positive during 2016. So we're adding volume in the high margin areas. We are losing volume in recycling. We're losing volume in brokered business and we're losing volume in noncore, all very low margin businesses. And so if you get positive volume and margins go backwards, I don't see that as a good volume report. If you get negative volumes and margins go up by 150 basis points, I view that as fairly positive. So I think it's a very easy question to answer. We look for volumes where we can make money on those volumes. We don't look for volumes for the sake of volumes. And so -- but having said all that, in those moneymaking volumes, we're going to see the overall volume number turn positive in 2016 and that's what I  look forward to. Look, this is a high fixed costs business and layering in that volume on the high fixed costs allows you to drop a big flow through to the bottom line. So I think we've done the right thing. We'll continue to do the right thing. We'll continue to add volumes where we can make money."

On the CPI front, about 20% of our business is -- are CPI-related business, is either on a floating index that more approximates the waste services index or they're on a fixed price increase track with over 2.5% fixed price increases. In other words, 2.5% is sort of our inflation rate. About 20% of our contracts are either on a CPI-based measure or that, that is not CPI but would be for example, the waste and water index or what we call a solid waste index. So that runs at a higher rate generally than our 2.5% inflation. And then we've got other contracts where they run higher than our 2.5% inflation because they have big price increases at over 2.5%.

I think there's still plenty of room for improvement. But at this point in time, basically what we're down to is we have a series of plants and those series of plants generally revolve around a large contract, the large municipal contract or other contracts. So if we lose that large municipal contract, absolutely. We would probably have to shut down that plant because we don't have enough volume going through that plant. We don't have any bid that we have on the early time horizon where we think that will happen. But that's basically how we'll have to respond to a low for long commodity price. We still have operational improvements we can make, we think we can pull out sort of that 5% to 10% operating costs for a few years. But then any bigger restructuring, we don't have any planned right now. If we did any of that, it would be based upon large contract losses that we would have, if we have those."

I think we've done a spectacular job with our recycling folks of doing that.

190694,321989988,935807,"Waste Management, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. 2015 was a very successful year as our commitment to core pricing, disciplined growth and controlling costs generated our highest adjusted earnings per share ever. We grew our income from operations and operating",1417,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. 2015 was a very successful year as our commitment to core pricing, disciplined growth and controlling costs generated our highest adjusted earnings per share ever. We grew our income from operations and operating EBITDA and achieved the highest operating margins we've seen since 2010. We generated earnings per share of $2.61 in spite of the divestitures of our Wheelabrator in Puerto Rico and Eastern Canada operations and headwinds from recycling commodity prices and foreign currency translation. 
In 2015, we saw the execution of pricing, productivity and growth strategy strengthen our foundation in a way that will lead to continued growth in 2016 and beyond. During 2015, our strong free cash flow allowed us to return almost $1.3 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. We've seen solid growth in cash generation in our business over the last few years, and we're confident that our free cash flow has reached a new base of at least $1.4 billion per year, up from the $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion level that has characterized the last several years. 
As a result of confidence in our cash flow, our board decided to increase the dividend by 6.5% in 2016 and authorized up to $1 billion of share repurchases. We acquired Deffenbaugh and several small solid waste companies in 2015. And in early 2016, we closed on the acquisition of Southern Waste Systems, or SWS. The acquisition of SWS and other smaller tuck-ins we expect to close in 2016 should generate between $50 million and $75 million of operating EBITDA in 2016. As we've previously mentioned, the operating EBITDA from these acquisitions won't translate into earnings per share in 2016 because we'll have corresponding intangible amortization. However, the transactions will generate cash flow in 2016 and incremental earnings starting in the second half of 2017. 
Looking at our operations in 2015. Our pricing programs continued to drive earnings growth and margin expansion. When we gave initial guidance for 2015, we targeted core price of 3.8% for the full year, and we exceeded that target. For the full year, our collection and disposal core price was 4.2%, with yield at 1.8%. We've now seen 8 consecutive quarters with core price of 4% or greater. For the full year, core price in the commercial line of business was 6.1%, industrial was 8.6% and the landfill line of business was 2.4%. For 2016, we expect core price to be about 4%, and then total revenue growth from yield should again be in the range of 1.5% to 2%. 
Our pricing teams continue to perform at high levels, and we'll continue our focus on price in 2016. The pricing excellence is not a 1-year project at Waste Management. It's a way of life. We must get pricing to keep up with inflation, and we have the tools and the people to do that indefinitely. 
Our traditional solid waste volumes, which include our collection, transfer and landfill volumes, were a negative 0.5% for the full year. But importantly, we saw positive trends throughout 2015, with traditional solid waste volumes improving sequentially each quarter, culminating in a slightly positive fourth quarter. Although commercial and residential were still negative, we continue to see positive momentum in those volumes, particularly in our commercial line of business. In that line, we've seen 6 consecutive quarters in which the rate of decline has improved. And commercial collection was down only 0.7% in the fourth quarter versus down 1.3% in the third quarter. Our continued focus on disciplined volume growth and customer service is paying dividends. 
Our churn was 10.1% for the full year, the lowest level since 2012. In the fourth quarter, it was 9%, the lowest level since 2002. And we did all of this while reducing rollbacks in 2015. So we're keeping our customers through improved service, not price concessions. 
We saw our new business exceed our lost business for the eighth consecutive quarter. These are all positive signs that our volumes are headed in the right direction without resorting to lowering prices. 
Total company volume, which includes lower-margin recycling, brokered and nonsolid waste volumes, declined 1.6% for the full year, with the fourth quarter being the best quarter of the year, declining only 0.9%. For 2016, we expect that traditional solid waste volumes will be positive. However, we do not see a recovery in recycling and nonsolid waste volumes, which would lead to overall volumes being about flat. Of course, some of the recycling volume that we lose is a direct result of our efforts to shed unprofitable volume, so losing certain volumes in the recycling business is not such a bad thing. And we expect that overall volumes will turn positive in the second half of the year. 
As you can see, the pricing volume trade-off continues to be very positive. For the full year, the company's income from operations grew 4.6%, and our income from operations margin grew 120 basis points. In addition, operating EBITDA increased about 3%, and operating EBITDA margins increased 130 basis points to 26.5%. 
Our solid EPS growth was achieved despite a $0.09 per share decline from our energy and environmental services business, which has been affected by the sharp decrease in market prices for oil, a negative $0.04 impact from foreign currency translation and a negative $0.04 impact from recycling operations. 
Looking more closely at recycling. We made significant progress improving operating costs and on renegotiating contractual terms with our customers, including exiting some unprofitable contracts. Our recycling employees worked hard and reduced gross operating expenses by 15%. And changed contracts were possible to allow us to charge a processing fee, where we previously paid rebates. Without these operational and contractual improvements, we had estimated that the recycling impact could be as much as a negative $0.08 to $0.10 per share as average commodity recycling prices declined 17.5% in 2015. However, the operational improvements lessened that negative impact to negative $0.04 per share. 
On the recycling commodity price front, 2016 has seen a continuation of the downward slide, and current prices are down $20 per ton or 23% from January of 2015. These are levels that we've not seen in nearly 7 years since the 2009 recession. If we do not see a normal seasonal uptick in commodity prices and prices remain at January levels, this would be a $0.02 to $0.03 headwind in 2016. We're committed to recycling, and we'll continue to work to change the business model to generate revenue that covers our processing costs and drive out operating expenses so that the business is sustainable over the long term. 
Turning to free cash flow. Our strong operating results, coupled with continued discipline in capital spending, allowed us to generate $1.41 billion of free cash flow in 2015. Included in that free cash flow number was a $150 million prepayment of 2016 cash taxes. We had mentioned on the third quarter conference call that we'd make this type of prepayment, given that our cash flow is going to be above the high end of our $1.5 billion range. Consequently, we increased our 2016 guidance to between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. 
So when we look at our success in 2015 and our guidance for 2016, we look at 3 things: first is price. In 2015, we exceeded our goals. And for 2016, it's pretty much locked and loaded and already in process. So we're very confident we'll meet our 4% target in 2016. 
Second is costs. Again, we did well in 2015, and we believe there's plenty of room to improve in 2016. So again, we're very confident. 
And finally, volumes. In 2014 and 2015, we built momentum. And for the first time in many years, I'm very confident that we'll see our volumes turn positive toward the end of 2016. So we go into 2016 with a lot of confidence and look forward to another strong year. 
We expect that our continued execution of these strategic priorities will drive 2016 adjusted EPS to between $2.74 and $2.79. And we expect operating EBITDA to grow at the fastest rate in 10 years, up 5% to $3.6 billion. But we can't do it without our people. I'd be remiss if I didn't thank them for their hard work and professionalism, and I know they will once again prove their value in 2016. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our fourth quarter results and our 2016 outlook in more detail."
190694,321989988,935807,"Waste Management, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David.

We produced solid growth in earnings and cash flow in 2015, and it would've been even better when you realize that recycling is down $0.30 per share from its peak. That is why we need to maintain our focus on fixing recycling. As David said, we're committed to recycling. And for the last 2 years, we've been working to improve our recycling business. We want to see recycling thrive because it's the right thing for our environment and it's the right thing for our customers. We just want to make sure it's the right thing for our shareholders. 
We performed well in 2015 navigating the recycling headwinds, which I'll discuss in a moment. But we're in the fourth year of low recycling commodity prices, and we are currently seeing these commodity prices at the lowest levels we've seen since the 2009 recession. Since there's little we can do to affect global market conditions, we're doubling down on those areas we can control. We've tightened our belt on investments. We're driving operational efficiencies. We're working with our community partners to reduce the amount of expensive contamination at our MRFs. We're optimizing our MRF network, and we're tackling the slow, difficult but necessary process of changing the terms of our contracts. 
Together, these actions produce real measurable results in 2015 and are expected to make recycling profitable over the long term. Initially, we expected the headwind in the recycling line of business would be between $0.08 and $0.10 of EPS. However, the full year impact ended up only $0.04 negative. That was not driven by an improvement in commodity prices, but was due to the actions that we took to improve recycling operations. 
Recycling was one of several market factors we overcame in 2015. In addition to the force and impact from recycling, we had a $0.09 per share headwind related to low demands for energy and environmental services, a $0.04 impact from foreign currency changes. 
Despite these market pressures, our EPS grew more than 13% to $2.61 per share in 2015. We overcame those headwinds through cost controls and strong growth in our traditional solid waste business, and those efforts will continue into 2016. 
At the beginning of 2015, we expected to see a $60 million improvement in SG&A costs when compared to 2014. I'm pleased with our 2015 results, as SG&A cost for the full year improved $68 million to $1.34 billion and improved as a percent of revenue by 20 basis points to 10.4%. For the fourth quarter, SG&A costs were $343 million, an improvement of $27 million compared to 2014. As a percent of revenue, SG&A costs improved 70 basis points to 10.6%. 
For 2016, we will continue to focus on managing anticipated wage increases, cost inflation and incremental SG&A brought on from the acquisitions. But despite these increases, we anticipate that SG&A costs should be flat when compared to 2015. 
Turning to cash flow. For the full year, we generated $1.41 billion of free cash flow. As we mentioned on our third quarter earnings call, we expected we would have a strong year of free cash flow and that we would likely make tax payments, assuming the tax extenders were not going to be enacted. Therefore, in the fourth quarter, we prepaid $150 million of 2016 cash taxes. 
For 2016, we now anticipate between $60 million and $70 million of cash tax savings from the impact of bonus depreciation, which was reinstated by Congress at the eleventh hour. During 2016, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. In 2016, the impacts of organic earnings growth, bonus depreciation, acquisitions and higher capital spending should drive free cash flow to between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. 
In the fourth quarter, we returned $172 million to our shareholders through our dividends. For the full year 2015, we returned about $1.3 billion to our shareholders consisting of $695 million in dividends and share repurchases of $600 million. Our board has indicated its intention to increase dividends in 2016 by 6.5% to $1.64 per share on an annual basis. And this is the 13th consecutive year of increased dividends. For 2016, our anticipated annual dividends will result in approximately $730 million being returned to our shareholders. 
We expect to spend around $100 million to $200 million on tuck-in acquisitions in 2016, with the remainder of free cash flow allocated to share repurchases. We have authorization from our Board of Directors to repurchase $1 billion of our shares. We've already repurchased $150 million and expect to spend an additional $500 million for the full year. 
Fourth quarter revenues were $3.25 billion. We saw a $59 million increase in revenues from acquisitions and a $50 million increase in our traditional solid waste business due to the combined impacts of pricing and volume. We saw an overall revenue decline of $163 million from divestitures, $43 million in lower fuel surcharge revenues, a $34 million decline from lower recycling revenues and a $33 million decline in foreign currency. 
Looking at internal revenue growth. For the total company in the fourth quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.2%, and yield was 1.7%, with total volumes declining 0.9%. This led to total company income from operations growing $42 million, operating income margin expanding 150 basis points to 17.7%, operating EBITDA growing $37 million and operating EBITDA margin growing 150 basis points to 27%. For the full year, income from operations grew $97 million, operating income margin expanded 120 basis points and operating EBITDA grew $86 million and operating EBITDA margin grew 130 basis points to 26.5%.
Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefits of our disciplined pricing programs in the fourth quarter. Our commercial core price was 5.8% with yield of 2.9%. Our industrial core price was 8.7% with yield of 2.3%. And residential achieved 2.2% core price and 1.5% yield. Overall, collection core price was 5.3%, and yield was 2.2%. Our focus on customer service, which helped reduce our churn, and disciplined growth also benefited our volume trends in the fourth quarter as volume declined only 0.6%. 
The volume change was a 90 basis point improvement sequentially from the third quarter and a 190 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2014. This core price and volume led to operating EBITDA growing $11.7 million and margin expanding 30 basis points. 
In the landfill line of business, we saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive yield in the fourth quarter just as we have all year. We saw same-store average MSW rates increase year-over-year by 2.4% from Q4 of 2014. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year MSW rates increases. 
Total landfill volumes increased 0.5%. MSW volumes grew by 11.1%, and C&D volume grew 15.8%. While special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes declined 7.4%. The special waste decline was predominantly driven by the decline in our energy services business. The positive volume and yield led to income from operations growing $15 million, margins growing 160 basis points, operating EBITDA increasing $14 million and operating EBITDA margins increasing 120 basis points. 
Moving now to operating expenses. These expenses improved by $50 million in the fourth quarter and as a percent of revenue, improved 80 basis points to 62.4%. For the full year, operating expenses improved $328 million and as a percent of revenue, improved 100 basis points to 63.1%. In 2015, our focus on improving operating costs saw significant traction, and we expect that to continue into 2016. For the full year, we saw improvements of $187 million in fuel costs, $102 million in cost of goods sold and $35 million in labor costs as we continue to see the benefits from our routing and logistics program. 
Finally, looking at our other financial metrics. At the end of the fourth quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.66, and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.32%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 8% at the end of the quarter. The effective tax rate was approximately 32.4% in the fourth quarter and 32.3% for the full year. Taxes were a $0.01 headwind to EPS in the fourth quarter. 
In conclusion, 2015 was a very good year for Waste Management, as our employees did a great job of focusing on price, disciplined growth and cost controls. I want to say thank you to our employees for their hard work in delivering a successful 2015 and positioning us to continue that into 2016. We're excited about continued growth in '16 and beyond.

I mean, that's going to be the big acquisition that we do in 2016. When I look at acquisitions, we've done RCI in Montréal. We did Deffenbaugh in Kansas City, and now we've done SWS in South Florida. And those were spectacular acquisitions for us because they're a fairly large amount of revenue, but they're also straight tuck-ins into our business. And so we know exactly how to do them. We know exactly how to get the dollars out. It takes a little bit of time, but we know exactly how to do them. So the more of those that we could do, the better. We thought there might be a few or more of those in the pipeline. But those -- call them those $400 million to 500 million transactions, we really don't see a lot of those on the near horizon right now. So I think 2016 will be a year, where it's mostly driven by tuck-in acquisitions. But again, we'd love to do some larger acquisitions like those 3 that we did in Montréal, Kansas City and South Florida. Pricing, I don't think, has changed dramatically. We've said it many times. We generally pay a little bit lower price for the smaller tuck-ins. And it's because you can pay a little bit higher price when you get that bigger bulk of business like we did down at SWS, although even with SWS, on a post-synergy basis, we'll end up paying sort of 6 to 7x EBITDA."

We're kind of calling it $170 million in EBITDA growth year-over-year, which includes -- that includes organic growth, that includes some of the benefit of acquisitions. I add in the impact of bonus depreciation, which I mentioned, was, let's call it, $70 million. And then our CapEx is going to be a bit higher this year. I mentioned the $1.3 billion to the $1.4 billion range, so back out $100 million in added CapEx. And I arrive in the middle of that range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. And keep in mind there, Corey, that the prepayments that we made in cash taxes is really offset by the benefit we got from the Q1 '15 debt transaction. So those 2 kind of offset each other.

To go from core price to yield, you then put in -- because we do it on a per unit basis, you then come in do a lot of things like mix. And so the biggest thing that we think drove the disparity between core price and yield was the fact that our energy services business was down fairly dramatically, and those are very high-priced halls. Compared to -- if you look at an energy service hall compared to an industrial container at a shopping mall, the price per hall difference is dramatic. And so the fact that energy services dropped
off, as we said, $0.09 for the year, when you saw that dramatic drop off in energy services, you lost a lot of those very high-priced polls. And that's where the biggest chunk of the disparity between core price and yield comes in."

It includes large retailers, it includes manufacturing and industrial, it includes construction and it includes energy services. And those really were -- there was a wide spectrum there. Construction, as I mentioned earlier, really finished the year on a high note. So we're very happy with that, and it looks like it's going to do well going forward. The large retailers, we're pretty solid, as was manufacturing and industrial. It looks like industrial production figures came out today, and looks like they're decent. And that's kind of what we saw as well, pretty solid in manufacturing and industrial. The one real soft spot, and you'll hear it several times today, was energy services, and it got worse throughout the year. So we were down 32% in our energy services business, albeit on kind of a small base there, but down 32% and down 45% in the fourth quarter. And looking through that kind of small lens, we don't see energy services getting much better in '16.

I mean, look, in our business, what you had happened last year was, obviously, you had the inventory build and then working off the inventory. And that's what I think drove everybody to say, oh gosh, what's going on in the manufacturing sector. Jim pointed out, you saw some good numbers from it today. But when they build up the inventory and then they work down the inventory, they don't shut down their plants, they still operate their plants. And so that really just doesn't have that big of an effect on us. It doesn't have an effect on us until they shut down the plants, and I don't think anyone seeing a shutdown of plants, I think they're seeing a little bit of a slowdown of the plants. And so when we look at our industrial waste, it really isn't going to be affected by the manufacturing and industrial space. And then the final piece is that a lot of the low energy prices are a big boon to a lot of the manufacturing and industrial customers that we have in the chemical quarter, all the way from Beaumont, Texas up through the Midwest. And so we see the manufacturing and industrial volumes actually being very strong. As Jim said, we've got a wide spectrum from extremely strong construction to weak on the energy services side. And manufacturing and industrial, I'd say, would come in on sort of the slightly positive side of that spectrum. So we don't see that particularly slowing in 2016, and we expect industrial volumes to continue to be positive in 2016."

Because you can't look at just a volume number, you've got to look at what is that volume made up of, right? If that volume is made up of brokered volumes, you're not making any money on it. If that volume is",345,"Yes. Look, this is an easy question to answer. Because you can't look at just a volume number, you've got to look at what is that volume made up of, right? If that volume is made up of brokered volumes, you're not making any money on it. If that volume is made up of recycling volumes, you're not making any money on it. And so when I look at the volumes, I don't say look at the overall volume number, I say look where the volumes are coming from. So for us, we've got positive volumes in the industrial line, which is a very high margin line for us. We've got positive volumes in the landfill line, which is the highest margin business that we have. And we're about to turn the corner to get positive volumes on the commercial line, we're at negative 0.7% in the quarter. I would expect to see that turn positive during 2016. So we're adding volume in the high margin areas. We are losing volume in recycling, we're losing volume in brokered business, and we're losing volume in non-core, all very low margin businesses. And so if you get positive volume and margins go backwards, I don't see that as a good volume report. If you get negative volumes and margins go up by 150 basis points, I view that as fairly positive. So I think it's a very easy question to answer. We look for volumes where we can make money on those volumes. We don't look for volumes for the sake of volumes. And so -- but having said all that, in those moneymaking volumes, we're going to see the overall volume number turn positive in 2016, and that's what I  look forward to. Look, this is a high fixed-cost business and layering in that volume on the high fixed costs allows you to drop a big flow-through to the bottom line. So I think we've done the right thing. We'll continue to do the right thing. We'll continue to add volumes where we can make money."

In other words, 2.5% is sort of our inflation rate. About 20% of our contracts are either on a CPI-based measure or that, that is not CPI, but would be, for example, the waste and water index or what we call a solid waste index. So that runs at a higher rate generally than our 2.5% inflation. And then we've got other contracts where they run higher than our 2.5% inflation because they have big price increases at over 2.5%. So about 20% of our business is under those types of contracts.

So if we lose that large municipal contract, absolutely, we would probably have to shut down that plant because we don't have enough volume going through that plant. We don't have any bid that we have on the early time horizon where we think that will happen, but that's basically how we'll have to respond to a low for long commodity price. We still have operational improvements we can make. We think we can pull out sort of that 5% to 10% operating costs for a few years. But then any bigger restructuring, we don't have any plan right now. If we did any of that, it would be based upon large contract losses that we would have, if we have those."

190694,321989988,936202,"Waste Management, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. 2015 was a very successful year as our commitment to core pricing, disciplined growth and controlling costs generated our highest adjusted earnings per share ever. We grew our income from operations and operating",1418,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. 2015 was a very successful year as our commitment to core pricing, disciplined growth and controlling costs generated our highest adjusted earnings per share ever. We grew our income from operations and operating EBITDA and achieved the highest operating margins we've seen since 2010. We generated earnings per share of $2.61 in spite of the divestitures of our Wheelabrator in Puerto Rico and Eastern Canada operations and headwinds from recycling commodity prices and foreign currency translation. 
In 2015, we saw the execution of pricing, productivity and growth strategy strengthen our foundation in a way that will lead to continued growth in 2016 and beyond. During 2015, our strong free cash flow allowed us to return almost $1.3 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. We've seen solid growth in cash generation in our business over the last few years, and we're confident that our free cash flow has reached a new base of at least $1.4 billion per year, up from the $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion level that has characterized the last several years. 
As a result of confidence in our cash flow, our board decided to increase the dividend by 6.5% in 2016 and to authorize up to $1 billion of share repurchases. We acquired Deffenbaugh and several small solid waste companies in 2015. And in early 2016, we closed on the acquisition of Southern Waste Systems, or SWS. The acquisition of SWS and other smaller tuck-ins we expect to close in 2016 should generate between $50 million and $75 million of operating EBITDA in 2016. As we've previously mentioned, the operating EBITDA from these acquisitions won't translate into earnings per share in 2016 because we'll have corresponding intangible amortization. However, the transactions will generate cash flow in 2016 and incremental earnings starting in the second half of 2017. 
Looking at our operations in 2015. Our pricing programs continued to drive earnings growth and margin expansion. When we gave initial guidance for 2015, we targeted core price of 3.8% for the full year, and we exceeded that target. For the full year, our collection and disposal core price was 4.2%, with yield at 1.8%. We've now seen 8 consecutive quarters with core price of 4% or greater. For the full year, core price in the commercial line of business was 6.1%, industrial was 8.6% and the landfill line of business was 2.4%. For 2016, we expect core price to be about 4%, and then total revenue growth from yield should again be in the range of 1.5% to 2%. 
Our pricing teams continue to perform at high levels, and we'll continue our focus on price in 2016. The pricing excellence is not a 1-year project at Waste Management. It's a way of life. We must get pricing to keep up with inflation, and we have the tools and the people to do that indefinitely. 
Our traditional solid waste volumes, which include our collection, transfer and landfill volumes, were a negative 0.5% for the full year. But importantly, we saw positive trends throughout 2015, with traditional solid waste volumes improving sequentially each quarter, culminating in a slightly positive fourth quarter. Although commercial and residential were still negative, we continue to see positive momentum in those volumes, particularly in our commercial line of business. In that line, we've seen 6 consecutive quarters in which the rate of decline has improved. And commercial collection was down only 0.7% in the fourth quarter versus down 1.3% in the third quarter. Our continued focus on disciplined volume growth and customer service is paying dividends. 
Our churn was 10.1% for the full year, the lowest level since 2012. In the fourth quarter, it was 9%, the lowest level since 2002. And we did all of this while reducing rollbacks in 2015. So we're keeping our customers through improved service, not price concessions. 
We saw our new business exceed our lost business for the eighth consecutive quarter. These are all positive signs that our volumes are headed in the right direction without resorting to lowering prices. 
Total company volume, which includes lower-margin recycling, brokered and nonsolid waste volumes, declined 1.6% for the full year, with the fourth quarter being the best quarter of the year, declining only 0.9%. For 2016, we expect that traditional solid waste volumes will be positive. However, we do not see a recovery in recycling and nonsolid waste volumes, which would lead to overall volumes being about flat. Of course, some of the recycling volume that we lose is a direct result of our efforts to shed unprofitable volume, so losing certain volumes in the recycling business is not such a bad thing. And we expect that overall volumes will turn positive in the second half of the year. 
As you can see, the pricing volume trade-off continues to be very positive. For the full year, the company's income from operations grew 4.6%, and our income from operations margin grew 120 basis points. In addition, operating EBITDA increased about 3%, and operating EBITDA margins increased 130 basis points to 26.5%. 
Our solid EPS growth was achieved despite a $0.09 per share decline from our energy and environmental services business, which has been affected by the sharp decrease in market prices for oil, a negative $0.04 impact from foreign currency translation and a negative $0.04 impact from recycling operations. 
Looking more closely at recycling. We made significant progress improving operating costs and on renegotiating contractual terms with our customers, including exiting some unprofitable contracts. Our recycling employees worked hard and reduced gross operating expenses by 15%. And changed contracts were possible to allow us to charge a processing fee, where we previously paid rebates. Without these operational and contractual improvements, we had estimated that the recycling impact could be as much as a negative $0.08 to $0.10 per share as average commodity recycling prices declined 17.5% in 2015. However, the operational improvements lessened that negative impact to negative $0.04 per share. 
On the recycling commodity price front, 2016 has seen a continuation of the downward slide, and current prices are down $20 per ton or 23% from January of 2015. These are levels that we've not seen in nearly 7 years since the 2009 recession. If we do not see a normal seasonal uptick in commodity prices and prices remain at January levels, this would be a $0.02 to $0.03 headwind in 2016. We're committed to recycling, and we'll continue to work to change the business model to generate revenue that covers our processing costs and drive out operating expenses so that the business is sustainable over the long term. 
Turning to free cash flow. Our strong operating results, coupled with continued discipline in capital spending, allowed us to generate $1.41 billion of free cash flow in 2015. Included in that free cash flow number was a $150 million prepayment of 2016 cash taxes. We had mentioned on the third quarter conference call that we'd make this type of prepayment, given that our cash flow is going to be above the high end of our $1.5 billion range. Consequently, we increased our 2016 guidance to between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. 
So when we look at our success in 2015 and our guidance for 2016, we look at 3 things: first is price. In 2015, we exceeded our goals. And for 2016, it's pretty much locked and loaded and already in process. So we're very confident we'll meet our 4% target in 2016. 
Second is costs. Again, we did well in 2015, and we believe there's plenty of room to improve in 2016. So again, we're very confident. 
And finally, volumes. In 2014 and 2015, we built momentum. And for the first time in many years, I'm very confident that we'll see our volumes turn positive toward the end of 2016. So we go into 2016 with a lot of confidence and look forward to another strong year. 
We expect that our continued execution of these strategic priorities will drive 2016 adjusted EPS to between $2.74 and $2.79. And we expect operating EBITDA to grow at the fastest rate in 10 years, up 5% to $3.6 billion. But we can't do it without our people.

I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our fourth quarter results and our 2016 outlook in more detail."
190694,321989988,936202,"Waste Management, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David.

That is why we need to maintain our focus on fixing recycling. As David s",1440,"Thank you, David. We produced solid growth in earnings and cash flow in 2015, and it would've been even better when you realize that recycling is down $0.30 per share from its peak. That is why we need to maintain our focus on fixing recycling. As David said, we're committed to recycling. And for the last 2 years, we've been working to improve our recycling business. We want to see recycling thrive because it's the right thing for our environment and it's the right thing for our customers. We just want to make sure it's the right thing for our shareholders. 
We performed well in 2015 navigating the recycling headwinds, which I'll discuss in a moment. But we're in the fourth year of low recycling commodity prices, and we are currently seeing these commodity prices at the lowest levels we've seen since the 2009 recession. Since there's little we can do to affect global market conditions, we're doubling down on those areas we can control. We've tightened our belt on investments. We're driving operational efficiencies. We're working with our community partners to reduce the amount of expensive contamination at our MRFs. We're optimizing our MRF network, and we're tackling the slow, difficult but necessary process of changing the terms of our contracts. 
Together, these actions produce real measurable results in 2015 and are expected to make recycling profitable over the long term. Initially, we expected the headwind in the recycling line of business would be between $0.08 and $0.10 of EPS. However, the full year impact ended up only $0.04 negative. That was not driven by an improvement in commodity prices, but was due to the actions that we took to improve recycling operations. 
Recycling was one of several market factors we overcame in 2015. In addition to the force and impact from recycling, we had a $0.09 per share headwind related to low demands for energy and environmental services, a $0.04 impact from foreign currency changes. 
Despite these market pressures, our EPS grew more than 13% to $2.61 per share in 2015. We overcame those headwinds through cost controls and strong growth in our traditional solid waste business, and those efforts will continue into 2016. 
At the beginning of 2015, we expected to see a $60 million improvement in SG&A costs when compared to 2014. I'm pleased with our 2015 results, as SG&A cost for the full year improved $68 million to $1.34 billion and improved as a percent of revenue by 20 basis points to 10.4%. For the fourth quarter, SG&A costs were $343 million, an improvement of $27 million compared to 2014. As a percent of revenue, SG&A costs improved 70 basis points to 10.6%. 
For 2016, we will continue to focus on managing the anticipated wage increases, cost inflation and incremental SG&A brought on from the acquisitions. But despite these increases, we anticipate that SG&A costs should be flat when compared to 2015. 
Turning to cash flow. For the full year, we generated $1.41 billion of free cash flow. As we mentioned on our third quarter earnings call, we expected we would have a strong year of free cash flow and that we would likely make tax payments, assuming the tax extenders were not going to be enacted. Therefore, in the fourth quarter, we prepaid $150 million of 2016 cash taxes. 
For 2016, we now anticipate between $60 million and $70 million of cash tax savings from the impact of bonus depreciation, which was reinstated by Congress at the eleventh hour. During 2016, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. In 2016, the impacts of organic earnings growth, bonus depreciation, acquisitions and higher capital spending should drive free cash flow to between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. 
In the fourth quarter, we returned $172 million to our shareholders through our dividends. For the full year 2015, we returned about $1.3 billion to our shareholders consisting of $695 million in dividends and share repurchases of $600 million. Our board has indicated its intention to increase dividends in 2016 by 6.5% to $1.64 per share on an annual basis. And this is the 13th consecutive year of increased dividends. For 2016, our anticipated annual dividends will result in approximately $730 million being returned to our shareholders. 
We expect to spend around $100 million to $200 million on tuck-in acquisitions in 2016, with the remainder of free cash flow allocated to share repurchases. We have authorization from our Board of Directors to repurchase $1 billion of our shares. We've already repurchased $150 million and expect to spend an additional $500 million for the full year. 
Fourth quarter revenues were $3.25 billion. We saw a $59 million increase in revenues from acquisitions and a $50 million increase in our traditional solid waste business due to the combined impacts of pricing and volume. We saw an overall revenue decline of $163 million from divestitures, $43 million in lower fuel surcharge revenues, a $34 million decline from lower recycling revenues and a $33 million decline in foreign currency. 
Looking at internal revenue growth. For the total company in the fourth quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.2%, and yield was 1.7%, with total volumes declining 0.9%. This led to total company income from operations growing $42 million, operating income margin expanding 150 basis points to 17.7%, operating EBITDA growing $37 million and operating EBITDA margin growing 150 basis points to 27%. For the full year, income from operations grew $97 million, operating income margin expanded 120 basis points and operating EBITDA grew $86 million and operating EBITDA margin grew 130 basis points to 26.5%.
Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefits of our disciplined pricing programs in the fourth quarter. Our commercial core price was 5.8% with yield of 2.9%. Our industrial core price was 8.7% with yield of 2.3%. And residential achieved 2.2% core price and 1.5% yield. Overall, collection core price was 5.3%, and yield was 2.2%. Our focus on customer service, which helped reduce our churn, and disciplined growth also benefited our volume trends in the fourth quarter as volume declined only 0.6%. 
The volume change was a 90 basis point improvement sequentially from the third quarter and a 190 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2014. This core price and volume led to operating EBITDA growing $11.7 million and margin expanding 30 basis points. 
In the landfill line of business, we saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive yield in the fourth quarter just as we have all year. We saw same-store average MSW rates increase year-over-year by 2.4% from Q4 of 2014. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year MSW rate increases. 
Total landfill volumes increased 0.5%. MSW volumes grew by 11.1%, and C&D volume grew 15.8%. While special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes declined 7.4%. The special waste decline was predominantly driven by the decline in our energy services business. The positive volume and yield led to income from operations growing $15 million, margins growing 160 basis points, operating EBITDA increasing $14 million and operating EBITDA margins increasing 120 basis points. 
Moving now to operating expenses. These expenses improved by $50 million in the fourth quarter and as a percent of revenue, improved 80 basis points to 62.4%. For the full year, operating expenses improved $328 million and as a percent of revenue, improved 100 basis points to 63.1%. In 2015, our focus on improving operating costs saw significant traction, and we expect that to continue into 2016. For the full year, we saw improvements of $187 million in fuel costs, $102 million in cost of goods sold and $35 million in labor costs as we continue to see the benefits from our routing and logistics program. 
Finally, looking at our other financial metrics. At the end of the fourth quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.66, and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.32%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 8% at the end of the quarter. The effective tax rate was approximately 32.4% in the fourth quarter and 32.3% for the full year. Taxes were a $0.01 headwind to EPS in the fourth quarter. 
In conclusion, 2015 was a very good year for Waste Management, as our employees did a great job of focusing on price, disciplined growth and cost controls. I want to say thank you to our employees for their hard work in delivering a successful 2015 and positioning us to continue that into 2016. We're excited about continued growth in '16 and beyond. 
And with that, Cornesia, let's open the line for questions."

I mean, that's going to be the big acquisition that we do in 2016. When I look at acquisitions, we've done RCI in Montréal. We did Deffenbaugh in Kansas City, and now we've done SWS in South Florida. And those were spectacular acquisitions for us because they're a fairly large amount of revenue, but they're also straight tuck-ins into our business. And so we know exactly how to do them. We know exactly how to get the dollars out. It takes a little bit of time, but we know exactly how to do them. So the more of those that we could do, the better. We thought there might be a few or more of those in the pipeline. But those -- call them those $400 million to $500 million transactions, we really don't see a lot of those on the near horizon right now. So I think 2016 will be a year, where it's mostly driven by tuck-in acquisitions. But again, we'd love to do some larger acquisitions like those 3 that we did in Montréal, Kansas City and South Florida. Pricing, I don't think, has changed dramatically. We've said it many times. We generally pay a little bit lower price for those smaller tuck-ins. And it's because you can pay a little bit higher price when you get that bigger bulk of business like we did down at SWS, although even with SWS, on a post-synergy basis, we'll end up paying sort of 6 to 7x EBITDA."

We're kind of calling it $170 million in EBITDA growth year-over-year, which includes -- that includes organic growth, that includes some of the benefit of acquisitions. I add in the impact of bonus depreciation, which I mentioned, was, let's call it, $70 million. And then our CapEx is going to be a bit higher this year. I mentioned the $1.3 billion to the $1.4 billion range, so back out $100 million in added CapEx. And I arrive in the middle of that range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. And keep in mind there, Corey, that the prepayments that we made in cash taxes is really offset by the benefit we got from the Q1 '15 debt transaction. So those 2 kind of offset each other.

And then when I look at moving from $261 million up to our range of $275 million to $279 million, I'm really adding in the kind of our traditional waste -- solid waste growth that we expect and we talked about on the EBITDA line. So hopefully, that helps."

So if we go back and look over the last few quarters, including Q4, it looks like the spread between core price and average yield has actually widened out. And at least from an outside perspective, it just looks like you're keeping less and less of that core price increase. Can you guys talk a little bit about that relationship and why that, that spread is widening out? I mean, it sounds like churn is actually trending well and the gap between new and lost business isn't widening. So is it mix? Or what's going on there?"

So the reason we've moved to core price is because core price is really an indicator of the price increases that we put across our current customer base. To go from core price to yield, you then put in -- because we do it on a per unit basis, you then come in do a lot of things like mix. And so the biggest thing that we think drove the disparity between the core price and yield was the fact that our energy services business was down fairly dramatically, and those are very high-priced hauls. Compared to -- if you look at an energy service haul compared to an industrial container at a shopping mall, the price per haul difference is dramatic. And so the fact that energy services dropped off, as we said, $0.09 for the year, when you saw that dramatic drop off in energy services, you lost a lot of those very high-priced pulls. And that's where the biggest chunk of the disparity between core price and yield comes in."

It includes large retailers, it includes manufacturing and industrial, it includes construction and it includes energy services. And those really were -- there was a wide spectrum there. Construction, as I mentioned earlier, really finished the year on a high note. So we're very happy with that, and it looks like it's going to do well going forward. The large retailers, we're pretty solid, as was manufacturing and industrial. It looks like industrial production figures came out today, and looks like they're decent. And that's kind of what we saw as well, pretty solid in manufacturing and industrial. The one real soft spot, and you'll hear it several times today, was energy services, and it got worse throughout the year. So we were down 32% in our energy services business, albeit on kind of a small base there, but down 32% and down 45% in the fourth quarter. And looking through that kind of small lens, we don't see energy services getting much better in '16.

I mean, look, in our business, what you had happened last year was, obviously, you had the inventory build and then working off the inventory. And that's what I think drove everybody to say, oh gosh, what's going on in the manufacturing sector? Jim pointed out, you saw some good numbers from it today. But when they build up the inventory and then they work down the inventory, they don't shut down their plants, they still operate their plants. And so that really just doesn't have that big of an effect on us. It doesn't have an effect on us until they shut down the plants, and I don't think anyone's seeing a shutdown of plants, I think they're seeing a little bit of a slowdown of the plants. And so when we look at our industrial waste, it really isn't going to be affected by the manufacturing and industrial space. And then the final piece is that a lot of the low energy prices are a big boon to a lot of the manufacturing and industrial customers that we have in the chemical corridor, all the way from Beaumont, Texas up through the Midwest. And so we see the manufacturing and industrial volumes actually being very strong. As Jim said, we've got a wide spectrum from extremely strong construction to weak on the energy services side. And manufacturing and industrial, I'd say, would come in on sort of the slightly positive side of that spectrum. So we don't see that particularly slowing in 2016, and we expect industrial volumes to continue to be positive in 2016."

Look, look, this is an easy question to answer. Because you can't look at just a volume number, you've got to look at what is that volume made up of, right?

Because you can't look at just a volume number, you've got to look at what is that volume made up of, right? If that volume is made up of brokered volumes, you're not making any money on it. If that volume is made up of recycling volumes, you're not making any money on it. And so when I look at the volumes, I don't say look at the overall volume number, I say look where the volumes are coming from. So for us, we've got positive volumes in the industrial line, which is a very high margin line for us. We've got positive volumes in the landfill line, which is the highest margin business that we have. And we're about to turn the corner to get positive volumes on the commercial line, we're at negative 0.7% in the quarter. I would expect to see that turn positive during 2016. So we're adding volume in the high margin areas. We are losing volume in recycling, we're losing volume in brokered business, and we're losing volume in non-core, all very low margin businesses. And so if you get positive volume and margins go backwards, I don't see that as a good volume report. If you get negative volumes and margins go up by 150 basis points, I view that as fairly positive. So I think it's a very easy question to answer. We look for volumes where we can make money on those volumes. We don't look for volumes for the sake of volumes. And so -- but having said all that, in those moneymaking volumes, we're going to see the overall volume number turn positive in 2016, and that's what I  look forward to. Look, this is a high fixed-cost business and layering in that volume on the high fixed costs allows you to drop a big flow-through to the bottom line. So I think we've done the right thing. We'll continue to do the right thing. We'll continue to add volumes where we can make money."

And so on the recycling front, we're probably about 75% to 80% through. On the CPI front, about 20% of our business is -- our CPI-related business is either on a floating index that more approximates the waste services index, or they're on a fixed price increase track with over 2.5% fixed price increases. In other words, 2.5% is sort of our inflation rate. About 20% of our contracts are either on a CPI-based measure or that, that is not CPI, but would be, for example, the waste and water index or what we call a solid waste index. So that runs at a higher rate generally than our 2.5% inflation. And then we've got other contracts where they run higher than our 2.5% inflation because they have fixed price increases at over 2.5%. So about 20% of our business is under those types of contracts. So there's still a lot of room to go on the residential and on the national accounts side to get those CPI contracts moved up, but we're about 20% through."

If we can get contracts on those terms, we're not going to be shutting down plants, we'll be adding plants. And so what we're trying to get to is how we can make this business sustainable for the long run. I think we've done a spectacular job with our recycling folks of doing that. I'm a firm believer that the industry is going to follow, just because the economics don't allow them to do anything different than what we're doing. And so I think over the long haul, even in a lower, longer commodity price environment, I think we can grow recycling.

190694,321989988,936507,"Waste Management, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2016",2016-02-18,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. 2015 was a very successful year as our commitment to core pricing, disciplined growth and controlling costs generated our highest adjusted earnings per share ever. We grew our income from operations and operating",1418,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. 2015 was a very successful year as our commitment to core pricing, disciplined growth and controlling costs generated our highest adjusted earnings per share ever. We grew our income from operations and operating EBITDA and achieved the highest operating margins we've seen since 2010. We generated earnings per share of $2.61 in spite of the divestitures of our Wheelabrator in Puerto Rico and Eastern Canada operations and headwinds from recycling commodity prices and foreign currency translation. 
In 2015, we saw the execution of pricing, productivity and growth strategy strengthen our foundation in a way that will lead to continued growth in 2016 and beyond. During 2015, our strong free cash flow allowed us to return almost $1.3 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. We've seen solid growth in cash generation in our business over the last few years, and we're confident that our free cash flow has reached a new base of at least $1.4 billion per year, up from the $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion level that has characterized the last several years. 
As a result of confidence in our cash flow, our board decided to increase the dividend by 6.5% in 2016 and to authorize up to $1 billion of share repurchases. We acquired Deffenbaugh and several small solid waste companies in 2015. And in early 2016, we closed on the acquisition of Southern Waste Systems, or SWS. The acquisition of SWS and other smaller tuck-ins we expect to close in 2016 should generate between $50 million and $75 million of operating EBITDA in 2016. As we've previously mentioned, the operating EBITDA from these acquisitions won't translate into earnings per share in 2016 because we'll have corresponding intangible amortization. However, the transactions will generate cash flow in 2016 and incremental earnings starting in the second half of 2017. 
Looking at our operations in 2015. Our pricing programs continued to drive earnings growth and margin expansion. When we gave initial guidance for 2015, we targeted core price of 3.8% for the full year, and we exceeded that target. For the full year, our collection and disposal core price was 4.2%, with yield at 1.8%. We've now seen 8 consecutive quarters with core price of 4% or greater. For the full year, core price in the commercial line of business was 6.1%, industrial was 8.6% and the landfill line of business was 2.4%. For 2016, we expect core price to be about 4%, and then total revenue growth from yield should again be in the range of 1.5% to 2%. 
Our pricing teams continue to perform at high levels, and we'll continue our focus on price in 2016. The pricing excellence is not a 1-year project at Waste Management. It's a way of life. We must get pricing to keep up with inflation, and we have the tools and the people to do that indefinitely. 
Our traditional solid waste volumes, which include our collection, transfer and landfill volumes, were a negative 0.5% for the full year. But importantly, we saw positive trends throughout 2015, with traditional solid waste volumes improving sequentially each quarter, culminating in a slightly positive fourth quarter. Although commercial and residential were still negative, we continue to see positive momentum in those volumes, particularly in our commercial line of business. In that line, we've seen 6 consecutive quarters in which the rate of decline has improved. And commercial collection was down only 0.7% in the fourth quarter versus down 1.3% in the third quarter. Our continued focus on disciplined volume growth and customer service is paying dividends. 
Our churn was 10.1% for the full year, the lowest level since 2012. In the fourth quarter, it was 9%, the lowest level since 2002. And we did all of this while reducing rollbacks in 2015. So we're keeping our customers through improved service, not price concessions. 
We saw our new business exceed our lost business for the eighth consecutive quarter. These are all positive signs that our volumes are headed in the right direction without resorting to lowering prices. 
Total company volume, which includes lower-margin recycling, brokered and nonsolid waste volumes, declined 1.6% for the full year, with the fourth quarter being the best quarter of the year, declining only 0.9%. For 2016, we expect that traditional solid waste volumes will be positive. However, we do not see a recovery in recycling and nonsolid waste volumes, which would lead to overall volumes being about flat. Of course, some of the recycling volume that we lose is a direct result of our efforts to shed unprofitable volume, so losing certain volumes in the recycling business is not such a bad thing. And we expect that overall volumes will turn positive in the second half of the year. 
As you can see, the pricing volume trade-off continues to be very positive. For the full year, the company's income from operations grew 4.6%, and our income from operations margin grew 120 basis points. In addition, operating EBITDA increased about 3%, and operating EBITDA margins increased 130 basis points to 26.5%. 
Our solid EPS growth was achieved despite a $0.09 per share decline from our energy and environmental services business, which has been affected by the sharp decrease in market prices for oil, a negative $0.04 impact from foreign currency translation and a negative $0.04 impact from recycling operations. 
Looking more closely at recycling. We made significant progress improving operating costs and on renegotiating contractual terms with our customers, including exiting some unprofitable contracts. Our recycling employees worked hard and reduced gross operating expenses by 15%. And changed contracts were possible to allow us to charge a processing fee, where we previously paid rebates. Without these operational and contractual improvements, we had estimated that the recycling impact could be as much as a negative $0.08 to $0.10 per share as average commodity recycling prices declined 17.5% in 2015. However, the operational improvements lessened that negative impact to negative $0.04 per share. 
On the recycling commodity price front, 2016 has seen a continuation of the downward slide, and current prices are down $20 per ton or 23% from January of 2015. These are levels that we've not seen in nearly 7 years since the 2009 recession. If we do not see a normal seasonal uptick in commodity prices and prices remain at January levels, this would be a $0.02 to $0.03 headwind in 2016. We're committed to recycling, and we'll continue to work to change the business model to generate revenue that covers our processing costs and drive out operating expenses so that the business is sustainable over the long term. 
Turning to free cash flow. Our strong operating results, coupled with continued discipline in capital spending, allowed us to generate $1.41 billion of free cash flow in 2015. Included in that free cash flow number was a $150 million prepayment of 2016 cash taxes. We had mentioned on the third quarter conference call that we'd make this type of prepayment, given that our cash flow is going to be above the high end of our $1.5 billion range. Consequently, we increased our 2016 guidance to between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. 
So when we look at our success in 2015 and our guidance for 2016, we look at 3 things: first is price. In 2015, we exceeded our goals. And for 2016, it's pretty much locked and loaded and already in process. So we're very confident we'll meet our 4% target in 2016. 
Second is costs. Again, we did well in 2015, and we believe there's plenty of room to improve in 2016. So again, we're very confident. 
And finally, volumes. In 2014 and 2015, we built momentum. And for the first time in many years, I'm very confident that we'll see our volumes turn positive toward the end of 2016. So we go into 2016 with a lot of confidence and look forward to another strong year. 
We expect that our continued execution of these strategic priorities will drive 2016 adjusted EPS to between $2.74 and $2.79. And we expect operating EBITDA to grow at the fastest rate in 10 years, up 5% to $3.6 billion. But we can't do it without our people. I'd be remiss if I didn't thank them for their hard work and professionalism, and I know they will once again prove their value in 2016. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our fourth quarter results and our 2016 outlook in more detail."

That is why we need to maintain our focus on fixing recycling. As David s",1440,"Thank you, David. We produced solid growth in earnings and cash flow in 2015, and it would've been even better when you realize that recycling is down $0.30 per share from its peak. That is why we need to maintain our focus on fixing recycling. As David said, we're committed to recycling. And for the last 2 years, we've been working to improve our recycling business. We want to see recycling thrive because it's the right thing for our environment and it's the right thing for our customers. We just want to make sure it's the right thing for our shareholders. 
We performed well in 2015 navigating the recycling headwinds, which I'll discuss in a moment. But we're in the fourth year of low recycling commodity prices, and we are currently seeing these commodity prices at the lowest levels we've seen since the 2009 recession. Since there's little we can do to affect global market conditions, we're doubling down on those areas we can control. We've tightened our belt on investments. We're driving operational efficiencies. We're working with our community partners to reduce the amount of expensive contamination at our MRFs. We're optimizing our MRF network, and we're tackling the slow, difficult but necessary process of changing the terms of our contracts. 
Together, these actions produce real measurable results in 2015 and are expected to make recycling profitable over the long term. Initially, we expected the headwind in the recycling line of business would be between $0.08 and $0.10 of EPS. However, the full year impact ended up only $0.04 negative. That was not driven by an improvement in commodity prices, but was due to the actions that we took to improve recycling operations. 
Recycling was one of several market factors we overcame in 2015. In addition to the force and impact from recycling, we had a $0.09 per share headwind related to low demands for energy and environmental services, a $0.04 impact from foreign currency changes. 
Despite these market pressures, our EPS grew more than 13% to $2.61 per share in 2015. We overcame those headwinds through cost controls and strong growth in our traditional solid waste business, and those efforts will continue into 2016. 
At the beginning of 2015, we expected to see a $60 million improvement in SG&A costs when compared to 2014. I'm pleased with our 2015 results, as SG&A cost for the full year improved $68 million to $1.34 billion and improved as a percent of revenue by 20 basis points to 10.4%. For the fourth quarter, SG&A costs were $343 million, an improvement of $27 million compared to 2014. As a percent of revenue, SG&A costs improved 70 basis points to 10.6%. 
For 2016, we will continue to focus on managing the anticipated wage increases, cost inflation and incremental SG&A brought on from the acquisitions. But despite these increases, we anticipate that SG&A costs should be flat when compared to 2015. 
Turning to cash flow. For the full year, we generated $1.41 billion of free cash flow. As we mentioned on our third quarter earnings call, we expected we would have a strong year of free cash flow and that we would likely make tax payments, assuming the tax extenders were not going to be enacted. Therefore, in the fourth quarter, we prepaid $150 million of 2016 cash taxes. 
For 2016, we now anticipate between $60 million and $70 million of cash tax savings from the impact of bonus depreciation, which was reinstated by Congress at the eleventh hour. During 2016, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. In 2016, the impacts of organic earnings growth, bonus depreciation, acquisitions and higher capital spending should drive free cash flow to between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. 
In the fourth quarter, we returned $172 million to our shareholders through our dividends. For the full year 2015, we returned about $1.3 billion to our shareholders consisting of $695 million in dividends and share repurchases of $600 million. Our board has indicated its intention to increase dividends in 2016 by 6.5% to $1.64 per share on an annual basis. And this is the 13th consecutive year of increased dividends. For 2016, our anticipated annual dividends will result in approximately $730 million being returned to our shareholders. 
We expect to spend around $100 million to $200 million on tuck-in acquisitions in 2016, with the remainder of free cash flow allocated to share repurchases. We have authorization from our Board of Directors to repurchase $1 billion of our shares. We've already repurchased $150 million and expect to spend an additional $500 million for the full year. 
Fourth quarter revenues were $3.25 billion. We saw a $59 million increase in revenues from acquisitions and a $50 million increase in our traditional solid waste business due to the combined impacts of pricing and volume. We saw an overall revenue decline of $163 million from divestitures, $43 million in lower fuel surcharge revenues, a $34 million decline from lower recycling revenues and a $33 million decline in foreign currency. 
Looking at internal revenue growth. For the total company in the fourth quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.2%, and yield was 1.7%, with total volumes declining 0.9%. This led to total company income from operations growing $42 million, operating income margin expanding 150 basis points to 17.7%, operating EBITDA growing $37 million and operating EBITDA margin growing 150 basis points to 27%. For the full year, income from operations grew $97 million, operating income margin expanded 120 basis points and operating EBITDA grew $86 million and operating EBITDA margin grew 130 basis points to 26.5%.
Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefits of our disciplined pricing programs in the fourth quarter. Our commercial core price was 5.8% with yield of 2.9%. Our industrial core price was 8.7% with yield of 2.3%. And residential achieved 2.2% core price and 1.5% yield. Overall, collection core price was 5.3%, and yield was 2.2%. Our focus on customer service, which helped reduce our churn, and disciplined growth also benefited our volume trends in the fourth quarter as volume declined only 0.6%. 
The volume change was a 90 basis point improvement sequentially from the third quarter and a 190 basis point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2014. This core price and volume led to operating EBITDA growing $11.7 million and margin expanding 30 basis points. 
In the landfill line of business, we saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive yield in the fourth quarter just as we have all year. We saw same-store average MSW rates increase year-over-year by 2.4% from Q4 of 2014. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year MSW rate increases. 
Total landfill volumes increased 0.5%. MSW volumes grew by 11.1%, and C&D volume grew 15.8%. While special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes declined 7.4%. The special waste decline was predominantly driven by the decline in our energy services business. The positive volume and yield led to income from operations growing $15 million, margins growing 160 basis points, operating EBITDA increasing $14 million and operating EBITDA margins increasing 120 basis points. 
Moving now to operating expenses. These expenses improved by $50 million in the fourth quarter and as a percent of revenue, improved 80 basis points to 62.4%. For the full year, operating expenses improved $328 million and as a percent of revenue, improved 100 basis points to 63.1%. In 2015, our focus on improving operating costs saw significant traction, and we expect that to continue into 2016. For the full year, we saw improvements of $187 million in fuel costs, $102 million in cost of goods sold and $35 million in labor costs as we continue to see the benefits from our routing and logistics program. 
Finally, looking at our other financial metrics. At the end of the fourth quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.66, and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.32%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 8% at the end of the quarter. The effective tax rate was approximately 32.4% in the fourth quarter and 32.3% for the full year. Taxes were a $0.01 headwind to EPS in the fourth quarter. 
In conclusion, 2015 was a very good year for Waste Management, as our employees did a great job of focusing on price, disciplined growth and cost controls. I want to say thank you to our employees for their hard work in delivering a successful 2015 and positioning us to continue that into 2016. We're excited about continued growth in '16 and beyond. 
And with that, Cornesia, let's open the line for questions."

We know exactly how to get the dollars out. It takes a little bit of time, but we know exactly how to do them. So the more of those that we could do, the better. We thought there might be a few or more of those in the pipeline. But those -- call them those $400 million to $500 million transactions, we really don't see a lot of those on the near horizon right now. So I think 2016 will be a year, where it's mostly driven by tuck-in acquisitions. But again, we'd love to do some larger acquisitions like those 3 that we did in Montréal, Kansas City and South Florida. Pricing, I don't think, has changed dramatically. We've said it many times. We generally pay a little bit lower price for those smaller tuck-ins. And it's because you can pay a little bit higher price when you get that bigger bulk of business like we did down at SWS, although even with SWS, on a post-synergy basis, we'll end up paying sort of 6 to 7x EBITDA."

We're kind of calling it $170 million in EBITDA growth year-over-year, which includes -- that includes organic growth, that includes some of the benefit of acquisitions. I add in the impact of bonus depreciation, which I mentioned, was, let's call it, $70 million. And then our CapEx is going to be a bit higher this year. I mentioned the $1.3 billion to the $1.4 billion range, so back out $100 million in added CapEx. And I arrive in the middle of that range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. And keep in mind there, Corey, that the prepayments that we made in cash taxes is really offset by the benefit we got from the Q1 '15 debt transaction. So those 2 kind of offset each other.

And so the biggest thing that we think drove the disparity between the core price and yield was the fact that our energy services business was down fairly dramatically, and those are very high-priced hauls. Compared to -- if you look at an energy service haul compared to an industrial container at a shopping mall, the price per haul difference is dramatic. And so the fact that energy services dropped off, as we said, $0.09 for the year, when you saw that dramatic drop off in energy services, you lost a lot of those very high-priced pulls.

It includes large retailers, it includes manufacturing and industrial, it includes construction and it includes energy services. And those really were -- there was a wide spectrum there. Construction, as I mentioned earlier, really finished the year on a high note. So we're very happy with that, and it looks like it's going to do well going forward. The large retailers, we're pretty solid, as was manufacturing and industrial. It looks like industrial production figures came out today, and looks like they're decent. And that's kind of what we saw as well, pretty solid in manufacturing and industrial. The one real soft spot, and you'll hear it several times today, was energy services, and it got worse throughout the year. So we were down 32% in our energy services business, albeit on kind of a small base there, but down 32% and down 45% in the fourth quarter. And looking through that kind of small lens, we don't see energy services getting much better in '16. But overall, the -- if you want to think about how we talk about industrial, it was more than compensated for the downturn in energy services."

I mean, look, in our business, what you had happened last year was, obviously, you had the inventory build and then working off the inventory. And that's what I think drove everybody to say, oh gosh, what's going on in the manufacturing sector? Jim pointed out, you saw some good numbers from it today. But when they build up the inventory and then they work down the inventory, they don't shut down their plants, they still operate their plants. And so that really just doesn't have that big of an effect on us. It doesn't have an effect on us until they shut down the plants, and I don't think anyone's seeing a shutdown of plants, I think they're seeing a little bit of a slowdown of the plants. And so when we look at our industrial waste, it really isn't going to be affected by the manufacturing and industrial space. And then the final piece is that a lot of the low energy prices are a big boon to a lot of the manufacturing and industrial customers that we have in the chemical corridor, all the way from Beaumont, Texas up through the Midwest. And so we see the manufacturing and industrial volumes actually being very strong. As Jim said, we've got a wide spectrum from extremely strong construction to weak on the energy services side. And manufacturing and industrial, I'd say, would come in on sort of the slightly positive side of that spectrum. So we don't see that particularly slowing in 2016, and we expect industrial volumes to continue to be positive in 2016."

Because you can't look at just a volume number, you've got to look at what is that volume made up of, right? If that volume is made up of brokered volumes, you're not making any money on it. If that volume is made up of recycling volumes, you're not making any money on it. And so when I look at the volumes, I don't say look at the overall volume number, I say look where the volumes are coming from. So for us, we've got positive volumes in the industrial line, which is a very high margin line for us. We've got positive volumes in the landfill line, which is the highest margin business that we have. And we're about to turn the corner to get positive volumes on the commercial line, we're at negative 0.7% in the quarter. I would expect to see that turn positive during 2016. So we're adding volume in the high margin areas. We are losing volume in recycling, we're losing volume in brokered business, and we're losing volume in non-core, all very low margin businesses. And so if you get positive volume and margins go backwards, I don't see that as a good volume report. If you get negative volumes and margins go up by 150 basis points, I view that as fairly positive. So I think it's a very easy question to answer. We look for volumes where we can make money on those volumes. We don't look for volumes for the sake of volumes. And so -- but having said all that, in those moneymaking volumes, we're going to see the overall volume number turn positive in 2016, and that's what I look forward to. Look, this is a high fixed-cost business and layering in that volume on the high fixed costs allows you to drop a big flow-through to the bottom line. So I think we've done the right thing. We'll continue to do the right thing. We'll continue to add volumes where we can make money."

On the CPI front, about 20% of our business is -- our CPI-related business is either on a floating index that more approximates the waste services index, or they're on a fixed price increase track with over 2.5% fixed price increases. In other words, 2.5% is sort of our inflation rate. About 20% of our contracts are either on a CPI-based measure or that, that is not CPI, but would be, for example, the waste and water index or what we call a solid waste index. So that runs at a higher rate generally than our 2.5% inflation. And then we've got other contracts where they run higher than our 2.5% inflation because they have fixed price increases at over 2.5%. So about 20% of our business is under those types of contracts. So there's still a lot of room to go on the residential and on the national accounts side to get those CPI contracts moved up, but we're about 20% through."

I think there's still plenty of room for improvement. But at this point in time, basically what we're down to is we have a series of plants, and those series of plants generally revolve around a large contract, the large municipal contract or other contracts. So if we lose that large municipal contract, absolutely, we would probably have to shut down that plant because we don't have enough volume going through that plant. We don't have any that, that we have on the early time horizon where we think that will happen, but that's basically how we'll have to respond to a low-for-long commodity price. We still have operational improvements we can make. We think we can pull out sort of that 5% to 10% operating costs for a few years. But then any bigger restructuring, we don't have any planned right now. If we did any of that, it would be based upon large contract losses that we would have, if we have those."

If we can get contracts on those terms, we're not going to be shutting down plants, we'll be adding plants. And so what we're trying to get to is how we can make this business sustainable for the long run. I think we've done a spectacular job with our recycling folks of doing that. I'm a firm believer that the industry is going to follow, just because the economics don't allow them to do anything different than what we're doing. And so I think over the long haul, even in a lower, longer commodity price environment, I think we can grow recycling.

We also saw the continued strength in our pricing",1304,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston.
Our first quarter results continued the positive trends that we saw throughout 2015, and our volumes turned positive more quickly than we had originally planned. We also saw the continued strength in our pricing programs and our cost programs continue to gain traction. This focus on disciplined growth, pricing and continues cost improvement delivered $0.58 per share in the quarter, an increase of more than 18% from our 2015 first quarter results.
Our revenue increased for the first time since 2014, and we achieved positive volumes for the first time since 2012. Our employees are doing a great job of managing cost increase that drive earnings growth and margin expansion.
In the first quarter, we saw improvement in virtually every financial metric that we track. Our traditional solid waste business income from operations increased $60 million and margin increased 30 basis points. And our operating EBITDA improved $90 million and margin increased 50 basis points. We're very pleased with our first quarter results as they provide a strong start to 2016.
Turning to operations. Our pricing programs continued to drive earnings growth and margin expansion. For the first quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 5.3% and yield was 2.6%. Core price improved to 90 basis points from the first quarter of 2015 to the highest level that we've achieved, and we also saw the highest core price ever in each of the commercial, industrial and landfill lines of business. Core price in the industrial line was 10.7%. In the commercial line, it was 7.5%. In our landfill line, it was 3.3% and our residential line, it was 2.6%. As volumes have turned positive, we expect core price to remain strong.
With respect to volumes, we saw a positive volume growth in the first quarter, but we did not chase low margin volumes by lowering price. We continue to drive disciplined growth by adding volumes in geographic areas and lines of business where growth is strongest. Our volumes reflect both strong solid waste economic backdrop and the great work by our sales and operating teams. Our traditional solid waste volumes were positive 2.4% in the first quarter of 2016, a 360 basis point improvement compared to 2015. We had one additional work day in 2016 and after adjusting for this, our traditional solid waste volume improved 1.8%. 
We some very positive trends in our commercial and industrial lines of business. Our commercial volumes declined only 0.2% in the first quarter, an improvement of 50 basis points from the fourth quarter and a 260 basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2015.
In the industrial line of business, volumes were more than doubled to 2.7% on a work day adjusted basis when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. We are very pleased with our traditional solid waste volume results in the first quarter, although we likely did see some benefit from the milder winter weather that may have led to some second quarter construction landfill volumes being pulled into the first quarter. We certainly expect volumes to remain positive throughout 2016, but we would like to see the extent of the seasonal uptick before we revisit our full year expectations for volumes.
Our landfill line of business continues to show strong operational results as we saw the benefit of increased core price and strong volumes, as Jim will discuss in more detail. However, we see a significant increase in the cost of managing the liquids that naturally occurs-ed in our landfill. Over the last 3 years, bleach aid cost have increased between 1% and 22%, and in the first quarter of 2016, the increase was greater than that with cost up about $14 million. This trend of increasing bleach aid cost has been ongoing for a number of years and we believe it's a common issue throughout our industry. With the increase in volumes, we've seen more liquids and the cost to transport and treat those liquids have increased substantially. Of course, the added cost to our landfills effects our profitability and return on capital, so we need to do something to offset those increasing costs.
Consequently, this quarter we'll begin to implement a liquids management charge at our landfill. This charge will be between 4% and 7% at the cost of disposal and will be applied only to our landfill customers and not to our collection customers. Of course, many of our disposal contracts are long-term, but just as we did with our if fuel recovery and recycling charges, we'll implement the liquids management charge on contracts as they renewal. Only by doing this can we maintain an adequate return on the huge capital investments that we make in our landfills.
Turning to recycling. We saw a drop of 12% in average commodity prices for the quarter and a 3.1% increase in volumes. The positive volumes are predominantly due to the unusually low broker volumes that we saw in the first quarter of 2015, associated with the slowdown in Western U.S. points. This should normalize and will likely be negative in the second quarter so we don't expect to see recycling volumes contributing to our overall volume growth. But the volumes that we're losing are generally not profitable volume, so the negative volumes won't negatively affect profitability.
Our employees have done a good job in managing operating cost and we've seen our recycling operating cost improved 12% when compared to the first quarter of 2015. However, the operational improvements have not been enough to offset the declining commodity prices. So our recycling income from operations or slightly negative in the first quarter, but we saw a year-over-year improvement of almost $0.02 per share.
Commodity prices have come off the load that we saw in January, but that's still below 2015 levels and we do not expect any significant rebound in 2016. So we continue to work with our customers to develop a mutually beneficial solution that allows for sustainable recycling program in their community. We're committed to recycling and we'll continue to work to change the business model and drive out operating expenses.
Finally, in the first quarter, our business generated strong growth in operating EBITDA, which in turn translated into significant cash generation. Cash flow from operating activities exceeded $700 million, an increase of more than $200 million when compared to the first quarter of 2015. We did have about $156 million and cash flow benefits in the quarter, which Jim will discuss, but even if you adjust those, cash from operating activities grew by 10.2% So 2016 is off to a strong start, and our results ask for be on track to meet or exceed our full year guidance of adjusted earnings per diluted share between $2.74 and $2.79. We also expect to achieve our full year free cash flow guidance of between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion.
Based on first quarter volume results, we also expect to beat our volume going for the year. I certainly believe that this will be the case, but we have favorable weather in the first quarter and we do expect that volumes will be put forward into the first quarter. As noted previously, we also like how you recycling volumes, which will not continue through the year. We'll get a better feel for the effects of these factors when we see our second quarter seasonal uptick. After we see volumes normalize, we expect to give more precise volume and financial guidance for the year. But we certainly expect to see continued year-over-year improvement across all of our operating metrics. It's a reflection of a strength of our corporate and build games to see our strategy so well executed.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our first quarter results in more detail."

In the first quarter, revenues were $3.2 billion, an increase of $136 million or 4.5% when compared to the first quarter of 2015. We saw $126 million increase in our traditional solid waste business due to the combined impacts of price and volume, and an $81 million increase in revenues from acquisitions net of divestitures. These increases were partially offset by declines of $32 million in lower fuel surcharge revenues, $18 million in foreign currency fluctuations and a $13 million decline from lower recycling revenues.
Looking at internal revenue growth for the total company. In the first quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 5.3% and yield was 2.6%, with total volumes improving 1.8%. We have 1 additional work day in the first quarter. Adjusting for the additional work day, volumes improved 1.3%. Volumes turned positive in the quarter for the first time since 2012. The combined positive price and positive volume led to total company income from operations growing $54 million, operating income margin expanding 110 basis points to 16%, operating EBITDA growing $74 million and operating EBITDA margin growing 130 basis points to 25.8%. 
Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefits of our disciplined pricing programs. Overall, collection core price was 6.5% and yield was 3.4%. Our strong core price reflects a disciplined approach to pricing and a strong demand for our services.
In the first quarter, we continue to make progress on reducing the churn through our improved customer service. Our churn in the quarter was 9.2%, 170 basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2015. The improvement in our churn, strong roll off demands and our focus on disciplined growth, benefited our volume trends in the first quarter as total production volumes returned positive, improving 70 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter and 240 basis points from the first quarter of 2015.
Industrial demand was strong in the quarter with volumes up 4.2% or 2.7% on a work-day adjusted basis.
Our residential business continues to be a drag on volumes, while commercial volumes are moving towards positive. For the quarter, residential volumes declined 3.4% and commercial volumes declined 0.2%, a year-over-year improvement of 260 basis points. Strong core price and positive volume in the collection line of business led to income from operations growing $21 million and operating EBITDA growing $36 million.
In the landfill line of business, we also saw the benefits of positive volume and positive yield in the first quarter just as we did last year. Total landfill volumes increased 11.6% and 10.3% on a workday adjusted basis. On a work-day adjusted basis, MSW volumes grew by 13.4%, C&D volume grew by 22.6% and combined special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes grew 2.9%. The landfill volumes were stronger than we expected in part due to milder weather and a couple of onetime events. We do not expect that the onetime events will repeat, so we continue throughout the year landfill volumes may moderate which should remain solidly positive as we face increasingly tougher comparisons.
We achieved core price of 3.3% and saw a same-store average MSW rates increase year-over-year by 2.1% from Q1 of 2015. The positive volume and yield led to income from operations growing $29 million, margins growing 60 basis points, operating EBITDA increasing $40 million and operating EBITDA margins increasing 40 basis points.
Moving now to operating expenses. As a percent of revenue, these expenses improved 120 basis points to 62.8%. For the first quarter, operating expenses increased $47 million when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Landfill operating cost increased the most at $17 million, an increase of more than 27% year-over-year. $14 million of the $17 million increase was leachate costs, which is one of the reasons that David the importance of imposing a charge to recover our increasing costs. The remainder of the operating cost increases primarily relate to our increased volumes and cost related to acquired operations.
For the first quarter, as a percent of revenue SG&A cost for 11.4%, flat when compared to the first quarter 2015. On a dollar basis, SG&A costs were $362 million, an increase of $14 million compared to 2015. Labor cost drove the majority of the increase primarily related to acquisitions. We also had higher accruals for incentive compensation costs related to our strong performance. We still expect to improve SG&A cost as a percent of revenue for the full year when compared to 2015.
Turning to cash flow for the first quarter, our operating EBITDA growth of almost 10%, translated into strong cash flow growth. Cash provided by operating activities was $706 million, a $207 million increase compared to the first quarter of 2015. Included in the 2016 results was a $67 million benefit from the termination of a cross currency hedge. We terminated the financial hedge because we borrowed money in Canadian dollars, thus providing a natural hedge against fluctuations in the Canadian dollar. The termination of the hedge had a negative $0.01 impact to EPS.
In addition, favorably affecting our year-over-year comparisons were nearly $90 million from timing and size of compensation payments. Excluding those benefits, we had strong growth as cash provided by operating activities grew 10.2%. 
During the first quarter, we spent $317 million in capital expenditures, an increase of 87 -- $84 million when compared to the first quarter of 2015. The increase was related to an intentional change in the timing of our truck purchases. However, as David mentioned, the cost of transporting our leachate has increased substantially, so we are building some additional leachate treatments facilities. This will help put cost over the long run, but will increase capital expenditures in 2016 and 2017. This makes its very important to implement our liquids recovery charge so we can offset some of these capital costs and generate acceptable returns. Nevertheless, we still believe that will be within our guidance range of between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion.
In the first quarter, we also had $13 million of proceeds from the divested assets. Combined, we generated $402 million of free cash flow, an increase of $117 million when compared to the first quarter 2015. This puts us well on our way to achieving or exceeding our free cash flow guidance of between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. In the first quarter, we returned $433 million to shareholders, we paid $183 million in dividends and we repurchased $250 million of shares.
Finally, looking at our other financial metrics. At end of the first quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, measured based on our bank covenants, was 2.77, and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.26%. Floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 15% at the end of the quarter. The effective tax rate was approximately 35.4% in the first quarter. It was a bit higher-than-expected due to the timing of certain items, but we still believe that our full year tax rate will be 35%. 
In summary, the first quarter trends continue the momentum that built throughout 2015. We're well-positioned to achieve or exceed our full year goals as our employees performed well to start the year. In the coming quarters, the year-over-year comparisons become tougher, but we have confidence that our employees can continue to be meet or exceed our targets.
And with that, Rebecca, let's open the line up for questions."

It's always a question when you have whether it's good weather or bad weather in the first quarter due to volumes disappear. And when you have bad whether or do they get pushed into the second quarter. And the same is true with good weather, did volumes get pulled in from the second quarter to the first quarter, or is there just more economic activity so there's going to be more volumes. So before we adjust our full year guidance, we wanted to be a little bit more precise on what -- we want to give a fairly tight range.

But as David said, it's hard to tell how much just move from quarter-to-quarter, how much good weather actually expands volume or on the other hand, bad weather contracts volume."

The landfill volumes come down a little bit. We had some one time, as the MSW items come down. The MSW volumes were really strong in the first quarter. But we had a couple of onetime type items. So, for example, some of the waste to energy plants along the East Coast were down from maintenance. And so some of those ones came over to us into our landfills. And so we'd expect the landfill volumes to moderate a little bit, but they'll continue to be strong. So I would say so far additions are pretty much what we expect in the second quarter. We continue to see positive volumes and we'd expect that to continue throughout May and June."

Look, our core prices are pretty much locked and loaded for the year. I mean, that is going to happen. Once we saw -- when you see this volumes turn positive and you see that our addition rates exceeding our deflection rate, it's hard to see volumes turning backwards. And so the things that are under our control, I think there's only upside, no down side. I guess, really the only potential downside would be in a general economic downturn what would happen to volumes. But I think if there is a general economic downturn, it's not going to be led by housing like the last one was. And so we should see at least a 6- to 9-month lag and a reduction in volumes. So it's hard to see how 2016 can do anything other than meet or exceed our guidance."

And what I would say is that the trend line on the profitable volumes that we're going to add is going to be very positive throughout the rest of the year. Some of those negative volumes like landfills, maybe some residential contracts, some of those things, might moderate the volume growth a little bit. But I expect that we'll continue to see good, strong growth in the landfill line and the industrial line and the commercial line."

So in most cases, if 1 POTW shuts you down, doesn't take leachate anymore, you can find another POTW. This happens to be in a more remote areas, so you have to build your own treatment facility. But that's pretty unique to this geography."

We also saw the continued strength in our pricing",1308,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston.
Our first quarter results continued the positive trends that we saw throughout 2015, and our volumes turned positive more quickly than we had originally planned. We also saw the continued strength in our pricing programs and our cost programs continue to gain traction. This focus on disciplined growth, pricing and continuous cost improvement delivered $0.58 per share in the quarter, an increase of more than 18% from our 2015 first quarter results.
Our revenue increased for the first time since 2014, and we achieved positive volumes for the first time since 2012. Our employees are doing a great job of managing cost increase to drive earnings growth and margin expansion.
In the first quarter, we saw improvement in virtually every financial metric that we track. Our traditional solid waste business income from operations increased $60 million and margin increased 30 basis points. And our operating EBITDA improved $90 million and margin increased 50 basis points. We're very pleased with our first quarter results as they provide a strong start to 2016.
Turning to our operations. Our pricing programs continued to drive earnings growth and margin expansion. For the first quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 5.3% and yield was 2.6%. Core price improved to 90 basis points from the first quarter of 2015 to the highest level that we've achieved, and we also saw the highest core price ever in each of the commercial, industrial and landfill lines of business. Core price in the industrial line was 10.7%. In the commercial line, it was 7.5%. In our landfill line, it was 3.3% and in our residential line, it was 2.6%. As volumes have turned positive, we expect core price to remain strong.
With respect to volumes, we saw a positive volume growth in the first quarter, but we did not chase low margin volumes by lowering price. We continue to drive disciplined growth by adding volumes in geographic areas and lines of business where growth is strongest. Our volumes reflect both a strong solid waste economic backdrop and the great work by our sales and operating teams. Our traditional solid waste volumes were positive 2.4% in the first quarter of 2016, a 360 basis point improvement compared to 2015. We had 1 additional work day in 2016 and after adjusting for this, our traditional solid waste volumes improved 1.8%. 
We some very positive trends in our commercial and industrial lines of business. Our commercial volumes declined only 0.2% in the first quarter, an improvement of 50 basis points from the fourth quarter and a 260 basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2015.
In the industrial line of business, volumes were more than doubled to 2.7% on a workday adjusted basis when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. We're very pleased with our traditional solid waste volume results in the first quarter, although we likely did see some benefit from the milder winter weather that may have led to some second quarter construction and landfill volumes being pulled into the first quarter. We certainly expect volumes to remain positive throughout 2016, but we would like to see the extent of the seasonal uptick before we revisit our full year expectations for volumes.
Our landfill line of business continues to show strong operational results as we saw the benefit of increased core price and strong volumes, as Jim will discuss in more detail. However, we see a significant increase in the cost of managing the liquids that naturally occur in our landfills. Over the last 3 years, leachate cost have increased between 11% and 22%, and in the first quarter of 2016, the increase was greater than that with cost up about $14 million. This trend of increasing leachate cost has been ongoing for a number of years and we believe it's a common issue throughout our industry. With the increase in volumes, we've seen more liquids and the cost to transport and treat those liquids has increased substantially. Of course, the added cost at our landfills effects our profitability and return on capital, so we need to do something to offset those increasing costs.
Consequently, this quarter we'll begin to implement a liquids management charge at our landfill. This charge will be between 4% and 7% of the cost of disposal and it will be applied only to our landfill customers and not to our collection customers. Of course, many of our disposal contracts are long-term, but just as we did with our fuel recovery and recycling charges, we'll implement the liquids management charge on contracts as they renew. Only by doing this can we maintain an adequate return on the huge capital investments that we make in our landfills.
Turning to recycling. We saw a drop of 12% in average commodity prices for the quarter and a 3.1% increase in volumes. The positive volumes are predominantly due to the unusually low broker volumes that we saw in the first quarter of 2015, associated with the slowdown in western U.S. ports. This should normalize and will likely be negative in the second quarter so we don't expect to see recycling volumes contributing to our overall volume growth. But the volumes that we're losing are generally not profitable volume, so the negative volumes won't negatively affect profitability.
Our employees have done a good job in managing operating cost and we've seen our recycling operating cost improved 12% when compared to the first quarter of 2015. However, the operational improvements have not been enough to offset the declining commodity prices. So our recycling income from operations was slightly negative in the first quarter, but we saw a year-over-year improvement of almost $0.02 per share.
Commodity prices have come off the load that we saw in January, but they're still below 2015 levels and we do not expect any significant rebound in 2016. So we continue to work with our customers to develop a mutually beneficial solution that allows for a sustainable recycling program in their community. We're committed to recycling and we'll continue to work to change the business model and drive out operating expenses.
Finally, in the first quarter, our business generated strong growth in operating EBITDA, which in turn translated into significant cash generation. Cash flow from operating activities exceeded $700 million, an increase of more than $200 million when compared the first quarter of 2015. We did have about $156 million and cash flow benefits in the quarter, which Jim will discuss, but even if you adjust for those, cash from operating activities grew by 10.2%. So 2016 is off to a strong start, and our results put us firmly on track to meet or exceed our full year guidance of adjusted earnings per diluted share between $2.74 and $2.79. We also expect to achieve or beat our full year free cash flow guidance of between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion.
Based on first quarter volume results, we'd also expect to beat our volume goal for the year. I certainly believe that this will be the case, but we had favorable weather in the first quarter and we'd expect that volumes will be pull -- will pull forward into the first quarter. As noted previously, we also had higher recycling volumes, which will not continue through the year. We'll get a better feel for the effects of these factors when we see our second quarter seasonal uptick. After we see volumes normalize, we expect to give more precise volume and financial guidance for the year. But we certainly expect to see continued year-over-year improvement across all of our operating metrics. It's a reflection of a strength of our corporate and field games to see our strategy so well executed.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our first quarter results in more detail."

In the first quarter, revenues were $3.2 billion, an increase of $136 million or 4.5% when compared to the first quarter of 2015. We saw $126 million increase in our traditional solid waste business due to the combined impacts of price and volume, and an $81 million increase in revenues from acquisitions net of divestitures. These increases were partially offset by declines of $32 million in lower fuel surcharge revenues, $18 million in foreign currency fluctuations and a $13 million decline from lower recycling revenues.
Looking at internal revenue growth for the total company. In the first quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 5.3% and yield was 2.6%, with total volumes improving 1.9%. We had 1 additional workday in the first quarter. Adjusting for the additional workday, volumes improved 1.3%. Volumes turned positive in the quarter for the first time since 2012. The combined positive price and positive volume led to total company income from operations growing $54 million, operating income margin expanding 110 basis points to 16%, operating EBITDA growing $74 million and operating EBITDA margin growing 130 basis points to 25.8%. 
Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefits of our disciplined pricing programs. Overall, collection core price was 6.5% and yield was 3.4%. Our strong core price reflects a disciplined approach to pricing and a strong demand for our services.
In the first quarter, we continue to make progress on reducing the churn through our improved customer service. Our churn in the quarter was 9.2%, 170 basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2015. The improvement in our churn, strong roll off demands and our focus on disciplined growth, benefited our volume trends in the first quarter as total collection volumes turned positive, improving 70 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter and 240 basis points from the first quarter of 2015.
Industrial demand was strong in the quarter with volumes up 4.2% or 2.7% on a workday adjusted basis.
Our residential business continues to be a drag on volumes, while commercial volumes are moving towards positive. For the quarter, residential volumes declined 3.4% and commercial volumes declined 0.2%, a year-over-year improvement of 260 basis points. Strong core price and positive volume in the collection line of business led to income from operations growing $21 million and operating EBITDA growing $36 million.
In the landfill line of business, we also saw the benefits of positive volume and positive yield in the first quarter just as we did last year. Total landfill volumes increased 11.6% and 10.3% on a workday adjusted basis. On a workday adjusted basis, MSW volumes grew by 13.4%, C&D volume grew by 22.6% and combined special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes grew 2.9%. Our landfill volumes were stronger than we expected in part due to milder weather and a couple of onetime events. We do not expect that the onetime events will repeat, so as we continue throughout the year landfill volumes may moderate which should remain solidly positive as we face increasingly tougher comparisons.
We achieved core price of 3.3% and saw a same-store average MSW rates increase year-over-year by 2.1% from Q1 of 2015. The positive volume and yield led to income from operations growing $29 million, margins growing 60 basis points, operating EBITDA increasing $40 million and operating EBITDA margins increasing 40 basis points.
Moving now to operating expenses. As a percent of revenue, these expenses improved 120 basis points to 62.8%. For the first quarter, operating expenses increased $47 million when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Landfill operating cost increased the most at $17 million, an increase of more than 27% year-over-year. $14 million of the $17 million increase was leachate costs, which is one of the reasons that David mentioned the importance of imposing a charge to recover our increasing costs. The remainder of the operating cost increases primarily relate to our increased volumes and cost related to acquired operations.
For the first quarter, as a percent of revenue SG&A cost were 11.4%, flat when compared to the first quarter 2015. On a dollar basis, SG&A costs were $362 million, an increase of $14 million compared to 2015. Labor cost drove the majority of the increase primarily related to acquisitions. We also had higher accruals for incentive compensation costs related to our strong performance. We still expect to improve SG&A cost as a percent of revenue for the full year when compared to 2015.
Turning to cash flow for the first quarter, our operating EBITDA growth of almost 10%, translated into strong cash flow growth. Cash provided by operating activities was $706 million, a $207 million increase compared to the first quarter of 2015. Included in the 2016 results was a $67 million benefit from the termination of a cross currency hedge. We terminated the financial hedge because we borrowed money in Canadian dollars, thus providing a natural hedge against fluctuations in the Canadian dollar. The termination of the hedge had a negative $0.01 impact to EPS.
In addition, favorably affecting our year-over-year comparisons were nearly $90 million from the timing and size of compensation payments. Excluding those benefits, we had strong growth as cash provided by operating activities grew 10.2%. 
During the first quarter, we spent $317 million in capital expenditures, an increase of $87 -- $84 million when compared to the first quarter of 2015. The increase was related to an intentional change in the timing of our truck purchases. However, as David mentioned, the cost of transporting our leachate has increased substantially, so we are building some additional leachate treatment facilities. This will help put cost over the long run, but will increase capital expenditures in 2016 and 2017. This makes its very important to implement our liquids recovery charge so we can offset some of these capital costs and generate acceptable returns. Nevertheless, we still believe that we will be within our guidance range of between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion.
In the first quarter, we also had $13 million in proceeds from the divested assets. Combined, we generated $402 million of free cash flow, an increase of $117 million when compared to the first quarter of 2015. This puts us well on our way to achieving or exceeding our free cash flow guidance of between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. In the first quarter, we returned $433 million to shareholders, we paid $183 million in dividends and we repurchased $250 million of shares.
Finally, looking at our other financial metrics. At the end of the first quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, measured based on our bank covenants, was 2.77, and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.26%. Floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 15% at the end of the quarter. The effective tax rate was approximately 35.4% in the first quarter. It was a bit higher than expected due to the timing of certain items, but we still believe that our full year tax rate will be 35%. 
In summary, the first quarter trends continue the momentum that built throughout 2015. We're well positioned to achieve or exceed our full year goals as our employees performed well to start the year. In the coming quarters, the year-over-year comparisons become tougher, but we have confidence that our employees can continue to be meet or exceed our targets.
And with that, Rebecca, let's open the line up for questions."

But that's okay, because they're not profitable volumes. And then about 20 to 30 basis points we estimate would be the amount that was pulled forward sort of from the second quarter. It's always a question when you have whether it's good weather or bad weather in the first quarter, do volumes disappear when you have bad whether or do they get pushed into the second quarter? And the same is true with good weather, did volumes get pulled in from the second quarter to the first quarter, or is there just more economic activity so that there's going to be more volumes? So before we adjust our full year guidance, we wanted to be a little bit more precise on what -- we want to give a fairly tight range. And so waiting till the second quarter seasonal uptick, I think will allow us to sort of say, okay here's a more normalized look at what the volumes are going to be.

But if there was going to be a threat, clearly recycling is still a little bit volatile. We haven't seen the rebound in commodity prices that you'd expect to see. Look, our core price is pretty much locked and loaded for the year. I mean, that is going to happen. Once we saw the -- when you see these volumes turn positive and you see that our addition rates exceeding our defection rate, it's hard to see volumes turning backwards. And so the things that are under our control, I think there's only upside, no down side. I guess, really the only potential downside would be in a general economic downturn what would happen to volumes. But I think with -- if there is a general economic downturn, it's not going to be led by housing like the last one was. And so we should see at least a 6- to 9-month lag in any reduction in volumes. And so it's hard to see how 2016 can do anything other than meet or exceed our guidance."

And you've seen the Sunbelt actually performing better than the Rust Belts. It's why we like having a diversified business. It works in any kind of economy. Obviously, right now you're seeing the south do better than the north. But the north continues to drive improved profitability, it just happens to be a little bit stronger in the south.

One thing I would say is, in addition to saying that we will try to get as close to flat as we can, is that on a percent of revenue basis, one kind of aspirational number we've had out there for probably a decade has been 10% on an annual basis, we were at 10.4% last year.

And so in most cases, if 1 POTW shuts you down, doesn't take leachate anymore, you can find another POTW. This happens to be in a more remote type areas, so you have to build your own treatment facility. But that's pretty unique to this geography."

Before we get started, please note that we have filed a Form 8-K this morning that includes the earnings press release and is available on our website at www.wm.com. The Form 8-K, the press release and the schedules in the press release include important information.
During the call, you will hear forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations, projections or opinions about future periods. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in today's press release and in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K.
David and Jim will discuss our results in the areas of yield and volume, which unless otherwise stated, are more specifically references to internal revenue growth, or IRG, from yield or volume. During the call, David and Jim will also discuss our earnings per diluted share, which they may refer to as EPS or earnings per share. And David and Jim will address operating EBITDA and operating EBITDA margin as defined in the footnotes to the earnings press release.
Any comparisons, unless otherwise stated, will be with the first quarter of 2015. The first quarter 2015 net income, EPS, income from operations and operating EBITDA have been adjusted to enhance comparability by excluding certain items that management believes do not reflect our fundamental business performance or results of operations. These adjusted measures, the addition to free cash flow, are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the earnings press release footnote and schedules, which can be found on the company's website at www.wm.com, for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures.

190694,329715514,966555,"Waste Management, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston.Our first quarter results continued the positive trends that we saw throughout 2015, and our volumes turned positive more quickly than we had originally planned. We also saw the continued strength in our pricing",1304,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston.
Our first quarter results continued the positive trends that we saw throughout 2015, and our volumes turned positive more quickly than we had originally planned. We also saw the continued strength in our pricing programs, and our cost programs continue to gain traction. This focus on disciplined growth, pricing and continuous cost improvement delivered $0.58 per share in the quarter, an increase of more than 18% from our 2015 first quarter results.
Our revenue increased for the first time since 2014, and we achieved positive volumes for the first time since 2012. Our employees are doing a great job of managing cost increases to drive earnings growth and margin expansion.
In the first quarter, we saw improvement in virtually every financial metric that we track. Our traditional solid waste business income from operations increased $60 million and margin increased 30 basis points. And our operating EBITDA improved $90 million and margin increased 50 basis points. We're very pleased with our first quarter results as they provide a strong start to 2016.
Turning to our operations. Our pricing programs continued to drive earnings growth and margin expansion. For the first quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 5.3% and yield was 2.6%. Core price improved 90 basis points from the first quarter of 2015 to the highest level that we've achieved, and we also saw the highest core price ever in each of the commercial, industrial and landfill lines of business. Core price in the industrial line was 10.7%. In the commercial line, it was 7.5%. In our landfill line, it was 3.3%, and in our residential line, it was 2.6%. As volumes have turned positive, we expect core price to remain strong.
With respect to volumes, we saw positive volume growth in the first quarter, but we did not chase low-margin volumes by lowering price. We continue to drive disciplined growth by adding volumes in geographic areas and lines of business where growth is strongest. Our volumes reflect both a strong solid waste economic backdrop and the great work by our sales and operating teams. Our traditional solid waste volumes were positive 2.4% in the first quarter of 2016, a 360 basis point improvement compared to 2015. We had 1 additional workday in 2016, and after adjusting for this, our traditional solid waste volumes improved 1.8%. 
We some very positive trends in our commercial and industrial lines of business. Our commercial volumes declined only 0.2% in the first quarter, an improvement of 50 basis points from the fourth quarter and a 260 basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2015.
In the industrial line of business, volumes were more than doubled to 2.7% on a workday-adjusted basis when compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. We're very pleased with our traditional solid waste volume results in the first quarter, although we likely did see some benefit from the milder winter weather that may have led to some second quarter construction and landfill volumes being pulled into the first quarter. We certainly expect volumes to remain positive throughout 2016, but we would like to see the extent of the seasonal uptick before we revisit our full year expectations for volumes.
Our landfill line of business continues to show strong operational results as we saw the benefit of increased core price and strong volumes, as Jim will discuss in more detail. However, we see a significant increase in the cost of managing the liquids that naturally occur in our landfills. Over the last 3 years, leachate costs have increased between 11% and 22%, and in the first quarter of 2016, the increase was greater than that with cost up about $14 million. This trend of increasing leachate costs has been ongoing for a number of years and we believe it's a common issue throughout our industry. With the increase in volumes, we've seen more liquids, and the cost to transport and treat those liquids has increased substantially. Of course, the added cost at our landfills affects our profitability and return on capital, so we need to do something to offset those increasing costs.
Consequently, this quarter we'll begin to implement a liquids management charge at our landfills. This charge will be between 4% and 7% of the cost of disposal, and it will be applied only to our landfill customers and not to our collection customers. Of course, many of our disposal contracts are long term, but just as we did with our fuel recovery and recycling charges, we'll implement the liquids management charge on contracts as they renew. Only by doing this can we maintain an adequate return on the huge capital investments that we make in our landfills.
Turning to recycling. We saw a drop of 12% in average commodity prices for the quarter and a 3.1% increase in volumes. The positive volumes are predominantly due to the unusually low broker volumes that we saw in the first quarter of 2015 associated with the slowdown in western U.S. ports. This should normalize and will likely be negative in the second quarter, so we don't expect to see recycling volumes contributing to our overall volume growth. But the volumes that we're losing are generally not profitable volumes, so the negative volumes won't negatively affect profitability.
Our employees have done a good job in managing operating cost, and we've seen our recycling operating cost improve 12% when compared to the first quarter of 2015. However, the operational improvements have not been enough to offset the declining commodity prices. So our recycling income from operations was slightly negative in the first quarter, but we saw a year-over-year improvement of almost $0.02 per share.
Commodity prices have come off the lows that we saw in January, but they're still below 2015 levels and we do not expect any significant rebound in 2016. So we continue to work with our customers to develop a mutually beneficial solution that allows for a sustainable recycling program in their community. We're committed to recycling and we'll continue to work to change the business model and drive out operating expenses.
Finally, in the first quarter, our business generated strong growth in operating EBITDA, which in turn translated into significant cash generation. Cash flow from operating activities exceeded $700 million, an increase of more than $200 million when compared the first quarter of 2015. We did have about $156 million in cash flow benefits in the quarter, which Jim will discuss, but even if you adjust for those, cash from operating activities grew by 10.2%. So 2016 is off to a strong start, and our results put us firmly on track to meet or exceed our full year guidance of adjusted earnings per diluted share between $2.74 and $2.79. We also expect to achieve or beat our full year free cash flow guidance of between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion.
Based on first quarter volume results, we'd also expect to beat our volume goal for the year. I certainly believe that this will be the case, but we had favorable weather in the first quarter and we'd expect that volumes will be pull -- were pulled forward into the first quarter. As noted previously, we also had higher recycling volumes, which will not continue through the year. We'll get a better feel for the effects of these factors when we see our second quarter seasonal uptick. After we see volumes normalize, we expect to give more precise volume and financial guidance for the year. But we certainly expect to see continued year-over-year improvement across all of our operating metrics. It's a reflection of the strength of our corporate and field teams to see our strategy so well executed.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our first quarter results in more detail."

In the first quarter, revenues were $3.2 billion, an increase of $136 million or 4.5% when compared to the first quarter of 2015. We saw a $126 million increase in our traditional solid waste business due to the combined impacts of price and volume, and an $81 million increase in revenues from acquisitions net of divestitures. These increases were partially offset by declines of $32 million in lower fuel surcharge revenues, $18 million in foreign currency fluctuations and a $13 million decline from lower recycling revenues.
Looking at internal revenue growth for the total company. In the first quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 5.3% and yield was 2.6%, with total volumes improving 1.9%. We had 1 additional workday in the first quarter. Adjusting for the additional workday, volumes improved 1.3%. Volumes turned positive in the quarter for the first time since 2012. The combined positive price and positive volume led to total company income from operations growing $54 million, operating income margin expanding 110 basis points to 16%, operating EBITDA growing $74 million and operating EBITDA margin growing 130 basis points to 25.8%. 
Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefits of our disciplined pricing programs. Overall, collection core price was 6.5% and yield was 3.4%. Our strong core price reflects a disciplined approach to pricing and a strong demand for our services.
In the first quarter, we continued to make progress on reducing the churn through our improved customer service. Our churn in the quarter was 9.2%, a 170 basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2015. The improvement in our churn, strong roll-off demand and our focus on disciplined growth benefited our volume trends in the first quarter as total collection volumes turned positive, improving 70 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter and 240 basis points from the first quarter of 2015.
Industrial demand was strong in the quarter with volumes up 4.2% or 2.7% on a workday-adjusted basis.
Our residential business continues to be a drag on volumes, while commercial volumes are moving towards positive. For the quarter, residential volumes declined 3.4% and commercial volumes declined 0.2%, a year-over-year improvement of 260 basis points. Strong core price and positive volume in the collection line of business led to income from operations growing $21 million and operating EBITDA growing $36 million.
In the landfill line of business, we also saw the benefits of positive volume and positive yield in the first quarter, just as we did last year. Total landfill volumes increased 11.6% and 10.3% on a workday-adjusted basis. On a workday-adjusted basis, MSW volumes grew by 13.4%, C&D volume grew by 22.6% and combined special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes grew 2.9%. Our landfill volumes were stronger than we expected, in part due to milder weather and a couple of onetime events. We do not expect that the onetime events will repeat, so as we continue throughout the year landfill volumes may moderate, which should remain solidly positive as we face increasingly tougher comparisons.
We achieved core price of 3.3% and saw same-store average MSW rates increase year-over-year by 2.1% from Q1 of 2015. The positive volume and yield led to income from operations growing $29 million, margins growing 60 basis points, operating EBITDA increasing $40 million and operating EBITDA margins increasing 40 basis points.
Moving now to operating expenses. As a percent of revenue, these expenses improved 120 basis points to 62.8%. For the first quarter, operating expenses increased $47 million when compared to the first quarter of 2015. Landfill operating cost increased the most at $17 million, an increase of more than 27% year-over-year. $14 million of the $17 million increase was leachate costs, which is one of the reasons that David mentioned the importance of imposing a charge to recover our increasing costs. The remainder of the operating cost increases primarily relate to our increased volumes and costs related to acquired operations.
For the first quarter, as a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 11.4%, flat when compared to the first quarter 2015. On a dollar basis, SG&A costs were $362 million, an increase of $14 million compared to 2015. Labor cost drove the majority of the increase, primarily related to acquisitions. We also had higher accruals for incentive compensation costs related to our strong performance. We still expect to improve SG&A cost as a percent of revenue for the full year when compared to 2015.
Turning to cash flow for the first quarter. Our operating EBITDA growth of almost 10% translated into strong cash flow growth. Cash provided by operating activities was $706 million, a $207 million increase compared to the first quarter of 2015. Included in the 2016 results was a $67 million benefit from the termination of a cross-currency hedge. We terminated the financial hedge because we borrowed money in Canadian dollars, thus providing a natural hedge against fluctuations in the Canadian dollar. The termination of the hedge had a negative $0.01 impact to EPS.
In addition, favorably affecting our year-over-year comparisons were nearly $90 million from the timing and size of compensation payments. Excluding those benefits, we had strong growth as cash provided by operating activities grew 10.2%. 
During the first quarter, we spent $317 million in capital expenditures, an increase of $87 -- $84 million when compared to the first quarter of 2015. The increase was related to an intentional change in the timing of our truck purchases. However, as David mentioned, the cost of transporting our leachate has increased substantially, so we are building some additional leachate treatment facilities. This will help with cost over the long run, but will increase capital expenditures in 2016 and 2017. This makes it very important to implement our liquids recovery charge so we can offset some of these capital costs and generate acceptable returns. Nevertheless, we still believe that we will be within our guidance range of between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion.
In the first quarter, we also had $13 million in proceeds from the divested assets. Combined, we generated $402 million of free cash flow, an increase of $117 million when compared to the first quarter of 2015. This puts us well on our way to achieving or exceeding our free cash flow guidance of between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion. In the first quarter, we returned $433 million to shareholders, we paid $183 million in dividends and we repurchased $250 million of shares.
Finally, looking at our other financial metrics. At the end of the first quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, measured based on our bank covenants, was 2.77, and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.26%. The floating-rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 15% at the end of the quarter. The effective tax rate was approximately 35.4% in the first quarter. It was a bit higher than expected due to the timing of certain items, but we still believe that our full year tax rate will be 35%. 
In summary, the first quarter trends continue the momentum that built throughout 2015. We're well positioned to achieve or exceed our full year goals, as our employees performed well to start the year. In the coming quarters, the year-over-year comparisons become tougher, but we have confidence that our employees can continue to be meet or exceed our targets.
And with that, Rebecca, let's open the line up for questions."

But that's okay, because they're not profitable volumes. And then about 20 to 30 basis points we estimate would be the amount that was pulled forward sort of from the second quarter. It's always a question when you have -- whether it's good weather or bad weather in the first quarter, do volumes disappear when you have bad weather or do they get pushed into the second quarter? And the same is true with good weather: Did volumes get pulled in from the second quarter to the first quarter, or is there just more economic activity so that there's going to be more volumes? So before we adjust our full year guidance, we wanted to be a little bit more precise on what -- we want to give a fairly tight range. And so waiting till the second quarter seasonal uptick, I think, will allow us to sort of say, okay, here's a more normalized look at what the volumes are going to be.

But if there was going to be a threat, clearly recycling is still a little bit volatile. We haven't seen the rebound in commodity prices that you'd expect to see. Look, our core price is pretty much locked and loaded for the year. I mean, that is going to happen. Once we saw the -- when you see these volumes turn positive and you see that our addition rate's exceeding our defection rate, it's hard to see volumes turning backwards. And so the things that are under our control, I think there's only upside, no down side. I guess, really the only potential downside would be in a general economic downturn, what would happen to volumes. But I think with -- if there is a general economic downturn, it's not going to be led by housing like the last one was. And so we should see at least a 6- to 9-month lag in any reduction in volumes. And so it's hard to see how 2016 can do anything other than meet or exceed our guidance."

It is interesting to see that after the last economic downturn, you saw the trends completely switch from being Sunbelt-driven to being more Rust Belt-driven.

And you've seen the Sunbelt actually performing better than the Rust Belt. It's why we like having a diversified business. It works in any kind of economy. Obviously, right now you're seeing the south do better than the north. But the north continues to drive improved profitability, it just happens to be a little bit stronger in the south.

So I look at that as being a good thing as well. One thing I would say is, in addition to saying that we will try to get as close to flat as we can, is that on a percent of revenue basis, one kind of aspirational number we've had out there for probably a decade has been 10% on an annual basis. We were at 10.4% last year. I think we have a decent chance of getting to or below 10% for the year.

But really, the big drivers of SG&A dollar increase is, as I said to Michael, were acquisition related, which we think is a good thing. We will make sure that we try and take as much of the kind of duplicate SG&A out of these acquisitions, as we always do. But the sales component is very important. I mean, if you think about Deffenbaugh, it was an area that we had no operations. If you think about EnviroServe, it was -- it's an area where we had operations, but they had a niche business.

But if those volumes go negative like we expect them to go in the back half of the year, it's probably a little bit more of an effect because it will go from positive 3.1% to negative couple of percent in the back half of the year. So it could be a little bit more than 30 to 40 basis points. But the underlying macroeconomic trends that we see in the industrial and commercial line are strong. And so I would expect -- look, we've always said, we don't look at volumes for volume's sake. We look at volumes to try to add profitable volumes. And what I would say is that the trend line on the profitable volumes that we're going to add is going to be very positive throughout the rest of the year. Some of those negative volumes like landfills, maybe some residential contracts, some of those things, might moderate the volume growth a little bit. But I expect that we'll continue to see good, strong growth in the landfill line, in the industrial line and the commercial line."

And so that's when -- when Jim talks about cost going up by 500%, that's basically what happened in this geography is our outlet for disposal basically disappeared. So now we have to find another outlet and it happens to be a lot further away. So in that type of case -- and this is a fairly rural area in the southeast. And so in most cases, if 1 POTW shuts you down, doesn't take leachate anymore, you can find another POTW. This happens to be in a more remote-type area, so you have to build your own treatment facility. But that's pretty unique to this geography."

190694,372218982,1013406,"Waste Management, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. Our quarter results again exceeded our internal expectations and mirror the trends we've seen for a number of quarters improving volumes, strong execution of our pricing programs and greater traction in our cost",1042,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. Our quarter results again exceeded our internal expectations and mirror the trends we've seen for a number of quarters improving volumes, strong execution of our pricing programs and greater traction in our cost programs. In the second quarter, we earned $0.74 per share, an increase of more than 10% from our second quarter 2015 results. The combined revenue growth and cost improvement led to strong growth in operating EBITDA to $955 million, an increase of almost 9% and an improvement in our operating EBITDA margin of 140 basis points to 27.9%. This is the highest operating EBITDA margin that we've achieved in 7 years. 
Our pricing programs continued to drive earnings growth in margin expansion. For the second quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.9% and yield was 2.6%. Core price improved 80 basis points in the second quarter of 2015 and yield was up 90 basis points. Core price in the industrial line was 9.5% and the commercial line, it was 7.6%. And our landfill line it was 2.7% and in our residential line, it was 2.5%.  Importantly, in the second quarter, our churn was 9.1%, 120 basis points better than last year and 10 basis points better than the first quarter of 2016, which demonstrates our ability to retain pricing and retain customers through improvements in our service efforts. 
At this point, we would certainly expect to exceed our full year core price target of 4% and our 2% yield target, although both metrics could moderate somewhat in the back half of the year due to year-over-year comparisons. With respect to volumes. We saw positive volume growth in the second quarter just as we did in the first quarter. But most encouraging is that we saw volume growth in the right volumes, our high-margin, commercial, industrial and landfill lines. In fact, our commercial volumes turned positive for the first time in over a decade. 
We shed volumes in the lower margin residential and recycling lines of business as we continued to eliminate low or negative margin contracts. Our traditional solid waste volumes were positive 0.8% in the second quarter 2016, 140-basis-point improvement from the second quarter of 2015. Our commercial volumes were 0.3% in the second quarter, an improvement of 50 basis points from the first quarter and a 250-basis-point improvement from Q2 of 2015. As this is our highest margin collection segment, this is a significant accomplishment and is reflected in the income from operations of the commercial line of business where we achieved the highest results ever.
We expect to see continued growth in our commercial line as the year progresses, which is a tribute to the efforts of our sales and marketing teams. So our strategy of maintaining price discipline while adding the right volumes continue to bear fruit. We did see slightly stronger volume growth in the first quarter with weather in the first quarter of 2016 much milder than in the first quarter of 2015, so we weren't surprised to see a little less volume growth in the second quarter versus the first. But we expect total company volumes to continue to improve throughout the remainder of the year. And we now expect our traditional solid waste volumes to exceed 1% positive by year-end. 
Residential and recycling volumes were down in the quarter, and we expect them to be down for the remainder of the year. But the loss of those volumes is mostly intentional given that they're low margin or often times even negative margin volumes. Our landfill line of business continues to show strong results, which Jim will discuss in more detail. However, as we mentioned on the first quarter conference call, we've seen a significant increase in the cost of managing the liquids that naturally occur in our landfills. In the second quarter of 2016, the increase in leachate costs was about $22 million or $0.03 per share. 
As of July 1, we've implemented a wastewater management charge at all of our landfills for customers that are not under contract. We're still in the early stages. But so far, there has not been significant pushback. The next step will be to apply the charge to our disposal contracts as they renew. By passing these cost increases on to our customers, we'll ensure that we maintain an adequate return on the huge capital investments that we make in our landfill. 
Turning to recycling. We saw a 2.3% increase in average commodity prices for the quarter and a 2.9% decrease in volumes. We continue to focus on managing operating costs as we've seen our recycling operating cost improved more than 9% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. These operational improvements and the increase in commodity prices drove the recycling line of business to its highest income from operations since 2012 when the blended commodity prices were $109 per ton versus $85 in the second quarter of 2016. Year-over-year, the recycling line of business contributed $0.01 per share to earning. We continue to work with our customers to develop a mutually beneficial solution that allows for a sustainable recycling business model.
To summarize. The positive momentum that we saw in the first quarter continued throughout the second quarter. All of our employees worked hard to deliver strong first half results by focusing on improving price, driving disciplined volume growth and managing costs. In light of a strong first half performance, we're increasing our adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to between $2.83 and $2.86 for the full year, a $0.09 to $0.12 increase from the low end from our previous guidance. 
More importantly, we're also raising our free cash flow guidance for 2016 to between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, a $100 million to $200 million increase from the low end of our previous guidance despite our expected capital expenditures being slightly higher than our previous guidance. So the momentum in our business continues and our focus has never been sharper. We look forward to our corporate and field teams building upon this strong performance to drive even better results for the remainder of 2016 and beyond. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our second quarter results in more detail."

In second quarter, revenues were $3.43 billion, an increase of $110 million or 3.3% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. We saw $150 million increase in our traditional solid waste business due to a $98 million increase from the com",1108,"Thanks, David. In second quarter, revenues were $3.43 billion, an increase of $110 million or 3.3% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. We saw $150 million increase in our traditional solid waste business due to a $98 million increase from the combined impacts of price and volume, and a $52 million increase in revenues from acquisitions net of divestitures. The increases were partially offset by declines of $24 million in lower fuel surcharge revenues, $10 million in foreign currency fluctuations and a $5 million decline from lower recycling revenues. 
Looking at internal revenue growth for the company in the second quarter. Our collection and disposal core price was 4.9% and yield was 2.6% with total volumes improving 0.4%. Volumes were positive for the second consecutive quarter. The combined positive price and positive volume led to total company income from operations growing $58 million, operating income margin expanding 120 basis points to 18%. Operating EBITDA growing $76 million and operating EBITDA margin growing 140 basis points to 27.9%. 
Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefits to our disciplined pricing programs and improved volumes. Overall, collection core price was 6.3% and yield was 3.3%. Industrial demand continue its strong performance that we saw in the first quarter. Volume was up 1.5% the second quarter, 150-basis-point improvement from the second quarter of 2015. And as David mentioned, commercial volumes were positive for the first time since 2005 at 0.3% for the second quarter, a 250-basis-point improvement from the second quarter of 2015. Our residential business continues to be a drag on our overall collection volumes, down 3.5% in the second quarter similar to the declines that we've experienced throughout 2014 and 2015. 
However, strong core price and positive volume in the high-margin commercial and industrial lines of business led to our collection, income from operations growing $44 million and the operating margin growing 120 basis points. EBITDA grew $54 million and EBITDA margin increased 150 basis points. In the landfill line of business. We again saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive yield in the second quarter just as we did last year. Total landfill volumes increased 6.5%. The landfill volume growth is very consistent with the volume growth in over the past 2 years. MSW volumes grew by 5.2%, C&D volume grew 12.5% and combined special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes grew 4.4%. We achieved core price of 2.7%, an increase of 40 basis points from the second quarter of 2015 and saw same-store average MSW rates increase year-over-year by 1.9% from Q2 of 2015. 
Moving now to operating expenses. As a percent of revenue, those expenses improved 140 basis points, to 62.2%. For the second quarter, operating expenses increased $22 million when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Landfill operating cost represented the largest increase, up $28 million. $22 million of the $28 million increase was the increased retake cost with the remaining $6 million increase related to the decline in the U.S. Treasury rate used to discounting our long-term care obligations. The remainder of the operating cost dollar increase primarily relates to our increased volumes and costs related to acquired operations, which were partially offset by savings from lower fuel and risk management costs. 
For the second quarter as a percent of revenue SG&A costs were 9.9%, up 20 basis points when compared to the second quarter of 2015. On a dollar basis, SG&A costs were $340 million, an increase of $18 million compared to 2015. Labor costs drove the majority of the increase, primarily related to acquisitions and higher accruals for stock-based incentive compensation. As you may recall, our stock-based incentive compensation is based upon performance in the areas of free cash flow and total shareholder return and we achieved strong performance in both metrics in the last 2 years. 
In the second quarter, those costs increased $11 million when compared to the second quarter of 2015. We expect that these costs will exceed last year by about the same amount in the back half of the year. We still expect to improve SG&A costs as a percent of revenue for the full year when compared to 2015. Turning to cash flow in the second quarter. Cash provided by operating activities were $748 million compared to $816 million in the second quarter of 2015. Our operations continued to perform very well as we achieved operating EBITDA increase of $76 million. However, this increase was more than offset by the impact of timing differences in cash tax payments of $75 million and working capital changes. We expect the working capital changes to even out over the remainder of the year. 
During the second quarter, we spent $312 million on capital expenditures, an increase of $16 million when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Through the first 6 months of 2016, CapEx has increased $100 million compared to 2015. A large portion of the increase relates to onetime capital spending for the leachate treatment facility and timing of truck purchases. As a result, we now expect capital expenditures will be between $1.4 billion and $1.45 billion for 2016. We do not believe that this years increase in capital spending over our original guidance as a permanent increase due to the onetime nature of the extra spend. 
In the second quarter, we had $11 million in proceeds from the divested assets, a decrease of $48 million from last year. Combined, we generated $447 million of free cash flow and almost $849 million year-to-date. Given this strong first half performance, we're raising our free cash flow guidance to between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion. In the second quarter, we returned $431 million to shareholders. We paid $181 million of dividends and repurchased $251 million of shares. 
Finally, looking at our other financial metrics. At the end of the second quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio measured based on our bank covenants was 2.67 and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.22%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 10% at the end of the quarter. The effective tax rate was 37.6% in the second quarter. Adjusting for the impairments, tax rate was 34.7%. We still expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 35%. In summary, through the first 6 months of 2016, our employees have driven strong operational and financial performance that's exceeded our expectations. 
And for that, I want to thank them. The second half of 2016, will have tougher year-over-year comparisons. However, we're confident that we can execute our strategy to have a successful 2016. And with that, Janisha, let's open the line for questions."

Now as we look back in the back half of the year, we're not counting on a dramatic commodity price increase. But any commodity price increase that we have obviously, false straight to the bottom line."

Now early on in the cycle, you had some people that came in and did some of these contracts under the old methodology, right? And they're not very happy with those contracts right now. So in my mind, it sort of follows the same cycle that we saw with the fuel surcharge back in the early 2000's where initially, people go well, we'll count on the market bouncing back so will continue to bid under the old model. They're now stuck with 3- to 5-year contracts where they're going to lose money for 3 to 5 years. The next time those contracts come up, they will be bid more rationality. So not only do the municipalities get it, but I think the recycling community gets it too. I think what you'll see is a much more rational bidding behavior over the next 5 years."

Of course, energy services, I mean we've had some questions when we've been out talking to investors about, you're seeing your energy services coming back because you're seeing price go, bouncing back up. And what we said is look, energy services is really not so much driven by the price of oil as it is driven by drilling activity, and we've not seen drilling activity rebound in the form of rig count. So the energy services piece is still pretty soft, year-over-year. It's a pretty big negative for us that we fought back against. Coal ashes another components. Coal ash, as you know, we have a big Duke contract that is proceeding well for us. And we're seeing some -- certainly seeing some landfill impact from that contract. The utilities, the public utilities out there, developing their coal combustion residual plants for each plant. And we expect that those plants will result in a combination of kind of on-site work and some off-site disposal for us in the next few years. So coal ash will be good. I would tell you that for the most part, these companies preferred a handle on site, preferred beneficial reuse. We can handle all 3, but we'll certainly see in addition to the Duke contract. C&D, we talked about -- c&D has been strong and I would tell you, I've been talking to one of our area vice presidents who has a strong C&D market right now, he believe that, that's part of what's affecting his commercial volume. David has said it many times, it's -- when you start seeing this big tracts of land being taken out and we get that C&D business, maybe the more beneficial side of that is getting the commercial volume, the permanent business on the back end of that. And this VP seems to think that's exactly what's going on. And there are a couple of other components within the industrial line of business as well.

So we did Deffenbaugh RCI in Montreal, Deffenbaugh in Kansas City and SWF in South Florida. And we really don't see another one of those on the horizon. We've looked at a number of deals in the Southeast and some other places where what you said is exactly right. Sellers have gotten a little bit undisciplined on what they want. We're generally willing to pay sort of 6 to 8x EBITDA given the synergies we can pull out for a bigger deal. We might paying 7 to 9x EBITDA again because we can get good synergies and post synergies, we can get it to sort of 6 to 7.5x EBITDA. The part of the problem is, we've got a lot of the solid waste sellers that want 12x EBITDA. And that's just not a number that really works for us. And so we really don't see one of those decent sized solid waste acquisitions on the near horizon. We aren't looking dramatically outside our core solid waste. As Jim said, if we saw some opportunistic buying on the industrial side or energy services, we'd look at that. But we are not currency actively looking at anything in that arena. So we're sort of active to what I would say our smaller tuck-in acquisitions, sort of the $10 million to $20 million type acquisitions and we ask our business developers to pick up the pace on those, to make up for the fact that we don't have any of those larger transactions on the horizon. And so you know the deal. These things go in cycles. There are not a lot of buyers out there. You really haven't seen a dramatic amount of activity in the M&A side. And so -- and I think that's probably because a lot of these sellers have heightened expectations as the industry dynamics have improved. I would say that the industry is showing just as much discipline on the M&A side as they are on the operational and pricing side. No one's out there paying crazy numbers. So those businesses are going to be solved. It's just a matter of when they get to a reasonable multiple."

Obviously, you all on the phone, know Jim very well. Many of you have worked with him for a while now, so you know why the board and I have such confidence in him.

190694,372218982,1013938,"Waste Management, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. Our second quarter results again exceeded our internal expectations and mirror the trends we've seen for a number of quarters, improving volumes, strong execution of our pricing programs and greater traction in o",1041,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. Our second quarter results again exceeded our internal expectations and mirror the trends we've seen for a number of quarters, improving volumes, strong execution of our pricing programs and greater traction in our cost programs. In the second quarter, we earned $0.74 per share, an increase of more than 10% from our second quarter 2015 results. The combined revenue growth and cost improvement led to strong growth in operating EBITDA to $955 million, an increase of almost 9% and an improvement in our operating EBITDA margin of 140 basis points to 27.9%. This is the highest operating EBITDA margin that we've achieved in 7 years. 
Our pricing programs continued to drive earnings growth and margin expansion. For the second quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.9% and yield was 2.6%. Core price improved 80 basis points in the second quarter of 2015, and yield was up 90 basis points. Core price in the industrial line was 9.5%. In the commercial line, it was 7.6%. In our landfill line, it was 2.7%. And in our residential line, it was 2.5%.  Importantly, in the second quarter, our churn was 9.1%, 120 basis points better than last year and 10 basis points better than the first quarter of 2016, which demonstrates our ability to retain pricing and retain customers through improvements in our service efforts. At this point, we would certainly expect to exceed our full year core price target of 4% and our 2% yield target, although both metrics could moderate somewhat in the back half of the year due to year-over-year comparisons. 
With respect to volumes, we saw positive volume growth in the second quarter just as we did in the first quarter. But most encouraging is that we saw volume growth in the right volumes, our high-margin, commercial, industrial and landfill lines. In fact, our commercial volumes turned positive for the first time in over a decade. We shed volumes in the lower-margin residential and recycling lines of business, as we continue to eliminate low or negative margin contracts. Our traditional solid waste volumes were positive 0.8% in the second quarter 2016, 140-basis-point improvement from the second quarter of 2015. Our commercial volumes were 0.3% in the second quarter, an improvement of 50 basis points from the first quarter and a 250-basis-point improvement from Q2 of 2015. As this is our highest margin collection segment, this is a significant accomplishment and is reflected in the income from operations of the commercial line of business where we achieved the highest results ever. We expect to see continued growth in our commercial line as the year progresses, which is a tribute to the efforts of our sales and marketing teams. So our strategy of maintaining price discipline while adding the right volumes continued to bear fruit. We did see slightly stronger volume growth in the first quarter with weather in the first quarter of 2016 much milder than in the first quarter of 2015. So we weren't surprised to see a little less volume growth in the second quarter versus the first, but we expect total company volumes to continue to improve throughout the remainder of the year. And we now expect our traditional solid waste volumes to exceed 1% positive by year-end. 
Residential and recycling volumes were down in the quarter, and we'd expect them to be down for the remainder of the year. But the loss of those volumes is mostly intentional, given that they're low margin or oftentimes even negative margin volumes. Our landfill line of business continues to show strong results, which Jim will discuss in more detail. However, as we mentioned on the first quarter conference call, we've seen a significant increase in the cost of managing the liquids that naturally occur in our landfills. In the second quarter of 2016, the increase in leachate costs was about $22 million or $0.03 per share. 
As of July 1, we've implemented a wastewater management charge at all of our landfills for customers that are not under contract. We're still in the early stages, but so far, there has not been significant pushback. The next step will be to apply the charge to our disposal contracts as they renew. By passing these cost increases on to our customers, we'll ensure that we maintain an adequate return on the huge capital investments that we make in our landfill. 
Turning to recycling. We saw a 2.3% increase in average commodity prices for the quarter and a 2.9% decrease in volumes. We continue to focus on managing operating costs as we've seen our recycling operating costs improve more than 9% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. These operational improvements and the increase in commodity prices drove the recycling line of business to its highest income from operations since 2012 when the blended commodity prices were $109 per ton versus $85 in the second quarter of 2016. Year-over-year, the recycling line of business contributed $0.01 per share to earning. We continue to work with our customers to develop a mutually beneficial solution that allows for a sustainable recycling business model.
To summarize. The positive momentum that we saw in the first quarter continued throughout the second quarter. All of our employees worked hard to deliver strong first half results by focusing on improving price, driving disciplined volume growth and managing costs. In light of a strong first half performance, we're increasing our adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to between $2.83 and $2.86 for the full year, a $0.09 to $0.12 increase from the low end of our previous guidance. More importantly, we're also raising our free cash flow guidance for 2016 to between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, a $100 million to $200 million increase from the low end of our previous guidance despite our expected capital expenditures being slightly higher than our previous guidance. So the momentum in our business continues and our focus has never been sharper. We look forward to our corporate and field teams building upon this strong performance to drive even better results for the remainder of 2016 and beyond. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our second quarter results in more detail."
190694,372218982,1013938,"Waste Management, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David. In second quarter, revenues were $3.43 billion, an increase of $110 million or 3.3% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. We saw $150 million increase in our traditional solid waste business due to a $98 million increase from the com",1108,"Thanks, David. In second quarter, revenues were $3.43 billion, an increase of $110 million or 3.3% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. We saw $150 million increase in our traditional solid waste business due to a $98 million increase from the combined impacts of price and volume and a $52 million increase in revenues from acquisitions net of divestitures. These increases were partially offset by declines of $24 million in lower fuel surcharge revenues, $10 million in foreign currency fluctuations and a $5 million decline from lower recycling revenues. 
Looking at internal revenue growth for the company in the second quarter. Our collection and disposal core price was 4.9% and yield was 2.6% with total volumes improving 0.4%. Volumes were positive for the second consecutive quarter. The combined positive price and positive volume led to total company income from operations growing $58 million, operating income margin expanding 120 basis points to 18%, operating EBITDA growing $76 million and operating EBITDA margin growing 140 basis points to 27.9%. 
Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefits of our disciplined pricing programs and improved volumes. Overall, collection core price was 6.3% and yield was 3.3%. Industrial demand continued the strong performance that we saw in the first quarter. Volume was up 1.5% in the second quarter, a 150-basis-point improvement from the second quarter of 2015. And as David mentioned, commercial volumes were positive for the first time since 2005 at 0.3% for the second quarter, a 250-basis-point improvement from the second quarter of 2015. Our residential business continues to be a drag on overall collection volumes, down 3.5% in the second quarter, similar to the declines that we've experienced throughout 2014 and 2015. However, strong core price and positive volume in the high-margin commercial and industrial lines of business led to our collection income from operations growing $44 million and the operating margin growing 120 basis points. EBITDA grew $54 million, and EBITDA margin increased 150 basis points. 
In the landfill line of business, we again saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive yield in the second quarter just as we did last year. Total landfill volumes increased 6.5%. The landfill volume growth is very consistent with the volume growth in over the past 2 years. MSW volumes grew by 5.2%. C&D volume grew 12.5%. And combined special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes grew 4.4%. We achieved core price of 2.7%, an increase of 40 basis points from the second quarter of 2015 and saw same-store average MSW rates increase year-over-year by 1.9% from Q2 of 2015. 
Moving now to operating expenses. As a percent of revenue, those expenses improved 140 basis points to 62.2%. For the second quarter, operating expenses increased $22 million when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Landfill operating cost represented the largest increase, up $28 million. $22 million of the $28 million increase were the increased leachate cost with remaining $6 million increase related to the decline in the U.S. treasury rate used for discounting our long-term care obligations. Remainder of the operating cost dollar increase primarily relates to our increased volumes and costs related to acquired operations, which were partially offset by savings from lower fuel and risk management costs. 
For the second quarter as a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 9.9%, up 20 basis points when compared to the second quarter of 2015. On a dollar basis, SG&A costs were $340 million, an increase of $18 million compared to 2015. Labor costs drove the majority of the increase primarily related to acquisitions and higher accruals for stock-based incentive compensation. As you may recall, our stock-based incentive compensation is based upon performance in the areas of free cash flow and total shareholder return, and we've achieved strong performance in both metrics in the last 2 years. In the second quarter, those costs increased $11 million when compared to the second quarter of 2015. We expect that these costs will exceed last year by about the same amount in the back half of the year. We still expect to improve SG&A cost as a percent of revenue for the full year when compared to 2015. 
Turning to cash flow in the second quarter. Cash provided by operating activities were $748 million compared to $816 million in the second quarter of 2015. Our operations continued to perform very well as we achieved operating EBITDA increase of $76 million. However, this increase was more than offset by the impact of timing differences in cash tax payments of $75 million and working capital changes. We expect the working capital changes to even out over the remainder of the year. 
During the second quarter, we spent $312 million on capital expenditures, an increase of $16 million when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Through the first 6 months of 2016, CapEx has increased $100 million compared to 2015. A large portion of the increase relates to onetime capital spending for the leachate treatment facility and the timing of truck purchases. As a result, we now expect that capital expenditures will be between $1.4 billion and $1.45 billion for 2016. We do not believe that this year's increase in capital spending over our original guidance is a permanent increase due to the onetime nature of the extra spend. 
In the second quarter, we had $11 million in proceeds from divested assets, a decrease of $48 million from last year. Combined, we generated $447 million of free cash flow and almost $849 million year-to-date. Given this strong first half performance, we're raising our free cash flow guidance to between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion. In the second quarter, we returned $431 million to shareholders. We paid $181 million of dividends and repurchased $251 million of shares. 
Finally, looking at our other financial metrics. At the end of the second quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, measured based on our bank covenants, was 2.67, and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.22%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 10% at the end of the quarter. The effective tax rate was 37.6% in the second quarter. Adjusting for the impairments, tax rate was 34.7%. We still expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 35%. 
In summary, through the first 6 months of 2016, our employees have driven strong operational and financial performance that's exceeded our expectations. And for that, I want to thank them.

And as we look forward, remember, every year you seem to have that seasonal uptick, and then starting in July, it starts to tick down. So we're not certain that we're going to see that benefit in the back half of the year. But generally, what we say is that every $10 in commodity prices equates to about $30 million of EBIT for us. And so what we've tried to do in this business is to make sure that if commodity prices go down, our earnings don't take a negative hit. But if commodity prices go up, they take a positive hit. So we've tried to derisk the business so that there's no downside, only upside. If the commodity prices go down in the back half of the year, we think we can offset that with operational improvement. So we don't expect any negative benefit in the back half of the year. If we see anything in the back half of the year, it will be a positive benefit from recycling."

They're now stuck with 3- to 5-year contracts where they're going to lose money for 3 to 5 years. The next time those contracts come up, they will be bid more rationally.

Of course, energy services -- I mean, we've had some questions when we've been out talking to investors about, you're seeing your energy services business coming back, because you're seeing price go up bouncing back up. And what we said is, look, energy services is really not so much driven by the price of oil as it is driven by drilling activity, and we've not seen drilling activity rebound in the form of rig count. So the energy services piece is still pretty soft. Year-over-year, it's a pretty big negative for us that we fought back against. Coal ash is another component. Coal ash, as you know, we have a big Duke contract that is proceeding well for us, and we're seeing some -- certainly seeing landfill impact from that contract. The utilities -- the public utilities are out there developing their coal combustion residual plants at each -- for each plant, and we expect that those plants will result in a combination of kind of on-site work and some off-site disposal for us in the next few years. So coal ash will be good. I would tell you that for the most part, these companies preferred handling on-site, preferred beneficial reuse. We can handle all 3, but we'll certainly see some benefit in addition to the Duke contract. C&D, we talked about -- C&D has been strong and I would tell you that in talking to one of our area vice presidents, who has a strong C&D market right now, he believes that, that's part of what's affecting his commercial volume is that -- David has said it many times, it's -- when you start seeing these big tracts of land being taken out and we get that C&D business, maybe the more beneficial side of that is getting the commercial volume, the permanent business on the back end of that.

So we did Deffenbaugh -- RCI in Montréal's, Deffenbaugh in Kansas City and then SWS in South Florida. And we really don't see another one of those on the horizon. We've looked at a number of deals in the Southeast and some other places where -- what you said is exactly right. Sellers have gotten a little bit undisciplined on what they want. We're generally willing to pay sort of 6 to 8x EBITDA. Given the synergies we can pull out for a bigger deal, we might pay 7 to 9x EBITDA again, because we can get good synergies, and post synergies, we can get it to sort of 6 to 7.5x EBITDA. The part of the problem is we've got a lot of the solid waste sellers that want 12x EBITDA, and that's just not a number that really works for us. And so we really don't see one of those decent-sized solid waste acquisitions on the near horizon. We aren't looking dramatically outside of our core solid waste. As Jim said, if we saw some opportunistic buying on the industrial side or energy services, we'd look at that. But we are not currency actively looking at anything in that arena. And so we're sort of active what I'd say are smaller tuck-in acquisitions, sort of the $10 million to $20 million type acquisitions. And we've asked our business developers to pick up the pace on those to make up for the fact that we don't have any of those larger transactions on the horizon. And so you know the deal, these things go in cycles. There are not a lot of buyers out there. You really haven't seen a dramatic amount of activity in the M&A side. And so -- and I think that's probably because a lot of these sellers have heightened expectations as the industry dynamics have improved. I would say that the industry is showing just as much discipline on the M&A side as they are on the operational and pricing side. No one's out there paying crazy numbers.

But I think the changes that Jim talked about in those contracts are to kind of back to David's point about derisking the business are helping to derisk the line of business. And then I think it's very important that we -- we've had some very stiff competition within the resi line of business. And so it's important for us to continue to push disposal price increases in addition to collection price increases. We're pushing collection price increases through this residential line of business on our customers. But I think it's important that we push disposal price increases on our third-party customers as well. I mean, they should have to pay their fair share."

I think part of the issue on some of that volume loss, not all of it, but enough that it's measurable, are from our local competitors. When you look at interest rates where they are, they can lease trucks really at a really low cost and come in and take some of the neighborhoods, for example, that are around the Houston area. They probably don't have the capital -- the capability from a capital standpoint to handle one of the larger locations or franchises. But they put pricing pressure on some of those local neighborhoods, where they can get a couple of trucks really, really inexpensively. And I -- that's part of the effects. What we do is look at it from an integrated standpoint. As Jim Fish said, we're integrated and we're taking the -- handing the disposal internally. And if it's not flow control to another disposal site, then we're going to retain that business. Where it's not, we'll turn that volume lose where it's a low collection margin and put that capital to work at a place that we get a better return."

And so we're always going to save a little bit of dry powder to make sure that we can do any of those acquisitions that come along. And then when we look at it, obviously our dividend yield has gone down with the stock price going up. And so at the end of the year, when we look at our dividend, I would expect that we'll see another good increase in the dividend coming into the back half of the year. And then on the share repurchase side, the bulk of the remainder of our cash goes to our share repurchase. We don't really time share repurchases.

The Form 8-K, the press release and the schedules to the press release include important information. During the call, you will hear forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations, projections or opinions about future periods. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in today's press release and in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K. 
David and Jim will discuss our results in the areas of yield and volume, which unless otherwise stated are more specifically references to internal revenue growth or IRG from yield or volume. During the call, David and Jim will also discuss our earnings per diluted share, which they may refer to as EPS or earnings per share. And David and Jim will address operating EBITDA and operating EBITDA margin as defined in the footnotes to the earnings press release. 
Any comparisons, unless otherwise stated, will be with the second quarter of 2015. The second quarter 2016 and 2015 results have been adjusted to enhance comparability by excluding certain items that management believes do not reflect our fundamental business performance or results of operations. These adjusted measures, in addition to free cash flow, are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the earnings press release footnote and schedules, which can be found on the company's website at www.wm.com for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures.

190694,372218982,1014333,"Waste Management, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. Our second quarter results again exceeded our internal expectations and mirror the trends we've seen for a number of quarters: improving volumes, strong execution of our pricing programs and greater traction in o",1042,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. Our second quarter results again exceeded our internal expectations and mirror the trends we've seen for a number of quarters: improving volumes, strong execution of our pricing programs and greater traction in our cost programs. In the second quarter, we earned $0.74 per share, an increase of more than 10% from our second quarter 2015 results. The combined revenue growth and cost improvement led to strong growth in operating EBITDA to $955 million, an increase of almost 9% and an improvement in our operating EBITDA margin of 140 basis points to 27.9%. This is the highest operating EBITDA margin that we've achieved in 7 years. 
Our pricing programs continued to drive earnings growth and margin expansion. For the second quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.9% and yield was 2.6%. Core price improved 80 basis points in the second quarter of 2015, and yield was up 90 basis points. Core price in the industrial line was 9.5%. In the commercial line, it was 7.6%. In our landfill line, it was 2.7%. And in our residential line, it was 2.5%.  Importantly, in the second quarter, our churn was 9.1%, 120 basis points better than last year and 10 basis points better than the first quarter of 2016, which demonstrates our ability to retain pricing and retain customers through improvements in our service efforts. At this point, we would certainly expect to exceed our full year core price target of 4% and our 2% yield target, although both metrics could moderate somewhat in the back half of the year due to year-over-year comparisons. 
With respect to volumes, we saw positive volume growth in the second quarter just as we did in the first quarter. But most encouraging is that we saw volume growth in the right volumes, our high-margin commercial, industrial and landfill lines. In fact, our commercial volumes turned positive for the first time in over a decade. We shed volumes in the lower-margin residential and recycling lines of business, as we continue to eliminate low or negative margin contracts. Our traditional solid waste volumes were positive 0.8% in the second quarter 2016, A 140-basis-point improvement from the second quarter of 2015. Our commercial volumes were 0.3% in the second quarter, an improvement of 50 basis points from the first quarter and a 250-basis-point improvement from Q2 of 2015. As this is our highest margin collection segment, this is a significant accomplishment and is reflected in the income from operations of the commercial line of business where we achieved the highest results ever. We expect to see continued growth in our commercial line as the year progresses, which is a tribute to the efforts of our sales and marketing teams. So our strategy of maintaining price discipline while adding the right volumes continued to bear fruit. We did see slightly stronger volume growth in the first quarter with weather in the first quarter of 2016 much milder than in the first quarter of 2015. So we weren't surprised to see a little less volume growth in the second quarter versus the first, but we expect total company volumes to continue to improve throughout the remainder of the year. And we now expect our traditional solid waste volumes to exceed 1% positive by year-end. 
Residential and recycling volumes were down in the quarter, and we'd expect them to be down for the remainder of the year. But the loss of those volumes is mostly intentional, given that they're low margin or oftentimes even negative margin volumes. Our landfill line of business continues to show strong results, which Jim will discuss in more detail. However, as we mentioned on the first quarter conference call, we've seen a significant increase in the cost of managing the liquids that naturally occur in our landfills. In the second quarter of 2016, the increase in leachate costs was about $22 million or $0.03 per share. 
As of July 1, we've implemented a wastewater management charge at all of our landfills for customers that are not under contract. We're still in the early stages, but so far, there has not been significant pushback. The next step will be to apply the charge to our disposal contracts as they renew. By passing these cost increases on to our customers, we'll ensure that we maintain an adequate return on the huge capital investments that we make in our landfills. 
Turning to recycling. We saw a 2.3% increase in average commodity prices for the quarter and a 2.9% decrease in volumes. We continue to focus on managing operating costs as we've seen our recycling operating costs improve more than 9% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. These operational improvements and the increase in commodity prices drove the recycling line of business to its highest income from operations since 2012 when the blended commodity prices were $109 per ton versus $85 in the second quarter of 2016. Year-over-year, the recycling line of business contributed $0.01 per share to earning. We continue to work with our customers to develop a mutually beneficial solution that allows for a sustainable recycling business model.
To summarize. The positive momentum that we saw in the first quarter continued throughout the second quarter. All of our employees worked hard to deliver strong first half results by focusing on improving price, driving disciplined volume growth and managing costs. In light of a strong first half performance, we're increasing our adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to between $2.83 and $2.86 for the full year, a $0.09 to $0.12 increase from the low end of our previous guidance. More importantly, we're also raising our free cash flow guidance for 2016 to between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, a $100 million to $200 million increase from the low end of our previous guidance despite our expected capital expenditures being slightly higher than our previous guidance. So the momentum in our business continues and our focus has never been sharper. We look forward to our corporate and field teams building upon this strong performance to drive even better results for the remainder of 2016 and beyond. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our second quarter results in more detail."

In second quarter, revenues were $3.43 billion, an increase of $110 million or 3.3% when compared to the second quarter of 2015.

In second quarter, revenues were $3.43 billion, an increase of $110 million or 3.3% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. We saw a $150 million increase in our traditional solid waste business due to a $98 million increase from the combined impacts of price and volume and a $52 million increase in revenues from acquisitions net of divestitures. These increases were partially offset by declines of $24 million in lower fuel surcharge revenues, $10 million in foreign currency fluctuations and a $5 million decline from lower recycling revenues. 
Looking at internal revenue growth for the company in the second quarter. Our collection and disposal core price was 4.9% and yield was 2.6% with total volumes improving 0.4%. Volumes were positive for the second consecutive quarter. The combined positive price and positive volume led to total company income from operations growing $58 million, operating income margin expanding 120 basis points to 18%, operating EBITDA growing $76 million and operating EBITDA margin growing 140 basis points to 27.9%. 
Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefits of our disciplined pricing programs and improved volumes. Overall, collection core price was 6.3% and yield was 3.3%. Industrial demand continued the strong performance that we saw in the first quarter. Volume was up 1.5% in the second quarter, a 150-basis-point improvement from the second quarter of 2015. And as David mentioned, commercial volumes were positive for the first time since 2005 at 0.3% for the second quarter, a 250-basis-point improvement from the second quarter of 2015. Our residential business continues to be a drag on overall collection volumes, down 3.5% in the second quarter, similar to the declines that we've experienced throughout 2014 and 2015. However, strong core price and positive volume in the high-margin commercial and industrial lines of business led to our collection income from operations growing $44 million and the operating margin growing 120 basis points. EBITDA grew $54 million, and EBITDA margin increased 150 basis points. 
In the landfill line of business, we again saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive yield in the second quarter just as we did last year. Total landfill volumes increased 6.5%. Our landfill volume growth is very consistent with the volume growth over the past 2 years. MSW volumes grew by 5.2%. C&D volume grew 12.5%. And combined special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes grew 4.4%. We achieved core price of 2.7%, an increase of 40 basis points from the second quarter of 2015 and saw same-store average MSW rates increase year-over-year by 1.9% from Q2 of 2015. 
Moving now to operating expenses. As a percent of revenue, those expenses improved 140 basis points to 62.2%. For the second quarter, operating expenses increased $22 million when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Landfill operating cost represented the largest increase, up $28 million. $22 million of the $28 million increase were the increased leachate costs with the remaining $6 million increase related to the decline in the U.S. treasury rate used for discounting our long-term care obligations. The remainder of the operating cost dollar increase primarily relates to our increased volumes and costs related to acquired operations, which were partially offset by savings from lower fuel and risk management costs. 
For the second quarter as a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 9.9%, up 20 basis points when compared to the second quarter of 2015. On a dollar basis, SG&A costs were $340 million, an increase of $18 million compared to 2015. Labor costs drove the majority of the increase, primarily related to acquisitions and higher accruals for stock-based incentive compensation. As you may recall, our stock-based incentive compensation is based upon performance in the areas of free cash flow and total shareholder return, and we've achieved strong performance in both metrics in the last 2 years. In the second quarter, those costs increased $11 million when compared to the second quarter of 2015. We expect that these costs will exceed last year by about the same amount in the back half of the year. We still expect to improve SG&A cost as a percent of revenue for the full year when compared to 2015. 
Turning to cash flow in the second quarter. Cash provided by operating activities was $748 million compared to $816 million in the second quarter of 2015. Our operations continued to perform very well as we achieved operating EBITDA increase of $76 million. However, this increase was more than offset by the impact of timing differences in cash tax payments of $75 million and working capital changes. We expect the working capital changes to even out over the remainder of the year. 
During the second quarter, we spent $312 million on capital expenditures, an increase of $16 million when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Through the first 6 months of 2016, CapEx has increased $100 million compared to 2015. A large portion of the increase relates to onetime capital spending for a leachate treatment facility and the timing of truck purchases. As a result, we now expect that capital expenditures will be between $1.4 billion and $1.45 billion for 2016. We do not believe that this year's increase in capital spending over our original guidance is a permanent increase due to the onetime nature of the extra spend. 
In the second quarter, we had $11 million in proceeds from divested assets, a decrease of $48 million from last year. Combined, we generated $447 million of free cash flow and almost $849 million year-to-date. Given this strong first half performance, we're raising our free cash flow guidance to between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion. In the second quarter, we returned $431 million to shareholders. We paid $181 million of dividends and repurchased $251 million of shares. 
Finally, looking at our other financial metrics. At the end of the second quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, measured based on our bank covenants, was 2.67, and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.22%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 10% at the end of the quarter. The effective tax rate was 37.6% in the second quarter. Adjusting for the impairments, the tax rate was 34.7%. We still expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 35%. 
In summary, through the first 6 months of 2016, our employees have driven strong operational and financial performance that's exceeded our expectations. And for that, I want to thank them. The second half of 2016 will have tougher year-over-year comparisons; however, we're confident that we can execute our strategy to have a successful 2016. And with that, Janisha, let's open the line for questions."

We also see some real strong effort just in execution by our teams on retaining those higher-margin customers. And I think that plays into that yield positive as well.

They're now stuck with 3- to 5-year contracts where they're going to lose money for 3 to 5 years. The next time those contracts come up, they will be bid more rationally.

Of course, energy services -- I mean, we've had some questions when we've been out talking to investors about, are you seeing your energy services business coming back, because you're seeing price of oil bouncing back up. And what we've said is, look, energy services is really not so much driven by the price of oil as it is driven by drilling activity, and we've not seen drilling activity rebound in the form of rig count. So the energy services piece is still pretty soft. Year-over-year, it's a pretty big negative for us that we fought back against. Coal ash is another component. Coal ash, as you know, we have a big Duke contract that is proceeding well for us, and we're seeing some -- certainly seeing landfill impact from that contract. The utilities -- the public utilities are out there developing their coal combustion residual plans at each -- for each plant, and we expect that those plans will result in a combination of kind of on-site work and some off-site disposal for us in the next few years. So coal ash will be good. I would tell you that for the most part, these companies prefer to handle it on-site, prefer beneficial reuse. We can handle all 3, but we'll certainly see some benefit in addition to the Duke contract. C&D, we talked about -- C&D has been strong and I would tell you that in talking to one of our area vice presidents, who has a strong C&D market right now, he believes that, that's part of what's affecting his commercial volume is that -- David has said it many times, it's -- when you start seeing these big tracts of land being taken out and we get that C&D business, maybe the more beneficial side of that is getting the commercial volume, the permanent business on the back end of that.

When we look at the acquisition market, basically in the last 3 years, we've done a moderate-sized deal each year that added sort of that $50 million to $75 million of EBITDA. So we did Deffenbaugh -- RCI in Montréal, Deffenbaugh in Kansas City and then SWS in South Florida. And we really don't see another one of those on the horizon. We've looked at a number of deals in the Southeast and some other places where -- what you said is exactly right. Sellers have gotten a little bit undisciplined on what they want. We're generally willing to pay sort of 6x to 8x EBITDA. Given the synergies we can pull out, for a bigger deal, we might pay 7x to 9x EBITDA, again, because we can get good synergies, and post synergies, we can get it to sort of 6x to 7.5x EBITDA. The -- part of the problem is we've got a lot of the solid waste sellers that want 12x EBITDA, and that's just not a number that really works for us. And so we really don't see one of those decent-sized solid waste acquisitions on the near horizon. We aren't looking dramatically outside of our core solid waste. As Jim said, if we saw some opportunistic buying on the industrial side or energy services, we'd look at that. But we are not currently actively looking at anything in that arena. And so we're sort of back to what I'd say are our smaller tuck-in acquisitions, sort of the $10 million to $20 million type acquisitions. And we've asked our business developers to pick up the pace on those to make up for the fact that we don't have any of those larger transactions on the horizon. And so you know the deal, these things go in cycles. There are not a lot of buyers out there. You really haven't seen a dramatic amount of activity in the M&A side. And so -- and I think that's probably because a lot of these sellers have heightened expectations as the industry dynamics have improved. I would say that the industry is showing just as much discipline on the M&A side as they are on the operational and pricing side. No one's out there paying crazy numbers. So those businesses are going to be sold. It's just a matter of when they get to a reasonable multiple."

They probably don't have the capital -- the capability from a capital standpoint to handle one of the larger locations or franchises. But they put pricing pressure on some of those local neighborhoods, where they can get a couple of trucks really, really inexpensively. And I -- that's part of the effect. What we do is look at it from an integrated standpoint, as Jim Fish said. We're integrated and we're taking the -- handing the disposal internally. And if it's not flow controlled to another disposal site, then we're going to retain that business. Where it's not, we'll turn that volume lose where it's a low collection margin and put that capital to work at a place that we get a better return."

And then when we look at it, obviously our dividend yield has gone down with the stock price going up. And so at the end of the year, when we look at our dividend, I would expect that we'll see another good increase in the dividend coming into the back half of the year. And then on the share repurchase side, the bulk of the remainder of our cash goes to our share repurchase. We don't really time share repurchases.

190694,372218982,1014691,"Waste Management, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. Our second quarter results again exceeded our internal expectations and mirror the trends we've seen for a number of quarters: improving volumes, strong execution of our pricing programs and greater traction in o",1042,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. Our second quarter results again exceeded our internal expectations and mirror the trends we've seen for a number of quarters: improving volumes, strong execution of our pricing programs and greater traction in our cost programs. In the second quarter, we earned $0.74 per share, an increase of more than 10% from our second quarter 2015 results. The combined revenue growth and cost improvement led to strong growth in operating EBITDA to $955 million, an increase of almost 9% and an improvement in our operating EBITDA margin of 140 basis points to 27.9%. This is the highest operating EBITDA margin that we've achieved in 7 years. 
Our pricing programs continued to drive earnings growth and margin expansion. For the second quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.9% and yield was 2.6%. Core price improved 80 basis points in the second quarter of 2015, and yield was up 90 basis points. Core price in the industrial line was 9.5%. In the commercial line, it was 7.6%. In our landfill line, it was 2.7%. And in our residential line, it was 2.5%. Importantly, in the second quarter, our churn was 9.1%, 120 basis points better than last year and 10 basis points better than the first quarter of 2016, which demonstrates our ability to retain pricing and retain customers through improvements in our service efforts. At this point, we would certainly expect to exceed our full year core price target of 4% and our 2% yield target, although both metrics could moderate somewhat in the back half of the year due to year-over-year comparisons. 
With respect to volumes, we saw positive volume growth in the second quarter just as we did in the first quarter. But most encouraging is that we saw volume growth in the right volumes, our high-margin commercial, industrial and landfill lines. In fact, our commercial volumes turned positive for the first time in over a decade. We shed volumes in the lower-margin residential and recycling lines of business, as we continue to eliminate low or negative margin contracts. Our traditional solid waste volumes were positive 0.8% in the second quarter 2016, A 140-basis-point improvement from the second quarter of 2015. Our commercial volumes were 0.3% in the second quarter, an improvement of 50 basis points from the first quarter and a 250-basis-point improvement from Q2 of 2015. As this is our highest margin collection segment, this is a significant accomplishment and is reflected in the income from operations of the commercial line of business where we achieved the highest results ever. We expect to see continued growth in our commercial line as the year progresses, which is a tribute to the efforts of our sales and marketing teams. So our strategy of maintaining price discipline while adding the right volumes continued to bear fruit. We did see slightly stronger volume growth in the first quarter with weather in the first quarter of 2016 much milder than in the first quarter of 2015. So we weren't surprised to see a little less volume growth in the second quarter versus the first, but we expect total company volumes to continue to improve throughout the remainder of the year. And we now expect our traditional solid waste volumes to exceed 1% positive by year-end. 
Residential and recycling volumes were down in the quarter, and we'd expect them to be down for the remainder of the year. But the loss of those volumes is mostly intentional, given that they're low margin or oftentimes even negative margin volumes. Our landfill line of business continues to show strong results, which Jim will discuss in more detail. However, as we mentioned on the first quarter conference call, we've seen a significant increase in the cost of managing the liquids that naturally occur in our landfills. In the second quarter of 2016, the increase in leachate costs was about $22 million or $0.03 per share. 
As of July 1, we've implemented a wastewater management charge at all of our landfills for customers that are not under contract. We're still in the early stages, but so far, there has not been significant pushback. The next step will be to apply the charge to our disposal contracts as they renew. By passing these cost increases on to our customers, we'll ensure that we maintain an adequate return on the huge capital investments that we make in our landfills. 
Turning to recycling. We saw a 2.3% increase in average commodity prices for the quarter and a 2.9% decrease in volumes. We continue to focus on managing operating costs as we've seen our recycling operating costs improve more than 9% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. These operational improvements and the increase in commodity prices drove the recycling line of business to its highest income from operations since 2012 when the blended commodity prices were $109 per ton versus $85 in the second quarter of 2016. Year-over-year, the recycling line of business contributed $0.01 per share to earning. We continue to work with our customers to develop a mutually beneficial solution that allows for a sustainable recycling business model.
To summarize. The positive momentum that we saw in the first quarter continued throughout the second quarter. All of our employees worked hard to deliver strong first half results by focusing on improving price, driving disciplined volume growth and managing costs. In light of a strong first half performance, we're increasing our adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to between $2.83 and $2.86 for the full year, a $0.09 to $0.12 increase from the low end of our previous guidance. More importantly, we're also raising our free cash flow guidance for 2016 to between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, a $100 million to $200 million increase from the low end of our previous guidance despite our expected capital expenditures being slightly higher than our previous guidance. So the momentum in our business continues and our focus has never been sharper. We look forward to our corporate and field teams building upon this strong performance to drive even better results for the remainder of 2016 and beyond. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our second quarter results in more detail."

In second quarter, revenues were $3.43 billion, an increase of $110 million or 3.3% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. We saw a $150 million increase in our traditional solid waste business due to a $98 million increase from the c",1111,"Thanks, David. In second quarter, revenues were $3.43 billion, an increase of $110 million or 3.3% when compared to the second quarter of 2015. We saw a $150 million increase in our traditional solid waste business due to a $98 million increase from the combined impacts of price and volume and a $52 million increase in revenues from acquisitions net of divestitures. These increases were partially offset by declines of $24 million in lower fuel surcharge revenues, $10 million in foreign currency fluctuations and a $5 million decline from lower recycling revenues. 
Looking at internal revenue growth for the company in the second quarter. Our collection and disposal core price was 4.9% and yield was 2.6% with total volumes improving 0.4%. Volumes were positive for the second consecutive quarter. The combined positive price and positive volume led to total company income from operations growing $58 million, operating income margin expanding 120 basis points to 18%, operating EBITDA growing $76 million and operating EBITDA margin growing 140 basis points to 27.9%. 
Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefits of our disciplined pricing programs and improved volumes. Overall, collection core price was 6.3% and yield was 3.3%. Industrial demand continued the strong performance that we saw in the first quarter. Volume was up 1.5% in the second quarter, a 150-basis-point improvement from the second quarter of 2015. And as David mentioned, commercial volumes were positive for the first time since 2005 at 0.3% for the second quarter, a 250-basis-point improvement from the second quarter of 2015. Our residential business continues to be a drag on overall collection volumes, down 3.5% in the second quarter, similar to the declines that we've experienced throughout 2014 and 2015. However, strong core price and positive volume in the high-margin commercial and industrial lines of business led to our collection income from operations growing $44 million and the operating margin growing 120 basis points. EBITDA grew $54 million, and EBITDA margin increased 150 basis points. 
In the landfill line of business, we again saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive yield in the second quarter just as we did last year. Total landfill volumes increased 6.5%. Our landfill volume growth is very consistent with the volume growth over the past 2 years. MSW volumes grew by 5.2%. C&D volume grew 12.5%. And combined special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes grew 4.4%. We achieved core price of 2.7%, an increase of 40 basis points from the second quarter of 2015 and saw same-store average MSW rates increase year-over-year by 1.9% from Q2 of 2015. 
Moving now to operating expenses. As a percent of revenue, those expenses improved 140 basis points to 62.2%. For the second quarter, operating expenses increased $22 million when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Landfill operating cost represented the largest increase, up $28 million. $22 million of the $28 million increase were the increased leachate costs with the remaining $6 million increase related to the decline in the U.S. treasury rate used for discounting our long-term care obligations. The remainder of the operating cost dollar increase primarily relates to our increased volumes and costs related to acquired operations, which were partially offset by savings from lower fuel and risk management costs. 
For the second quarter as a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 9.9%, up 20 basis points when compared to the second quarter of 2015. On a dollar basis, SG&A costs were $340 million, an increase of $18 million compared to 2015. Labor costs drove the majority of the increase, primarily related to acquisitions and higher accruals for stock-based incentive compensation. As you may recall, our stock-based incentive compensation is based upon performance in the areas of free cash flow and total shareholder return, and we've achieved strong performance in both metrics in the last 2 years. In the second quarter, those costs increased $11 million when compared to the second quarter of 2015. We expect that these costs will exceed last year by about the same amount in the back half of the year. We still expect to improve SG&A cost as a percent of revenue for the full year when compared to 2015. 
Turning to cash flow in the second quarter. Cash provided by operating activities was $748 million compared to $816 million in the second quarter of 2015. Our operations continued to perform very well as we achieved operating EBITDA increase of $76 million. However, this increase was more than offset by the impact of timing differences in cash tax payments of $75 million and working capital changes. We expect the working capital changes to even out over the remainder of the year. 
During the second quarter, we spent $312 million on capital expenditures, an increase of $16 million when compared to the second quarter of 2015. Through the first 6 months of 2016, CapEx has increased $100 million compared to 2015. A large portion of the increase relates to onetime capital spending for a leachate treatment facility and the timing of truck purchases. As a result, we now expect that capital expenditures will be between $1.4 billion and $1.45 billion for 2016. We do not believe that this year's increase in capital spending over our original guidance is a permanent increase due to the onetime nature of the extra spend. 
In the second quarter, we had $11 million in proceeds from divested assets, a decrease of $48 million from last year. Combined, we generated $447 million of free cash flow and almost $849 million year-to-date. Given this strong first half performance, we're raising our free cash flow guidance to between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion. In the second quarter, we returned $431 million to shareholders. We paid $181 million of dividends and repurchased $251 million of shares. 
Finally, looking at our other financial metrics. At the end of the second quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio, measured based on our bank covenants, was 2.67, and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.22%. The floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 10% at the end of the quarter. The effective tax rate was 37.6% in the second quarter. Adjusting for the impairments, the tax rate was 34.7%. We still expect our full year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 35%. 
In summary, through the first 6 months of 2016, our employees have driven strong operational and financial performance that's exceeded our expectations. And for that, I want to thank them. The second half of 2016 will have tougher year-over-year comparisons; however, we're confident that we can execute our strategy to have a successful 2016. And with that, Janisha, let's open the line for questions."

We can do it by customer segment or a sales channel, by route, by geography. It really will help us as we move forward. We're about halfway through, rolling it out to our 17 areas. Not all of them are executing with it. We're in the final steps of putting together a playbook that really will be -- because the analytics are so intuitive and so obvious, it'll be really heavy on action, what do we do with the tool to get benefit. Most of that will come as we finish the rollout in Q4 and especially into 2017. But for those areas that have had it up and running, we see the benefit. We also see some real strong effort just in execution by our teams on retaining those higher-margin customers. And I think that plays into that yield positive as well. We've got really good processes that are being executed across the areas to retain customers, and our operating team is providing a lot better service that we measure really consistently with real accountability processes.

They're now stuck with 3- to 5-year contracts where they're going to lose money for 3 to 5 years. The next time those contracts come up, they will be bid more rationally.

Of course, energy services -- I mean, we've had some questions when we've been out talking to investors about, are you seeing your energy services business coming back, because you're seeing price of oil bouncing back up. And what we've said is, look, energy services is really not so much driven by the price of oil as it is driven by drilling activity, and we've not seen drilling activity rebound in the form of rig count. So the energy services piece is still pretty soft. Year-over-year, it's a pretty big negative for us that we fought back against. Coal ash is another component. Coal ash, as you know, we have a big Duke contract that is proceeding well for us, and we're seeing some -- certainly seeing landfill impact from that contract. The utilities -- the public utilities are out there developing their coal combustion residual plans at each -- for each plant, and we expect that those plans will result in a combination of kind of on-site work and some off-site disposal for us in the next few years. So coal ash will be good. I would tell you that for the most part, these companies prefer to handle it on-site, prefer beneficial reuse. We can handle all 3, but we'll certainly see some benefit in addition to the Duke contract. C&D, we talked about -- C&D has been strong and I would tell you that in talking to one of our area vice presidents, who has a strong C&D market right now, he believes that, that's part of what's affecting his commercial volume is that -- David has said it many times, it's -- when you start seeing these big tracts of land being taken out and we get that C&D business, maybe the more beneficial side of that is getting the commercial volume, the permanent business on the back end of that.

On the national account side, we're getting a different metric on every renewal of a contract. It may not be the full wastewater treatment metric that's generally 200, 300 basis points higher than CPI.

So we did Deffenbaugh -- RCI in Montréal, Deffenbaugh in Kansas City and then SWS in South Florida. And we really don't see another one of those on the horizon. We've looked at a number of deals in the Southeast and some other places where -- what you said is exactly right. Sellers have gotten a little bit undisciplined on what they want. We're generally willing to pay sort of 6x to 8x EBITDA. Given the synergies we can pull out, for a bigger deal, we might pay 7x to 9x EBITDA, again, because we can get good synergies, and post synergies, we can get it to sort of 6x to 7.5x EBITDA. The -- part of the problem is we've got a lot of the solid waste sellers that want 12x EBITDA, and that's just not a number that really works for us. And so we really don't see one of those decent-sized solid waste acquisitions on the near horizon. We aren't looking dramatically outside of our core solid waste. As Jim said, if we saw some opportunistic buying on the industrial side or energy services, we'd look at that. But we are not currently actively looking at anything in that arena. And so we're sort of back to what I'd say are our smaller tuck-in acquisitions, sort of the $10 million to $20 million type acquisitions. And we've asked our business developers to pick up the pace on those to make up for the fact that we don't have any of those larger transactions on the horizon. And so you know the deal, these things go in cycles. There are not a lot of buyers out there. You really haven't seen a dramatic amount of activity in the M&A side. And so -- and I think that's probably because a lot of these sellers have heightened expectations as the industry dynamics have improved. I would say that the industry is showing just as much discipline on the M&A side as they are on the operational and pricing side. No one's out there paying crazy numbers. So those businesses are going to be sold. It's just a matter of when they get to a reasonable multiple."

But they put pricing pressure on some of those local neighborhoods, where they can get a couple of trucks really, really inexpensively. And I -- that's part of the effect. What we do is look at it from an integrated standpoint, as Jim Fish said. We're integrated and we're taking the -- handing the disposal internally. And if it's not flow controlled to another disposal site, then we're going to retain that business.

I wish I could promote him to role of President of the United States. But unfortunately, all I can do is promote him to President of Waste Management. 
As part of our ongoing succession planning process, the board and I felt that the next logical step in that process was for us to name Jim President. We're conducting a search for a new Chief Financial Officer who will report to Jim. And while that search is underway, Jim will retain his CFO responsibilities. Obviously, you all on the phone know Jim very well. Many of you have worked with him for a while now. So you know why the board and I have such confidence in him. He's really been pivotal to the success of our company, and he's also a talented leader with tremendous knowledge of all aspects of our business. The promotion is a well-deserved recognition of his past accomplishments and another step in his development as a leader. I'm sure you'll all join me, our board, our senior leadership team and the rest of our Waste Management family in congratulating Jim on this great achievement.

Before we get started, please note that we have filed a Form 8-K this morning that includes the earnings press release, and is available on our website at www.wm.com. The Form 8-K, the press release and the schedules to the press release include important information. 
During the call, you will hear forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations, projections or opinions about future periods. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in today's press release and in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K. David and Jim will discuss our results in the areas of yield and volume which, unless otherwise stated, are more specifically references to internal revenue growth, or IRG, from yield or volume. 
During the call, David and Jim will also discuss our earnings per diluted share, which they may refer to as EPS, or earnings per share. And Jim and David will address operating EBITDA and operating EBITDA margin, as defined in the earnings press release. Any comparison, unless otherwise stated, will be with the third quarter of 2015. The third quarter of 2016 results have been adjusted to enhance comparability by excluding certain items that management believes do not reflect our fundamental business performance or results of operations. These adjusted measures, in addition to free cash flow, are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the earnings press release footnote and schedules, which can be found on the company's website at www.wm.com for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures.

190694,403160531,1061589,"Waste Management, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. Our third quarter results exceeded our internal expectations. As we have all year, we saw improving volumes, strong execution of our pricing programs and continued traction in our cost programs. Each of our net i",992,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. Our third quarter results exceeded our internal expectations. As we have all year, we saw improving volumes, strong execution of our pricing programs and continued traction in our cost programs. Each of our net income, operating income and margin, operating EBITDA and margin, and earnings per diluted share improved when compared to the third quarter of 2015. And during the third quarter, we achieved a significant milestone as our operating EBITDA exceeded $1 billion for the first time. 
We earned $0.84 per share in the third quarter, an increase of 13.5% from our third quarter 2015 results. Our continued growth in earnings translated into strong generation of cash flow from operations, which grew $96 million in the third quarter and drove year-to-date cash from operations to over $2.2 billion. That's almost a 12% increase over last year. So we're very pleased with the momentum that we've built in the first 3 quarters of the year, which we expect to continue into the fourth quarter and extend it to 2017. 
Our pricing programs are significant reason for our earnings growth and margin expansion. For the third quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.7%, and collection and disposal yield was 2.1% with total company yield at 2.6%. Core price improved 70 basis points from the third quarter of 2015. Core price in the industrial line was 8.6%. In the commercial line, it was 7%. And in both our landfill and residential lines, it was 2.6%. 
Importantly, we demonstrated our continued ability to increase prices while retaining customers through improved customer service as our churn rate dropped to 8.7%. That's 170 basis points better than last year and 40 basis points better than the second quarter of 2016. This is the lowest churn that we've seen since before 2005. It's a tribute to our customer service and operations folks who work together to create a better customer experience. 
With respect to volumes. We continue to see positive volume growth in the third quarter just as we have all year. In the quarter, we saw volumes in our high-margin commercial, industrial and landfill lines of business continue to grow and we saw an improvement in the rate of decline of residential volumes. Our traditional solid waste volumes were positive 1.6% in the third quarter 2016, 170 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015 and an 80 basis point improvement sequentially from the the second quarter of 2016. And our overall volume was also a positive 1.6% as our national accounts and recycling segments contributed positively to volume growth in the quarter. 
Our entire team continues to execute on our strategy of maintaining price, adding high-margin business and improving customer service. And the results continue to impress. Our landfill line of business continues to show strong results too, which Jim will discuss in more details. However, as we previously mentioned, we've seen a significant increase in the cost of managing the liquid that occur on our landfill. In the third quarter of 2016, the increase in leachate costs was about $23 million or a drag of $0.03 per share. 
We continue to roll out our wastewater management charge to our landfill customers who are under long-term contracts. However, the charge is fully implemented on our spot customers. So in the third quarter, we added approximately 0.2% to landfill yield from implementing the charge with almost no pushback. However, we still have a long way to go before we can recover the full cost. It's important that we pass the cost increases on to our customers, so that we can achieve an appropriate return on investment on our landfill assets. But just like when we implemented the fuel surcharge, it will take time to fully implement this charge. 
Turning to recycling. We saw a 13.6% increase in average commodity prices at our recycling facilities for the quarter and a 0.9% increase in volumes. Year-over-year, the recycling line of business contributed almost $0.03 per share to earnings, which helped to offset the $0.03 of increase of leachate costs. The improvement in earnings was driven by about $0.01 from pricing and about $0.02 from operational improvements at our recycling plants and our continued efforts to improve our contracts. 
On the operational side. Our recycling employees have been a nice job on improving operational efficiencies such as reducing downtime events through preventive maintenance practices, educating customers about contamination and charging for contamination overages. This led to gross operating expenses improving 4.5% in the third quarter. And on the contract side. We continued to work with customers on more fair contract terms to allow Waste Management to remain their recycling partner and provide us with a sustainable business model. 
So we're very pleased with our third quarter results as well as our results through the first 9 months of 2016. We are proud of the hard work all of our employees have done to date, it caused us to exceed our expectations for yield, volume, earnings and cash flow generation. Consequently, we are again raising our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance for 2016. We are confident that we can achieve consensus for the fourth quarter, which would put us at $2.91 of EPS for the full year. 
Cash flow continues to be strong and we remain confident that we can achieve our free cash flow guidance for 2016 of between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion. As we move towards the end of the year, we will do what we have done in the past few years where we estimate full year cash flow and determine if we want to prepay up the $100 million of our 2017 capital spend or taxes. I want to thank all of our team members for demonstrating, once again, why they are the best in the business. 
I will now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our third quarter results in more detail."

The third quarter was indeed another strong quarter for us. Revenues in the quarter were  $3.55 billion, an increase of $188 million or 5.6% when compared to the third quarter of 2015.

Revenues in the quarter were  $3.55 billion, an increase of $188 million or 5.6% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. We saw $110 million increase in our collection and disposal business from the combined impacts of pricing and volume, a $60 million increase in revenues from acquisitions net of divestitures and recycling revenues increased $27 million. These increases were partially offset by an $11 million decline related to lower fuel surcharge revenues. Foreign currency fluctuations had no material impact on revenues compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
Looking at internal revenue growth for the company. In the third quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.7% and yield was 2.1% with total volumes improving 1.6%. Volumes were positive for the third consecutive quarter. The combined positive price and cost of volume led to total company income operations growing $65 million, operating income margin expanding 90 basis points to 18.8%, operating EBITDA growing $71 million and operating EBITDA margin growing 50 basis points to 28.2%. 
Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefits of improving volume. Industrial volume was up 1.9% in the third quarter, a 150 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015 and a 40 basis point improvement, sequentially. Commercial line of business showed strong momentum with volumes up 1.2% in the third quarter, a 250 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015 and a 90 basis point improvement from the second quarter 2016. While our residential business lines were down 2.9% in the third quarter, this reflected a 70 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015 and a 60 basis point improvement, sequentially, from second quarter. Overall, our collection income from operations grew $26 million and EBITDA grew $38 million in the third quarter. 
In the landfill line of business. We, again, saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive yield in the third quarter, just as we saw the first and second quarters of this year. Total landfill volumes increased 6.9%, MSW volume grew 6.1%, C&D volume grew 22%, and combined special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes grew 6.7%. More than half of the growth of C&D was due to the storm cleanup in Louisiana, but underlying trends remain strong. We achieved core price of 2.6%, an increase of 30 basis points from the third quarter of 2015. The combined positive price and volume in the landfill line of business led to income from operations and EBITDA, each growing $12 million in the third quarter. 
Moving now to operating expenses. As a percent of revenue, this expenses increased to 10 basis points to 62.5%. For the third quarter, operating expenses increased $121 million when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Landfill operating cost represented the largest increase, up $29 million. $23 million of the $29 million increase were the increased leachate costs, which equated to 60 basis points as a percent of revenue. 
The remainder of the operating cost dollar increase related primarily to our increased volumes and costs from acquired operations, with labor costs increasing $28 million, cost of goods sold increasing $25 million and subcontractor costs increasing $22 million. These increases were partially offset by savings from lower fuel costs. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect to see operating expense margin improvements as we add wastewater treatment capacity and as our increased fuel per fleet purchases and MSDO [ph] initiative begin to positively impact maintenance costs. 
For the third quarter, as a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 9.3%, an improvement of 50 basis points when compared to the third quarter of 2015. On a dollar basis, SG&A costs were $330 million, a slight improvement compared to 2015. We've done a nice job controlling SG&A costs as increases in wages and compensation have been offset by other improvements. 
Turning to cash flow for the third quarter. Cash provided by operating activities was $753 million compared to $657 million in the third quarter of 2015. Our operations continue to perform very well as cash flow was driven largely by an operating EBITDA increase of $71 million. During the third quarter, we spent $333 million on capital expenditures, a decrease of $2 million when compared to the third quarter 2015. Through the first 9 months of 2016, we have spent $962 million on capital expenditures, an increase of $98 million when compared to the first 9 months of 2015. We still expect that capital expenditures will be between $1.4 billion and $1.45 billion for the full year 2016. 
In the third quarter, we had $8 million in proceeds from divested assets, a decrease of $28 million from the prior year quarter. Combined, we generated $428 million of free cash flow, a $70 million increase compared to the third quarter of 2015. Year-to-date, we have achieved free cash flow of $1.28 billion. We remain confident in achieving our full year 2016 free cash flow guidance of between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion. 
In the third quarter, we paid $182 million in dividends to our shareholders. While we didn't repurchase any shares during the third quarter, we currently planned to start buying back our stock again in the fourth quarter when the window opens. We expect that these late 2016 and early 2017 repurchases will allow us to completely offset the 2017 dilution impacts of our equity compensation plans. 
Finally, looking at our other financial metrics. At the end of the third quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio measured based on our bank covenants was 2.56 and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.17%. The floating rate portion of our debt portfolio was 13% at the end of the quarter. The effective tax rate was 33.7% in the third quarter. Adjusting for the impairments, the tax rate was 33.5%. We still expect that our full year as adjusted tax rate will be approximately 35%. 
In summary, year-to-date 2016 has been a very successful year driven by the exceptional performance of our employees. I want to thank them for their efforts through the first 9 months. I know they're working hard to improve our operational and financial performance for the remainder of 2016 and into 2017, and we are confident that they will be successful.
And with that, Karnissia, let's open the line for questions."

We, obviously, can't look out a number of years, but we've said very often that the best indicator for our business is new housing starts. And as you know, we've been running a deficit on new housing starts in the United States since 2009. So we still haven't gotten to the point where we're meeting annual demand for new housing starts. And so everything I've seen says that, that's going to continue to be strong through 2020. Now obviously, you saw there are some labor challenges in the housing market, but once those get evened out, I think you're going to start to see those new housing starts move up from that 1.1 million to 1.2 million, to sort of the 1.4 million to 1.5 million, and you can run at that rate for a good 3 to 4 years before you actually catch up with demand. So -- and following those new housing starts, you'll see commercial businesses come in. And so we see the commercial business remaining strong. And then I think our other lines of business like our industrial and our oilfield services, I think oilfield services has bottomed out, we should see a recovery. I don't think that will be a huge robust recovery in 2017, but I think we'll see a good steady recovery over the next couple of years. So absent any big political event or big regulatory event, I would expect that we'll see -- continue to see good volume growth over the next few years."

Our pricing programs, quite frankly, have always been premised on providing better customer service. I always use the cable model, right? We all get an offer to get lower cable or lower TV service once a week. We'll get something that will promise us a lower price, but we don't switch because the pain of switching is high and the cost differential is not dramatic. And so you've got to keep that good customer service because you don't change your TV provider until you start having service issues. And that's when you take those lower-priced offers and [ph] say, I'm going to listen to these and actually get this done. So customer service is pivotal to the long-term sustainability of our pricing programs and I would say it's 2 things that really drive it. One is technology. I mean, the use of technology, the use of data. And I would tell you and that we're probably in sort of the second or third inning. But the more important part of customer service is making sure that our customers service folks, our sales folks and our operations folks are all working hand in hand to make sure that we give a great customer experience. And frankly, that's where we've made a lot of progress over the last 2 years. Jim Trevathan and his team have done a phenomenal job of creating better connections between our sales folks, our customer service folks and our operations folks to make sure that we're all driving to the same goals. So yes, it can go lower. Probably about 4% to 5% of that churn is systemic, people going out of business, moving businesses, different things like that.

And we rolled out in the last year some very specific tools that help us provide for our largest customers some online and real-time information that helps them manage their business more aggressively. And it's led us, as Dave and Jim mentioned earlier, it's led us to grow national account revenue in total this year where that's -- it's been a negative drag on our volume in previous years. So we're trying to differentiate that service offering very specifically. The other thing without getting into any specific metrics, and it ties to exactly what Dave said, we've added some operating metrics that tied directly to service to our customers rather than just that internal efficiency look. And that's really helped us focus on the right things as we think to add that specific value. I guess the last thing I'd mention there is that we've gotten much more aggressive in the process of how we handle service challenges with our customers. Occasionally we fail, and when we do, we want to correct it quickly and adequately. But we also want to make sure that we renew contracts every opportunity we get, so we've added several process changes that led us renew those agreements once an issue, either positive or negative, happen. And I think it's added to that decreasing churn number."

So if we think about finishing '16 with about 3 6 5 [ph] in EBITDA, and then you back out CapEx, kind of in the middle of that range that I gave on earlier, so back out CapEx of $1.425 billion less kind of the sum of interest taxes and working capital of about $650 million.

But in the last 2 years, we've actually prepaid some cash taxes. 2 years ago, we prepaid $200 million and last year, we prepaid $150 million.

When you look at the margin expansion, I think that we still have that 50 to 100 basis point, and let's spend -- so when we look at 2017, we would probably expect to not get a big benefit from recycling even though we've seen commodity prices up. We've been bitten by that before. And so when we put together our plan, we probably won't expect to get a large benefit from recycling. So that won't contribute to the margin. Obviously, we've got this leap shade expense, which will restrain the margin. But what we need to do is get efficiency gains by adding route density. We need to get more dollars of price as we see the construction season, beginning next year and we need to do, I think a better job of planning for the construction season and meeting the increased demand that we would expect to see. And to me, that's what's going to drive the margin. Obviously, the gyms and other operations folks keep a great eye on SG&A. And as you revenue go up, obviously, we pick up basis points there because we'll hold SG&A relatively flat. And so I think that 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion next year, sort of comes probably 40% from SG&A and about 60% from the operating side."

Now we move in the back half of the year and I think we said on the first 2 quarter conference calls, that it will probably abate in the second half of the year between CPI and mix, that we would see it come down closer to that too. But when I look at pricing increasingly, we're looking at core price not yield because yield has those mix issues in it. Yield has some of the CPI issues in it. But core price is the actual dollars that we're putting on the street and holding onto and pricing. And as you saw, that was up 70 basis points this quarter. What we've said is we think core price should be at that sort of 4% number, year in and year out. We'd expect that to continue. So if we continue to get that 4% core price, 4% plus core price, yield should continue at around 2%. But we're not going to get too worked up over a few basis points of movement here or there based on CPI or on mix."

I mean, there's 2 things really that are potential headwinds for us and then we overcome those with the growth of the business. Those 2 things, as you mentioned, one is cash taxes, the other is CapEx. And right now, it looks like CapEx for '17, could be higher. We've had a couple of projects that we originally had in '16 that's why our range has come down a little bit. We were originally $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. We're now $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion, so we've brought the top end of the range down by $50 million and that's just simply because of the government projects that we had originally thought would show up in '16, look like that they will show up in '17. So none of it is -- do we feel like we can't overcome. But those are the 2 things that work against us a little bit in '17."

And we look at bonus depreciation, we look at how do we kind of smooth CapEx a little bit. And so as we think about CapEx, though I really maybe to answer your question this way. We've said all along that we thought CapEx should fall in the 9% to 10% of revenue range. In 2014, it was below that. It was in the 8s. 2015, it was just above 9, kind of like 9.1. And 2016, it's going to be closer to 10. But we'd still think in '17 and on a go-forward basis that, that range of 9% to 10% is a healthy range. It's a good range for us. Keep in mind that if you look at things like lead purchases in 2012, 2013, I think 2012, we bought around 900 to 950 vehicles. We're going to buy 1,300 vehicles this year. So when we think about OpEx as we talked about that a little earlier, eventually, that has to start affecting our maintenance cost as we increase the number of trucks that we buy by almost 40%. Hopefully, that answers your question."

As we look at it, I think the number that we've always said it's about 25% to 35% of our customers are on some type of modified index whether it's a particular line is index or index for us, or a government index like the wastewater sewage. That's one where like a lot of things we do, you have to have sort of an industry backing, right? I mean, look, too many times we see -- I'll go back to the recycling business. Too many times, we saw a lot of people bid rational contracts like we do then one party comes in and say, we'll do it under the old type of contract. And before you know, they're winning business and losing money. And I would tell you, we haven't seen as much sort of industry acceptance of a different CPI base residential or franchise type model. We have not seen widespread enough acceptance to move the needle. I mean, when fitters go in and say we're going to bid on our modified CPI than the fourth a bidder comes in and says we'll take whatever you have on the table, it's hard to see things change. And so we've had better success in our large franchise areas like California. But I think that's going to be a long slow slug that we just have to -- there's only one thing we can do at Waste Management, and that's stiffing our backbone and say we're not going to bid these contracts would've thought good for our business. We've proven that on the recycling side. We need to continue to have that same type of firm backbone on the residential franchise side. And Tony, you've seen it that's why our residential volume has paid and long-term basis with our return on invested capital. There's a real focus and we're not just going to take business long-term. It doesn't give us the ability to manage our cost structure but also get some margin improvement."

Before we get started, please note that we have filed a Form 8-K this morning that includes the earnings press release, and is available on our website at www.wm.com. The Form 8-K, the press release and the schedules to the press release include important information. 
During the call, you will hear forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations, projections or opinions about future periods. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in today's press release and in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K. David and Jim will discuss our results in the areas of yield and volume which, unless otherwise stated, are more specifically references to internal revenue growth, or IRG, from yield or volume. 
During the call, David and Jim will also discuss our earnings per diluted share, which they may refer to as EPS, or earnings per share. And Jim and David will address operating EBITDA and operating EBITDA margin, as defined in the earnings press release. Any comparison, unless otherwise stated, will be with the third quarter of 2015. The third quarter of 2016 results have been adjusted to enhance comparability by excluding certain items that management believes do not reflect our fundamental business performance or results of operations. These adjusted measures, in addition to free cash flow, are non-GAAP measures.

190694,403160531,1061805,"Waste Management, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. Our third quarter results exceeded our internal expectations. As we have all year, we saw improving volumes, strong execution of our pricing programs and continued traction in our cost programs. Each of our net i",991,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. Our third quarter results exceeded our internal expectations. As we have all year, we saw improving volumes, strong execution of our pricing programs and continued traction in our cost programs. Each of our net income, operating income and margin, operating EBITDA and margin, and earnings per diluted share improved when compared to the third quarter of 2015. And during the third quarter, we achieved a significant milestone as our operating EBITDA exceeded $1 billion for the first time. 
We earned $0.84 per share in the third quarter, an increase of 13.5% from our third quarter 2015 results. Our continued growth in earnings translated into strong generation of cash flow from operations, which grew $96 million in the third quarter and drove year-to-date cash from operations to over $2.2 billion. That's almost a 12% increase over last year. So we're very pleased with the momentum that we've built in the first 3 quarters of the year, which we expect to continue into the fourth quarter and extend it to 2017. 
Our pricing programs are significant reason for our earnings growth and margin expansion. For the third quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.7%, and collection and disposal yield was 2.1% with total company yield at 2.6%. Core price improved 70 basis points from the third quarter of 2015. Core price in the industrial line was 8.6%. In the commercial line, it was 7%. And in both our landfill and residential lines, it was 2.6%. 
Importantly, we demonstrated our continued ability to increase prices while retaining customers through improved customer service as our churn rate dropped to 8.7%. That's 170 basis points better than last year and 40 basis points better than the second quarter of 2016. This is the lowest churn that we've seen since before 2005. It's a tribute to our customer service and operations folks who work together to create a better customer experience. 
With respect to volumes. We continue to see positive volume growth in the third quarter just as we have all year. In the quarter, we saw volumes in our high-margin commercial, industrial and landfill lines of business continue to grow and we saw an improvement in the rate of decline of residential volumes. Our traditional solid waste volumes were positive 1.6% in the third quarter 2016, 170 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015 and an 80 basis point improvement sequentially from the second quarter of 2016. And our overall volume was also a positive 1.6% as our national accounts and recycling segments contributed positively to volume growth in the quarter. 
Our entire team continues to execute on our strategy of maintaining price, adding high-margin business and improving customer service. And the results continue to impress. Our landfill line of business continues to show strong results too, which Jim will discuss in more details. However, as we previously mentioned, we've seen a significant increase in the cost of managing the liquid that occur on our landfill. In the third quarter of 2016, the increase in leachate costs was about $23 million or a drag of $0.03 per share. 
We continue to roll out our wastewater management charge to our landfill customers who are under long-term contracts. However, the charge is fully implemented on our spot customers. So in the third quarter, we added approximately 0.2% to landfill yield from implementing the charge with almost no pushback. However, we still have a long way to go before we can recover the full cost. It's important that we pass the cost increases on to our customers, so that we can achieve an appropriate return on investment on our landfill assets. But just like when we implemented the fuel surcharge, it will take time to fully implement this charge. 
Turning to recycling. We saw a 13.6% increase in average commodity prices at our recycling facilities for the quarter and a 0.9% increase in volumes. Year-over-year, the recycling line of business contributed almost $0.03 per share to earnings, which helped to offset the $0.03 of increase of leachate costs. The improvement in earnings was driven by about $0.01 from pricing and about $0.02 from operational improvements at our recycling plants and our continued efforts to improve our contracts. 
On the operational side. Our recycling employees have been a nice job on improving operational efficiencies such as reducing downtime events through preventive maintenance practices, educating customers about contamination and charging for contamination overages. This led to gross operating expenses improving 4.5% in the third quarter. And on the contract side. We continued to work with customers on more fair contract terms to allow Waste Management to remain their recycling partner and provide us with a sustainable business model. 
So we're very pleased with our third quarter results as well as our results through the first 9 months of 2016. We are proud of the hard work all of our employees have done to date, it caused us to exceed our expectations for yield, volume, earnings and cash flow generation. Consequently, we are again raising our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance for 2016. We are confident that we can achieve consensus for the fourth quarter, which would put us at $2.91 of EPS for the full year. 
Cash flow continues to be strong and we remain confident that we can achieve our free cash flow guidance for 2016 of between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion. As we move towards the end of the year, we will do what we have done in the past few years where we estimate full year cash flow and determine if we want to prepay up the $100 million of our 2017 capital spend or taxes. I want to thank all of our team members for demonstrating, once again, why they are the best in the business. 
I will now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our third quarter results in more detail."

The third quarter was indeed another strong quarter for us. Revenues in the quarter were  $3.55 billion, an increase of $188 million or 5.6% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. We saw $110 million increase in our collection and disp",1062,"Thanks, David. The third quarter was indeed another strong quarter for us. Revenues in the quarter were  $3.55 billion, an increase of $188 million or 5.6% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. We saw $110 million increase in our collection and disposal business from the combined impacts of pricing and volume, a $60 million increase in revenues from acquisitions net of divestitures and recycling revenues increased $27 million. These increases were partially offset by an $11 million decline related to lower fuel surcharge revenues. Foreign currency fluctuations had no material impact on revenues compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
Looking at internal revenue growth for the company. In the third quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.7% and yield was 2.1% with total volumes improving 1.6%. Volumes were positive for the third consecutive quarter. The combined positive price and cost of volume led to total company income operations growing $65 million, operating income margin expanding 90 basis points to 18.8%, operating EBITDA growing $71 million and operating EBITDA margin growing 50 basis points to 28.2%. 
Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefits of improving volume. Industrial volume was up 1.9% in the third quarter, a 150 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015 and a 40 basis point improvement, sequentially. Commercial line of business showed strong momentum with volumes up 1.2% in the third quarter, a 250 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015 and a 90 basis point improvement from the second quarter 2016. While our residential business lines were down 2.9% in the third quarter, this reflected a 70 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015 and a 60 basis point improvement, sequentially, from second quarter. Overall, our collection income from operations grew $26 million and EBITDA grew $38 million in the third quarter. 
In the landfill line of business. We, again, saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive yield in the third quarter, just as we saw the first and second quarters of this year. Total landfill volumes increased 6.9%, MSW volume grew 6.1%, C&D volume grew 22%, and combined special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes grew 6.7%. More than half of the growth of C&D was due to the storm cleanup in Louisiana, but underlying trends remain strong. We achieved core price of 2.6%, an increase of 30 basis points from the third quarter of 2015. The combined positive price and volume in the landfill line of business led to income from operations and EBITDA, each growing $12 million in the third quarter. 
Moving now to operating expenses. As a percent of revenue, this expenses increased to 10 basis points to 62.5%. For the third quarter, operating expenses increased $121 million when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Landfill operating cost represented the largest increase, up $29 million. $23 million of the $29 million increase were the increased leachate costs, which equated to 60 basis points as a percent of revenue. 
The remainder of the operating cost dollar increase related primarily to our increased volumes and costs from acquired operations, with labor costs increasing $28 million, cost of goods sold increasing $25 million and subcontractor costs increasing $22 million. These increases were partially offset by savings from lower fuel costs. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect to see operating expense margin improvements as we add wastewater treatment capacity and as our increased fuel per fleet purchases and MSDO initiative begin to positively impact maintenance costs. 
For the third quarter, as a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 9.3%, an improvement of 50 basis points when compared to the third quarter of 2015. On a dollar basis, SG&A costs were $330 million, a slight improvement compared to 2015. We've done a nice job controlling SG&A costs as increases in wages and compensation have been offset by other improvements. 
Turning to cash flow for the third quarter. Cash provided by operating activities was $753 million compared to $657 million in the third quarter of 2015. Our operations continue to perform very well as cash flow was driven largely by an operating EBITDA increase of $71 million. During the third quarter, we spent $333 million on capital expenditures, a decrease of $2 million when compared to the third quarter 2015. Through the first 9 months of 2016, we have spent $962 million on capital expenditures, an increase of $98 million when compared to the first 9 months of 2015. We still expect that capital expenditures will be between $1.4 billion and $1.45 billion for the full year 2016. 
In the third quarter, we had $8 million in proceeds from divested assets, a decrease of $28 million from the prior year quarter. Combined, we generated $428 million of free cash flow, a $70 million increase compared to the third quarter of 2015. Year-to-date, we have achieved free cash flow of $1.28 billion. We remain confident in achieving our full year 2016 free cash flow guidance of between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion. 
In the third quarter, we paid $182 million in dividends to our shareholders. While we didn't repurchase any shares during the third quarter, we currently planned to start buying back our stock again in the fourth quarter when the window opens. We expect that these late 2016 and early 2017 repurchases will allow us to completely offset the 2017 dilution impacts of our equity compensation plans. 
Finally, looking at our other financial metrics. At the end of the third quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio measured based on our bank covenants was 2.56 and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.17%. The floating rate portion of our debt portfolio was 13% at the end of the quarter. The effective tax rate was 33.7% in the third quarter. Adjusting for the impairments, the tax rate was 33.5%. We still expect that our full year as adjusted tax rate will be approximately 35%. 
In summary, year-to-date 2016 has been a very successful year driven by the exceptional performance of our employees. I want to thank them for their efforts through the first 9 months. I know they're working hard to improve our operational and financial performance for the remainder of 2016 and into 2017, and we are confident that they will be successful.

We, obviously, can't look out a number of years, but we've said very often that the best indicator for our business is new housing starts. And as you know, we've been running a deficit on new housing starts in the United States since 2009. So we still haven't gotten to the point where we're meeting annual demand for new housing starts. And so everything I've seen says that, that's going to continue to be strong through 2020. Now obviously, you saw there are some labor challenges in the housing market, but once those get evened out, I think you're going to start to see those new housing starts move up from that 1.1 million to 1.2 million, to sort of the 1.4 million to 1.5 million, and you can run at that rate for a good 3 to 4 years before you actually catch up with demand. So -- and following those new housing starts, you'll see commercial businesses come in. And so we see the commercial business remaining strong. And then I think our other lines of business like our industrial and our oilfield services, I think oilfield services has bottomed out, we should see a recovery. I don't think that will be a huge robust recovery in 2017, but I think we'll see a good steady recovery over the next couple of years. So absent any big political event or big regulatory event, I would expect that we'll see -- continue to see good volume growth over the next few years."

Our pricing programs, quite frankly, have always been premised on providing better customer service. I always use the cable model, right? We all get an offer to get lower cable or lower TV service once a week. We'll get something that will promise us a lower price, but we don't switch because the pain of switching is high and the cost differential is not dramatic. And so you've got to keep that good customer service because you don't change your TV provider until you start having service issues. And that's when you take those lower-priced offers and you say, I'm going to listen to these and actually get this done. So customer service is pivotal to the long-term sustainability of our pricing programs and I would say it's 2 things that really drive it. One is technology. I mean, the use of technology, the use of data. And I would tell you and that we're probably in sort of the second or third inning. But the more important part of customer service is making sure that our customers service folks, our sales folks and our operations folks are all working hand in hand to make sure that we give a great customer experience. And frankly, that's where we've made a lot of progress over the last 2 years. Jim Trevathan and his team have done a phenomenal job of creating better connections between our sales folks, our customer service folks and our operations folks to make sure that we're all driving to the same goals. So yes, it can go lower. Probably about 4% to 5% of that churn is systemic, people going out of business, moving businesses, different things like that.

And we rolled out in the last year some very specific tools that help us provide for our largest customers some online and real-time information that helps them manage their business more aggressively. And it's led us, as Dave and Jim mentioned earlier, it's led us to grow national account revenue in total this year where that's -- it's been a negative drag on our volume in previous years. So we're trying to differentiate that service offering very specifically. The other thing without getting into any specific metrics, and it ties to exactly what Dave said, we've added some operating metrics that tied directly to service to our customers rather than just that internal efficiency look. And that's really helped us focus on the right things as we think to add that specific value. I guess the last thing I'd mention there is that we've gotten much more aggressive in the process of how we handle service challenges with our customers. Occasionally we fail, and when we do, we want to correct it quickly and adequately. But we also want to make sure that we renew contracts every opportunity we get, so we've added several process changes that led us renew those agreements once an issue, either positive or negative, happen. And I think it's added to that decreasing churn number."

So if we think about finishing '16 with about 3 6 5 [ph] in EBITDA, and then you back out CapEx kind of in the middle of that range that I gave earlier, so back out CapEx of $1.425 billion less kind of the sum of interest taxes and working capital of about $650 million and then you add in proceeds, and you're right, proceeds are kind of a small number this year compared to prior years, but adding proceeds of about $50 million, and that puts you at about 1 6 2 5 [ph] finishing point for 2016. And then in order to get to a kind of a new normal, you probably have to kind of normalize cash taxes a bit. We haven't decided exactly what we're going do. But in the last 2 years, we've actually prepaid some cash taxes. 2 years ago, we prepaid $200 million and last year we prepaid $150 million. And as we said when we did it, it was really in an effort to try and kind of smooth out cash a little bit so we don't have these big lumps. But we'll look at that as we get to the end of the year and to the extent that we're kind of over the top of that low end of the range, maybe look to prepay some cash taxes in December."

You saw that in a little bit of the compression in the operating margin, although it would move forward, it was smaller than previous quarters.

We've been bitten by that before. And so when we put together our plan, we probably won't expect to get a large benefit from recycling so that won't contribute to the margin. Obviously, we've got this leachate expense which will restrain the margin. But what we need to do is get efficiency gains by adding route density. We need to get more dollars of price as we see the construction season beginning next year and we need to do, I think, a better job of planning for the construction season and meeting the increased demand that we would expect to see. And to me, that's what's going to drive the margin. Obviously, the Jims and our other operations folks keep a great eye on SG&A. And as you see, revenue go up. Obviously, we picked up basis points there because we'll hold SG&A relatively flat. And so I think that 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion next year, sort of comes probably 40% from SG&A and about 60% from the operating side."

But when I look at pricing, increasingly, we're looking at core price not yield because yield has those mix issues in it. Yield has some of the CPI issues in it. But core price is the actual dollars that we're putting out on the street and holding on to in pricing. And as you saw, that was up 70 basis points this quarter. What we've said is that we think core price should be sort of that 4% number, year in and year out. We'd expect that to continue. And so if we can -- we continue to get that 4% core price, 4% plus core price, yield should continue at around 2%.

And we looked at bonus depreciation. We looked at how do we kind of smooth CapEx a little bit. And so as we think about CapEx, so really maybe to answer your question this way, we've said all along that we thought CapEx should fall in the 9% to 10% of revenue range. In 2014, it was below that. It was in the 8s. 2015, it was just above 9%, kind of like 9.1%. And 2016, it's going to be closer to 10%. But we'd still think in '17 and on a go-forward basis that, that range of 9% to 10% is a healthy range. It's a good range for us. Keep in mind that if you look at things like lead purchases in 2012, 2013, I think 2012, we bought around 900 to 950 vehicles. We're going to buy 1,300 vehicles this year. So when we think about OpEx, and we talked about a little earlier, eventually, that has to start affecting our maintenance costs as we've increased the number of trucks that we buy by almost 40%.

Too many times we saw a lot of people bid rational contracts like we do then one party comes in and says we'll do it under the old type of contract. And before you know it, they're winning business and losing money. And I would tell you, we haven't seen as much sort of industry acceptance of a different CPI based residential or franchise-type model. We have not seen widespread enough acceptance to move the needle. I mean, when fitters go in and say we're going to bid on a modified CPI and then the fourth bidder comes in and says we'll take whatever you have on the table, it's hard to see things change. And so we've had better success in our large franchise areas like California, but I think that's going to be a long slow slug that we just have to -- there's only one thing we can do at Waste Management, and that's stiffen our backbone and say we're not going to bid these contracts when it's not good for our business.

During the call, you will hear forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations, projections or opinions about future periods. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in today's press release and in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K. David and Jim will discuss our results in the areas of yield and volume which, unless otherwise stated, are more specifically references to internal revenue growth, or IRG, from yield or volume. 
During the call, David and Jim will also discuss our earnings per diluted share, which they may refer to as EPS, or earnings per share. And Jim and David will address operating EBITDA and operating EBITDA margin, as defined in the earnings press release. Any comparison, unless otherwise stated, will be with the third quarter of 2015. The third quarter of 2016 results have been adjusted to enhance comparability by excluding certain items that management believes do not reflect our fundamental business performance or results of operations. These adjusted measures, in addition to free cash flow, are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the earnings press release footnote and schedules, which can be found on the company's website at www.wm.com for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures.

Our third quarter results exceeded our internal expectations. As we have all year, we saw improving volumes, strong execution of our pricing programs and continued traction in our cost programs. Each of our net i",991,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. Our third quarter results exceeded our internal expectations. As we have all year, we saw improving volumes, strong execution of our pricing programs and continued traction in our cost programs. Each of our net income, operating income and margin, operating EBITDA and margin, and earnings per diluted share improved when compared to the third quarter of 2015. And during the third quarter, we achieved a significant milestone as our operating EBITDA exceeded $1 billion for the first time. 
We earned $0.84 per share in the third quarter, an increase of 13.5% from our third quarter 2015 results. Our continued growth in earnings translated into strong generation of cash flow from operations, which grew $96 million in the third quarter and drove year-to-date cash from operations to over $2.2 billion. That's almost a 12% increase over last year. So we're very pleased with the momentum that we've built in the first 3 quarters of the year, which we expect to continue into the fourth quarter and extend it to 2017. 
Our pricing programs are significant reason for our earnings growth and margin expansion. For the third quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.7%, and collection and disposal yield was 2.1% with total company yield at 2.6%. Core price improved 70 basis points from the third quarter of 2015. Core price in the industrial line was 8.6%. In the commercial line, it was 7%. And in both our landfill and residential lines, it was 2.6%. 
Importantly, we demonstrated our continued ability to increase prices while retaining customers through improved customer service as our churn rate dropped to 8.7%. That's 170 basis points better than last year and 40 basis points better than the second quarter of 2016. This is the lowest churn that we've seen since before 2005. It's a tribute to our customer service and operations folks who work together to create a better customer experience. 
With respect to volumes. We continued to see positive volume growth in the third quarter just as we have all year. In the quarter, we saw volumes in our high-margin commercial, industrial and landfill lines of business continue to grow and we saw an improvement in the rate of decline of residential volumes. Our traditional solid waste volumes were positive 1.6% in the third quarter 2016, 170 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015 and an 80 basis point improvement sequentially from the second quarter of 2016. And our overall volume was also a positive 1.6% as our national accounts and recycling segments contributed positively to volume growth in the quarter. 
Our entire team continues to execute on our strategy of maintaining price, adding high-margin business and improving customer service. And the results continue to impress. Our landfill line of business continues to show strong results too, which Jim will discuss in more detail. However, as we previously mentioned, we've seen a significant increase in the cost of managing the liquid that occur on our landfills. In the third quarter of 2016, the increase in leachate costs was about $23 million or a drag of $0.03 per share. 
We continue to roll out our wastewater management charge to our landfill customers who are under long-term contracts. However, the charge is fully implemented on our spot customers. So in the third quarter, we added approximately 0.2% to landfill yield from implementing the charge with almost no pushback. However, we still have a long way to go before we can recover the full cost. It's important that we pass the cost increases on to our customers, so that we can achieve an appropriate return on investment on our landfill assets. But just like when we implemented the fuel surcharge, it will take time to fully implement this charge. 
Turning to recycling. We saw a 13.6% increase in average commodity prices at our recycling facilities for the quarter and a 0.9% increase in volumes. Year-over-year, the recycling line of business contributed almost $0.03 per share to earnings, which helped to offset the $0.03 of increase of leachate costs. The improvement in earnings was driven by about $0.01 from pricing and about $0.02 from operational improvements at our recycling plants and our continued efforts to improve our contracts. 
On the operational side. Our recycling employees have been a nice job on improving operational efficiencies such as reducing downtime events through preventive maintenance practices, educating customers about contamination and charging for contamination overages. This led to gross operating expenses improving 4.5% in the third quarter. And on the contract side. We continued to work with customers on more fair contract terms to allow Waste Management to remain their recycling partner and provide us with a sustainable business model. 
So we're very pleased with our third quarter results as well as our results through the first 9 months of 2016. We are proud of the hard work all of our employees have done to date to cause us to exceed our expectations for yield, volume, earnings and cash flow generation. Consequently, we are again raising our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance for 2016. We are confident that we can achieve consensus for the fourth quarter, which would put us at $2.91 of EPS for the full year. 
Cash flow continues to be strong and we remain confident that we can achieve our free cash flow guidance for 2016 of between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion. As we move towards the end of the year, we will do what we have done in the past few years where we estimate full year cash flow and determine if we want to prepay up the $100 million of our 2017 capital spend or taxes. I want to thank all of our team members for demonstrating, once again, why they are the best in the business. 
I will now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our third quarter results in more detail."

The third quarter was indeed another strong quarter for us. Revenues in the quarter were  $3.55 billion, an increase of $188 million or 5.6% when compared to the third quarter of 2015.

Revenues in the quarter were  $3.55 billion, an increase of $188 million or 5.6% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. We saw $110 million increase in our collection and disposal business from the combined impacts of pricing and volume, a $60 million increase in revenues from acquisitions net of divestitures and recycling revenues increased $27 million. These increases were partially offset by an $11 million decline related to lower fuel surcharge revenues. Foreign currency fluctuations had no material impact on revenues compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
Looking at internal revenue growth for the company. In the third quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.7% and yield was 2.1% with total volumes improving 1.6%. Volumes were positive for the third consecutive quarter. The combined positive price and cost of volume led to total company income operations growing $65 million, operating income margin expanding 90 basis points to 18.8%, operating EBITDA growing $71 million and operating EBITDA margin growing 50 basis points to 28.2%. 
Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefits of improving volume. Industrial volume was up 1.9% in the third quarter, a 150 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015 and a 40 basis point improvement, sequentially. Commercial line of business showed strong momentum with volumes up 1.2% in the third quarter, a 250 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015 and a 90 basis point improvement from the second quarter 2016. While our residential business lines were down 2.9% in the third quarter, this reflected a 70 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015 and a 60 basis point improvement, sequentially, from second quarter. Overall, our collection income from operations grew $26 million and EBITDA grew $38 million in the third quarter. 
In the landfill line of business. We, again, saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive yield in the third quarter, just as we saw the first and second quarters of this year. Total landfill volumes increased 6.9%, MSW volume grew 6.1%, C&D volume grew 22%, and combined special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes grew 6.7%. More than half of the growth of C&D was due to the storm cleanup in Louisiana, but underlying trends remain strong. We achieved core price of 2.6%, an increase of 30 basis points from the third quarter of 2015. The combined positive price and volume in the landfill line of business led to income from operations and EBITDA, each growing $12 million in the third quarter. 
Moving now to operating expenses. As a percent of revenue, this expenses increased to 10 basis points to 62.5%. For the third quarter, operating expenses increased $121 million when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Landfill operating cost represented the largest increase, up $29 million. $23 million of the $29 million increase were the increased leachate costs, which equated to 60 basis points as a percent of revenue. 
The remainder of the operating cost dollar increase related primarily to our increased volumes and costs from acquired operations, with labor costs increasing $28 million, cost of goods sold increasing $25 million and subcontractor costs increasing $22 million. These increases were partially offset by savings from lower fuel costs. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect to see operating expense margin improvements as we add wastewater treatment capacity and as our increased fuel per fleet purchases and MSDO initiative begin to positively impact maintenance costs. 
For the third quarter, as a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 9.3%, an improvement of 50 basis points when compared to the third quarter of 2015. On a dollar basis, SG&A costs were $330 million, a slight improvement compared to 2015. We've done a nice job controlling SG&A costs as increases in wages and compensation have been offset by other improvements. 
Turning to cash flow for the third quarter. Cash provided by operating activities was $753 million compared to $657 million in the third quarter of 2015. Our operations continue to perform very well as cash flow was driven largely by an operating EBITDA increase of $71 million. During the third quarter, we spent $333 million on capital expenditures, a decrease of $2 million when compared to the third quarter 2015. Through the first 9 months of 2016, we have spent $962 million on capital expenditures, an increase of $98 million when compared to the first 9 months of 2015. We still expect that capital expenditures will be between $1.4 billion and $1.45 billion for the full year 2016. 
In the third quarter, we had $8 million in proceeds from divested assets, a decrease of $28 million from the prior year quarter. Combined, we generated $428 million of free cash flow, a $70 million increase compared to the third quarter of 2015. Year-to-date, we have achieved free cash flow of $1.28 billion. We remain confident in achieving our full year 2016 free cash flow guidance of between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion. 
In the third quarter, we paid $182 million in dividends to our shareholders. While we didn't repurchase any shares during the third quarter, we currently planned to start buying back our stock again in the fourth quarter when the window opens. We expect that these late 2016 and early 2017 repurchases will allow us to completely offset the 2017 dilution impacts of our equity compensation plans. 
Finally, looking at our other financial metrics. At the end of the third quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio measured based on our bank covenants was 2.56 and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.17%. The floating rate portion of our debt portfolio was 13% at the end of the quarter. The effective tax rate was 33.7% in the third quarter. Adjusting for the impairments, the tax rate was 33.5%. We still expect that our full year as adjusted tax rate will be approximately 35%. 
In summary, year-to-date 2016 has been a very successful year driven by the exceptional performance of our employees. I want to thank them for their efforts through the first 9 months. I know they're working hard to improve our operational and financial performance for the remainder of 2016 and into 2017, and we are confident that they will be successful.
And with that, Karnissia, let's open the line for questions."

We, obviously, can't look out a number of years, but we've said very often that the best indicator for our business is new housing starts. And as you know, we've been running a deficit on new housing starts in the United States since 2009. So we still haven't gotten to the point where we're meeting annual demand for new housing starts. And so everything I've seen says that, that's going to continue to be strong through 2020. Now obviously, you saw there are some labor challenges in the housing market, but once those get evened out, I think you're going to start to see those new housing starts move up from that 1.1 million to 1.2 million, to sort of the 1.4 million to 1.5 million, and you can run at that rate for a good 3 to 4 years before you actually catch up with demand. So -- and following those new housing starts, you'll see commercial businesses come in. And so we see the commercial business remaining strong. And then I think our other lines of business like our industrial and our oilfield services, I think oilfield services has bottomed out, we should see a recovery. I don't think that will be a huge robust recovery in 2017, but I think we'll see a good steady recovery over the next couple of years. So absent any big political event or big regulatory event, I would expect that we'll see -- continue to see good volume growth over the next few years."

Our pricing programs, quite frankly, have always been premised on providing better customer service. I always use the cable model, right? We all get an offer to get lower cable or lower TV service once a week. We'll get something that will promise us a lower price, but we don't switch because the pain of switching is high and the cost differential is not dramatic. And so you've got to keep that good customer service because you don't change your TV provider until you start having service issues. And that's when you take those lower-priced offers and you say, I'm going to listen to these and actually get this done. So customer service is pivotal to the long-term sustainability of our pricing programs and I would say it's 2 things that really drive it. One is technology. I mean, the use of technology, the use of data. And I would tell you and that we're probably in sort of the second or third inning. But the more important part of customer service is making sure that our customers service folks, our sales folks and our operations folks are all working hand in hand to make sure that we give a great customer experience. And frankly, that's where we've made a lot of progress over the last 2 years. Jim Trevathan and his team have done a phenomenal job of creating better connections between our sales folks, our customer service folks and our operations folks to make sure that we're all driving to the same goals. So yes, it can go lower. Probably about 4% to 5% of that churn is systemic, people going out of business, moving businesses, different things like that. But we think we can continue to get it lower and we expect to do so."

And we rolled out in the last year some very specific tools that help us provide for our largest customers some online and real-time information that helps them manage their business more aggressively. And it's led us, as Dave and Jim mentioned earlier, it's led us to grow national account revenue in total this year where that's -- it's been a negative drag on our volume in previous years. So we're trying to differentiate that service offering very specifically. The other thing without getting into any specific metrics, and it ties to exactly what Dave said, we've added some operating metrics that tied directly to service to our customers rather than just that internal efficiency look. And that's really helped us focus on the right things that we think add that specific value. I guess the last thing I'd mention there is that we've gotten much more aggressive in the process of how we handle service challenges with our customers. Occasionally we fail, and when we do, we want to correct it quickly and adequately. But we also want to make sure that we renew contracts every opportunity we get, so we've added several process changes that led us renew those agreements once an issue, either positive or negative, happen. And I think it's added to that decreasing churn number."

but most of it comes from the single biggest component, which is EBITDA which is, in my mind, kind of the best proxy for how the business is doing overall. So if we think about finishing '16 with about 3 6 5 [ph] in EBITDA, and then you back out CapEx kind of in the middle of that range that I gave earlier, so back out CapEx of $1.425 billion less kind of the sum of interest taxes and working capital of about $650 million and then you add in proceeds, and you're right, proceeds are kind of a small number this year compared to prior years, but adding proceeds of about $50 million, and that puts you at about 1 6 2 5 [ph] finishing point for 2016. And then in order to get to a kind of a new normal, you probably have to kind of normalize cash taxes a bit. We haven't decided exactly what we're going do. But in the last 2 years, we've actually prepaid some cash taxes. 2 years ago, we prepaid $200 million and last year we prepaid $150 million. And as we said when we did it, it was really in an effort to try and kind of smooth out cash flows a bit so we don't have these big lumps. But we'll look at that as we get to the end of the year and to the extent that we're kind of over the top of that low end of the range, maybe look to prepay some cash taxes in December."

We need to get more dollars of price as we see the construction season beginning next year and we need to do, I think, a better job of planning for the construction season and meeting the increased demand that we would expect to see. And to me, that's what's going to drive the margin. Obviously, the Jims and our other operations folks keep a great eye on SG&A. And as you see, revenue go up. Obviously, we picked up basis points there because we'll hold SG&A relatively flat.

But core price is the actual dollars that we're putting out on the street and holding on to in pricing. And as you saw, that was up 70 basis points this quarter. What we've said is that we think core price should be sort of that 4% number, year in and year out. We'd expect that to continue.

Joe, overall, as we said earlier on the call, coal ash, the disposal portion flows into the special waste revenue-generating cover category. And that was up almost 7%. The coal ash part is less than 10% of that total, so it's still a small part of our overall revenue but a growing component of our revenue. We also have some on-site activities. We've done work on those customer sites where we're moving materials from one location to another, helping them operationally manage both their generated waste materials, but also their historic materials that are stockpiled and need remediation, so there's an on-site component. That on-site component is without a doubt, a lower margin. It is accretive to our company. But it also, it has a very low capital cost associated with it. The disposal side, much higher margin -- when we go off-site higher margin, but it's typical to our landfill margin. So it is a good part of our business, but it's not a substantial part yet, Joe. But we expect it to be over the coming years to continue to grow as those regulations take effect and companies decide what they're going to do on their site to meet those new regulations."

In 2014, it was below that. It was in the 8s. 2015, it was just above 9%, kind of like 9.1%. And 2016, it's going to be closer to 10%. But we'd still think in '17 and on a go-forward basis that, that range of 9% to 10% is a healthy range. It's a good range for us. Keep in mind that if you look at things like leachate purchases in 2012, 2013, I think 2012, we bought around 900 to 950 vehicles. We're going to buy 1,300 vehicles this year.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. With me this morning are David Steiner, Chief Executive Officer; Jim Fish, President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jim Trevathan, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. 
Before we get started, please note that we have filed a Form 8-K this morning that includes the earnings press release, and is available on our website at www.wm.com. The Form 8-K, the press release and the schedules to the press release include important information. 
During the call, you will hear forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations, projections or opinions about future periods. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in today's press release and in our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K. David and Jim will discuss our results in the areas of yield and volume which, unless otherwise stated, are more specifically references to internal revenue growth, or IRG, from yield or volume. 
During the call, David and Jim will also discuss our earnings per diluted share, which they may refer to as EPS, or earnings per share. And Jim and David will address operating EBITDA and operating EBITDA margin, as defined in the earnings press release. Any comparison, unless otherwise stated, will be with the third quarter of 2015. The third quarter of 2016 results have been adjusted to enhance comparability by excluding certain items that management believes do not reflect our fundamental business performance or results of operations. These adjusted measures, in addition to free cash flow, are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the earnings press release footnote and schedules, which can be found on the company's website at www.wm.com for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures.

190694,403160531,1062630,"Waste Management, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Waste Management, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. Our third quarter results exceeded our internal expectations. As we have all year, we saw improving volumes, strong execution of our pricing programs and continued traction in our cost programs. Each of our net i",991,"Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. Our third quarter results exceeded our internal expectations. As we have all year, we saw improving volumes, strong execution of our pricing programs and continued traction in our cost programs. Each of our net income, operating income and margin, operating EBITDA and margin, and earnings per diluted share improved when compared to the third quarter of 2015. And during the third quarter, we achieved a significant milestone as our operating EBITDA exceeded $1 billion for the first time. 
We earned $0.84 per share in the third quarter, an increase of 13.5% from our third quarter 2015 results. Our continued growth in earnings translated into strong generation of cash flow from operations, which grew $96 million in the third quarter and drove year-to-date cash from operations to over $2.2 billion. That's almost a 12% increase over last year. So we're very pleased with the momentum that we've built in the first 3 quarters of the year, which we expect to continue into the fourth quarter and extend it to 2017. 
Our pricing programs are significant reason for our earnings growth and margin expansion. For the third quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.7%, and collection and disposal yield was 2.1% with total company yield at 2.6%. Core price improved 70 basis points from the third quarter of 2015. Core price in the industrial line was 8.6%. In the commercial line, it was 7%. And in both our landfill and residential lines, it was 2.6%. 
Importantly, we demonstrated our continued ability to increase prices while retaining customers through improved customer service as our churn rate dropped to 8.7%. That's 170 basis points better than last year and 40 basis points better than the second quarter of 2016. This is the lowest churn that we've seen since before 2005. It's a tribute to our customer service and operations folks who work together to create a better customer experience. 
With respect to volumes. We continued to see positive volume growth in the third quarter just as we have all year. In the quarter, we saw volumes in our high-margin commercial, industrial and landfill lines of business continue to grow and we saw an improvement in the rate of decline of residential volumes. Our traditional solid waste volumes were positive 1.6% in the third quarter 2016, 170 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015 and an 80 basis point improvement sequentially from the second quarter of 2016. And our overall volume was also a positive 1.6% as our national accounts and recycling segments contributed positively to volume growth in the quarter. 
Our entire team continues to execute on our strategy of maintaining price, adding high-margin business and improving customer service. And the results continue to impress. Our landfill line of business continues to show strong results too, which Jim will discuss in more detail. However, as we previously mentioned, we've seen a significant increase in the cost of managing the liquid that occur on our landfills. In the third quarter of 2016, the increase in leachate costs was about $23 million or a drag of $0.03 per share. 
We continue to roll out our wastewater management charge to our landfill customers who are under long-term contracts. However, the charge is fully implemented on our spot customers. So in the third quarter, we added approximately 0.2% to landfill yield from implementing the charge with almost no pushback. However, we still have a long way to go before we can recover the full cost. It's important that we pass the cost increases on to our customers, so that we can achieve an appropriate return on investment on our landfill assets. But just like when we implemented the fuel surcharge, it will take time to fully implement this charge. 
Turning to recycling. We saw a 13.6% increase in average commodity prices at our recycling facilities for the quarter and a 0.9% increase in volumes. Year-over-year, the recycling line of business contributed almost $0.03 per share to earnings, which helped to offset the $0.03 of increase of leachate costs. The improvement in earnings was driven by about $0.01 from pricing and about $0.02 from operational improvements at our recycling plants and our continued efforts to improve our contracts. 
On the operational side. Our recycling employees have been a nice job on improving operational efficiencies such as reducing downtime events through preventive maintenance practices, educating customers about contamination and charging for contamination overages. This led to gross operating expenses improving 4.5% in the third quarter. And on the contract side. We continued to work with customers on more fair contract terms to allow Waste Management to remain their recycling partner and provide us with a sustainable business model. 
So we're very pleased with our third quarter results as well as our results through the first 9 months of 2016. We are proud of the hard work all of our employees have done to date to cause us to exceed our expectations for yield, volume, earnings and cash flow generation. Consequently, we are again raising our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance for 2016. We are confident that we can achieve consensus for the fourth quarter, which would put us at $2.91 of EPS for the full year. 
Cash flow continues to be strong and we remain confident that we can achieve our free cash flow guidance for 2016 of between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion. As we move towards the end of the year, we will do what we have done in the past few years where we estimate full year cash flow and determine if we want to prepay up the $100 million of our 2017 capital spend or taxes. I want to thank all of our team members for demonstrating, once again, why they are the best in the business. 
I will now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our third quarter results in more detail."

The third quarter was indeed another strong quarter for us. Revenues in the quarter were  $3.55 billion, an increase of $188 million or 5.6% when compared to the third quarter of 2015.

Revenues in the quarter were  $3.55 billion, an increase of $188 million or 5.6% when compared to the third quarter of 2015. We saw $110 million increase in our collection and disposal business from the combined impacts of pricing and volume, a $60 million increase in revenues from acquisitions net of divestitures and recycling revenues increased $27 million. These increases were partially offset by an $11 million decline related to lower fuel surcharge revenues. Foreign currency fluctuations had no material impact on revenues compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
Looking at internal revenue growth for the company. In the third quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.7% and yield was 2.1% with total volumes improving 1.6%. Volumes were positive for the third consecutive quarter. The combined positive price and cost of volume led to total company income operations growing $65 million, operating income margin expanding 90 basis points to 18.8%, operating EBITDA growing $71 million and operating EBITDA margin growing 50 basis points to 28.2%. 
Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefits of improving volume. Industrial volume was up 1.9% in the third quarter, a 150 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015 and a 40 basis point improvement, sequentially. Commercial line of business showed strong momentum with volumes up 1.2% in the third quarter, a 250 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015 and a 90 basis point improvement from the second quarter 2016. While our residential business lines were down 2.9% in the third quarter, this reflected a 70 basis point improvement from the third quarter of 2015 and a 60 basis point improvement, sequentially, from second quarter. Overall, our collection income from operations grew $26 million and EBITDA grew $38 million in the third quarter. 
In the landfill line of business. We, again, saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive yield in the third quarter, just as we saw the first and second quarters of this year. Total landfill volumes increased 6.9%, MSW volume grew 6.1%, C&D volume grew 22%, and combined special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes grew 6.7%. More than half of the growth of C&D was due to the storm cleanup in Louisiana, but underlying trends remain strong. We achieved core price of 2.6%, an increase of 30 basis points from the third quarter of 2015. The combined positive price and volume in the landfill line of business led to income from operations and EBITDA, each growing $12 million in the third quarter. 
Moving now to operating expenses. As a percent of revenue, this expenses increased to 10 basis points to 62.5%. For the third quarter, operating expenses increased $121 million when compared to the third quarter of 2015. Landfill operating cost represented the largest increase, up $29 million. $23 million of the $29 million increase were the increased leachate costs, which equated to 60 basis points as a percent of revenue. 
The remainder of the operating cost dollar increase related primarily to our increased volumes and costs from acquired operations, with labor costs increasing $28 million, cost of goods sold increasing $25 million and subcontractor costs increasing $22 million. These increases were partially offset by savings from lower fuel costs. Over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect to see operating expense margin improvements as we add wastewater treatment capacity and as our increased fuel per fleet purchases and MSDO initiative begin to positively impact maintenance costs. 
For the third quarter, as a percent of revenue, SG&A costs were 9.3%, an improvement of 50 basis points when compared to the third quarter of 2015. On a dollar basis, SG&A costs were $330 million, a slight improvement compared to 2015. We've done a nice job controlling SG&A costs as increases in wages and compensation have been offset by other improvements. 
Turning to cash flow for the third quarter. Cash provided by operating activities was $753 million compared to $657 million in the third quarter of 2015. Our operations continue to perform very well as cash flow was driven largely by an operating EBITDA increase of $71 million. During the third quarter, we spent $333 million on capital expenditures, a decrease of $2 million when compared to the third quarter 2015. Through the first 9 months of 2016, we have spent $962 million on capital expenditures, an increase of $98 million when compared to the first 9 months of 2015. We still expect that capital expenditures will be between $1.4 billion and $1.45 billion for the full year 2016. 
In the third quarter, we had $8 million in proceeds from divested assets, a decrease of $28 million from the prior year quarter. Combined, we generated $428 million of free cash flow, a $70 million increase compared to the third quarter of 2015. Year-to-date, we have achieved free cash flow of $1.28 billion. We remain confident in achieving our full year 2016 free cash flow guidance of between $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion. 
In the third quarter, we paid $182 million in dividends to our shareholders. While we didn't repurchase any shares during the third quarter, we currently planned to start buying back our stock again in the fourth quarter when the window opens. We expect that these late 2016 and early 2017 repurchases will allow us to completely offset the 2017 dilution impacts of our equity compensation plans. 
Finally, looking at our other financial metrics. At the end of the third quarter, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio measured based on our bank covenants was 2.56 and our weighted average cost of debt was 4.17%. The floating rate portion of our debt portfolio was 13% at the end of the quarter. The effective tax rate was 33.7% in the third quarter. Adjusting for the impairments, the tax rate was 33.5%. We still expect that our full year as adjusted tax rate will be approximately 35%. 
In summary, year-to-date 2016 has been a very successful year driven by the exceptional performance of our employees. I want to thank them for their efforts through the first 9 months. I know they're working hard to improve our operational and financial performance for the remainder of 2016 and into 2017, and we are confident that they will be successful.
And with that, Karnissia, let's open the line for questions."

We, obviously, can't look out a number of years, but we've said very often that the best indicator for our business is new housing starts. And as you know, we've been running a deficit on new housing starts in the United States since 2009. So we still haven't gotten to the point where we're meeting annual demand for new housing starts. And so everything I've seen says that, that's going to continue to be strong through 2020. Now obviously, you saw there are some labor challenges in the housing market, but once those get evened out, I think you're going to start to see those new housing starts move up from that 1.1 million to 1.2 million, to sort of the 1.4 million to 1.5 million, and you can run at that rate for a good 3 to 4 years before you actually catch up with demand. So -- and following those new housing starts, you'll see commercial businesses come in. And so we see the commercial business remaining strong. And then I think our other lines of business like our industrial and our oilfield services, I think oilfield services has bottomed out, we should see a recovery. I don't think that will be a huge robust recovery in 2017, but I think we'll see a good steady recovery over the next couple of years. So absent any big political event or big regulatory event, I would expect that we'll see -- continue to see good volume growth over the next few years."

Our pricing programs, quite frankly, have always been premised on providing better customer service. I always use the cable model, right? We all get an offer to get lower cable or lower TV service once a week. We'll get something that will promise us a lower price, but we don't switch because the pain of switching is high and the cost differential is not dramatic. And so you've got to keep that good customer service because you don't change your TV provider until you start having service issues. And that's when you take those lower-priced offers and you say, I'm going to listen to these and actually get this done. So customer service is pivotal to the long-term sustainability of our pricing programs and I would say it's 2 things that really drive it. One is technology. I mean, the use of technology, the use of data. And I would tell you and that we're probably in sort of the second or third inning. But the more important part of customer service is making sure that our customers service folks, our sales folks and our operations folks are all working hand in hand to make sure that we give a great customer experience. And frankly, that's where we've made a lot of progress over the last 2 years. Jim Trevathan and his team have done a phenomenal job of creating better connections between our sales folks, our customer service folks and our operations folks to make sure that we're all driving to the same goals. So yes, it can go lower. Probably about 4% to 5% of that churn is systemic, people going out of business, moving businesses, different things like that.

And we rolled out in the last year some very specific tools that help us provide for our largest customers some online and real-time information that helps them manage their business more aggressively. And it's led us, as Dave and Jim mentioned earlier, it's led us to grow national account revenue in total this year where that's -- it's been a negative drag on our volume in previous years. So we're trying to differentiate that service offering very specifically. The other thing without getting into any specific metrics, and it ties to exactly what Dave said, we've added some operating metrics that tied directly to service to our customers rather than just that internal efficiency look. And that's really helped us focus on the right things that we think add that specific value. I guess the last thing I'd mention there is that we've gotten much more aggressive in the process of how we handle service challenges with our customers. Occasionally we fail, and when we do, we want to correct it quickly and adequately. But we also want to make sure that we renew contracts every opportunity we get, so we've added several process changes that led us renew those agreements once an issue, either positive or negative, happen. And I think it's added to that decreasing churn number."

I would say -- I wouldn't say surprised, but I would say that we are -- that we're very happy to see the landfill continue to be so robust.

We cover all the sectors and we service all of the sectors.

but most of it comes from the single biggest component, which is EBITDA which is, in my mind, kind of the best proxy for how the business is doing overall. So if we think about finishing '16 with about 3 6 5 [ph] in EBITDA, and then you back out CapEx kind of in the middle of that range that I gave earlier, so back out CapEx of $1.425 billion less kind of the sum of interest taxes and working capital of about $650 million and then you add in proceeds, and you're right, proceeds are kind of a small number this year compared to prior years, but adding proceeds of about $50 million, and that puts you at about 1 6 2 5 [ph] finishing point for 2016. And then in order to get to a kind of a new normal, you probably have to kind of normalize cash taxes a bit. We haven't decided exactly what we're going do. But in the last 2 years, we've actually prepaid some cash taxes. 2 years ago, we prepaid $200 million and last year we prepaid $150 million. And as we said when we did it, it was really in an effort to try and kind of smooth out cash flows a bit so we don't have these big lumps. But we'll look at that as we get to the end of the year and to the extent that we're kind of over the top of that low end of the range, maybe look to prepay some cash taxes in December."

Obviously, we've got this leachate expense which will restrain the margin. But what we need to do is get efficiency gains by adding route density. We need to get more dollars of price as we see the construction season beginning next year and we need to do, I think, a better job of planning for the construction season and meeting the increased demand that we would expect to see. And to me, that's what's going to drive the margin. Obviously, the Jims and our other operations folks keep a great eye on SG&A. And as you see, revenue go up. Obviously, we picked up basis points there because we'll hold SG&A relatively flat.

Now we knew that in the back half of the year, and I think we said on the first 2 quarter conference calls, that it would probably abate in the second half of the year between CPI and mix, that we would see it come down closer to that too. But when I look at pricing, increasingly, we're looking at core price not yield because yield has those mix issues in it. Yield has some of the CPI issues in it. But core price is the actual dollars that we're putting out on the street and holding on to in pricing. And as you saw, that was up 70 basis points this quarter. What we've said is that we think core price should be sort of that 4% number, year in and year out. We'd expect that to continue. And so if we can -- we continue to get that 4% core price, 4% plus core price, yield should continue at around 2%. But we're not going to get too worked up over a few basis points of movement here or there based on CPI or on mix."

So lots of hand wringing in the last month about data regarding the consumer and the economy. If you look into your database and start looking at very consumer-centric businesses, restaurants especially retail, my sense is -- based on the MSW trends and the landfill volume trends in MSW, that consumer is still plodding along there and you haven't seen any pullback in activity. They're participating in the economy. And restaurants may be complaining about having to cut price and do all that, that's a fundamental issue for them, it's the consumers not shopping."

As we look at it, I think the number that we've always said it's about 25% to 35% of our customers are on some type of modified index, whether it's a particularized index for us or a government index like the wastewater sewage.

As we look at it, I think the number that we've always said it's about 25% to 35% of our customers are on some type of modified index, whether it's a particularized index for us or a government index like the wastewater sewage. That's one where, like a lot of things we do, you have to have sort of an industry backing, right? I mean, look, too many times we see -- I'll go back to the recycling business. Too many times we saw a lot of people bid rational contracts like we do then one party comes in and says we'll do it under the old type of contract. And before you know it, they're winning business and losing money. And I would tell you, we haven't seen as much sort of industry acceptance of a different CPI based residential or franchise-type model. We have not seen widespread enough acceptance to move the needle. I mean, when fitters go in and say we're going to bid on a modified CPI and then the fourth bidder comes in and says we'll take whatever you have on the table, it's hard to see things change. And so we've had better success in our large franchise areas like California, but I think that's going to be a long slow slug that we just have to -- there's only one thing we can do at Waste Management, and that's stiffen our backbone and say we're not going to bid these contracts when it's not good for our business. We've proven that on the recycling side. We need to continue to have that same type of firm backbone on the residential and franchise side."
