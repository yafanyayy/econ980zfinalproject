First, I would like to thank Milton and the board for giving me the opportunity to lead this incredible company. At our recent Investor Day, we laid our 2020 vision, underscoring the work we've done over the last several years to position Kimco to take full advantage of the evolving landscape for retail and become a leader in our industry. Our team has executed over the past few years dramatically transforming the portfolio from a scattered collection of assets across the U.S., Mexico, South America and Canada to now a tightly concentrated footprint of high-quality asset clusters in the major metro markets in the U.S., where we see the highest growth potential.
The top U.S. markets showcased the highest growth in population, household income, education, both significant barriers to entry and present the most potential to add value for our shareholders. All of our resources are now laser focused on what we do best, owning, managing, leasing and redeveloping assets here in the U.S. to drive net asset value. Our portfolio has 2 distinct advantages. First, we have a 37% mark-to-market opportunity that is unmatched due to the low in place average base rent and the spread to market that we can unlock by recapturing and repurposing assets to meet that need of today's shopper. Second, we have more raw material to work with, the large collection of assets we own provide numerous redevelopment opportunities to adding grocery components to overpower centers and adding technology to extend the hours of our shopping centers to fulfill the everyday needs of our shoppers 24/7.
Our 2020 vision provides the roadmap for how we plan to take the company to new heights in the next 5 years. The 3 main pillars of our strategy are simple. First, it starts with management. We have to continue to motivate and empower the best talent in the industry and create a vibrant and rewarding place to work. Second, the balance sheet. We have to be of capital by keeping watchful eye on our cost of capital, so we can invest wisely and position the balance sheet to whether any storm. Finally, a major focus on NAV per share growth and the major metro markets in the U.S. Asset values are close to peak or even above prior peak pricing, as a healthy balance in supply and demand continues for open-air centers. We believe the best use of our capital is to take full advantage of that demand and redevelop our assets to drive outsized growth by leaning on a tremendous team, fulfilling our redevelopment opportunities and executing on our select strategic developments.
We have planted the seeds to and redevelopment and development to bring to life assets that will significantly enhance the value and quality of our overall portfolio. We will continue to remain disciplined, pre-leasing, phasing and ground leasing are just a few of our risk management tools that are in place to analyze each and every investment opportunity versus our cost of capital and to ensure we generate the highest return for our shareholders. The future is bright, and we're passionate about delivering for our shareholders. 
Turning to our results for the fourth quarter and the full year, I will give a brief overview of our portfolio metrics, a quick update on acquisitions and dispositions, followed by an update on redevelopments. U.S. occupancy at the end of 2015 was 95.8%, up 20 basis points from last quarter and 10 basis points from the beginning of the year, driven in large part by the small shop recovery. Small shop occupancy is 88.7%, up 70 basis points from last quarter and for the beginning of the year. U.S. leasing spreads continue to display of the mark-to-market opportunity at Kimco, with an impressive 31% on new leases and a combined missing spread 13.1% in the fourth quarter, the highest combined spread in almost 3 years. U.S. same-site NOI growth was 2.8% for the quarter, primarily driven by minimum rent increase and a 20 basis points basis point in positive impact from the development. 
For the full year, you a same-site NOI growth is 3.1%, including a 50 basis point negative impact from bankruptcies experienced over the year.
The average base rent for the U.S. portfolio continues to improve with 5.2% gain from the prior year end. Competition continues to be fierce in our top markets of acquisition, with some staggering cap rates recently reported in areas of California. This bodes well for the NAV of our holdings in California, which is our largest state by NOI contribution and continues to direct us to deploy capital towards redevelopment of our existing assets versus acquiring in the open market. 
For the year, our total gross acquisition of $2.1 billion is heavily weighted towards the purchase of our joint venture interest in 57 assets. In contrast, only 2 assets were acquired in the open market for a purchase price of $155 million. Disposition market remains healthy, as we completed a total gross disposition value of $2.2 billion for the year. We completed the exit from Mexico is out of America and announced the closing of the JV transaction in Canada, that will pave the way to achieving our goal of simplifying the company to be strictly U.S. focused by year end.
In the U.S., we completed the sale of 95 properties in 2015, for a gross price of $762 million, at the blended 6.9% cap rate. Pricing expectations for our disposition have not changed, as you continue to see the demand for high-quality anchor open-air shopping centers. Our redevelopment program remain the focal point of our strategy. For the year, we projected $189 million of projects, delivering a 10.6% incremental return. We're pleased to announce that due to some cost savings we came in under-budget on cost of $184 million and above budget on NOI, improving the incremental returns to 11.3% for the year. Perhaps the most exciting redevelopment completion this quarter is opening in our flagship Long Island assets Airport Plaza and Farmingdale. Early indications from students and shoppers are incredible and from the video footage of the parking lot, we think the benefit of this grocery addition to an existing power center will create a significant NAV and same-site NOI improvement for years to come.
In Florida, we also had successful openings for public at our redevelopment and redevelopment on Orlando. we signed new leases with Joe's, one in California and one in Washington. The tremendous grocery additions improve the percentage of ABR from grocery anchored centers to 72%, up from 65% at prior year end.
To be the best, we continue to question the status quo and take a deep dive into every aspect of our operations to help drive results. Open-air retail continues to evolve and embrace omni-channel, as a physical store has proven to be a driver of online sales. Our retailers know their customer better than anyone inside their 4 walls, and our job is to more people to the shopping center and get those consumers to come back time and time again. The open-air retail landscape is healthy, as limited new supply is forecasted and our strongest retailers continue to grow store count. The shadow supply from potential closings or consolidating retailers and future developments supply is what we are monitoring closely. 
Looking ahead, we are starting to see the activity pick up in every category size. Big-box retailers are back looking for space. Junior box players continue to be most aggressive. Traditional and specialty groceries are active and our small shop leasing indicates a healthy trajectory. All of these ingredients indicate we are well-positioned to unlock the value of our real estate for our shareholders.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Glen to revise more granularity on our results."

It's going to be a fun go for us all. Good morning to everyone. We finished 2015 with a solid fourth quarter, delivering strong results for the full year, while furthering our transformation",954,"Thanks, Conor, and congratulations on your appointment to CEO. It's going to be a fun go for us all. Good morning to everyone. 
We finished 2015 with a solid fourth quarter, delivering strong results for the full year, while furthering our transformation and simplification efforts. We successfully executed on our TSR strategy plus and delivered a total shareholder return of 9.4% in 2015, in very tough environmental market. In December, we unveiled our 2020 vision at our Investor Day, focusing on owning and operating fine quality U.S. properties in the major metro markets, where we have deep concentration. We also continue to execute on our redevelopment pipeline and select roundup development projects. Our 2020 vision includes operating in a more conservative capital structure, with plenty of liquidity and even stronger debt metrics than today. Finally, as an added benefit, we have the upside potential for PLUS business, position is clear, the team is focused and aligned. 
Now for some details on our fourth quarter and full year results and further call regarding our 2016 earnings guidance. Our FFO is adjusted per-share or recurring FFO, which excludes nonoperating impairments and transactional income and expense was $0.37 for the fourth quarter, an increase of 5.7% compared to last year's $0.35. The increase was driven by NOI from the operating portfolio of $24.8 million, offset by $4.4 million of decreased management fees related to the significant reduction in joint ventures and higher G&A associated with severance charges, attributable to our anticipated exit of Canada. In addition, interest expense was higher by $5.6 million, primarily from the debt assumptions related to the Kimstone acquisition earlier in the year, the recent JV buyouts of and and the acquisition of property impairments.
Our full year 2015 FFO adjusted per share came in at $1.46, achieving the high-end of our revised guidance range and $0.06 above last year's results for $1.40, a 4.3% increase. Headline FFO per share representing the official was $0.35 for the fourth quarter, in line with first call consensus estimates. Headline FFO per share was $0.02 lower than FFO is adjusted, primarily related to the $5.8 million noncash charge for the redemption of our $175 million, 6.9% series H preferred stock redemption during the quarter and the acquisition of related costs. Our full year 2015 headline FFO per share came in at $1.56, achieving the upper end of our guidance range and a $0.01 ahead of first call consensus. Our 2015 results were $0.11 higher than the 2014 amount of $1.45 per share, a 7.6% increase. The primary drivers of the headline per share increase are the $0.06 increase in recurring FFO and the gain on sale of our SUPERVALU stock investment, which contributed 40 million or $0.10 per share. Acquisition cost and nonoperating impairments offset these increases. As Conor just articulated, the operating portfolio delivered solid results with improved occupancy, a 23rd contributive quarter of delivering positive U.S. same-site NOI growth and double-digit leasing spreads. 
Ross Cooper and his team are very active during the quarter on the disposition for rent. We completed the sale-of-interest in 64 U.S. properties, 23 Canadian properties and our last asset in South America generating proceeds of approximately $600 million, which we used to fund $175 million of mission of preferred stock, pay down debt and fund the acquisitions. We remain focused and committed to operate with a strong capital structure. We finished the fourth quarter with consolidated net debt to recurring EBITDA of 6x, the high-end of our 5.5 to 6x range, down from the 6.6x at end of the fourth quarter after acquiring $1.4 billion Kimstone portfolio.
We achieved this level even with the redemption of the preferred stock which had a 0.2x impact on the metric. As part of our 2020 vision, overtime, we plan to reduce the consolidated net debt to recurring EBITDA to a range of 5 to 5.5x and on look-through basis, including pro-rata JV debt and preferred stock to a range of 6.4 to 6.9x, with a fixed charge coverage of 3x plus. 
During the fourth quarter, we capped the bond market issuing a $500 million 7-year 3.4% fixed-rate bond. Our liquidity position is in excellent shape, ending the year with 0 outstanding on our $1.75 billion revolving credit facility and over $180 million in cash. We have already begun to address our 2016 maturities, both consolidated and in our JVs, which are anticipated to be funded from sales proceeds, the unsecured bank and bond markets and mortgage financings, all at lower coupons than the maturing debts.
We are reaffirming our guidance for 2016, which was provided at our Investor Day in December. Our FFO is adjusted or recurring FFO per share range is $1.48 to $1.52 and our headline FFO per share range is $1.54 to $1.62. The guidance range takes into account the significant level of dispositions throughout 2015, and the accelerated exit of Canada during 2016, which had a combined impact of $0.06 to $0.07 per share on the 2016 growth expectations. We anticipate that by the end of 2016, we will be a purely U.S. owner and operator with assets concentrated in our key metro markets. The transactional expense and income included in the headline guidance range, but not in acquiring range, is primarily comprised of acquisition costs and the commencement of modified investments, assess the transactional income portion is heavily weighted towards the fourth quarter of 2016. The guidance range is sensitive to timing of acquisitions, dispositions, redevelopments coming online, lease-up and financing initiatives. Our 2016 plans supports our recently increased common dividend level of $0.255 per quarter, which equates to an FFO payout ratio in the upper 60% range. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Conor."

If look at the Christiana, Delaware, its around 95, where we have been working to rezone that from a former warehouse to now retail offering, and it's very next to GDP successful Christiana Mall. So each and every one of these projects have a story to it. And there is not going to be significant development in our pipeline looking out, maybe because the land prices have really skyrocketed. A lot of that's due to the multifamily that we have seen pop-up. But we see the demand from all retailers to want to grow store count in the limited supply. So each of these projects has really -- it's within a key market for us. The demand is there, on the one in Houston obviously, where Houston is going through some headwinds, we still see retailers wanting to be there for the void. Clearly the apartments density -- the density around our Grand Parkway project has been there for a long period of time, and I think the retail is the last sector to really catch up to meet the demand. So we haven't seen any falloff in terms of return or demand there and that will actually be one of our first development of projects and we're cautiously optimistic that it will be a big success."

Pentagon is obviously, the apartment forward that we talked about and 25,000 square feet of new retail there. So the ROI is going to be little lower there, because of the apartments, but the spreads from the cap rate is still well over 200 basis points.

But if you look at the pure tick up in market rents, it's at the high-end of our range where we expected to be and continue to see it improve, as retailers really have focused on making sure to try to penetrate these markets, but also not close stores.

At our recent Investor Day, we laid our 2020 vision, underscoring the work we've done over the last several years to position Kimco",1308,"Good morning. First, I'd like to thank Milton and the board for giving me the opportunity to lead this incredible company. At our recent Investor Day, we laid our 2020 vision, underscoring the work we've done over the last several years to position Kimco to take full advantage of the evolving landscape of open-air retail and become a leader in our industry. Our team has executed over the past few years dramatically transforming the portfolio from a scattered collection of assets across the U.S., Mexico, South America and Canada to now a tightly concentrated footprint of high-quality asset clusters in the major metro markets in the U.S., where we see the highest growth potential.
The top U.S. markets showcased the highest growth in population, household income, education, both significant barriers to entry and present the most potential to add value for our shareholders. All of our resources are now laser focused on what we do best, owning, managing, leasing and redeveloping assets here in the U.S. to drive net asset value. Our portfolio has 2 distinct advantages: First, we have a 37% mark-to-market opportunity that is unmatched due to the low in place average base rent and the spread to market that we can unlock by recapturing and repurposing assets to meet the need of today's shopper; second, we have more raw material to work with. The large collection of assets we own provides numerous redevelopment opportunities through densification, adding grocery components to our power centers and adding technology to extend the hours of our shopping centers to fulfill the everyday needs of our shoppers, 24/7.
Our 2020 vision provides the roadmap for how we plan to take the company to new heights in the next 5 years. The 3 main pillars of our strategy are simple. First, it starts with management. We have to continue to motivate and empower the best talent in the industry and create a vibrant and rewarding place to work. Second, the balance sheet. We have to be stewards of capital by keeping a watchful eye on our cost of capital, so we can invest wisely and position the balance sheet to weather any storm. Finally, a major focus on NAV per share growth. In the major metro markets in the U.S., asset values are close to peak or even above prior peak pricing, as a healthy balance in supply and demand continues for open-air centers. We believe the best use of our capital is to take full advantage of that demand and redevelop our assets to drive outsized growth by leaning on a tremendous team, fulfilling our redevelopment opportunities and executing on our select strategic developments.
We have planted the seeds to redevelopment and development to bring to life assets that will significantly enhance the value and quality of our overall portfolio. We will continue to remain disciplined. Pre-leasing, phasing and ground leasing are just a few of our risk management tools that are in place to analyze each and every investment opportunity versus our cost of capital and to ensure we generate the highest returns for our shareholders. The future is bright, and we're passionate about delivering for our shareholders. 
Turning to our results for the fourth quarter and the full year, I will give a brief overview of our portfolio metrics, a quick update on acquisitions and dispositions, followed by an update on redevelopments. U.S. occupancy at the end of 2015 was 95.8%, up 20 basis points from last quarter and 10 basis points from the beginning of the year, driven in large part by the small shop recovery. Small shop occupancy is 88.7%, up 70 basis points from last quarter and for the beginning of the year. U.S. leasing spreads continue to display the mark-to-market opportunity at Kimco, with an impressive 31% on new leases and a combined leasing spread of 13.1% in the fourth quarter, the highest combined spread in almost 3 years. U.S. same-site NOI growth was 2.8% for the quarter, primarily driven by minimum rent increases and a 20-basis-point positive impact from redevelopment. 
For the full year, U.S. same-site NOI growth is 3.1%, including a 50-basis-point negative impact from bankruptcies experienced over the year.
The average base rent for the U.S. portfolio continues to improve with a 5.2% gain from the prior year end. Competition continues to be fierce in our top markets of acquisition, with some staggering cap rates recently reported in areas of California. This bodes well for the NAV of our holdings in California, which is our largest state by NOI contribution and continues to direct us to deploy capital towards redevelopment of our existing assets versus acquiring in the open market. 
For the year, our total gross acquisition of $2.1 billion is heavily weighted toward the purchase of our joint venture interest in 57 assets. In contrast, only 2 assets were acquired in the open market for a purchase price of $155 million. The disposition market remains healthy, as we completed a total gross disposition value of $2.2 billion for the year. We completed the exit from Mexico and South America and announced the closing of the RioCan JV transaction in Canada. That will pave the way to achieving our goal of simplifying the company to be strictly U.S. focused by year end.
In the U.S., we completed the sale of 95 properties in 2015, for a gross price of $762 million, at a blended 6.9% cap rate. Pricing expectations for our disposition candidates have not changed, as we continue to see the demand for high-quality anchored open-air shopping centers. Our redevelopment program remains the focal point of our strategy. For the year, we budgeted $189 million of projects, delivering a 10.6% incremental return. We're pleased to announce that due to some cost savings, we came in under-budget on cost of $184 million and above budget on NOI, improving the incremental return to 11.3% for the year. Perhaps the most exciting redevelopment completion this quarter is this [indiscernible] opening in our flagship Long Island asset, Airport Plaza and Farmingdale. Early indications from stus and shoppers are incredible, and from the video footage of the parking lot, we think the benefit of this grocery addition to an existing power center will produce significant NAV and same-site NOI improvement for years to come.
In Florida, we also had successful openings of Publix at our Palm Beach redevelopment and haul-throughs at a redevelopment in Orlando. At last, we signed 2 new leases with Trader Joe's, one in California and one in Washington. These tremendous grocery additions improve the percent of AVR from grocery-anchored centers to 72%, up from 65% at prior year end.
To be the best, we continue to question the status quo and take a deep dive into every aspect of operations to help drive results. Open-air retail continues to evolve and embrace omni-channel, as a physical store has proven to be a driver of online sales. Our retailers know their customer better than anyone inside their 4 walls, and our job is to bring more people to the shopping center and get those consumers to come back time and time again. The open-air retail landscape is healthy, as limited new supply is forecasted and our strongest retailers continue to grow store count. The shadow supply from potential closings or consolidating retailers and future developments supply is what we are monitoring closely. 
Looking ahead, we are starting to see the activity pick up at every category size. Big-box retailers are back looking for space. Junior box players continue to be most aggressive. Traditional and specialty groceries are active and our small shop leasing indicates a healthy trajectory. All of these ingredients indicate we are well positioned to unlock the value of our real estate for our shareholders.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Glenn to revise more granularity on our results."

It's going to be a fun go for us all. Good morning to everyone. We finished 2015 with a solid fourth quarter, delivering strong results for the full year, while furthering our transformation",970,"Thanks, Conor, and congratulations on your appointment to CEO. It's going to be a fun go for us all. Good morning to everyone. 
We finished 2015 with a solid fourth quarter, delivering strong results for the full year, while furthering our transformation and simplification efforts. We successfully executed on our TSR strategy plus and delivered a total shareholder return of 9.4% in 2015, in a very tough and volatile market. In December, we unveiled our 2020 vision at our Investor Day, focusing on owning and operating high-quality U.S. properties in the major metro markets where we have deep concentration. We also continue to execute on our redevelopment pipeline and select ground-up development projects. Our 2020 vision includes operating with a more conservative capital structure, with plenty of liquidity and even stronger debt metrics than today. Finally, as an added benefit, we have the upside potential from our PLUS business. Position is clear. The team is focused and aligned. 
Now for some details on our fourth quarter and full year results and further color regarding our 2016 earnings guidance. Our FFO is adjusted per-share or recurring FFO, which excludes nonoperating impairments and transactional income and expense, was $0.37 for the fourth quarter, an increase of 5.7% compared to last year's $0.35. The increase was driven by higher NOI from the operating portfolio of $24.8 million, offset by $4.4 million of decreased management fees related to the significant reduction in joint ventures and higher G&A associated with severance charges, attributable to our anticipated exit of Canada. In addition, interest expense was higher by $5.6 million, primarily from the debt assumptions related to the Kimstone acquisition earlier in the year, the recent JV buyouts of Crown and SEB and the acquisition of the Christiana property in Phoenix.
Our full year 2015 FFO as adjusted per share came in at $1.46, achieving the high end of our revised guidance range and $0.06 above last year's result from $1.40, a 4.3% increase. Headline FFO per share representing the official NAREIT definition was $0.35 for the fourth quarter, in line with first call consensus estimates. Headline FFO per share was $0.02 lower than FFO as adjusted, primarily related to the $5.8 million noncash charge for the redemption of our $175 million, 6.9% series H preferred stock redemption during the quarter and the acquisition-related costs. Our full year 2015 headline FFO per share came in at $1.56, achieving the upper end of our guidance range and a $0.01 ahead of first call consensus. Our 2015 results were $0.11 higher than the 2014 amount of $1.45 per share, a 7.6% increase. The primary drivers of the headline per share increase are the $0.06 increase in recurring FFO and the gain on the sale of our SUPERVALU stock investment, which contributed $40 million or $0.10 per share. Acquisition cost and nonoperating impairments offset these increases. As Conor just articulated, the operating portfolio delivered solid results with improved occupancy, a 23rd consecutive quarter of delivering positive U.S. same-site NOI growth and double-digit leasing spreads. 
Ross Cooper and his team were very active during the quarter on the disposition front. We completed the sale-of-interest in 64 U.S. properties, 23 Canadian properties and our last asset in South America generating proceeds of approximately $600 million, which we used to fund $175 million redemption of preferred stock, pay down debt and fund the acquisitions. We remain focused and committed to operate with a strong capital structure. We finished the fourth quarter with consolidated net debt to recurring EBITDA of 6x, the high-end of our 5.5 to 6x range, down from the 6.6x at the end of the first quarter, after acquiring $1.4 billion Kimstone portfolio.
We achieved this level even with the redemption of the preferred stock, which had a 0.2x impact on the metric. As part of our 2020 vision, overtime, we plan to reduce the consolidated net debt to recurring EBITDA to a range of 5x to 5.5x, and on a look-through basis, including pro-rata JV debt and preferred stock to a range of 6.4x to 6.9x, with a fixed charge coverage of 3x plus. 
During the fourth quarter, we capped the bond market issuing a $500 million 7-year 3.4% fixed-rate bond. Our liquidity position is in excellent shape, ending the year with 0 outstanding on our $1.75 billion revolving credit facility and over $180 million in cash. We have already begun to address our 2016 maturities, both consolidated and in our JVs, which are anticipated to be funded with sales proceeds, the unsecured bank and bond markets and mortgage financings, all at lower coupons than the maturing debt.
We are reaffirming our guidance for 2016, which was provided at our Investor Day in December. Our FFO is adjusted or recurring FFO per share range is at $1.48 to $1.52, and our headline FFO per share range is $1.54 to $1.62. The guidance range takes into account the significant level of dispositions throughout 2015, and the accelerated exit of Canada during 2016, which has a combined impact of $0.06 to $0.07 per share on the 2016 growth expectations. We anticipate that by the end of 2016, we will be a purely U.S. owner and operator with assets concentrated in our key metro markets. The transactional expense and income included in the headline guidance range, but not in the recurring range, is primarily comprised of acquisition costs and the commencement of monetizing our Albertsons investment. As such, the transactional income portion is heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter of 2016. The guidance range is sensitive to timing of acquisitions, dispositions, redevelopments coming online, lease-up and financing initiatives. Our 2016 plan supports our recently increased common dividend level of $0.255 per quarter, which equates to an FFO payout ratio in the upper 60% range. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Milton."

Most of our strategic development has a story to them, and we feel very confident about why we think it's appropriate to add these to the pipeline. If you go asset-by-asset, they each have a reason why -- the one in Fort Lauderdale is right across from our most successful shopping center in the State of Florida, and the demand has been off-the-charts there. If you look at the Christiana, Delaware, its right along 95, where we've been working to rezone that from a former Sears warehouse to now a retail offering, and it's right next to GGP's successful Christiana Mall. So each and every one of these projects have a story to it. And there is not going to be significant more development in our pipeline looking out, mainly because the land prices have really skyrocketed. A lot of that's due to the multifamily that we've seen pop up. But we see the demand from our retailers to want to grow store count and limited supply. So each of these projects has really -- it's within a key market for us. The demand is there. And the one in Houston, obviously, with Houston going through some headwinds, we still see retailers wanting to be there and fill the void. Clearly, the apartments and the density around our Grand Parkway project has been there for a long period of time, and I think the retail is the last sector to really catch up to meet the demand. So we haven't seen any falloff in terms of retailer demand there, and that will actually be one of our first development projects on the ground and we're cautiously optimistic that it will be a big success."

We think that TJX has been really the phenomenal performer for many, many years now.

The new players were watching closely. We want to try and pick best-in-class and have the merchandising mix that enhances both at the shopping center and the amount of traffic it drives. So we're cautiously optimistic that I think that more competition is good for the off-price sector. We clearly favor the ones that have to prove in business model and we're doing it for many, many years. But going forward, it will be an interesting situation to watch to see who really can capture some of that market share. TJX obviously has such a leap. And now Ross is really ramping up their expansion plans.

But there is going to be plenty of aggressive entrants into that market in the Mid-Atlantic and any names, pretty much the majors that are all coming, and coming in droves. So on your question on Lidl, its interesting when we met with them and talk to them about their plans. Most of their plans are self-development. So they actually looking to self-develop standalone grocery stores, where they can be competitors to the traditional grocery stores at a lower price point. So most of what they've been doing is tying up land and looking to self-develop. So they have little bit of a different approach to it than say some of your traditional grocer who is looking to lease space. That being said, though, there is plenty of bidding going on for opportunity there. But it's already a very tight market, so it's very difficult to penetrate."

At our recent Investor Day, we laid our 2020 vision, underscoring the work we've done over the last several years to position Kimco",1310,"Good morning. First, I'd like to thank Milton and the board for giving me the opportunity to lead this incredible company. At our recent Investor Day, we laid our 2020 vision, underscoring the work we've done over the last several years to position Kimco to take full advantage of the evolving landscape of open-air retail and become a leader in our industry. Our team has executed over the past few years dramatically transforming the portfolio from a scattered collection of assets across the U.S., Mexico, South America and Canada to now a tightly concentrated footprint of high-quality asset clusters in the major metro markets in the U.S., where we see the highest growth potential.
The top U.S. markets showcased the highest growth in population, household income, education, both significant barriers to entry and present the most potential to add value for our shareholders. All of our resources are now laser focused on what we do best, owning, managing, leasing and redeveloping assets here in the U.S. to drive net asset value. Our portfolio has 2 distinct advantages: First, we have a 37% mark-to-market opportunity that is unmatched due to the low in-place average base rent and the spread to market that we can unlock by recapturing and repurposing assets to meet the need of today's shopper; second, we have more raw material to work with. The large collection of assets we own provides numerous redevelopment opportunities through densification, adding grocery components to our power centers and adding technology to extend the hours of our shopping centers to fulfill the everyday needs of our shoppers, 24/7.
Our 2020 vision provides the roadmap for how we plan to take the company to new heights in the next 5 years. The 3 main pillars of our strategy are simple. First, it starts with management. We have to continue to motivate and empower the best talent in the industry and create a vibrant and rewarding place to work. Second, the balance sheet. We have to be stewards of capital by keeping a watchful eye on our cost of capital, so we can invest wisely and position the balance sheet to weather any storm. Finally, a major focus on NAV per share growth. In the major metro markets in the U.S., asset values are close to peak or even above prior peak pricing, as a healthy balance in supply and demand continues for open-air centers. We believe the best use of our capital is to take full advantage of that demand and redevelop our assets to drive outsized growth by leaning on our tremendous team, fulfilling our redevelopment opportunities and executing on our select strategic developments.
We have planted the seeds to redevelopment and development to bring to life assets that will significantly enhance the value and quality of our overall portfolio. We will continue to remain disciplined. Pre-leasing, phasing and ground leasing are just a few of our risk management tools that are in place to analyze each and every investment opportunity versus our cost of capital and to ensure we generate the highest returns for our shareholders. The future is bright, and we're passionate about delivering for our shareholders. 
Turning to our results for the fourth quarter and the full year, I will give a brief overview of our portfolio metrics, a quick update on acquisitions and dispositions, followed by an update on redevelopments. U.S. occupancy at the end of 2015 was 95.8%, up 20 basis points from last quarter and 10 basis points from the beginning of the year, driven in large part by the small shop recovery. Small shop occupancy is 88.7%, up 70 basis points from last quarter and from the beginning of the year. U.S. leasing spreads continue to display the mark-to-market opportunity at Kimco, with an impressive 31% on new leases and a combined leasing spread of 13.1% in the fourth quarter, the highest combined spread in almost 3 years. U.S. same-site NOI growth was 2.8% for the quarter, primarily driven by minimum rent increases and a 20-basis-point positive impact from redevelopment. 
For the full year, U.S. same-site NOI growth is 3.1%, including a 50-basis-point negative impact from bankruptcies experienced over the year.
The average base rent for the U.S. portfolio continues to improve with a 5.2% gain from the prior year end. Competition continues to be fierce in our top markets for acquisitions, with some staggering cap rates recently reported in areas of California. This bodes well for the NAV of our holdings in California, which is our largest state by NOI contribution and continues to direct us to deploy capital towards redevelopment of our existing assets versus acquiring in the open market. 
For the year, our total gross acquisitions of $2.1 billion is heavily weighted toward the purchase of our joint venture interest in 57 assets. In contrast, only 2 assets were acquired in the open market for a purchase price of $155 million. The disposition market remains healthy, as we completed a total gross disposition value of $2.2 billion for the year. We completed the exit from Mexico and South America and announced the closing of the RioCan JV transaction in Canada. That will pave the way to achieving our goal of simplifying the company to be strictly U.S. focused by year end.
In the U.S., we completed the sale of 95 properties in 2015, for a gross price of $762 million, at a blended 6.9% cap rate. Pricing expectations for our disposition candidates have not changed, as we continue to see the demand for high-quality anchored open-air shopping centers. Our redevelopment program remains the focal point of our strategy. For the year, we budgeted $189 million of projects, delivering a 10.6% incremental return. We're pleased to announce that due to some cost savings, we came in under-budget on costs of $184 million and above budget on NOI, improving the incremental return to 11.3% for the year. Perhaps the most exciting redevelopment completion this quarter is this [indiscernible] opening in our flagship Long Island asset, Airport Plaza and Farmingdale. Early indications from stus [ph] and shoppers are incredible, and from the video footage of the parking lot, we think the benefit of this grocery addition to an existing power center will produce significant NAV and same-site NOI improvement for years to come.
In Florida, we also had successful openings of Publix at our Palm Beach redevelopment and Whole Foods at our redevelopment in Orlando. Out west, we signed 2 new leases with Trader Joe's, one in California and one in Washington. These tremendous grocery additions improve the percent of AVR from grocery-anchored centers to 72%, up from 65% at prior year end.
To be the best, we continue to question the status quo and take a deep dive into every aspect of operations to help drive results. Open-air retail continues to evolve and embrace omni-channel, as a physical store has proven to be a driver of online sales. Our retailers know their customer better than anyone inside their 4 walls, and our job is to bring more people to the shopping center and get those consumers to come back time and time again. The open-air retail landscape is healthy, as limited new supply is forecasted and our strongest retailers continue to grow store count. The shadow supply from potential closings or consolidating retailers and future redevelopment supply is what we are monitoring closely. 
Looking ahead, we are starting to see the activity pick up at every category size. Big-box retailers are back looking for space. Junior box players continue to be the most aggressive. Traditional and specialty groceries are active and our small shop leasing indicates a healthy trajectory. All of these ingredients indicate we are well positioned to unlock the value of our real estate for our shareholders.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Glenn to revise more granularity on our results."

It's going to be a fun go for us all. Good morning to everyone. We finished 2015 with a solid fourth quarter, delivering strong results for the full year, while furthering our transformation",971,"Thanks, Conor, and congratulations on your appointment to CEO. It's going to be a fun go for us all. Good morning to everyone. 
We finished 2015 with a solid fourth quarter, delivering strong results for the full year, while furthering our transformation and simplification efforts. We successfully executed on our TSR strategy plus and delivered a total shareholder return of 9.4% for 2015, in a very tough and volatile market. In December, we unveiled our 2020 vision at our Investor Day, focusing on owning and operating high-quality U.S. properties in the major metro markets where we have deep concentration. We also continue to execute on our redevelopment pipeline and select ground-up development projects. Our 2020 vision includes operating with a more conservative capital structure, with plenty of liquidity and even stronger debt metrics than today. Finally, as an added benefit, we have the upside potential from our PLUS business. Position is clear. The team is focused and aligned. 
Now for some details on our fourth quarter and full year results and further color regarding our 2016 earnings guidance. Our FFO is adjusted per-share or recurring FFO, which excludes nonoperating impairments and transactional income and expense, was $0.37 for the fourth quarter, an increase of 5.7% compared to last year's $0.35. The increase was driven by higher NOI from the operating portfolio of $24.8 million, offset by $4.4 million of decreased management fees related to the significant reduction in joint ventures and higher G&A associated with severance charges, attributable to our anticipated exit of Canada. In addition, interest expense was higher by $5.6 million, primarily from the debt assumptions related to the Kimstone acquisition earlier in the year, the recent JV buyouts of Crow and SEB and the acquisition of the Christown property in Phoenix.
Our full year 2015 FFO as adjusted per share came in at $1.46, achieving the high end of our revised guidance range and $0.06 above last year's result of $1.40, a 4.3% increase. Headline FFO per share representing the official NAREIT definition was $0.35 for the fourth quarter, in line with first call consensus estimates. Headline FFO per share was $0.02 lower than FFO as adjusted, primarily related to the $5.8 million noncash charge for the redemption of our $175 million, 6.9% series H preferred stock redemption during the quarter and the acquisition-related costs. Our full year 2015 headline FFO per share came in at $1.56, achieving the upper end of our guidance range and a $0.01 ahead of first call consensus. Our 2015 results were $0.11 higher than the 2014 amount of $1.45 per share, a 7.6% increase. The primary drivers of the headline per share increase are the $0.06 increase in recurring FFO and the gain on the sale of our SUPERVALU stock investment, which contributed $40 million or $0.10 per share. Acquisition cost and nonoperating impairments offset these increases. As Conor just articulated, the operating portfolio delivered solid results with improved occupancy, our 23rd consecutive quarter of delivering positive U.S. same-site NOI growth and double-digit leasing spreads. 
Ross Cooper and his team were very active during the quarter on the disposition front. We completed the sale-of-interest in 64 U.S. properties, 23 Canadian properties and our last asset in South America generating proceeds of approximately $600 million, which we used to fund the $175 million redemption of preferred stock, pay down debt and fund the acquisitions. We remain focused and committed to operate with a strong capital structure. We finished the fourth quarter with consolidated net debt to recurring EBITDA of 6x, the high-end of our 5.5 to 6x range, down from the 6.6x at the end of the first quarter, after acquiring $1.4 billion Kimstone portfolio.
We achieved this level even with the redemption of the preferred stock, which had a 0.2x impact on the metric. As part of our 2020 vision, over time, we plan to reduce the consolidated net debt to recurring EBITDA to a range of 5x to 5.5x, and on a look-through basis, including pro-rata JV debt and preferred stock to a range of 6.4x to 6.9x, with a fixed charge coverage of 3x plus. 
During the fourth quarter, we tapped the bond market issuing a $500 million 7-year 3.4% fixed-rate bond. Our liquidity position is in excellent shape, ending the year with 0 outstanding on our $1.75 billion revolving credit facility and over $180 million in cash. We have already begun to address our 2016 maturities, both consolidated and in our JVs, which are anticipated to be funded with sales proceeds, the unsecured bank and bond markets and mortgage financings, all at lower coupons than the maturing debt.
We are reaffirming our guidance for 2016, which was provided at our Investor Day in December. Our FFO is adjusted or recurring FFO per share range is $1.48 to $1.52, and our headline FFO per share range is $1.54 to $1.62. The guidance range takes into account the significant level of dispositions throughout 2015, and the accelerated exit of Canada during 2016, which has a combined impact of $0.06 to $0.07 per share on the 2016 growth expectations. We anticipate that by the end of 2016, we will be a purely U.S. owner and operator with assets concentrated in our key metro markets. The transactional expense and income included in the headline guidance range, but not in the recurring range, is primarily comprised of acquisition costs and the commencement of monetizing our Albertsons investment. As such, the transactional income portion is heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter of 2016. The guidance range is sensitive to timing of acquisitions, dispositions, redevelopments coming online, lease-up and financing initiatives. Our 2016 plan supports our recently increased common dividend level of $0.255 per quarter, which equates to an FFO payout ratio in the upper 60% range. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Milton."

Most of our strategic development has a story to them, and we feel very confident about why we think it's appropriate to add these to the pipeline. If you go asset-by-asset, they each have a reason why -- the one in Fort Lauderdale is right across from our most successful shopping center in the state of Florida, and the demand has been off-the-charts there. If you look at the Christiana, Delaware, it's right along 95, where we've been working to rezone that from a former Sears warehouse to now a retail offering, and it's right next to GGP's successful Christiana Mall. So each and every one of these projects has a story to it. And there is not going to be significant more development in our pipeline looking out, mainly because the land prices have really skyrocketed. A lot of that's due to the multifamily that we've seen pop up. But we see the demand from our retailers to want to grow store count and the limited supply. So each of these projects has really -- it's within a key market for us. The demand is there. And the one in Houston, obviously, with Houston going through some headwinds, we still see retailers wanting to be there and fill a void. Clearly, the apartments and the density around our Grand Parkway project has been there for a long period of time, and I think the retail was the last sector to really catch up to meet the demand. So we haven't seen any falloff in terms of retailer demand there, and that will actually be one of our first development projects out of the ground and we're cautiously optimistic that it will be a big success."

We think that TJX has been really the phenomenal performer for many, many years now. And if you look back not too long ago, the market cap of TJX and Ross combined was relatively small compared to some of the mall anchors, and if you just compare it to today, it's really phenomenal, just the growth that they have achieved. The new players we're watching closely. You want to try and pick best-in-class and have the merchandising mix that enhances the shopping center and the amount of traffic it drives. So we're cautiously optimistic that I think that more competition is good for the off-price sector. We clearly favor the ones that have the proven business model and have been doing it for many, many years. But going forward, it will be an interesting situation to watch to see who really can capture some of that market share. TJX obviously has such a lead. And now Ross is really ramping up their expansion plans. And then if you look at Nordstrom Rack and then some of the Saks OFF 5TH, Fine from Lord & Taylor, there is a lot of players out there that are trying to really gain market share.

So on your question on Lidl, it's an interesting one, we met with them and talked to them about their plans. Most of their plans are self-development. So they've actually looking to self-develop standalone grocery stores, where they can be competitors to the traditional grocery stores at a lower price point. So most of what they've been doing is tying up land and looking to self-develop. So they have a little bit of a different approach to it than say some of your traditional grocer who is looking to lease space.

I mean, if you think about the initial guidance that we put out last year, right. We were in this 3 to 3.5 range. We brought to the whole year, we came in at 3.1.

We were in this 3 to 3.5 range. We brought to the whole year, we came in at 3.1. Anna's -- as Conor mentioned -- Anna's and A&P really hit us about 50 basis points. So we would have achieved the high end of the range, but bankruptcies happen. The guidance range does incorporate a modest amount, not a lot, of bankruptcies, so if you get to the midpoint, we think there should be a very, very modest amount. If there is a large-scale bankruptcy, you probably would have a nick on us and you'd probably wind up towards the lower end of the range. If it stays stable and the lease-up happens where we think, we can get to the mid- to upper end of the range."

First, I'd like to thank Milton and the board for giving me the opportunity to lead this incredible company. At our recent Investor Day, we laid our 2020 vision, underscoring the work we've done over the last several years to position Kimco",1307,"Good morning. First, I'd like to thank Milton and the board for giving me the opportunity to lead this incredible company. At our recent Investor Day, we laid our 2020 vision, underscoring the work we've done over the last several years to position Kimco to take full advantage of the evolving landscape of open-air retail and become a leader in our industry. Our team has executed over the past few years dramatically transforming the portfolio from a scattered collection of assets across the U.S., Mexico, South America and Canada to now a tightly concentrated footprint of high-quality asset clusters in the major metro markets in the U.S., where we see the highest growth potential.
The top U.S. markets showcased the highest growth in population, household income, education, both significant barriers to entry and present the most potential to add value for our shareholders. All of our resources are now laser focused on what we do best, owning, managing, leasing and redeveloping assets here in the U.S. to drive net asset value. Our portfolio has 2 distinct advantages: First, we have a 37% mark-to-market opportunity that is unmatched due to the low in-place average base rent and the spread to market that we can unlock by recapturing and repurposing assets to meet the need of today's shopper; second, we have more raw material to work with. The large collection of assets we own provides numerous redevelopment opportunities through densification, adding grocery components to our power centers and adding technology to extend the hours of our shopping centers to fulfill the everyday needs of our shoppers, 24/7.
Our 2020 vision provides the roadmap for how we plan to take the company to new heights in the next 5 years. The 3 main pillars of our strategy are simple. First, it starts with management. We have to continue to motivate and empower the best talent in the industry and create a vibrant and rewarding place to work. Second, the balance sheet. We have to be stewards of capital by keeping a watchful eye on our cost of capital, so we can invest wisely and position the balance sheet to weather any storm. Finally, a major focus on NAV per share growth. In the major metro markets in the U.S., asset values are close to peak or even above prior peak pricing, as a healthy balance in supply and demand continues for open-air centers. We believe the best use of our capital is to take full advantage of that demand and redevelop our assets to drive outsized growth by leaning on our tremendous team, fulfilling our redevelopment opportunities and executing on our select strategic developments.
We have planted the seeds to redevelopment and development to bring to life assets that will significantly enhance the value and quality of our overall portfolio. We will continue to remain disciplined. Pre-leasing, phasing and ground leasing are just a few of our risk management tools that are in place to analyze each and every investment opportunity versus our cost of capital and to ensure we generate the highest returns for our shareholders. The future is bright, and we're passionate about delivering for our shareholders. 
Turning to our results for the fourth quarter and the full year, I will give a brief overview of our portfolio metrics, a quick update on acquisitions and dispositions, followed by an update on redevelopments. U.S. occupancy at the end of 2015 was 95.8%, up 20 basis points from last quarter and 10 basis points from the beginning of the year, driven in large part by the small shop recovery. Small shop occupancy is 88.7%, up 70 basis points from last quarter and from the beginning of the year. U.S. leasing spreads continue to display the mark-to-market opportunity at Kimco, with an impressive 31% on new leases and a combined leasing spread of 13.1% in the fourth quarter, the highest combined spread in almost 3 years. U.S. same-site NOI growth was 2.8% for the quarter, primarily driven by minimum rent increases and a 20-basis-point positive impact from redevelopment. 
For the full year, U.S. same-site NOI growth is 3.1%, including a 50-basis-point negative impact from bankruptcies experienced over the year.
The average base rent for the U.S. portfolio continues to improve with a 5.2% gain from the prior year-end. Competition continues to be fierce in our top markets for acquisitions, with some staggering cap rates recently reported in areas of California. This bodes well for the NAV of our holdings in California, which is our largest state by NOI contribution and continues to direct us to deploy capital towards redevelopment of our existing assets versus acquiring in the open market. 
For the year, our total gross acquisitions of $2.1 billion is heavily weighted toward the purchase of our joint venture interest in 57 assets. In contrast, only 2 assets were acquired in the open market for a purchase price of $155 million. The disposition market remains healthy, as we completed a total gross disposition value of $2.2 billion for the year. We completed the exit from Mexico and South America and announced the closing of the RioCan JV transaction in Canada. That will pave the way to achieving our goal of simplifying the company to be strictly U.S. focused by year-end.
In the U.S., we completed the sale of 95 properties in 2015, for a gross price of $762 million, at a blended 6.9% cap rate. Pricing expectations for our disposition candidates have not changed, as we continue to see the demand for high-quality anchored open-air shopping centers. Our redevelopment program remains the focal point of our strategy. For the year, we budgeted $189 million of projects, delivering a 10.6% incremental return. We're pleased to announce that due to some cost savings, we came in under-budget on costs of $184 million and above budget on NOI, improving the incremental return to 11.3% for the year. Perhaps the most exciting redevelopment completion this quarter is this [indiscernible] opening in our flagship Long Island asset, Airport Plaza and Farmingdale. Early indications from stus [ph] and shoppers are incredible, and from the video footage of the parking lot, we think the benefit of this grocery addition to an existing power center will produce significant NAV and same-site NOI improvement for years to come.
In Florida, we also had successful openings of Publix at our Palm Beach redevelopment and Whole Foods at our redevelopment in Orlando. Out west, we signed 2 new leases with Trader Joe's, one in California and one in Washington. These tremendous grocery additions improve the percent of AVR from grocery-anchored centers to 72%, up from 65% at prior year-end.
To be the best, we continue to question the status quo and take a deep dive into every aspect of operations to help drive results. Open-air retail continues to evolve and embrace omni-channel, as a physical store has proven to be a driver of online sales. Our retailers know their customer better than anyone inside their 4 walls, and our job is to bring more people to the shopping center and get those consumers to come back time and time again. The open-air retail landscape is healthy, as limited new supply is forecasted and our strongest retailers continue to grow store count. The shadow supply from potential closings or consolidating retailers and future redevelopment supply is what we are monitoring closely. 
Looking ahead, we are starting to see the activity pick up at every category size. Big-box retailers are back looking for space. Junior box players continue to be the most aggressive. Traditional and specialty groceries are active and our small shop leasing indicates a healthy trajectory. All of these ingredients indicate we are well positioned to unlock the value of our real estate for our shareholders.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Glenn to revise more granularity on our results."

It's going to be a fun go for us all. Good morning to everyone. We finished 2015 with a solid fourth quarter, delivering strong results for the full year, while furthering our transformation",971,"Thanks, Conor, and congratulations on your appointment to CEO. It's going to be a fun go for us all. Good morning to everyone. 
We finished 2015 with a solid fourth quarter, delivering strong results for the full year, while furthering our transformation and simplification efforts. We successfully executed on our TSR strategy plus and delivered a total shareholder return of 9.4% for 2015, in a very tough and volatile market. In December, we unveiled our 2020 vision at our Investor Day, focusing on owning and operating high-quality U.S. properties in the major metro markets where we have deep concentration. We also continue to execute on our redevelopment pipeline and select ground-up development projects. Our 2020 vision includes operating with a more conservative capital structure, with plenty of liquidity and even stronger debt metrics than today. Finally, as an added benefit, we have the upside potential from our PLUS business. Position is clear. The team is focused and aligned. 
Now for some details on our fourth quarter and full year results and further color regarding our 2016 earnings guidance. Our FFO is adjusted per-share or recurring FFO, which excludes nonoperating impairments and transactional income and expense, was $0.37 for the fourth quarter, an increase of 5.7% compared to last year's $0.35. The increase was driven by higher NOI from the operating portfolio of $24.8 million, offset by $4.4 million of decreased management fees related to the significant reduction in joint ventures and higher G&A associated with severance charges, attributable to our anticipated exit of Canada. In addition, interest expense was higher by $5.6 million, primarily from the debt assumptions related to the Kimstone acquisition earlier in the year, the recent JV buyouts of Crow and SEB and the acquisition of the Christown property in Phoenix.
Our full year 2015 FFO as adjusted per share came in at $1.46, achieving the high end of our revised guidance range and $0.06 above last year's result of $1.40, a 4.3% increase. Headline FFO per share representing the official NAREIT definition was $0.35 for the fourth quarter, in line with first call consensus estimates. Headline FFO per share was $0.02 lower than FFO as adjusted, primarily related to the $5.8 million noncash charge for the redemption of our $175 million, 6.9% series H preferred stock redemption during the quarter and the acquisition-related costs. Our full year 2015 headline FFO per share came in at $1.56, achieving the upper end of our guidance range and a $0.01 ahead of first call consensus. Our 2015 results were $0.11 higher than the 2014 amount of $1.45 per share, a 7.6% increase. The primary drivers of the headline per share increase are the $0.06 increase in recurring FFO and the gain on the sale of our SUPERVALU stock investment, which contributed $40 million or $0.10 per share. Acquisition cost and nonoperating impairments offset these increases. As Conor just articulated, the operating portfolio delivered solid results with improved occupancy, our 23rd consecutive quarter of delivering positive U.S. same-site NOI growth and double-digit leasing spreads. 
Ross Cooper and his team were very active during the quarter on the disposition front. We completed the sale-of-interest in 64 U.S. properties, 23 Canadian properties and our last asset in South America generating proceeds of approximately $600 million, which we used to fund the $175 million redemption of preferred stock, pay down debt and fund the acquisitions. We remain focused and committed to operate with a strong capital structure. We finished the fourth quarter with consolidated net debt to recurring EBITDA of 6x, the high-end of our 5.5 to 6x range, down from the 6.6x at the end of the first quarter, after acquiring $1.4 billion Kimstone portfolio.
We achieved this level even with the redemption of the preferred stock, which had a 0.2x impact on the metric. As part of our 2020 vision, over time, we plan to reduce the consolidated net debt to recurring EBITDA to a range of 5x to 5.5x, and on a look-through basis, including pro-rata JV debt and preferred stock to a range of 6.4x to 6.9x, with a fixed charge coverage of 3x plus. 
During the fourth quarter, we tapped the bond market issuing a $500 million 7-year 3.4% fixed-rate bond. Our liquidity position is in excellent shape, ending the year with 0 outstanding on our $1.75 billion revolving credit facility and over $180 million in cash. We have already begun to address our 2016 maturities, both consolidated and in our JVs, which are anticipated to be funded with sales proceeds, the unsecured bank and bond markets and mortgage financings, all at lower coupons than the maturing debt.
We are reaffirming our guidance for 2016, which was provided at our Investor Day in December. Our FFO is adjusted or recurring FFO per share range is $1.48 to $1.52, and our headline FFO per share range is $1.54 to $1.62. The guidance range takes into account the significant level of dispositions throughout 2015, and the accelerated exit of Canada during 2016, which has a combined impact of $0.06 to $0.07 per share on the 2016 growth expectations. We anticipate that by the end of 2016, we will be a purely U.S. owner and operator with assets concentrated in our key metro markets. The transactional expense and income included in the headline guidance range, but not in the recurring range, is primarily comprised of acquisition costs and the commencement of monetizing our Albertsons investment. As such, the transactional income portion is heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter of 2016. The guidance range is sensitive to timing of acquisitions, dispositions, redevelopments coming online, lease-up and financing initiatives. Our 2016 plan supports our recently increased common dividend level of $0.255 per quarter, which equates to an FFO payout ratio in the upper 60% range. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Milton."

Most of our strategic development has a story to them, and we feel very confident about why we think it's appropriate to add these to the pipeline. If you go asset-by-asset, they each have a reason why -- the one in Fort Lauderdale is right across from our most successful shopping center in the state of Florida, and the demand has been off-the-charts there. If you look at the Christiana, Delaware, it's right along 95, where we've been working to rezone that from a former Sears warehouse to now a retail offering, and it's right next to GGP's successful Christiana Mall. So each and every one of these projects has a story to it. And there is not going to be significant more development in our pipeline looking out, mainly because the land prices have really skyrocketed. A lot of that's due to the multifamily that we've seen pop up. But we see the demand from our retailers to want to grow store count and the limited supply. So each of these projects has really -- it's within a key market for us. The demand is there. And the one in Houston, obviously, with Houston going through some headwinds, we still see retailers wanting to be there and fill a void. Clearly, the apartments and the density around our Grand Parkway project has been there for a long period of time, and I think the retail was the last sector to really catch up to meet the demand. So we haven't seen any falloff in terms of retailer demand there, and that will actually be one of our first development projects out of the ground and we're cautiously optimistic that it will be a big success."

We think that TJX has been really the phenomenal performer for many, many years now. And if you look back not too long ago, the market cap of TJX and Ross combined was relatively small compared to some of the mall anchors, and if you just compare it to today, it's really phenomenal, just the growth that they have achieved. The new players we're watching closely. You want to try and pick best-in-class and have the merchandising mix that enhances the shopping center and the amount of traffic it drives. So we're cautiously optimistic that I think that more competition is good for the off-price sector. We clearly favor the ones that have the proven business model and have been doing it for many, many years. But going forward, it will be an interesting situation to watch to see who really can capture some of that market share. TJX obviously has such a lead. And now Ross is really ramping up their expansion plans. And then if you look at Nordstrom Rack and then some of the Saks OFF 5TH, Fine from Lord & Taylor, there is a lot of players out there that are trying to really gain market share.

But there is going to be plenty of aggressive entrants into that market in the Mid-Atlantic and you named, pretty much the majors that are all coming, and coming in droves. So on your question on Lidl, it's an interesting one, we met with them and talked to them about their plans. Most of their plans are self-development. So they've actually looking to self-develop standalone grocery stores, where they can be competitors to the traditional grocery stores at a lower price point. So most of what they've been doing is tying up land and looking to self-develop. So they have a little bit of a different approach to it than say some of your traditional grocer who is looking to lease space.

I mean, if you think about the initial guidance that we put out last year, right. We were in this 3 to 3.5 range. We brought to the whole year, we came in at 3.1.

So we would have achieved the high end of the range, but bankruptcies happen. The guidance range does incorporate a modest amount, not a lot, of bankruptcies, so if you get to the midpoint, we think there should be a very, very modest amount. If there is a large-scale bankruptcy, you probably would have a nick on us and you'd probably wind up towards the lower end of the range. If it stays stable and the lease-up happens where we think, we can get to the mid- to upper end of the range."

It really is a function of supply and demand, and we continue to see pretty strong leasing spreads. But if you look at the pure tick-up in market rents, it's at the high end of our range, where we expected it to be and continue to see it improve, as retailers really have focused on making sure to try and penetrate these markets, but also not lose stores.

Today, we plan to keep our prepared remarks short and sweet. We are firing on all cylinders as we drive toward achieving our 2020 vision and focus on long-term shareholder value. The first quarter highlights the",1095,"Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Today, we plan to keep our prepared remarks short and sweet. We are firing on all cylinders as we drive toward achieving our 2020 vision and focus on long-term shareholder value. The first quarter highlights the execution of all aspects of our strategy as we focus less on short-term earnings and more on creating long-term net asset value. Our disposition and acquisition activity continues to produce a higher quality portfolio. This higher quality is reflected in our leasing production as we continue to attract premier tenants at higher rents. 
Our redevelopment and development activity continues to create value and opportunity, unlocking the highest and best use of the real estates. And we do all of this with a cautious and watchful eye on our balance sheet and our cost of capital. Now for some details. In the first quarter, we continue to execute on our disposition strategy by closing on $323 million of dispositions in Canada and $114 million of dispositions in the U.S. The blended average cap rate was 6.9% in the first quarter and quality buyers ranging from public REITs, private REITs, local private real estate groups, high net worth individuals, international buyers and trade buyers all continue to call through our disposition portfolio. 
We are in the ninth inning of our transformation, so with the majority of our Canadian portfolio under contracts and the products to date on our U.S. dispositions, we are on pace to hit our target of $400 million to $475 million of dispositions in the U.S. and $425 million to $500 million in Canada by year-end and complete the transformation of the portfolio. Turning to acquisitions. Our first quarter concluded with limited volume, reflecting the competitiveness in our target markets. After quarter-end, we did reach agreements to purchase our JV partner's interest in Oakwood Plaza and the adjacent Dania Pointe development site. These sites combined to offer over 2 miles of frontage to our I-95 in the Fort Lauderdale Miami corridor. Oakwood is 100% occupied, but reflects what we look for in our target markets. 
Irreplaceable real estate with below-market rents, significant sales volumes and future redevelopment opportunity. Dania is the adjacent development site that we now control and are happy to take this opportunity to announce the ground lease with Costco to and anchor the first phase and kick off the pre-leasing. Both Oakwood and Dania are key building blocks to our 2020 Vision, creating value on larger assets in markets with high various entry. Oakwood is now our #2 NOI producer and upon stabilization, Dania will be the #1 NOI contributor in the entire portfolio. 
The strong leasing demand for quality real estate highlights the positive supply and demand in balance that the open-air sector is currently enjoying. Keeping occupancy steady at 95.8% over prior quarter, validates the portfolio of quality and the quality of our leasing team as we typically experience an early year dip due to post-holiday closings. Retailer demand did not change during the stock market correction in the first quarter and we continue to see demand across all square footage categories. The volume of new deals this quarter included big-box retailers, grocery stores and off-price retailers, all enhancing the merchandising mix and improving net asset value. 
Target, Whole Foods, Giant and Trader Joe's are just a few examples of executed leases this quarter that positively impacts NAV. A high number of our new deals this quarter, including the targeted Whole Foods deals are taking currently occupied space. So while we will have a short-term hit in same-site NOI and do not pick up any occupancy, we do pick up a material improvement in NAV. In addition, these quality tenants create a halo effect in our centers, which allow Kimco to achieve outsized growth from the surrounding retail. New leases were signed at an average base rent of $21 a foot reflecting the embedded mark the market opportunities while compared to our current average base rent. Kimco's average base rent is now $14.167 [ph], a 4.8% increase over Q1 2015 and a 27.9% increase over Q1 2010. 
While we are currently enjoying a 38-year low in supply, we are monitoring the shadow supply pipeline closely. Recent bankruptcies and announced store closings, in addition to pending mergers, will be the primary driver of increased supply in the short run for both mall and open-air centers. This is not new to our sector. What is new is that at Kimco today, our transformed high-quality portfolio makes us more ready and better prepared for these situations. That is why we are approaching the Sports Authority liquidation with cautious optimism. 
Preliminary indications suggest that we will be significant demand for our boxes, if and when they revert back to us. redevelopments completed in the first quarter will deliver incremental NOI of $2.3 million with an ROI of 11.5%. Redevelopment remains the best use of our capital and Kimco's billion-dollar pipeline continues to cycle more projects from the entitlement stage to the active pipeline as additional opportunities are constantly being discovered within the existing portfolio. 
The amount of raw material in our portfolio and the focus on value creation has given rise to a shadow pipeline of additional redevelopment projects that account for roughly $2 billion of future projects. Acting upon the embedded opportunity will serve our long-term shareholders by adding value to best-in-class properties. Turning to development. We recently had 2 major milestones, by securing the Target deal at our Grand Parkway development in Texas and today, announcing the Costco ground lease at our Dania development projects in Florida. 
These anchors have just started the pre-leasing for the first phases of both projects. Due to the lack of new supply and a strong demand from open-air retailers, we continue to aggressively pre-lease our strategic development projects. Each development site has a date of plan in-place to better monitor and ensure that our investment remains accretive to our cost of capital and to provide off ramps to keep maximum flexibility. In 
closing, we continue to march toward our 2020 Vision of being a U.S. focus REIT, with large pockets of concentration and high barrier to entry markets. The team is working overtime to unlock value at the property level to lease up and mark-to-market opportunities, continuing to expand and deliver on the redevelopment pipeline and executing on the strategic development pipeline, all while positioning the balance sheet to be in a position of strength now and for the next cycle. 
Glenn will now take you through the details of the first quarter."

We continue to execute on all fronts: leasing, dispositions, redevelopment and development activity and further strengthening of our balance sheet metrics. These are the primary ingredients needed to achieve our 2020 Vision. Headline FFO per diluted share, which represents the official NAREIT definition was $0.38, up from $0.37 last year and $0.01 [ph] higher than first call consensus. The improved performance is attributable to a 5.2% increase in U.S. net operating income, which was substantially offset by the reduction in NOI from the Canadian dispositions. 
Lower G&A expense and lower financing costs attributable to the redemption of the 6.9% preferred stock last year also contributed to the growth. Included in the headline result is a profit participation from the sale of our Canadian preferred equity investment of $5.5 million. FFO as adjusted or recurring FFO, which excludes nonoperating impairments and transactional income and expense was $0.37 per diluted share for the first quarter, up from $0.36 last year, a 2.8% increase. We accomplished this growth level despite the $0.03 per share dilutive impact from our portfolio transformation. 
The portfolio transformation includes the substantial disposition of assets in Latin America and Canada totaling $900 million and $600 million of U.S. dispositions in just the last 12 months. The diluted impact was more than offset with the reduced financing costs and $1.4 billion of acquisitions of high-quality assets in our key markets. Many of the acquisitions were sourced from our joint venture programs. Our portfolio operating team delivered solid first quarter results, maintaining our anchored and occupancy at 98.2% and increasing small shop space by 40 basis points from a year-ago to 88.6%. 
We remain on target for small shop occupancy to reach 90% by year-end. We continue to deliver strong leasing spreads, up 19.1% for new leases, up 6.3% for renewals and options and 7.5% combined. U.S. same-site NOI growth is 1.5% and includes a credit loss reserve of $3.2 million or 140 basis points related to the bankruptcy filing by Sports Authority. This reserve amount includes 100% of all prepetition amounts and $811,000 of rent from March which remains unpaid. Even with the short-term impact in Sports Authority, we remain on track and reaffirm our full-year U.S. same-site NOI guidance range of an increase of 2.5% to 3.5%. 
Additionally, in an effort to give the analyst and investor community further information for comparability purposes, we have included in our supplemental package the same-site disclosures of straight line rent adjustments, lease termination fees and amortization of above and below market rents. As Part of our 2020 Vision, we are laser-focused on further improving our debt metrics with a target of 5 to 5.5x for consolidated net debt through occurring EBITDA and a fixed charge coverage of 3x plus. 
In the last 12 months, we have reduced our net debt by $560 million from $5.5 billion to $4.94 billion at March 31. At the end of the first quarter, net debt to recurring EBITDA is 5.9x, down from 6.6x a year ago and fixed charge coverage came in at 3.2x. We repaid over $400 million of maturing debt during the first quarter and we paid an additional $117 million of mortgage debt in April, leaving us with just about $250 million in remaining consolidated maturities for the balance of the year. 
A portion of the debt repayment was accomplished with $138.5 million of proceeds raised from the issuance of 4.96 million shares of common equity through our ATM program and a weighted average offering price of $28.20 per share during March and April. As another data point, at the end of the first quarter, our total debt to total market capitalization was down to 28%, the lowest level in the past 8 years. 
Based on the solid first quarter results, we are reaffirming our headline FFO per share guidance range of $1.54 to $1.62. Please keep in mind that the bulk of the transactional income for 2016 is anticipated to occur late in the fourth quarter. We're also reaffirming our FFO as adjusted per-share of guidance range of $1.58 to $1.52 and a midpoint of $1.50 per share and each of our operating guidance assumptions. 
And with that, we'd be happy to answer your questions."

As you know, one of our strategies is to really own more of our assets 100%, give us total control of our destiny. And this especially was true with Oakwood and Dania. Oakwood is where we have an office, so we have physical presence there. And so we realize that with Oakwood and Dania, we have a unique opportunity to really enhance the value of both assets of what we're trying to do, both at Oakwood and at Dania. So we've been proactive with all of our partners and this one was opportunistic for us to strike and really take CPP out of the transaction early on in this stage. So we were able to buy CPP out of the development side at their basis, which we thought was extremely opportunistic. And now that we have Costco fully executed, we think that it's just the beginning of a strong pre-leasing effort for the first phase. And the second phase now that we have complete control, gives us the ability to really take a step back and look at what's the highest and best use for the property if we want to sell off parcel, if we want to self-develop more parcels or if we want to do higher density, we have that luxury now, which before, we probably have the inability to do so because of the partnership. So we feel like it gives us more flexibility, and it continues to allow us to focus on larger assets with significant both development and redevelopment activity. So that's a little bit of the history there. In terms of the concentration, you're right that it's going to be in terms of our size, the #1 and #2 producing properties in the portfolio. But we also have tremendous pockets of concentration in California and New York. And with future redevelopments at Westlake and as well as some of our other larger assets, I think that there will be other larger assets that may challenge the #1 and #2 distinction that were given Dania and Oakwood. And so we always want to look and see and make sure we're diversified accordingly. So if it becomes too concentrated, we'll have, hopefully the luxury of looking at alternative ideas there of what we should do."

A third one is in Staten Island, which is probably the last piece of Richmond redevelopment that's where we did the large target redevelopment and this was the last phase. We have a deal improved at RSC committees with retailers to split the 1/4 [ph] best-in-class of specialty grocer to take half of it and another best-in-class off-price user to just take the other half. So final A&P store is actually under contract to be sold to an end-user.

Many of the off-price concepts have multiple flags. So they can take the whole box and do multiple uses in that box as well. We also have the opportunity to add grocery to 15 of our 25 locations. So we've obviously, pinned that down in the priority for us to see if we can create some value there as well and we're working with some of the specialty grocers as well as some traditional grocers to take those boxes. So again, the average base rent for all 25 are under $15 a foot. These are all locations that we think are very much in demand and there's very little supply out there. So whether it's going to be a competitor that just buys the lease, and has to live with the existing used cost or is an off-price user or a grocery store, there's also some interest from some of the home improvement sector as well from some of their smaller boxes.

I think that when you look at sort of a transactional environment in general, we're definitely seeing continued strength in competition and aggressive pricing for the core products. Anything that has a value add or achievable redevelopment or growth story, there's still an immense amount of capital chasing those deals. When we look at our transactions on the disposition side, I'd say that the biggest challenge that we're finding is generating a deep buyer pool on some of the secondary market assets. The ones that are really stable income streams with no growth and no grocer, I would say that we are seeing a little bit of a more shallow buyer pool. But I think that's sort of where the private REITs are really controlling and being aggressive in that market. So to a certain extent, I think we're missing those buyers, but that being said, we are still getting enough of an auction going where we're able to achieve our cap rates and our objectives. So I think when you compare the cap rates this quarter as Conor mentioned sort of blended, we're still in the very high 6s, may be low 7s in some cases on the dispositions, but we still feel very good about our ability to get that sold. We're not seeing any real material retrading obviously, oneoff opportunities, you'll see them here and there. But I don't think there's any major general trends. So we're optimistic that we'll continue to hit our targets for the rest of the year."

Today, we plan to keep our prepared remarks short and sweet. We are firing on all cylinders as we drive toward achieving our 2020 vision and focus on long-term shareholder value. The first quarter highlights the e",1084,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Today, we plan to keep our prepared remarks short and sweet. We are firing on all cylinders as we drive toward achieving our 2020 vision and focus on long-term shareholder value. The first quarter highlights the execution of all aspects of our strategy as we focus less on short-term earnings and more on creating long-term net asset value. Our disposition and acquisition activity continues to produce a higher-quality portfolio. This higher quality is reflected in our leasing production as we continue to attract premier tenants at higher rents.
Our redevelopment and development activity continues to create value and opportunity, unlocking the highest and best use of the real estates. And we do all of this with a cautious and watchful eye on our balance sheet and our cost of capital.
Now for some details. In the first quarter, we continued to execute on our disposition strategy by closing on $323 million of dispositions in Canada and $114 million of dispositions in the U.S. The blended average cap rate was 6.9% in the first quarter and quality buyers ranging from public REITs, private REITs, local private real estate groups, high-net-worth individuals, international buyers and trade buyers all continue to call through our disposition portfolio.
We are in the ninth inning of our transformation. And with the majority of our Canadian portfolio under contracts and the products to date on our U.S. dispositions, we are on pace to hit our target of $400 million to $475 million of dispositions in the U.S. and $425 million to $500 million in Canada by year-end and complete the transformation of the portfolio.
Turning to acquisitions. Our first quarter concluded with limited volume, reflecting the competitiveness in our target markets. After quarter-end, we did reach agreements to purchase our JV partner's interest in Oakwood Plaza and the adjacent Dania Pointe development site. These sites combined to offer over 2 miles of frontage along I-95 in the Fort Lauderdale-Miami corridor. Oakwood is 100% occupied, but reflects what we look for in our target markets, irreplaceable real estate with below-market rents, significant sales volumes and future redevelopment opportunity. Dania is the adjacent development site that we now control and are happy to take this opportunity to announce the ground lease with Costco to anchor the first phase and kick off the pre-leasing. Both Oakwood and Dania are key building blocks to our 2020 Vision, creating value on larger assets in markets with high barriers to entry. Oakwood is now our #2 NOI producer. And upon stabilization, Dania will be the #1 NOI contributor in the entire portfolio.
The strong leasing demand for quality real estate highlights the positive supply and demand imbalance that the open-air sector is currently enjoying. Keeping occupancy steady at 95.8% over prior quarter validates the portfolio of quality and the quality of our leasing team as we typically experience an early year dip due to post-holiday closings. Retailer demands did not change during the stock market correction in the first quarter, and we continue to see demand across all square footage categories. The volume of new deals this quarter included big-box retailers, grocery stores and off-price retailers, all enhancing the merchandising mix and improving net asset value.
Target, Whole Foods, Giant and Trader Joe's are just a few examples of executed leases this quarter that positively impacts NAV. A high number of our new deals this quarter, including the Target/Whole Foods deals, are taking currently occupied space. So while we will have a short-term hit in same-site NOI and do not pick up any occupancy, we do pick up a material improvement in NAV. In addition, these quality tenants create a halo effect in our centers, which allow Kimco to achieve outsized growth from the surrounding retail.
New leases were signed at an average base rent of $21 a foot, reflecting the embedded mark-to-market opportunities while compared to our current average base rent. Kimco's average base rent is now $14.67, a 4.8% increase over Q1 2015 and a 27.9% increase over Q1 in 2010.
While we are currently enjoying a 38-year low in supply, we are monitoring the shadow supply pipeline closely. Recent bankruptcies and announced store closings, in addition to pending mergers, will be the primary driver of increased supply in the short run for both mall and open-air centers. This is not new to our sector. What is new is that at Kimco today, our transformed high-quality portfolio makes us more ready and better prepared for these situations. That is why we are approaching the Sports Authority liquidation with cautious optimism.
Preliminary indications suggest that there will be significant demand for our boxes, if and when they revert back to us. Redevelopments completed in the first quarter will deliver incremental NOI of $2.3 million with an ROI of 11.5%. Redevelopment remains the best use of our capital, and Kimco's billion-dollar pipeline continues to cycle more projects from the entitlement stage to the active pipeline as additional opportunities are constantly being discovered within the existing portfolio.
The amount of raw material in our portfolio and the focus on value creation has given rise to a shadow pipeline of additional redevelopment projects that account for roughly $2 billion of future projects. Acting upon the embedded opportunity will serve our long-term shareholders by adding value to best-in-class properties.
Turning to development. We recently hit 2 major milestones by securing the Target deal at our Grand Parkway development in Texas, and today, announcing the Costco ground lease at our Dania development project in Florida. These anchors have jump-started the pre-leasing for the first phases of both projects. Due to the lack of new supply and the strong demand from open-air retailers, we continue to aggressively pre-lease our strategic development projects. Each development sites has a phasing plan in place to better monitor and ensure that our investment remains accretive to our cost of capital and to provide off-ramps to keep maximum flexibility.
In closing, we continue to march toward our 2020 vision of being a U.S. focus REIT with large pockets of concentration and high barrier to entry markets. The team is working overtime to unlock value at the property level through lease up and mark-to-market opportunities, continuing to expand and deliver on the redevelopment pipeline and executing on the strategic development pipeline, all while positioning the balance sheet to be in a position of strength now and for the next cycle.
Glenn will now take you through the detail of the first quarter."

We continue to execute on all fronts: leasing, dispositions, redevelopment and development activity and further strengthening of our balance sheet metrics. These are the primary ingredients needed to achieve our 2020 Vision. Headline FFO per diluted share, which represents the official NAREIT definition, was $0.38, up from $0.37 last year and $0.01 higher than first call consensus. The improved performance is attributable to a 5.2% increase in U.S. net operating income, which was substantially offset by the reduction in NOI from the Canadian dispositions.
Lower G&A expense and lower financing costs attributable to the redemption of the 6.9% preferred stock last year also contributed to the growth. Included in the headline result is a profit participation from the sale of our Canadian preferred equity investment of $5.5 million. FFO as adjusted or recurring FFO, which excludes nonoperating impairments and transactional income and expense, was $0.37 per diluted share for the first quarter, up from $0.36 last year, a 2.8% increase. We accomplished this growth level despite the $0.03 per share dilutive impact from our portfolio transformation.
The portfolio transformation includes the substantial disposition of assets in Latin America and Canada totaling $900 million and $600 million of U.S. dispositions in just the last 12 months. The diluted impact was more than offset with the reduced financing costs and $1.4 billion of acquisitions of high-quality assets in our key markets. Many of the acquisitions were sourced from our joint venture programs.
Our portfolio operating team delivered solid first quarter results, maintaining our anchored tenant occupancy at 98.2% and increasing small shop space by 40 basis points from 1 year ago to 88.6%.
We remain on target for small shop occupancy to reach 90% by year-end. We continue to deliver strong leasing spreads, up 19.1% for new leases, up 6.3% for renewals and options and 7.5% combined. U.S. same-site NOI growth is 1.5% and includes a credit loss reserve of $3.2 million or 140 basis points related to the bankruptcy filing by Sports Authority. This reserve amount includes 100% of all prepetition amounts and $811,000 of rent from March, which remains unpaid. Even with the short-term impact from Sports Authority, we remain on track and reaffirm our full-year U.S. same-site NOI guidance range of an increase of 2.5% to 3.5%.
Additionally, in an effort to give the analyst and investor community further information for comparability purposes, we have included in our supplemental package the same-site disclosures of straight line rent adjustments, lease termination fees and amortization of above and below market rents.
As part of our 2020 vision, we are laser-focused on further improving our debt metrics with a target of 5 to 5.5x for consolidated net debt through recurring EBITDA and a fixed charge coverage of 3x plus.
In the last 12 months, we have reduced our net debt by $560 million from $5.5 billion to $4.94 billion at March 31. At the end of the first quarter, net debt to recurring EBITDA is 5.9x, down from 6.6x a year ago, and fixed charge coverage came in at 3.2x. We repaid over $400 million of maturing debt during the first quarter, and we paid an additional $117 million of mortgage debt in April, leaving us with just about $250 million in remaining consolidated maturities for the balance of the year.
A portion of the debt repayment was accomplished with $138.5 million of proceeds raised from the issuance of 4.96 million shares of common equity through our ATM program at a weighted average offering price of $28.20 per share during March and April. As another data point, at the end of the first quarter, our total debt to total market capitalization was down to 28%, the lowest level in the past 8 years.
Based on the solid first quarter results, we are reaffirming our headline FFO per share guidance range of $1.54 to $1.62. Please keep in mind that the bulk of the transactional income for 2016 is anticipated to occur late in the fourth quarter. We're also reaffirming our FFO as adjusted per-share guidance range of $1.58 to $1.52 with a midpoint of $1.50 per share in each of our operating guidance assumptions.
And with that, we'd be happy to answer your questions."

As you know, one of our strategies is to really own more of our assets 100% and give us total control of our destiny. And this especially was true with Oakwood and Dania. Oakwood is where we have an office, so we have a physical presence there. And we realize that with Oakwood and Dania, we have a unique opportunity to truly enhance the value of both assets of what we're trying to do, both at Oakwood and at Dania. So we've been proactive with all of our partners, and this one was opportunistic for us to strike and really take CPP out of the transaction early on in this stage. So we were able to buy CPP out of the development side at their basis, which we thought was extremely opportunistic. And now that we have Costco fully executed, we think that it's just the beginning of a strong pre-leasing effort for the first phase. And the second phase, now that we have complete control, gives us the ability to really take a step back and look at what's the highest and best use for the property if we want to sell off parcel, if we want to self-develop more parcels or if we want to do higher density. We have that luxury now, which before, we probably had the inability to do so because of the partnership. So we feel like it gives us more flexibility, and it continues to allow us to focus on larger assets with significant, both, development and redevelopment activity. So that was a little bit of a history there. And in terms of the concentration, you're right that it's going to be in terms of our size, the #1 and #2 producing properties in the portfolio. But we also have tremendous pockets of concentration in California and New York. And with future redevelopments at Westlake and as well as some of our other larger assets, I think that there will be other larger assets that may challenge the #1 and #2 distinction that we've given Dania and Oakwood. So -- and we always want to look to see and make sure we're diversified accordingly. So if it becomes too concentrated, we'll have, hopefully, the luxury of looking at alternative ideas there of what we should do."

On the releasing side of it, it's going to be, again, case-by-case scenario. We do have LOI's for our users to take the whole box and also users to split. Many of the off-price concepts have multiple flags. So they can take the whole box and do multiple uses in that box as well. We also have the opportunity to add grocery to 15 of our 25 locations. So we've obviously pinned that down as a priority for us to see that we can create some value there as well, and we're working with some of the specialty grocers as well as traditional grocers to take those boxes. So again, the average base rent for all 25 is under $15 a foot. These are all locations that we think are very much in demand, and there's very little supply out there. So whether it's going to be a competitor that just buys the lease and has to live with the existing used cost or is an off-price user or a grocery store, there's also some interest from some of the home improvement sector, as well from some of their smaller boxes. So we think we're cost optimistic that we're going to be in good shape here for the long haul."

I think that when you look at sort of a transactional environment in general, we're definitely seeing continued strength in competition and aggressive pricing for the core product. Anything that has a value add or achievable redevelopment or growth story, there's still an immense amount of capital chasing those deals. When we look at our transactions on the disposition side, I'd say that the biggest challenge that we're finding is generating a deep buyer pool on some of the secondary market assets. The ones that are really stable income streams with no growth and no grocer, I would say that we are seeing a little bit of a more shallow buyer pool. But I think that's sort of where the private REITs were really controlling and being aggressive in that market. So to a certain extent, I think we're missing those buyers, but that being said, we are still getting enough of an auction going where we're able to achieve our cap rates and our objectives. So I think when you compare the cap rates this quarter, as Conor mentioned, sort of blended. We're still in the very high 6s, may be low 7s in some cases on the dispositions, but we still feel very good about our ability to get that sold. We're not seeing any real material re-trading.

Today, we plan to keep our prepared remarks short and sweet. We are firing on all cylinders as we drive toward achieving our 2020 vision and focus on long-term shareholder value. The first quarter highlights the e",1084,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Today, we plan to keep our prepared remarks short and sweet. We are firing on all cylinders as we drive toward achieving our 2020 vision and focus on long-term shareholder value. The first quarter highlights the execution of all aspects of our strategy as we focus less on short-term earnings and more on creating long-term net asset value. Our disposition and acquisition activity continues to produce a higher-quality portfolio. This higher quality is reflected in our leasing production as we continue to attract premier tenants at higher rents.
Our redevelopment and development activity continues to create value and opportunity, unlocking the highest and best use of the real estate. And we do all of this with a cautious and watchful eye on our balance sheet and our cost of capital.
Now for some details. In the first quarter, we continued to execute on our disposition strategy by closing on $323 million of dispositions in Canada and $114 million of dispositions in the U.S. The blended average cap rate was 6.9% in the first quarter and quality buyers ranging from public REITs, private REITs, local private real estate groups, high-net-worth individuals, international buyers and trade buyers all continue to cull through our disposition portfolio.
We are in the ninth inning of our transformation. And with the majority of our Canadian portfolio under contract and the progress to date on our U.S. dispositions, we are on pace to hit our target of $400 million to $475 million of dispositions in the U.S. and $425 million to $500 million in Canada by year-end and complete the transformation of the portfolio.
Turning to acquisitions. Our first quarter concluded with limited volume, reflecting the competitiveness in our target markets. After quarter-end, we did reach agreements to purchase our JV partner's interest in Oakwood Plaza and the adjacent Dania Pointe development site. These sites combine to offer over 2 miles of frontage along I-95 in the Fort Lauderdale-Miami corridor. Oakwood is 100% occupied, but reflects what we look for in our target markets, irreplaceable real estate with below-market rents, significant sales volumes and future redevelopment opportunity. Dania is the adjacent development site that we now control and are happy to take this opportunity to announce the ground lease with Costco to anchor the first phase and kick off the pre-leasing. Both Oakwood and Dania are key building blocks to our 2020 Vision, creating value on larger assets in markets with high barriers to entry. Oakwood is now our #2 NOI producer. And upon stabilization, Dania will be the #1 NOI contributor in the entire portfolio.
The strong leasing demand for quality real estate highlights the positive supply and demand imbalance that the open-air sector is currently enjoying. Keeping occupancy steady at 95.8% over prior quarter validates the portfolio quality and the quality of our leasing team as we typically experience an early year dip due to post-holiday closings. Retailer demands did not change during the stock market correction in the first quarter, and we continue to see demand across all square footage categories. The volume of new deals this quarter included big-box retailers, grocery stores and off-price retailers, all enhancing the merchandising mix and improving net asset value.
Target, Whole Foods, Giant and Trader Joe's are just a few examples of executed leases this quarter that positively impact NAV. A high number of our new deals this quarter, including the Target and Whole Foods deals, are taking currently occupied space. So while we will have a short-term hit in same-site NOI and do not pick up any occupancy, we do pick up a material improvement in NAV. In addition, these quality tenants create a halo effect at our centers, which allow Kimco to achieve outsized growth from the surrounding retail.
New leases were signed at an average base rent of $21 a foot, reflecting the embedded mark-to-market opportunities when compared to our current average base rent. Kimco's average base rent is now $14.67, a 4.8% increase over Q1 2015 and a 27.9% increase over Q1 in 2010.
While we are currently enjoying a 38-year low in supply, we are monitoring the shadow supply pipeline closely. Recent bankruptcies and announced store closings, in addition to pending mergers, will be the primary driver of increased supply in the short run for both malls and open-air centers. This is not new to our sector. What is new is that at Kimco today, our transformed high-quality portfolio makes us more ready and better prepared for these situations. That is why we are approaching the Sports Authority liquidation with cautious optimism.
Preliminary indications suggest that we will be significant demand for our boxes if and when they revert back to us. Redevelopments completed in the first quarter will deliver incremental NOI of $2.3 million with an ROI of 11.5%. Redevelopment remains the best use of our capital, and Kimco's billion-dollar pipeline continues to cycle more projects from the entitlement stage to the active pipeline as additional opportunities are constantly being discovered within the existing portfolio.
The amount of raw material in our portfolio and the focus on value creation has given rise to a shadow pipeline of additional redevelopment projects that account for roughly $2 billion of future projects. Acting upon the embedded opportunity will serve our long-term shareholders by adding value to best-in-class properties.
Turning to development. We recently hit 2 major milestones by securing the Target deal at our Grand Parkway development in Texas, and today, announcing the Costco ground lease at our Dania development project in Florida. These anchors have jump-started the pre-leasing for the first phases of both projects. Due to the lack of new supply and the strong demand from open-air retailers, we continue to aggressively pre-lease our strategic development projects. Each development site has a phasing plan in place to better monitor and ensure that our investment remains accretive to our cost of capital and to provide off-ramps to keep maximum flexibility.
In closing, we continue to march toward our 2020 vision of being a U.S.-focused REIT with large pockets of concentration in high barrier to entry markets. The team is working overtime to unlock value at the property level through lease up and mark-to-market opportunities, continuing to expand and deliver on the redevelopment pipeline and executing on the strategic development pipeline, all while positioning the balance sheet to be in a position of strength now and for the next cycle.
Glenn will now take you through the detail of the first quarter."

We continue to execute on all fronts: leasing, dispositions, redevelopment and development activity and further strengthening of our balance sheet metrics. These are the primary ingredients needed to achieve our 2020 Vision. Headline FFO per diluted share, which represents the official NAREIT definition, was $0.38, up from $0.37 last year and $0.01 higher than first call consensus. The improved performance is attributable to a 5.2% increase in U.S. net operating income, which was substantially offset by the reduction in NOI from the Canadian dispositions.
Lower G&A expense and lower financing costs attributable to the redemption of the 6.9% preferred stock last year also contributed to the growth. Included in the headline result is a profit participation from the sale of a Canadian preferred equity investment of $5.5 million. FFO as adjusted or recurring FFO, which excludes nonoperating impairments and transactional income and expense, was $0.37 per diluted share for the first quarter, up from $0.36 last year, a 2.8% increase. We accomplished this growth level despite the $0.03 per share dilutive impact from our portfolio transformation.
The portfolio transformation includes the substantial disposition of assets in Latin America and Canada totaling $900 million and $600 million of U.S. dispositions in just the last 12 months. The diluted impact was more than offset with the reduced financing costs and $1.4 billion of acquisitions of high-quality assets in our key markets. Many of the acquisitions were sourced from our joint venture programs.
Our portfolio operating team delivered solid first quarter results, maintaining our anchor tenant occupancy at 98.2% and increasing small shop space by 40 basis points from 1 year ago to 88.6%.
We remain on target for small shop occupancy to reach 90% by year-end. We continue to deliver strong leasing spreads, up 19.1% for new leases, up 6.3% for renewals and options and 7.5% combined. U.S. same-site NOI growth is 1.5% and includes a credit loss reserve of $3.2 million or 140 basis points related to the bankruptcy filing by Sports Authority. This reserve amount includes 100% of all pre-petition amounts and $811,000 of rent from March, which remains unpaid. Even with the short-term impact from Sports Authority, we remain on track and reaffirm our full-year U.S. same-site NOI guidance range of an increase of 2.5% to 3.5%.
Additionally, in an effort to give the analyst and investor community further information for comparability purposes, we have included in our supplemental package the same-site disclosures of straight line rent adjustments, lease termination fees and amortization of above and below market rents.
As part of our 2020 vision, we are laser-focused on further improving our debt metrics with a target of 5 to 5.5x for consolidated net debt through recurring EBITDA and a fixed charge coverage of 3x plus.
In the last 12 months, we have reduced our net debt by $560 million from $5.5 billion to $4.94 billion at March 31. At the end of the first quarter, net debt to recurring EBITDA is 5.9x, down from 6.6x a year ago, and fixed charge coverage came in at 3.2x. We repaid over $400 million of maturing debt during the first quarter, and we paid an additional $117 million of mortgage debt in April, leaving us with just about $250 million in remaining consolidated maturities for the balance of the year.
A portion of the debt repayment was accomplished with $138.5 million of proceeds raised from the issuance of 4.96 million shares of common equity through our ATM program at a weighted average offering price of $28.20 per share during March and April. As another data point, at the end of the first quarter, our total debt to total market capitalization was down to 28%, the lowest level in the past 8 years.
Based on the solid first quarter results, we are reaffirming our headline FFO per share guidance range of $1.54 to $1.62. Please keep in mind that the bulk of the transactional income for 2016 is anticipated to occur late in the fourth quarter. We're also reaffirming our FFO as adjusted per-share guidance range of $1.48 to $1.52 with a midpoint of $1.50 per share in each of our operating guidance assumptions.
And with that, we'd be happy to answer your questions."

But also, how the development was effectively valued versus going forward with it as a partnership? And then I get your point in terms of wanting to have high pockets of concentration, but it would seem that between Oakwood and Dania, which would rank #1 and #2, that would be a very large concentration in a very concentrated location.

As you know, one of our strategies is to really own more of our assets 100% and give us total control of our destiny. And this especially was true with Oakwood and Dania. Oakwood is where we have an office, so we have a physical presence there. And we realize that with Oakwood and Dania, we have a unique opportunity to truly enhance the value of both assets with what we're trying to do, both at Oakwood and at Dania. So we've been proactive with all of our partners, and this one was opportunistic for us to strike and really take CPP out of the transaction early on in this stage. So we were able to buy CPP out of the development side at their basis, which we thought was extremely opportunistic. And now that we have Costco fully executed, we think that it's just the beginning of a strong pre-leasing effort for the first phase. And the second phase, now that we have complete control, gives us the ability to really take a step back and look at what's the highest and best use for the property if we want to sell off parcels, if we want to self-develop more parcels or if we want to do higher density. We have that luxury now, which before, we probably had the inability to do so because of the partnership. So we feel like it gives us more flexibility, and it continues to allow us to focus on larger assets with significant, both development and redevelopment activity. So that was a little bit of a history there. 
And in terms of the concentration, you're right that it's going to be in terms of our size, the #1 and #2 producing properties in the portfolio. But we also have tremendous pockets of concentration in California and New York. And with future redevelopments at Westlake and as well as some of our other larger assets, I think that there will be other larger assets that may challenge the #1 and #2 distinction that we've given Dania and Oakwood. So -- and we always want to look to see and make sure we're diversified accordingly. So if it becomes too concentrated, we'll have, hopefully, the luxury of looking at alternative ideas there of what we should do."

A third one in Staten Island, which is only the last piece of Richmond redevelopment, that's where we did the large Target redevelopment, and this was the last phase. We have deals approved at REC committees with retailers to split the box, 1 for a best-in-class specialty grocer to take half of it and another best-in-class off-price user to take the other half.

So we've obviously pinned that down as a priority for us to see that we can create some value there as well, and we're working with some of the specialty grocers as well as traditional grocers to take those boxes. So again, the average base rent for all 25 is under $15 a foot. These are all locations that we think are very much in demand, and there's very little supply out there. So whether it's going to be a competitor that just buys the lease and has to live with the existing use clause or is an off-price user or a grocery store, there's also some interest from some of the home improvement sector, as well from some of their smaller boxes.

I think that when you look at sort of a transactional environment in general, we're definitely seeing continued strength in competition and aggressive pricing for the core product. Anything that has a value add or achievable redevelopment or growth story, there's still an immense amount of capital chasing those deals. When we look at our transactions on the disposition side, I'd say that the biggest challenge that we're finding is generating a deep buyer pool on some of the secondary market assets. The ones that are really stable income streams with no growth and no grocer, I would say that we are seeing a little bit of a more shallow buyer pool. But I think that's sort of where the private REITs were really controlling and being aggressive in that market. So to a certain extent, I think we're missing those buyers, but that being said, we are still getting enough of an auction going where we're able to achieve our cap rates and our objectives. So I think when you compare the cap rates this quarter, as Conor mentioned, sort of blended.

Obviously, one-off opportunities, you'll see them here and there. But I don't think there's any major general trends. So we're optimistic that we'll continue to hit our targets for the rest of the year."

So it does weigh on the combined leasing spreads. But overall, we still feel very confident that we can deliver a high single-digit, low double-digit combined leasing spread going forward. We still think there's lots of opportunities to unlock value in mark-to-market opportunities there."

Today, we will report on major milestones that encompass our 2020 vision. I will give a quick update on the execution of our strategic goals, quarterly metrics and development and redevelopment pipelines before turning it over to Ross to cover acquisitions and dispositions, followed by Glenn to discuss our financial results. 
We are making great strides in creating long-term shareholder value as we continue to simplify and strengthen our business. With our recent Canadian dispositions, our strategic exit from Canada is over 90% complete, and we have further reduced our joint venture investment. More specifically, the number of properties in our JV portfolio now stands at 152 as compared to 551 sites in 2010, a decrease of 72%. And the overall value of the joint venture portfolio is currently $5.4 billion gross as compared to $12.3 billion gross in 2010, a decrease of 56%. 
We are further simplifying our capital structure by redeeming our Canadian bonds to coincide with our exit of Canada. We will also prepay unsecured bond and a portion of our U.S. mortgages that come due in 2017, to take full advantage of the all-time low rate environment and further extend our maturity profile. 
We continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities in the capital markets, including the use of our ATM to improve the balance sheet as we strive to achieve our publicly stated goal of achieving an A- A3 credit rating. All of these efforts will put Kimco in a position of strength for the next cycle and move us closer to our 2020 vision. 
Internally, we will be merging our primary taxable REIT subsidiary into the parent company, thus transferring long-term hold assets into the REIT structure to simplify and make our holdings more efficient. 
Overall, the strong fundamentals of high-quality open-air centers continue to demonstrate why we believe we are, to use Milton's words, in the sweet spot of retail. 
Supply and demand remain in check, with limited new development on the horizon. Retailers with new formats and off-price specialty and traditional grocers, pet stores, home improvement, fitness, wellness and beauty are all looking to grow store count. Our occupancy is up to 96%, with our anchor boxes at 98.3% and our small shop occupancy improving to 89.2%. Achieving an 8-year high in occupancy could not have been accomplished without the incredible effort of our entire team. 
New deal spreads improved to 29.8%, demonstrating the portfolio's mark-to-market opportunity. Renewals and options also improved 10.7% to produce an impressive combined leasing spread of 16.2%, our highest in 3 years. Same-site NOI increased 3.1%, which included 30 basis points from redevelopment. 
Notwithstanding the success, the Sports Authority liquidation will create some near-term headwinds, but will result in long-term positives. Our exposure to Sports Authority has been reduced, with retailers acquiring 2 leases at auction, reducing our exposure to 1.1% of ABR. We also see the opportunity to buy back the lease at our Farmington, Connecticut property, which has 52 years of term remaining at a $4 rent, which was dramatically below market. 
The numerous auction delays and false starts resulted in a shallow pool of retailers that were willing to pay the unpaid prepetition rent and live by the existing lease terms. Throughout the auction process, we've been proactively marketing to 23 remaining boxes and have won fully executed lease and LOIs working on all remaining locations. 
We see further opportunity to add a grocery component in certain locations and the ability to mark-to-market undervalued leases. Based upon the interest we are receiving, we are optimistic the absorption of these spaces will be swift over the next 6 to 12 months. We are maintaining our full year guidance for same-site NOI growth and occupancy based on our reforecast that incorporate the impact from the Sports Authority liquidation and demand for our high-quality real estate. 
Progress continues on our strategic development and redevelopment pipeline, especially in our larger projects that we are calling the signature series. Whole Foods in Wynnewood, PA is now installing fixtures in their new store and is set to open in September. The Grand Parkway in Houston is on schedule and is now 89% preleased. The Target pad was turned over on June 10 and all 7 junior anchor leases are fully executed. Ground Parkway Phase 2 is also moving forward, with 2 of the 3 anchor boxes fully executed with the Academy Sports and Hobby Lobby. Dania Pointe in the Fort Lauderdale MSA is also on schedule. The Costco pad is being prepped with turnover set for second quarter of 2017. Phase 2 of Dania has kicked off pre-leasing, and we are happy to announce the fully executed anchor lease with H&M. 
Our major redevelopments are also gaining traction, highlighted by the new parking garage at Pentagon, which is nearing completion. This will allow us to move forward with the Phase 1 specification. Our redevelopment for the quarter are projected to produce 9.9% return on invested capital, and we continue to believe this growing pipeline is a major differentiator for Kimco as we are just getting started with the repositioning of our top assets. 
As you can see, our 2020 vision is coming more and more into focus as we create a portfolio of assets that is both resilient to economic downturns and at the same time, able to attractive the best tenets to generate quality earnings growth and expand our overall net asset value. Our portfolio is focused and concentrated in the best U.S. markets with the best demographics. Our shopping center strike a wonderful balance with off-price and grocery anchors and just the right mix of small-shop tenants. These are the types of centers that consumers return to again and again in good times and bad, whether they are looking to restock their refrigerator at Albertsons, treasure hunt at TJX or get a haircut or manicure. When you add our signature series of development and redevelopment projects to this solid defensive foundation, the portfolios changing profile is dramatic, both in quality and value. 
Ross will now walk you through our transactions for the quarter."

The largest driver of our progress was the continued and",565,"Thanks, Conor. With the execution of our second quarter transaction activity completed, we took another big step towards our goals of reducing leverage, joint ventures and noncore market ownership. The largest driver of our progress was the continued and accelerated pace of our Canadian exit, highlighted by the Anthem transaction, which closed last month. Coupled with the sale of several additional Canadian assets, we have now sold over 90% of our Canadian LOI with the remainder to be sold by year-end. 
In the U.S., we took advantage of the strong investor demand for shopping centers, with a disposition of 12 assets for $220 million. This included the sale of our last remaining asset in Mississippi as well as other noncore assets in markets such as Council Bluffs, Iowa and Overland Park, Kansas. The blended cap rate on the dispositions for the quarter was 6.6%, which was in line with our expectations. We will continue to selectively prune the portfolio to enhance the overall quality on a go-forward basis. 
On the acquisition side, we remain laser-focused on high-quality assets, with both long and short-term growth, located within strong demographic areas. As previously announced, the acquisition of our partner's share in Oakwood Plaza and Dania not only provides Kimco with 100% ownership of 2 of the largest and highest-quality projects in the portfolio, but also further achieves the goal of JV reduction. 
Additionally, we are excited to announce the planned acquisition of the Kimco marketplace, a 250,000 square-foot Whole Foods-anchored center in Gaithersburg, Maryland. This Metro DC asset provides a unique opportunity to own a highly coveted infill asset, with excellent grocery sales of almost $1,300 a square foot and also have significantly near-term upside and redevelopment potential. Closing as anticipated in the next couple of weeks, and we look forward to sharing our plans for this asset. 
Our transactional activity for the year has been front-loaded with asset sales as we have sold $821 million Kim share, which bumped against the low end of our initial 2016 disposition range of $825 million to $975 million. With over 20 assets either under contract, with accepted offers or in the market, we are increasing our full year 2016 disposition range to $1 billion to $1.15 billion. Our 2016 estimate for acquisitions remains intact at $450 million to $550 million, as we will have purchased approximately $250 million of shopping centers, including the pending acquisition. 
The environment for quality real estate remains hypercompetitive, but we continue to evaluate unique opportunities and pick our spots. Capital is abundant, with significant equity being placed by foreign investors, pension funds, life companies, private equity and REITs. Debt is readily available from CMBS and life companies with historically low rates, and yields are expected to stay low for the near future. Recent sub-5% cap rates on open-air shopping center transactions have closed in New York, New Jersey Metro, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Austin, Texas, Washington, D.C. and South Florida. These are all primary markets for Kimco, where we have a strong established presence. 
Single tenant ground leases with strong credit rating are trading in the low 4% range and even sub-4% in some cases, which bodes well for the value of our long-term ground leases with the likes of Walmart, Costco, Home Depot and others. 
With that, I'm happy to pass it over to Glenn to provide detail on the financials."

Our 2020 vision is focused on both the left side of the balance sheet as well as the right side as we continue to further improve our debt metrics and balance sheet position. 
Now for some color on the quarter and further detail regarding the 3 strategic initiatives we announced last night, which we believe will further improve our capital structure as well as our recurring growth profile and tax efficiency in both the short term and long term. Headline FFO per share, which represents the official NAREIT definition, was $0.38 for the second quarter, meeting first call consensus. As a reminder, our consensus estimate is based on NAREIT-defined FFO. Included in the headline result is $0.01 per share attributable to profit participation from the sale of a preferred equity investment. Headline FFO per share for the second quarter last year was $0.44, which included $0.08 per share attributable to the gain on the sale of our marketable security investment in SUPERVALU. FFO is adjusted or recurring FFO, which excludes transactional income and expense and nonoperating impairments was $0.37 per diluted share for the second quarter, the same level as last year. We achieved this level despite a $17 million decrease in net operating income, primarily attributable to the significant Canadian and U.S. property dispositions over the past year. This was largely offset by a $15 million reduction in financing costs related to lower debt levels, lower interest rates on debt refinancing and the redemption of our 6.9% preferred stock last year. 
For the 6 months, FFO as adjusted per share is $0.74, up from $0.73 for the comparable period last year and on target with our recurring forecast and guidance expectations. We ended the second quarter with consolidated net debt to recurring EBITDA of 5.7x, down from 6.3x a year ago. In addition, our net debt-to-EBITDA on a look-through basis is 6.9x, which includes our $800 million of preferred stock, which is all callable next year, and our program of sharing venture debt, which, by the way, is down to $843 million from a peak of $3 billion. The 6.9x level is at the high end of our target range of 6.4x to 6.9x that we announced at our 2020 vision Investor Day. 
We improved our debt maturity profile with the addition of $150 million to our 4 1/4% [ph] 30-year bond, and we also issued $38.9 million of common equity through our ATM program in the early part of the quarter. 
Now for some additional color on the 3 strategic initiatives announced last night. Initiative one, redeeming our outstanding Canadian bonds. As Ross mentioned with the completed sale of Canadian assets, representing over 90% of our Canadian NOI, it's no longer necessary to have the Canadian-denominated bonds outstanding. This is clearly an opportunity for us to further delever the balance sheet. As such, we will be redeeming the Canadian-denominated $350 million of bonds at the end of August, using the proceeds from the Canadian sales, which have also produced over $111 million of non-FFO gains year-to-date. We expect to incur a prepayment charge of approximately $26 million or $0.06 per share, which will impact net income and headline FFO in the third quarter. 
Initiative two, the prepayment of U.S. debt that's due in 2017. As part of reaching our stated goal of increasing our unsecured credit ratings to A- and A3, we want to further extend our debt maturity profile, further improve our fixed charge and debt service coverage ratios and increase our unencumbered asset pool. To this end, we'll be redeeming our $290.9 million, 5.7% bond due in 2017 and prepaying $137 million of 6.32% mortgage debt that's due in December of 2017. The funding of the aggregate principal amount of $427.9 million and the prepayment charge of $22 million or $0.05 per share, which will impact net income and headline FFO, will be made with the combination of proceeds from asset sales, availability under our revolving credit facility and depending on market conditions, issuance of an unsecured bond. 
Initiative three, merging our primary taxable REIT subsidiary Kimco Realty Services into Kimco Realty Corporation. This tax-free merger will effectively transfer the ownership of our Albertson's investment in over 30 shopping center assets, many of which were developed in our former merchant-building business but retained and today, are considered long-term hold properties. This transaction will provide us greater tax efficiency as well as reduce our administrative costs. In conjunction with the merger, which is expected to be completed in the third quarter, generally accepted accounting principles require the establishment of evaluation reserve when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. As such, a noncash charge against net income of $66 million or $0.16 per share and headline FFO of $41 million or $0.10 a share, respectively, will be recorded. The difference between the net income charge and the FFO charge is related to the tax impact from impairments previously taken on operating properties, which were excluded from FFO. Now subsequent to the merger, a portion of this evaluation reserve may no longer be required in the event certain taxable transactions related to these assets occur. This will include a monetization of our Albertson's investment. 
In total, the 3 initiatives just discussed are expected to have a total impact on net income of approximately $114 million or $0.27 per share and on headline FFO of $89 million with $0.21 per share. As a result of the charges, we are revising our headline FFO per share guidance range to $1.34 to $1.42 with a midpoint of $1.38 from the previous headline FFO per share guidance range of $1.54 to $1.62 with a midpoint of $1.58. We continue to anticipate that the bulk of our transactions will occur in the fourth quarter. We are reaffirming our FFO as adjusted recurring FFO per share guidance range of $1.48 to $1.52 with a midpoint of $1.50, which builds upon our solid first half performance and the expected benefits from the 3 initiatives, along with the impact from the Sports Authority liquidation and our increased disposition range. 
And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions."

And we continue to see what other opportunities exist to add grocery components going forward to the opportunity set that we have."

Today, we will report on major milestones that encompass our 2020 vision. I will give a quick update on the execution of our strategic goals, quarterly metrics and development and redevelopment pipelines before turning it over to Ross to cover acquisitions and dispositions, followed by Glenn to discuss our financial results. 
We are making great strides in creating long-term shareholder value as we continue to simplify and strengthen our business. With our recent Canadian dispositions, our strategic exit from Canada is over 90% complete, and we have further reduced our joint venture investment. 
More specifically, the number of properties in our JV portfolio now stands at 152 as compared to 551 sites in 2010, a decrease of 72%. And the overall value of the joint venture portfolio is currently $5.4 billion gross as compared to $12.3 billion gross in 2010, a decrease of 56%. 
We are further simplifying our capital structure by redeeming our Canadian bonds to coincide with our exit of Canada. We will also prepay an unsecured bond and a portion of our U.S. mortgages that come due in 2017, to take full advantage of the all-time low rate environment and further extend our maturity profile. 
We continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities in the capital markets, including the use of our ATM to improve the balance sheet as we strive to achieve our publicly-stated goal of achieving an A- A3 credit rating. All of these efforts will put Kimco in a position of strength for the next cycle and move us closer to our 2020 vision. 
Internally, we will be merging our primary taxable REIT subsidiary into the parent company, thus transferring long-term hold assets into the REIT structure to simplify and make our holdings more efficient. 
Overall, the strong fundamentals of high-quality open-air centers continue to demonstrate why we believe we are, to use Milton's words, in the sweet spot of retail. 
Supply and demand remain in check, with limited new development on the horizon. Retailers with new formats and off-price specialty and traditional grocers, pet stores, home improvement, fitness, wellness and beauty are all looking to grow store count. 
Our occupancy is up to 96%, with our anchor boxes at 98.3% and our small shop occupancy improving to 89.2%. Achieving an 8-year high in occupancy could not have been accomplished without the incredible effort of our entire team. 
New deal spreads improved to 29.8%, demonstrating the portfolio's mark-to-market opportunity. Renewals and options also improved 10.7% to produce an impressive combined leasing spread of 16.2%, our highest in 3 years. Same-site NOI increased 3.1%, which included 30 basis points from redevelopment. 
Notwithstanding the success, the Sports Authority liquidation will create some near-term headwinds, but will result in long-term positives. Our exposure to Sports Authority has been reduced, with retailers acquiring 2 leases at auction, reducing our exposure to 1.1% of ABR. 
We also seized the opportunity to buy back the lease at our Farmington, Connecticut property, which has 52 years of term remaining at a $4 rent, which was dramatically below market. 
The numerous auction delays and false starts resulted in a shallow pool of retailers that were willing to pay the unpaid pre-petition rent and live by the existing lease terms. Throughout the auction process, we've been proactively marketing the 23 remaining boxes and have 1 fully executed lease and LOIs working on all remaining locations. 
We see further opportunity to add a grocery component in certain locations and the ability to mark-to-market undervalued leases. Based upon the interest we are receiving, we are optimistic the absorption of these spaces will be swift over the next 6 to 12 months. 
We are maintaining our full year guidance for same-site NOI growth and occupancy based on our re-forecast that incorporate the impact from the Sports Authority liquidation and demand for our high-quality real estate. 
Progress continues on our strategic development and redevelopment pipeline, especially on our larger projects that we are calling the Signature Series. Whole Foods in Wynnewood, PA is now installing fixtures in their new store and is set to open in September. 
Grand Parkway in Houston is on schedule and is now 89% pre-leased. The Target pad was turned over on June 10, and all 7 junior anchor leases are fully executed. Ground Parkway Phase 2 is also moving forward, with 2 of the 3 anchor boxes fully executed with the Academy Sports and Hobby Lobby. 
Dania Pointe in the Fort Lauderdale MSA is also on schedule. The Costco pad is being prepped with turnover set for second quarter of 2017. Phase 2 of Dania has kicked off pre-leasing, and we are happy to announce the fully executed anchor lease with H&M. 
Our major redevelopments are also gaining traction, highlighted by the new parking garage at Pentagon, which is nearing completion. This will allow us to move forward with the Phase 1 densifications. Our redevelopment for the quarter are projected to produce 9.9% return on invested capital, and we continue to believe this growing pipeline is a major differentiator for Kimco as we are just getting started with the repositioning of our top assets. 
As you can see, our 2020 vision is coming more and more into focus as we create a portfolio of assets that is both resilient to economic downturns, and at the same time, able to attract the best tenants to generate quality earnings growth and expand our overall net asset value. 
Our portfolio is focused and concentrated in the best U.S. markets with the best demographics. Our shopping centers strike a wonderful balance with off-price and grocery anchors and just the right mix of small-shop tenants. These are the types of centers that consumers return to again and again in good times and bad, whether they are looking to restock their refrigerator at Albertsons, treasure hunt at TJX or get a haircut or manicure. 
When you add our Signature Series of development and redevelopment projects to this solid defensive foundation, the portfolio's changing profile is dramatic, both in quality and value. 
Ross will now walk you through our transactions for the quarter."

With the execution of our second quarter transaction activity completed, we took another big step towards our goals of reducing leverage, joint ventures and non-core market ownership. The largest driver of our progress was the continued and accelerated pace of our Canadian exit, highlighted by the Anthem transaction, which closed last month. Coupled with the sale of several additional Canadian assets, we have now sold over 90% of our Canadian LOI with the remainder to be sold by year-end. 
In the U.S., we took advantage of the strong investor demand for shopping centers, with the disposition of 12 assets for $220 million. This included the sale of our last remaining asset in Mississippi as well as other non-core assets in markets such as Council Bluffs, Iowa and Overland Park, Kansas. 
The blended cap rate on the dispositions for the quarter was 6.6%, which was in line with our expectations. We will continue to selectively prune the portfolio to enhance the overall quality on a go-forward basis. 
On the acquisition side, we remain laser-focused on high-quality assets, with both long- and short-term growth, located within strong demographic areas. As previously announced, the acquisition of our partner share in Oakwood Plaza and Dania not only provides Kimco with the 100% ownership of 2 of the largest and highest-quality projects in the portfolio, but also further achieves the goal of JV reduction. 
Additionally, we are excited to announce the planned acquisition of the Kentlands marketplace, a 250,000 square-foot Whole Foods-anchored center in Gaithersburg, Maryland. This Metro DC asset provides a unique opportunity to own a highly coveted infill asset, with excellent grocery sales of almost $1,300 a square foot and also has significant near-term upside and redevelopment potential. Closing is anticipated in the next couple of weeks, and we look forward to sharing our plans for this asset. 
Our transactional activity for the year has been front-loaded with asset sales as we have sold $821 million KIM share, which bumped against the low end of our initial 2016 disposition range of $825 million to $975 million. 
With over 20 assets either under contract, with accepted offers or in the market, we are increasing our full year 2016 disposition range to $1 billion to $1.15 billion. Our 2016 estimate for acquisitions remains intact at $450 million to $550 million, as we will have purchased approximately $250 million of shopping centers, including the pending Kentlands acquisition. 
The environment for quality real estate remains hypercompetitive, but we continue to evaluate unique opportunities and pick our spots. Capital is abundant, with significant equity being placed by foreign investors, pension funds, life companies, private equity and REITs. Debt is readily available from CMBS and life companies with historically low rates and yields are expected to stay low for the near future. 
Recent sub-5% cap rates on open-air shopping center transactions have closed in New York; New Jersey Metro; Los Angeles; San Diego; San Francisco; Austin, Texas; Washington, D.C.; and South Florida. These are all primary markets for Kimco, where we have a strong established presence. 
Single tenant ground leases with strong credit are trading in the low 4% range and even sub-4% in some cases, which bodes well for the value of our long-term ground leases with the likes of Walmart, Costco, Home Depot and others. 
With that, I'm happy to pass it over to Glenn to provide detail on the financials."

We continue to execute on the key components of our 2020 vision that Conor and Ross described. Our 2020 vision is focused on both the left side of the balance sheet as well as the right side as we continue to further improve our debt metrics and balance sheet position. 
Now for some color on the quarter and further details regarding the 3 strategic initiatives we announced last night, which we believe will further improve our capital structure as well as our recurring growth profile and tax efficiency in both the short term and long term. 
Headline FFO per share, which represents the official NAREIT definition, was $0.38 for the second quarter, meeting first call consensus. As a reminder, our consensus estimate is based on NAREIT-defined FFO. 
Included in the headline result is $0.01 per share attributable to profit participation from the sale of a preferred equity investment. Headline FFO per share for the second quarter last year was $0.44, which included $0.08 per share attributable to the gain on the sale of our marketable security investment in SUPERVALU. 
FFO is adjusted or recurring FFO, which excludes transactional income and expense and nonoperating impairments, was $0.37 per diluted share for the second quarter, the same level as last year. We achieved this level despite a $17 million decrease in net operating income, primarily attributable to the significant Canadian and U.S. property dispositions over the past year. 
This was largely offset by a $15 million reduction in financing costs related to lower debt levels, lower interest rates on debt refinancing and the redemption of our 6.9% preferred stock last year. 
For the 6 months, FFO as adjusted per share is $0.74, up from $0.73 for the comparable period last year and on target with our recurring forecast and guidance expectations. We ended the second quarter with consolidated net debt to recurring EBITDA of 5.7x, down from 6.3x a year ago. 
In addition, our net debt to EBITDA on a look-through basis is 6.9x, which includes our $800 million of preferred stock, which is all callable next year, and our pro-rata share of joint venture debt, which, by the way, is down to $843 million from a peak of $3 billion. The 6.9x level is at the high end of our target range of 6.4x to 6.9x that we announced at our 2020 vision Investor Day. 
We improved our debt maturity profile with the addition of $150 million to our 4.25% 30-year bond, and we also issued $38.9 million of common equity through our ATM program in the early part of the quarter. 
Now for some additional color on the 3 strategic initiatives announced last night. Initiative one, redeeming our outstanding Canadian bonds. As Ross mentioned, with the completed sale of Canadian assets representing over 90% of our Canadian NOI, it's no longer necessary to have the Canadian-denominated bonds outstanding. 
This is clearly an opportunity for us to further delever the balance sheet. As such, we will be redeeming the Canadian-denominated $350 million of bonds at the end of August using the proceeds from the Canadian sales, which have also produced over $111 million of non-FFO gains year-to-date. We expect to incur a prepayment charge of approximately $26 million or $0.06 per share, which will impact net income and headline FFO in the third quarter. 
Initiative two, the prepayment of U.S. debt that's due in 2017. As part of reaching our stated goal of increasing our unsecured credit ratings to A- and A3, we want to further extend our debt maturity profile, further improve our fixed charge and debt service coverage ratios and increase our unencumbered asset pool. 
To this end, we'll be redeeming our $290.9 million, 5.7% bond due in 2017 and prepaying $137 million of 6.32% mortgage debt that's due in December of 2017. The funding of the aggregate principal amount of $427.9 million and the prepayment charge of $22 million or $0.05 per share, which will impact net income and headline FFO, will be made with the combination of proceeds from asset sales, availability under our revolving credit facility and depending on market conditions, issuance of an unsecured bond. 
Initiative three, merging our primary taxable REIT subsidiary, Kimco Realty Services, into Kimco Realty Corporation. This tax-free merger will effectively transfer the ownership of our Albertsons investment in over 30 shopping center assets. Many of which were developed in our former merchant building business but retained and today are considered long-term hold properties. 
This transaction will provide us greater tax efficiency as well as reduce our administrative costs. In conjunction with the merger, which is expected to be completed in the third quarter, generally accepted accounting principles require the establishment of evaluation reserve when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
As such, a noncash charge against net income of $66 million or $0.16 per share and headline FFO of $41 million or $0.10 a share, respectively, will be recorded. The difference between the net income charge and the FFO charge is related to the tax impact from impairments previously taken on operating properties, which were excluded from FFO. 
Now subsequent to the merger, a portion of this valuation reserve may no longer be required in the event certain taxable transactions related to these assets occur. This would include a monetization of our Albertsons investment. 
In total, the 3 initiatives just discussed are expected to have a total impact on net income of approximately $114 million or $0.27 per share and on headline FFO of $89 million or $0.21 per share. 
As a result of the charges, we are revising our headline FFO per share guidance range to $1.34 to $1.42 with the midpoint of $1.38 from the previous headline FFO per share guidance range of $1.54 to $1.62 with the midpoint of $1.58. We continue to anticipate that the bulk of our transactions will occur in the fourth quarter. 
We are reaffirming our FFO as adjusted or recurring FFO per share guidance range of $1.48 to $1.52 with the midpoint of $1.50, which builds upon our solid first half performance and the expected benefits from the 3 initiatives, along with the impact from the Sports Authority liquidation and our increased disposition range. 
And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions."

Today, we will report on major milestones that encompass our 2020 vision. I will give a quick update on the execution of our strategic goals, quarterly metrics and development and redevelopment pipelines before turning it over to Ross to cover acquisitions and dispositions, followed by Glenn to discuss our financial results. 
We are making great strides in creating long-term shareholder value as we continue to simplify and strengthen our business. With our recent Canadian dispositions, our strategic exit from Canada is over 90% complete, and we have further reduced our joint venture investment. 
More specifically, the number of properties in our JV portfolio now stands at 152 as compared to 551 sites in 2010, a decrease of 72%. And the overall value of the joint venture portfolio is currently $5.4 billion gross as compared to $12.3 billion gross in 2010, a decrease of 56%. 
We are further simplifying our capital structure by redeeming our Canadian bonds to coincide with our exit of Canada. We will also prepay an unsecured bond and a portion of our U.S. mortgages that come due in 2017, to take full advantage of the all-time low rate environment and further extend our maturity profile. 
We continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities in the capital markets, including the use of our ATM to improve the balance sheet as we strive to achieve our publicly-stated goal of achieving an A- A3 credit rating. All of these efforts will put Kimco in a position of strength for the next cycle and move us closer to our 2020 vision. 
Internally, we will be merging our primary taxable REIT subsidiary into the parent company, thus transferring long-term hold assets into the REIT structure to simplify and make our holdings more efficient. 
Overall, the strong fundamentals of high-quality open-air centers continue to demonstrate why we believe we are, to use Milton's words, in the sweet spot of retail. 
Supply and demand remain in check, with limited new development on the horizon. Retailers with new formats and off-price specialty and traditional grocers, pet stores, home improvement, fitness, wellness and beauty are all looking to grow store count. 
Our occupancy is up to 96%, with our anchor boxes at 98.3% and our small shop occupancy improving to 89.2%. Achieving an 8-year high in occupancy could not have been accomplished without the incredible effort of our entire team. 
New deal spreads improved to 29.8%, demonstrating the portfolio's mark-to-market opportunity. Renewals and options also improved 10.7% to produce an impressive combined leasing spread of 16.2%, our highest in 3 years. Same-site NOI increased 3.1%, which included 30 basis points from redevelopment. 
Notwithstanding this success, the Sports Authority liquidation will create some near-term headwinds, but will result in long-term positives. Our exposure to Sports Authority has been reduced, with retailers acquiring 2 leases at auction, reducing our exposure to 1.1% of ABR. 
We also seized the opportunity to buy back the lease at our Farmington, Connecticut property, which has 52 years of term remaining at a $4 rent, which was dramatically below market. 
The numerous auction delays and false starts resulted in a shallow pool of retailers that were willing to pay the unpaid pre-petition rent and live by the existing lease terms. Throughout the auction process, we've been proactively marketing the 23 remaining boxes, and have 1 fully executed lease and LOIs working on all remaining locations. 
We see further opportunity to add a grocery component in certain locations and the ability to mark-to-market undervalued leases. Based upon the interest we are receiving, we are optimistic the absorption of these spaces will be swift over the next 6 to 12 months. 
We are maintaining our full year guidance for same-site NOI growth and occupancy based on our re-forecast that incorporate the impact from the Sports Authority liquidation and demand for our high-quality real estate. 
Progress continues on our strategic development and redevelopment pipeline, especially on our larger projects that we are calling the Signature Series. Whole Foods in Wynnewood, PA is now installing fixtures in their new store and is set to open in September. 
Grand Parkway in Houston is on schedule and is now 89% pre-leased. The Target pad was turned over on June 10, and all 7 junior anchor leases are fully executed. Grand Parkway Phase 2 is also moving forward, with 2 of the 3 anchor boxes fully executed with Academy Sports and Hobby Lobby. 
Dania Pointe in the Fort Lauderdale MSA is also on schedule. The Costco pad is being prepped with turnover set for second quarter of 2017. Phase 2 of Dania has kicked off pre-leasing, and we are happy to announce the fully executed anchor lease with H&M. 
Our major redevelopments are also gaining traction, highlighted by the new parking garage at Pentagon, which is nearing completion. This will allow us to move forward with the Phase 1 densifications. Our redevelopments for the quarter are projected to produce 9.9% return on invested capital, and we continue to believe this growing pipeline is a major differentiator for Kimco, as we are just getting started with the repositioning of our top assets. 
As you can see, our 2020 vision is coming more and more into focus, as we create a portfolio of assets that is both resilient to economic downturns, and at the same time able to attract the best tenants to generate quality earnings growth and expand our overall net asset value. 
Our portfolio is focused and concentrated in the best U.S. markets with the best demographics. Our shopping centers strike a wonderful balance with off-price and grocery anchors and just the right mix of small-shop tenants. These are the types of centers that consumers return to again and again in good times and bad, whether they are looking to restock their refrigerator at Albertsons, treasure hunt at TJX or get a haircut or manicure. 
When you add our Signature Series of development and redevelopment projects to this solid defensive foundation, the portfolio's changing profile is dramatic, both in quality and value. 
Ross will now walk you through our transactions for the quarter."

The largest driver of our progress was the continued and",564,"Thanks, Conor. With the execution of our second quarter transaction activity completed, we took another big step towards our goals of reducing leverage, joint ventures and non-core market ownership. The largest driver of our progress was the continued and accelerated pace of our Canadian exit, highlighted by the Anthem transaction, which closed last month. Coupled with the sale of several additional Canadian assets, we have now sold over 90% of our Canadian NOI with the remainder to be sold by year-end. 
In the U.S., we took advantage of the strong investor demand for shopping centers, with the disposition of 12 assets for $220 million. This included the sale of our last remaining asset in Mississippi as well as other non-core assets in markets such as Council Bluffs, Iowa and Overland Park, Kansas. 
The blended cap rate on the dispositions for the quarter was 6.6%, which was in line with our expectations. We will continue to selectively prune the portfolio to enhance the overall quality on a go-forward basis. 
On the acquisition side, we remain laser-focused on high-quality assets, with both long- and short-term growth, located within strong demographic areas. As previously announced, the acquisition of our partner share in Oakwood Plaza and Dania not only provides Kimco with 100% ownership of 2 of the largest and highest-quality projects in the portfolio, but also further achieves the goal of JV reduction. 
Additionally, we are excited to announce the planned acquisition of the Kentlands marketplace, a 250,000 square-foot Whole Foods-anchored center in Gaithersburg, Maryland. This Metro DC asset provides a unique opportunity to own a highly coveted infill asset, with excellent grocery sales of almost $1,300 a square foot, and also has significant near-term upside and redevelopment potential. Closing is anticipated in the next couple of weeks, and we look forward to sharing our plans for this asset. 
Our transactional activity for the year has been front-loaded with asset sales, as we have sold $821 million KIM share, which bumped against the low end of our initial 2016 disposition range of $825 million to $975 million. 
With over 20 assets either under contract, with accepted offers or in the market, we are increasing our full year 2016 disposition range to $1 billion to $1.15 billion. Our 2016 estimate for acquisitions remains intact at $450 million to $550 million, as we will have purchased approximately $250 million of shopping centers, including the pending Kentlands acquisition. 
The environment for quality real estate remains hypercompetitive, but we continue to evaluate unique opportunities and pick our spots. Capital is abundant, with significant equity being placed by foreign investors, pension funds, life companies, private equity and REITs. Debt is readily available from CMBS and life companies with historically low rates and yields are expected to stay low for the near future. 
Recent sub-5% cap rates on open-air shopping center transactions have closed in New York-New Jersey Metro; Los Angeles; San Diego; San Francisco; Austin, Texas; Washington, D.C.; and South Florida. These are all primary markets for Kimco, where we have a strong established presence. 
Single tenant ground leases with strong credit are trading in the low 4% range and even sub-4% in some cases, which bodes well for the value of our long-term ground leases with the likes of Walmart, Costco, Home Depot and others. 
With that, I'm happy to pass it over to Glenn to provide detail on the financials."

Our 2020 vision is focused on both the left side of the balance sheet as well as the right side as we continue to further improve our debt metrics and balance sheet position. 
Now for some color on the quarter and further details regarding the 3 strategic initiatives we announced last night, which we believe will further improve our capital structure as well as our recurring growth profile and tax efficiency in both the short term and long term. 
Headline FFO per share, which represents the official NAREIT definition, was $0.38 for the second quarter, meeting first call consensus. As a reminder, our consensus estimate is based on NAREIT-defined FFO. 
Included in the headline result is $0.01 per share attributable to profit participation from the sale of a preferred equity investment. Headline FFO per share for the second quarter last year was $0.44, which included $0.08 per share attributable to the gain on the sale of our marketable security investment in SUPERVALU. 
FFO as adjusted or recurring FFO, which excludes transactional income and expense and nonoperating impairments, was $0.37 per diluted share for the second quarter, the same level as last year. We achieved this level despite a $17 million decrease in net operating income, primarily attributable to the significant Canadian and U.S. property dispositions over the past year. 
This was largely offset by a $15 million reduction in financing costs related to lower debt levels, lower interest rates on debt refinancing and the redemption of our 6.9% preferred stock last year. 
For the 6 months, FFO as adjusted per share is $0.74, up from $0.73 for the comparable period last year and on target with our recurring forecast and guidance expectations. We ended the second quarter with consolidated net debt to recurring EBITDA of 5.7x, down from 6.3x a year ago. 
In addition, our net debt to EBITDA on a look-through basis is 6.9x, which includes our $800 million of preferred stock, which is all callable next year, and our pro-rata share of joint venture debt, which, by the way, is down to $843 million from a peak of $3 billion. The 6.9x level is at the high end of our target range of 6.4x to 6.9x that we announced at our 2020 vision Investor Day. 
We improved our debt maturity profile with the addition of $150 million to our 4.25% 30-year bond, and we also issued $38.9 million of common equity through our ATM program in the early part of the quarter. 
Now for some additional color on the 3 strategic initiatives announced last night. Initiative one, redeeming our outstanding Canadian bonds. As Ross mentioned, with the completed sale of Canadian assets representing over 90% of our Canadian NOI, it's no longer necessary to have the Canadian-denominated bonds outstanding. 
This is clearly an opportunity for us to further delever the balance sheet. As such, we will be redeeming the Canadian-denominated $350 million of bonds at the end of August using the proceeds from the Canadian sales, which have also produced over $111 million of non-FFO gains year-to-date. We expect to incur a prepayment charge of approximately $26 million or $0.06 per share, which will impact net income and headline FFO in the third quarter. 
Initiative 2, the prepayment of U.S. debt that's due in 2017. As part of reaching our stated goal of increasing our unsecured credit ratings to A- and A3, we want to further extend our debt maturity profile, further improve our fixed charge and debt service coverage ratios and increase our unencumbered asset pool. 
To this end, we'll be redeeming our $290.9 million, 5.7% bond due in 2017 and prepaying $137 million of 6.32% mortgage debt that's due in December of 2017. The funding of the aggregate principal amount of $427.9 million and the prepayment charge of $22 million or $0.05 per share, which will impact net income and headline FFO, will be made with a combination of proceeds from asset sales, availability under our revolving credit facility and depending on market conditions, issuance of an unsecured bond. 
Initiative 3, merging our primary taxable REIT subsidiary, Kimco Realty Services, into Kimco Realty Corporation. This tax-free merger will effectively transfer the ownership of our Albertsons investment in over 30 shopping center assets, many of which were developed in our former merchant building business but retained, and today are considered long-term hold properties. 
This transaction will provide us greater tax efficiency as well as reduce our administrative costs. In conjunction with the merger, which is expected to be completed in the third quarter, generally accepted accounting principles require the establishment of evaluation reserve when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
As such, a noncash charge against net income of $66 million or $0.16 per share and headline FFO of $41 million or $0.10 a share, respectively, will be recorded. The difference between the net income charge and the FFO charge is related to the tax impact from impairments previously taken on operating properties, which were excluded from FFO. 
Now, subsequent to the merger, a portion of this valuation reserve may no longer be required in the event certain taxable transactions related to these assets occur. This would include a monetization of our Albertsons investment. 
In total, the 3 initiatives just discussed are expected to have a total impact on net income of approximately $114 million or $0.27 per share and our headline FFO of $89 million or $0.21 per share. 
As a result of the charges, we are revising our headline FFO per share guidance range to $1.34 to $1.42 with the midpoint of $1.38 from the previous headline FFO per share guidance range of $1.54 to $1.62 with the midpoint of $1.58. We continue to anticipate that the bulk of our transaction income will occur in the fourth quarter. 
We are reaffirming our FFO as adjusted or recurring FFO per share guidance range of $1.48 to $1.52 with a midpoint of $1.50, which builds upon our solid first half performance and the expected benefits from the 3 initiatives, along with the impact from the Sports Authority liquidation and our increased disposition range. 
And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions."

Today, we will report on major milestones that encompass our 2020 vision. I will give a quick update on the execution of our strategic goals, quarterly metrics and development and redevelopment pipelines before turning it over to Ross to cover acquisitions and dispositions, followed by Glenn to discuss our financial results. 
We are making great strides in creating long-term shareholder value as we continue to simplify and strengthen our business. With our recent Canadian dispositions, our strategic exit from Canada is over 90% complete, and we have further reduced our joint venture investment. 
More specifically, the number of properties in our JV portfolio now stands at 152 as compared to 551 sites in 2010, a decrease of 72%. And the overall value of the joint venture portfolio is currently $5.4 billion gross as compared to $12.3 billion gross in 2010, a decrease of 56%. 
We are further simplifying our capital structure by redeeming our Canadian bonds to coincide with our exit of Canada. We will also prepay an unsecured bond and a portion of our U.S. mortgages that come due in 2017, to take full advantage of the all-time low rate environment and further extend our maturity profile. 
We continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities in the capital markets, including the use of our ATM to improve the balance sheet as we strive to achieve our publicly-stated goal of achieving an A- A3 credit rating. All of these efforts will put Kimco in a position of strength for the next cycle and move us closer to our 2020 vision. 
Internally, we will be merging our primary taxable REIT subsidiary into the parent company, thus transferring long-term hold assets into the REIT structure to simplify and make our holdings more efficient. 
Overall, the strong fundamentals of high-quality open-air centers continue to demonstrate why we believe we are, to use Milton's words, in the sweet spot of retail. 
Supply and demand remain in check, with limited new development on the horizon. Retailers with new formats and off-price specialty and traditional grocers, pet stores, home improvement, fitness, wellness and beauty are all looking to grow store count. 
Our occupancy is up to 96%, with our anchor boxes at 98.3% and our small shop occupancy improving to 89.2%. Achieving an 8-year high in occupancy could not have been accomplished without the incredible effort of our entire team. 
New deal spreads improved to 29.8%, demonstrating the portfolio's mark-to-market opportunity. Renewals and options also improved 10.7% to produce an impressive combined leasing spread of 16.2%, our highest in 3 years. Same-site NOI increased 3.1%, which included 30 basis points from redevelopment. 
Notwithstanding this success, the Sports Authority liquidation will create some near-term headwinds, but will result in long-term positives. Our exposure to Sports Authority has been reduced, with retailers acquiring 2 leases at auction, reducing our exposure to 1.1% of ABR. 
We also seized the opportunity to buy back the lease at our Farmington, Connecticut property, which has 52 years of term remaining at a $4 rent, which was dramatically below market. 
The numerous auction delays and false starts resulted in a shallow pool of retailers that were willing to pay the unpaid pre-petition rent and live by the existing lease terms. Throughout the auction process, we've been proactively marketing the 23 remaining boxes, and have 1 fully executed lease and LOIs working on all remaining locations. 
We see further opportunity to add a grocery component in certain locations and the ability to mark-to-market undervalued leases. Based upon the interest we are receiving, we are optimistic the absorption of these spaces will be swift over the next 6 to 12 months. 
We are maintaining our full year guidance for same-site NOI growth and occupancy based on our re-forecast that incorporate the impact from the Sports Authority liquidation and demand for our high-quality real estate. 
Progress continues on our strategic development and redevelopment pipeline, especially on our larger projects that we are calling the Signature Series. Whole Foods in Wynnewood, PA is now installing fixtures in their new store and is set to open in September. 
Grand Parkway in Houston is on schedule and is now 89% pre-leased. The Target pad was turned over on June 10, and all 7 junior anchor leases are fully executed. Grand Parkway Phase 2 is also moving forward, with 2 of the 3 anchor boxes fully executed with Academy Sports and Hobby Lobby. 
Dania Pointe in the Fort Lauderdale MSA is also on schedule. The Costco pad is being prepped with turnover set for second quarter of 2017. Phase 2 of Dania has kicked off pre-leasing, and we are happy to announce the fully executed anchor lease with H&M. 
Our major redevelopments are also gaining traction, highlighted by the new parking garage at Pentagon, which is nearing completion. This will allow us to move forward with the Phase 1 densifications. Our redevelopments for the quarter are projected to produce 9.9% return on invested capital, and we continue to believe this growing pipeline is a major differentiator for Kimco, as we are just getting started with the repositioning of our top assets. 
As you can see, our 2020 vision is coming more and more into focus, as we create a portfolio of assets that is both resilient to economic downturns, and at the same time able to attract the best tenants to generate quality earnings growth and expand our overall net asset value. 
Our portfolio is focused and concentrated in the best U.S. markets with the best demographics. Our shopping centers strike a wonderful balance with off-price and grocery anchors and just the right mix of small-shop tenants. These are the types of centers that consumers return to again and again in good times and bad, whether they are looking to restock their refrigerator at Albertsons, treasure hunt at TJX or get a haircut or manicure. 
When you add our Signature Series of development and redevelopment projects to this solid defensive foundation, the portfolio's changing profile is dramatic, both in quality and value. 
Ross will now walk you through our transactions for the quarter."

The largest driver of our progress was the continued and",564,"Thanks, Conor. With the execution of our second quarter transaction activity completed, we took another big step towards our goals of reducing leverage, joint ventures and non-core market ownership. The largest driver of our progress was the continued and accelerated pace of our Canadian exit, highlighted by the Anthem transaction, which closed last month. Coupled with the sale of several additional Canadian assets, we have now sold over 90% of our Canadian NOI with the remainder to be sold by year-end. 
In the U.S., we took advantage of the strong investor demand for shopping centers, with the disposition of 12 assets for $220 million. This included the sale of our last remaining asset in Mississippi as well as other non-core assets in markets such as Council Bluffs, Iowa and Overland Park, Kansas. 
The blended cap rate on the dispositions for the quarter was 6.6%, which was in line with our expectations. We will continue to selectively prune the portfolio to enhance the overall quality on a go-forward basis. 
On the acquisition side, we remain laser-focused on high-quality assets, with both long- and short-term growth, located within strong demographic areas. As previously announced, the acquisition of our partner share in Oakwood Plaza and Dania not only provides Kimco with 100% ownership of 2 of the largest and highest-quality projects in the portfolio, but also further achieves the goal of JV reduction. 
Additionally, we are excited to announce the planned acquisition of the Kentlands marketplace, a 250,000 square-foot Whole Foods-anchored center in Gaithersburg, Maryland. This Metro DC asset provides a unique opportunity to own a highly coveted infill asset, with excellent grocery sales of almost $1,300 a square foot, and also has significant near-term upside and redevelopment potential. Closing is anticipated in the next couple of weeks, and we look forward to sharing our plans for this asset. 
Our transactional activity for the year has been front-loaded with asset sales, as we have sold $821 million KIM share, which bumped against the low end of our initial 2016 disposition range of $825 million to $975 million. 
With over 20 assets either under contract, with accepted offers or in the market, we are increasing our full year 2016 disposition range to $1 billion to $1.15 billion. Our 2016 estimate for acquisitions remains intact at $450 million to $550 million, as we will have purchased approximately $250 million of shopping centers, including the pending Kentlands acquisition. 
The environment for quality real estate remains hypercompetitive, but we continue to evaluate unique opportunities and pick our spots. Capital is abundant, with significant equity being placed by foreign investors, pension funds, life companies, private equity and REITs. Debt is readily available from CMBS and life companies with historically low rates and yields are expected to stay low for the near future. 
Recent sub-5% cap rates on open-air shopping center transactions have closed in New York-New Jersey Metro; Los Angeles; San Diego; San Francisco; Austin, Texas; Washington, D.C.; and South Florida. These are all primary markets for Kimco, where we have a strong established presence. 
Single tenant ground leases with strong credit are trading in the low 4% range and even sub-4% in some cases, which bodes well for the value of our long-term ground leases with the likes of Walmart, Costco, Home Depot and others. 
With that, I'm happy to pass it over to Glenn to provide detail on the financials."

Our 2020 vision is focused on both the left side of the balance sheet as well as the right side as we continue to further improve our debt metrics and balance sheet position. 
Now for some color on the quarter and further details regarding the 3 strategic initiatives we announced last night, which we believe will further improve our capital structure as well as our recurring growth profile and tax efficiency in both the short term and long term. 
Headline FFO per share, which represents the official NAREIT definition, was $0.38 for the second quarter, meeting first call consensus. As a reminder, our consensus estimate is based on NAREIT-defined FFO. 
Included in the headline result is $0.01 per share attributable to profit participation from the sale of a preferred equity investment. Headline FFO per share for the second quarter last year was $0.44, which included $0.08 per share attributable to the gain on the sale of our marketable security investment in SUPERVALU. 
FFO as adjusted or recurring FFO, which excludes transactional income and expense and nonoperating impairments, was $0.37 per diluted share for the second quarter, the same level as last year. We achieved this level despite a $17 million decrease in net operating income, primarily attributable to the significant Canadian and U.S. property dispositions over the past year. 
This was largely offset by a $15 million reduction in financing costs related to lower debt levels, lower interest rates on debt refinancing and the redemption of our 6.9% preferred stock last year. 
For the 6 months, FFO as adjusted per share is $0.74, up from $0.73 for the comparable period last year and on target with our recurring forecast and guidance expectations. We ended the second quarter with consolidated net debt to recurring EBITDA of 5.7x, down from 6.3x a year ago. 
In addition, our net debt to EBITDA on a look-through basis is 6.9x, which includes our $800 million of preferred stock, which is all callable next year, and our pro-rata share of joint venture debt, which, by the way, is down to $843 million from a peak of $3 billion. The 6.9x level is at the high end of our target range of 6.4x to 6.9x that we announced at our 2020 vision Investor Day. 
We improved our debt maturity profile with the addition of $150 million to our 4.25% 30-year bond, and we also issued $38.9 million of common equity through our ATM program in the early part of the quarter. 
Now for some additional color on the 3 strategic initiatives announced last night. Initiative one, redeeming our outstanding Canadian bonds. As Ross mentioned, with the completed sale of Canadian assets representing over 90% of our Canadian NOI, it's no longer necessary to have the Canadian-denominated bonds outstanding. 
This is clearly an opportunity for us to further delever the balance sheet. As such, we will be redeeming the Canadian-denominated $350 million of bonds at the end of August using the proceeds from the Canadian sales, which have also produced over $111 million of non-FFO gains year-to-date. We expect to incur a prepayment charge of approximately $26 million or $0.06 per share, which will impact net income and headline FFO in the third quarter. 
Initiative 2, the prepayment of U.S. debt that's due in 2017. As part of reaching our stated goal of increasing our unsecured credit ratings to A- and A3, we want to further extend our debt maturity profile, further improve our fixed charge and debt service coverage ratios and increase our unencumbered asset pool. 
To this end, we'll be redeeming our $290.9 million, 5.7% bond due in 2017 and prepaying $137 million of 6.32% mortgage debt that's due in December of 2017. The funding of the aggregate principal amount of $427.9 million and the prepayment charge of $22 million or $0.05 per share, which will impact net income and headline FFO, will be made with a combination of proceeds from asset sales, availability under our revolving credit facility and depending on market conditions, issuance of an unsecured bond. 
Initiative 3, merging our primary taxable REIT subsidiary, Kimco Realty Services, into Kimco Realty Corporation. This tax-free merger will effectively transfer the ownership of our Albertsons investment in over 30 shopping center assets, many of which were developed in our former merchant building business but retained, and today are considered long-term hold properties. 
This transaction will provide us greater tax efficiency as well as reduce our administrative costs. In conjunction with the merger, which is expected to be completed in the third quarter, generally accepted accounting principles require the establishment of evaluation reserve when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
As such, a noncash charge against net income of $66 million or $0.16 per share and headline FFO of $41 million or $0.10 a share, respectively, will be recorded. The difference between the net income charge and the FFO charge is related to the tax impact from impairments previously taken on operating properties, which were excluded from FFO. 
Now, subsequent to the merger, a portion of this valuation reserve may no longer be required in the event certain taxable transactions related to these assets occur. This would include a monetization of our Albertsons investment. 
In total, the 3 initiatives just discussed are expected to have a total impact on net income of approximately $114 million or $0.27 per share and our headline FFO of $89 million or $0.21 per share. 
As a result of the charges, we are revising our headline FFO per share guidance range to $1.34 to $1.42 with the midpoint of $1.38 from the previous headline FFO per share guidance range of $1.54 to $1.62 with the midpoint of $1.58. We continue to anticipate that the bulk of our transaction income will occur in the fourth quarter. 
We are reaffirming our FFO as adjusted or recurring FFO per share guidance range of $1.48 to $1.52 with a midpoint of $1.50, which builds upon our solid first half performance and the expected benefits from the 3 initiatives, along with the impact from the Sports Authority liquidation and our increased disposition range. 
And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions."

You're obviously largely there, but you did raise your disposition and expectations again, which is offsetting some of the positives from the debt redemptions and the TRS merger.

With that, though, the Albertsons transaction and the investment in Albertsons comes along with it because we own less than 10% of the investment there and allowed us to bring it back into the REIT.

I'm pleased to announce another strong quarter driven by our high-quality operating portfolio and the tireless efforts of our team. This quarter, we made the decision to remove any contribution to our NAREI",704,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. 
I'm pleased to announce another strong quarter driven by our high-quality operating portfolio and the tireless efforts of our team. This quarter, we made the decision to remove any contribution to our NAREIT-defined FFO from [indiscernible] monetization for 2 major reasons. First and foremost, we believe we should not succumb to the pressures of short-term [indiscernible] and pursue the sale of a portion of our Albertsons investment in an environment that would negatively impact creating long-term value for our shareholders. Currently, grocery stores are dealing with food deflation, while the IPO more remains challenging. Despite these headwinds, Albertsons continues to increase EBITDA providing free cash flow to pay down debt and invest in the business. Second, and sometimes forgotten, are the significant real estate holdings of the company. Close to half of the chain's 2,300 stores are either owned or under long-term ground leases, with concentrations in desirable markets, such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Washington, D.C. In fact, the recently updated S-1 noted an estimated value of $12.1 billion for its real estate holdings. We believe that over a medium-term horizon, our investment in Albertsons will provide Kimco with significant capital to reinvest in our recurring business activities and create long-term shareholder value. As a reminder, we are just shy of 2 years into the merger of Albertsons and Safeway and the company continues to reap the benefits of scale through execution on the planned synergies. The S-1 remains current and we continue to monitor the markets with our partners. To be clear, we remain focused on our core business and we'll continue to fund capital requirements of free cash flow after dividends, opportunistic use of our ATM and disposition proceeds. 
Our 2020 Vision outlines our plan to create long-term shareholder value by focusing on our building blocks of growth, reducing leverage and maintaining our cost efficient capital structure. The fundamentals of our opener shopping center portfolio remains strong due to favorable balance of supply and demand in the major metro markets. As the performance on key metrics demonstrates, our operating platform continues to deliver value to our shareholders. A wide range of opener retailers, including our first Nike store, continue to expand and seek growth opportunities in high-quality real estate. Supply has modestly increased recently due to bankruptcies and an [indiscernible] closings and we are monitoring closely the shadow supply coming from struggling department stores at enclosed malls. Overall, however, this environment provides the ability for us to position our real estate with best-in-class retailers that drive more traffic and sales. While The Sports Authority liquidation drove the dip in anchor occupancy, we are pleased with the leasing momentum on those boxes. Seven of our 25 Sports Authority boxes are now fully committed. The deals include: [indiscernible] sporting goods; a Land Rover Jaguar dealership; [indiscernible] supply hardware; home goods [indiscernible] combo; Burlington; and [indiscernible] Grocery. The anchor leasing volume was the strongest this quarter year-to-date, with 19 anchor deals fully executed. Small shop leasing continues to progress. Even though pro rata occupancy remain flat this quarter, this is primarily due to the dispositions of a number of fully occupied centers that had limited upside [indiscernible] and the purchase of assets, with significant redevelopment potential that included considerable small shop vacancy, which we believe offers future upsides. 
The strategic free development and development pipeline, which we are calling our Signature Series, continues to mature and deliver results. As an update, we moved the first phase of our flagship suburban square redevelopment for the active pipeline, where we have an executed lease to expand Trader Joe's and construction underway to build a new parking facility to provide Kimco with further densification opportunities. Separately, our Whole Foods development is now open and thriving in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania and has moved out of our development pipeline and into the operating portfolio. Our Signature Series continues to provide the company with significant internal growth opportunities and we remain laser-focused on the execution. This quarter, we delivered $65 million of redevelopment projects, producing on incremental ROI of 10%. 
I will now turn the call over to Ross who will provide a deeper dive in the transaction activity this quarter."

The third quarter was a successful continuation of our strategy and transformation of the portfolio composition, resulting a higher quality asset-based, with stronger demographics and tenancy. This includes our [indiscernible] marketpl",629,"Thank you, Conor. 
The third quarter was a successful continuation of our strategy and transformation of the portfolio composition, resulting a higher quality asset-based, with stronger demographics and tenancy. This includes our [indiscernible] marketplace acquisition in Metro DC, which offers significant value creation and redevelopment opportunities for our team. In just 2 short months of ownership, our plans to reposition the asset are underway and the preliminary interest has been very strong. We expect to begin seeking municipal input regarding our plans in the coming month. Also, during the third quarter, we bought out a JV partner on a 4-property portfolio, with asset located in our core markets in Atlanta, Houston Washington, D.C. and Pittsburgh and acquiring additional JV asset, Gateway center in Seattle, where we are working on a supermarket and pharmacy lease to reposition this well located asset. These acquisitions, along with the Canadian asset sales, helped further reduce our JV portfolio as we continue to simplify our ownership position while increasing the percentage of wholly owned net operating income coming from the overall portfolio. The wholly owned NOI is now 85% compared to being at a low of 60% level a few years earlier. In Q3 2015, we had 264 JV properties and at Q3 2016, we have only 135 JV properties, nearly a 50% reduction in 1 year. 
The acquisition [indiscernible] continues to be extremely competitive for core assets as investors of all types chase hard assets in the United States. Pension fund advisers, REITs and private operators have all narrowed the definition of core, which has further limited the available supply of institutional quality assets. This has created bidding wars for the highest quality assets in major MSAs, pushing down cap rates even further, notwithstanding the potential risk of interest rates hikes in the future. While some may view the current real estate environment as expensive, on a relative basis, we continue to believe that, compared to alternative investment options, our asset class remains a wonderful investment, with a healthy spread between cap rates and treasury's. Our focus remains on making investments and solid real estate with a strong business plan. 
We also consider the dynamic that new shopping center development remains at all-time lows, together with the living and shopping [indiscernible] of millennials to recognize that the first ring outside the Irving core has become extremely desirable for investment, redevelopment and repurposing. This has created mix use opportunities offering a live work play environment, which we believe offer attractive investment opportunities. We are constantly evaluating these types of projects while remaining disciplined in our search for quality assets. 
On the dispositions side, the sale of our interest in 5 Canadian assets has reduced our ownership in Canada to 1 remaining shopping center and 2 land parcels. In just 12 months, the NOI coming from Canada have gotten from approximately $19 million in the third quarter of 2015 to roughly $1 million in the third quarter of 2016. We are thrilled with our progress. In the United States, we sold 7 assets for $53.3 million, 49 million Kimco share. Execution on sales of noncore assets has become more challenging and it is critical to perform due diligence to the buyer [indiscernible] before selecting the buyer. In addition, we've seen the pricing between the core trophy and the secondary market assets, particularly non-grocery, widen from 9 to 12 months ago. Fortunately, we are at the tail end of the heavy lifting and expect to close approximately $100 million of asset sales in the fourth quarter. We will continue to review the portfolio and judiciously sell assets that do not fit within our long-term 2020 Vision.

Our execution during the third quarter takes another step forward towards achieving our 2020 Vision. Our operating results were solid despite the short-term headwinds of The Sports Authority store close. We also successfully completed 3 strategic initiatives related to our Canadian debt repayment, U.S. debt repayment and the merger of our TRS into the REIT. Headline FFO per share, which represents the official NAREIT definition, was $0.18 per diluted share for the third quarter. Included in the headline result is $45.7 million of early extinguishment of debt charges in connection with the prepayment of 350 million Canadian denominated bonds, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.77%, the prepayment of our 5.7% $291 million U.S. bond and the prepayment of $137 million of 6.32% mortgage debt encumbering 10 properties. Also included in the headline result is a non-cash FFO charge of $36.2 million associated with the deferred tax valuation allowance in connection with the TRS REIT merger. The one-time charges associated with the prepayments in the TRS REIT merger totaled $0.20 per share. These initiatives will enhance our future profitability and our tax efficiencies. 
FFO as adjusted, or recurring FFO, which excludes transactional income and expenses and nonoperating impairments, was $0.38 per diluted share for the third quarter, up 5.6% on $0.36 per diluted share last year. These solid results include the diluted impact of further transforming and simplifying the business over the past year with the sale of over $1 billion of U.S. assets and another $1.1 billion of assets in Canada and Mexico. The proceeds raised from these efforts were used to acquire $800 million of high-quality, wholly owned U.S. assets in our key markets from our joint venture partners and third parties. The net effect of this activity reduced net operating income, including our pro rata share from the joint ventures, by $23.5 million. This was largely offset by a reduction in financing costs of $18.2 million related to lower debt levels of $1 billion, lower interest rates on debt refinancings and the redemption of our $175 million, 6.9% preferred tax last year. Recurring tax savings from the TRS REIT merger were an additional contributor. 
Turning to our operating metrics. U.S. occupancy stands at 95.1%, down 90 basis points from last quarter and 50 basis points from a year ago. The Sports Authority's store closure account for 85 days as points of the decrease from last quarter. Positive net absorption of 35 basis points from a year ago mitigated the TSA impact. As Conor mentioned, our operating team is making great strides in releasing these boxes, with a higher quality tenants that will drive increased traffic to the centers. Occupancy of our boxes over 10,000 square feet remain a healthy 97% in our small shop occupancy [indiscernible] 89.2% of 120 basis points from a year ago. Leasing spreads continue to be strong, with new leasing spreads of 26.6% and renewal on option spreads, up 7.8%, for a combined spreads of 12.9%. U.S. same-site NOI growth was 3.3% for the quarter, notwithstanding a 110 basis point negative impact from The Sports Authority bankruptcy. Redevelopments contributed 60 basis points this quarter. For the 9 months, U.S. same-site NOI growth stands at 2.9%, including a negative 60 basis point impact from TSA. We have narrowed our U.S. same site NOI guidance for the full year to a range of 2.7% to 3.3% from the previous range of 2.5% to 3.5%. We remain focused on further strengthening our balance sheet metrics and debt maturity profile. Consolidated net debt to EBITDA, as adjusted, is 5.8x, with a target of 5x to 5.5x. On a look through basis, including pro rata joint venture debt and perpetual preferred stock, the look through metric was 7.1x, with a goal of 6.46.9x. During the quarter, we issued a new $500 million 10-year unsecured bond and a coupon of 2.8%, the second 10-year coupon ever issued by a REIT. Over the last year, we've extended our consolidated weighted average debt maturity profile to 6.7 years from 4.3 years just a year ago. 
We opportunistically utilize our ATM program to issue 4.8 million shares of common stock at a weighted average sale price of $30.59 per share, raising $146.7 million of proceeds. The proceeds we used for accretive and value creating acquisitions of the 4 property joint venture buyouts and the Kentlands project that Ross mentioned in his remarks. Year-to-date, we have issued 9.8 million shares of common stock, raising net proceeds of $285 million. 
Let me spend a moment on guidance. Based on the solid results during the first 9 months, achieving $1.12 per diluted share for FFO as adjusted, we are narrowing our FFO as adjusted per share guidance range to $1.49 to $1.51 from the previous per share guidance range of $1.48 to $1.52. For the 9 months, we achieved NAREIT-defined FFO of $0.94 per diluted share. We previously stated that our 2016 NAREIT-defined guidance included a partial Albertsons monetization in the fourth quarter. As Conor mentioned, we're not anticipating a monetization of our outlets and investment this year. As such, we revised our NAREIT-defined FFO guidance to a range of $1.30 to $1.32, with a midpoint of $1.31 from the previous range of $1.34 to $1.42, with a midpoint of $1.38. The reduction is solely attributable to not monetizing a portion of our Albertsons investment this year. We remain confident that we will be able to do so in accordance with our 2020 Vision. 
We are currently deeply into our property by property budget process and we'll provide 2017 guidance on our next earnings call. 
Our initial 2017 NAREIT-defined guidance range will not include any transactional encumbered expense. As such, our NAREIT-defined FFO per share range and our FFO as adjusted per share range will be comparable at the start of the year and will only differ upon the execution of specifically identified transactional events. We remain focused on growing our recurring earnings and cash flows. 
Lastly, we are pleased to announce that based on our 2016 performance, and expectations for 2017, our Board of Directors has approved an increase in the common stock quarterly cash dividend to $0.27 per share from $0.255, an increase of 5.9% on an annualized basis. Our FFO as adjusted payout ratio remains conservative among the lowest in the peer group. 
And with that, we'd be happy to answer your questions."

We want to be sure that it's something that checks all the boxes with our strategy and where we want to take the company and the portfolio. And we also want to be very careful in terms of how much more we add to the pipeline. You'll probably see maybe another development deal or 2, but maybe probably not much more than that over the 5 years.

And as part of that, I'd also appreciate some thoughts specifically on potential stock repurchase, given your stock here in the mid-20s versus what [indiscernible] nearly $31?
Well, we always look at our capital allocation as our priority. And when you look at the pipeline of what we have outlined, clearly, the redevelopments are the most accretive in terms of returns to the company and its shareholders. So can't really remove that from the analysis because we think that's number 1, 2 and 3 for us going forward. And we have,  as we've said a number of different times, we have all the assets internally to work over. We don't actually have to go out, try to acquire assets in a very competitive market to try and create that internal value. So clearly, for us, that's a big differentiator, and we still think we're in the early innings of unlocking that value for the portfolio. Our share price has moved to -- with along with the interest rates environments. And we obviously can't control that. We did take advantage of the ATM when -- last quarter when we thought that it was prudent. And we used it accordingly, and we'll continue to monitor that. But for us, when we look in the open market, we want to be extremely selective and company of our size, we feel like we need right now to be extremely selective on third-party acquisitions, and you've seen us do that, and continue to finish off our disposition. So we have a 5-year plan that's outlined. We have all the building blocks internally to really unlock a tremendous amount of value for our shareholders. And for us, it's all about execution and making sure we deliver home those results."

Examples include, but are not limited to, funds from operations and net operating income. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures are also available on our website.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Conor."

I am pleased to announce another strong quarter, driven by our high-quality operating portfolio and the tireless efforts of our team.This quarter, we made the decision to remove any contribution to our NARE",710,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. I am pleased to announce another strong quarter, driven by our high-quality operating portfolio and the tireless efforts of our team.
This quarter, we made the decision to remove any contribution to our NAREIT-defined FFO from [ph] an hour since [ph] monetization for 2 major reasons. First and foremost, we believe we should not succumb to the pressures of short term [indiscernible] and pursue the sale of a portion of our Albertsons investment in an environment that would negatively impact, creating long-term value for our shareholders.
Currently, grocery stores are dealing with food deflation while the IPO market remains challenging. Despite these headwinds, Albertsons continues to increase EBITDA, providing substantial free cash flow to pay down debt and invest in the business.
Second, and sometimes forgotten, are the significant real estate holdings of the company. Close to half of the chain's 2,300 stores are either owned or under long-term ground leases, with concentrations in desirable markets, such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Washington, D.C. In fact, the recently updated S-1 noted an estimated value of $12.1 billion for its real estate holdings.
We believe that over a medium-term horizon, our investment in Albertsons will provide Kimco with significant capital to reinvest in our recurring business activities and create long-term shareholder value. As a reminder, we are just shy of 2 years into the merger of Albertsons and Safeway, and the company continues to reap the benefits of scale through execution on the planned synergies.
The S-1 remains current and we continue to monitor the markets with our partners. To be clear, we remain focused on our core business, and we'll continue to fund capital requirements with free cash flow after dividends, opportunistic use of our ATM and disposition proceeds.
Our 2020 vision outlines our plan to create long-term shareholder value by focusing on our building blocks of growth, reducing leverage and maintaining a cost-efficient capital structure. The fundamentals of our open-air shopping center portfolio remains strong due to the favorable balance of supply and demand in the major metro markets.
As the performance on key metrics demonstrates, our operating platform continues to deliver value to our shareholders. A wide range of open-air retailers, including our first Nike store, continue to expand and seek growth opportunities in high-quality real estate.
Supply has modestly increased recently due to bankruptcies and an out [ph] store closings, and we are monitoring closely the shadow supply coming from struggling department stores at enclosed malls. Overall, however, this environment provides the ability for us to position our real estate with best-in-class retailers that drive more traffic and sales.
While the Sports Authority liquidation drove the dip in anchor occupancy, we are pleased with the leasing momentum on those boxes. Seven of our 25 Sports Authority boxes are now fully committed. The deals include DICK'S Sporting Goods, a Land Rover Jaguar dealership, Orchard Supply Hardware, HomeGoods-Ulta combo, Burlington and H mart grocery.
Anchor leasing volume was the strongest this quarter year-to-date, with 19 anchored deals fully executed. Small shop leasing continues to progress. Even though pro rata occupancy remain flat this quarter, this is primarily due to the dispositions of a number of fully occupied centers that have limited upside remaining and the purchase of assets, with significant redevelopment potential that included considerable small shop vacancy, which we believe offers future upsides.
The strategic redevelopment and development pipeline, which we are calling our Signature Series, continues to mature and deliver results. As an update, we moved the first phase of our flagship Suburban Square redevelopment to the active pipeline, where we have an executed lease to expand Trader Joe's and construction underway to build a new parking facility to provide Kimco with further densification opportunities.
Separately, our Whole Foods development is now open and thriving in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania and has moved out of our development pipeline and into the operating portfolio. Our Signature Series continues to provide the company with significant internal growth opportunities, and we remain laser-focused on the execution. This quarter, we delivered $65 million of redevelopment projects, producing on incremental ROI of 10%.
I will now turn the call over to Ross, who will provide a deeper dive in the transaction activity this quarter."

The third quarter was a successful continuation of our strategy and transformation of the portfolio composition, resulting in a higher-quality asset base, with stronger demographics and tenancy.

The third quarter was a successful continuation of our strategy and transformation of the portfolio composition, resulting in a higher-quality asset base, with stronger demographics and tenancy. This includes our Kentlands Marketplace acquisition in Metro D.C., which offers significant value creation and redevelopment opportunities for our team. In just 2 short months of ownership, our plans to reposition the asset are underway, and the preliminary leasing interest has been very strong. We expect to begin seeking municipal input regarding our plans in the coming month.
Also, during the third quarter, we bought out a JV partner on a 4-property portfolio, with assets located in our core markets in Atlanta, Houston Washington, D.C. and Pittsburgh and acquiring additional JV asset, Gateway Center in Seattle, where we are working on a supermarket and pharmacy lease to reposition this well-located asset.
These acquisitions, along with the Canadian asset sales, helped further reduce our JV portfolio as we continue to simplify our ownership position while increasing the percentage of wholly owned net operating income coming from the overall portfolio. The wholly owned NOI is now 85% compared to being at a low of 60% level a few years earlier. In Q3 2015, we had 264 JV properties, and at Q3 2016, we have only 135 JV properties, nearly a 50% reduction in 1 year.
The acquisitions market continues to be extremely competitive for core assets as investors of all types chase hard assets in the United States. Pension fund advisers, REITs and private operators have all narrowed the definition of core, which has further limited the available supply of institutional quality assets. This has created bidding wars for the highest-quality assets in major MSAs, pushing down cap rates even further, notwithstanding the potential risk of interest rate hikes in the future.
While some may view the current real estate environment as expensive, on a relative basis, we continue to believe that compared to alternative investment options, our asset class remains a wonderful investment, with a healthy spread between cap rates and treasuries. Our focus remains on making investments and solid real estate with a strong business plan.
We also consider the dynamic that new shopping center development remains at all-time lows, together with the living and shopping tenants and [ph] millennials to recognize that the first ring outside the Irving core has become extremely desirable for investment, redevelopment and repurposing. This has created mix use opportunities offering a live, work, play environment, which we believe offer attractive investment opportunities. We are constantly evaluating these types of projects while remaining disciplined in our search for quality assets.
On the dispositions side, the sale of our interest in 5 Canadian assets has reduced our ownership in Canada to 1 remaining shopping center and 2 land parcels. In just 12 months, the NOI coming from Canada had gotten from approximately $19 million in the third quarter of 2015 to roughly $1 million in the third quarter of 2016. We are thrilled with our progress.
In the United States, we sold 7 assets for $53.3 million, 49 million Kimco share. Execution on sales of noncore assets has become more challenging, and it is critical to perform due diligence to the buyer pool before selecting the buyer. In addition, we've seen the pricing between the core trophy and the secondary market assets, particularly nongrocery, widen from 9 to 12 months ago. Fortunately, we're at the tail end of the heavy lifting and expect to close approximately $100 million of asset sales in the fourth quarter. We will continue to review the portfolio and judiciously sell assets that do not fit within our long-term 2020 vision.
Now I would like to introduce Glenn to provide additional color and insight on our financial performance for the quarter."

Our execution during the third quarter takes another step forward towards achieving our 2020 vision. Our operating results were solid despite the short-term headwinds of The Sports Authority store close. We also successfully completed 3 strategic initiatives related to our Canadian debt repayment, U.S. debt repayment and the merger of our TRS into the REIT.
Headline FFO per share, which represents the official NAREIT definition, was $0.18 per diluted share for the third quarter. Included in the headline result is $45.7 million of early extinguishment of debt charges in connection with the prepayment of $350 million Canadian-denominated bonds with a weighted average interest rate of 4.77%, the prepayment of our 5.7% $291 million U.S. bond and the prepayment of $137 million of 6.32% mortgage debt encumbering 10 properties.
Also included in the headline result is a noncash FFO charge of $36.2 million associated with the deferred tax valuation allowance in connection with the TRS REIT merger. The onetime charges associated with the prepayments in the TRS REIT merger totaled $0.20 per share. These initiatives will enhance our future profitability and our tax efficiencies.
FFO as adjusted or recurring FFO, which excludes transactional income and expenses and nonoperating impairments, was $0.38 per diluted share for the third quarter, up 5.6% from $0.36 per diluted share last year. These solid results include the diluted impact of further transforming and simplifying the business over the past year with the sale of over $1 billion of U.S. assets and another $1.1 billion of assets in Canada and Mexico.
The proceeds raised from these efforts were used to acquire $800 million of high-quality, wholly owned U.S. assets in our key markets from our joint venture partners and third parties. The net effect of this activity reduced net operating income, including our pro rata share from the joint ventures, by $23.5 million. This was largely offset by a reduction in financing costs of $18.2 million related to lower debt levels of $1 billion, lower interest rates on debt refinancings and the redemption of our $175 million, 6.9% preferred stock last year. Recurring tax savings from the TRS REIT merger were an additional contributor.
Turning to our operating metrics. U.S. occupancy stands at 95.1%, down 90 basis points from last quarter and 50 basis points from a year ago. The Sports Authority store closures account for 85 days as points of the decrease from last quarter. Positive net absorption of 35 basis points from a year ago mitigated the TSA impact. As Conor mentioned, our operating team is making great strides in releasing these boxes, with higher-quality tenants that will drive increased traffic to the centers.
Occupancy of our boxes over 10,000 square feet remain a healthy 97% in our small shop occupancy, that's [ph] 89.2% of 120 basis points from a year ago. Leasing spreads continue to be strong, with new leasing spreads up 26.6% and renewal on option spreads up 7.8% for combined spreads of 12.9%.
U.S. same-site NOI growth was 3.3% for the quarter, notwithstanding a 110 basis point negative impact from The Sports Authority bankruptcy. Redevelopments contributed 60 basis points this quarter. For the 9 months, U.S. same-site NOI growth stands at 2.9%, including a negative 60 basis point impact from TSA. We have narrowed our U.S. same-site NOI guidance for the full year to a range of 2.7% to 3.3% from the previous range of 2.5% to 3.5%.
We remain focused on further strengthening our balance sheet metrics and debt maturity profile. Consolidated net debt to EBITDA as adjusted is 5.8x with a target of 5 to 5.5x. On a look-through basis, including pro rata joint venture debt and perpetual preferred stock, the look-through metric was 7.1x with a goal of 6.4 to 6.9x.
During the quarter, we issued a new $500 million 10-year unsecured bond and a coupon of 2.8%, the second-lowest 10-year coupon ever issued by a REIT. Over the last year, we have extended our consolidated weighted average debt maturity profile to 6.7 years from 4.3 years just a year ago.
We opportunistically utilize our ATM program to issue 4.8 million shares of common stock at a weighted average sale price of $30.59 per share, raising $146.7 million of proceeds. The proceeds, we used for accretive and value-creating acquisitions of the 4 property joint venture buyouts and the Kentlands project that Ross mentioned in his remarks. Year-to-date, we have issued 9.8 million shares of common stock, raising net proceeds of $285 million.
Let me spend a moment on guidance. Based on the solid results during the first 9 months, achieving $1.12 per diluted share for FFO as adjusted, we are narrowing our FFO as adjusted per share guidance range to $1.49 to $1.51 from the previous per share guidance range of $1.48 to $1.52. For the 9 months, we achieved NAREIT-defined FFO of $0.94 per diluted share. We previously stated that our 2016 NAREIT-defined FFO guidance included a partial Albertsons monetization in the fourth quarter.
As Conor mentioned, we're not anticipating a monetization of our outlets since investment this year. As such, we revised our NAREIT-defined FFO guidance to a range of $1.30 to $1.32 with a midpoint of $1.31 from the previous range of $1.34 to $1.42 with a midpoint of $1.38. The reduction is solely attributable to not monetizing a portion of our Albertsons investment this year. We remain confident that we'll be able to do so in accordance with our 2020 vision.
We are currently deeply into our property-by-property budget process, and we'll provide 2017 guidance on our next earnings call. Our initial 2017 NAREIT-defined guidance range will not include any transactional encumbered expense. As such, our NAREIT-defined FFO per share range and our FFO as adjusted per share range will be comparable at the start of the year and will only differ upon the execution of specifically identified transactional events. We remain focused on growing our recurring earnings and cash flows.
Lastly, we are pleased to announce that based on our 2016 performance and expectations for 2017, our Board of Directors has approved an increase in the common stock quarterly cash dividend to $0.27 per share from $0.255, an increase of 5.9% on an annualized basis. Our FFO as adjusted payout ratio remains conservative, among the lowest in the peer group.
And with that, we'd be happy to answer your questions."

But we feel really confident in the projects we've identified. We're also making big strides on announcing pre-leasing on all those projects. So I think when you look at the risk reward, we still feel really strong about what they will deliver to our shareholders over the next 5 years. That said, going forward, we're going to be very careful on what we add to the pipeline. We want to be sure that it's something that checks all the boxes with our strategy and where we want to take the company and the portfolio. And we also want to be very careful in terms of how much more we add to the pipeline. You'll probably see maybe another development deal or 2, but maybe probably not much more than that over the 5 years. But you will see us ramp up redevelopment where we see the opportunity because we continue to believe that, that's the best use of our capital risk-adjusted and continue to think that there's more to come when you look at our shadow supply."

The grocery-anchored shopping center still see a bit of a deeper bench of bidders. But by way of example, our Q3 dispositions average in the mid-7s on a cap rate range. Overall, for the year, blended, we're closer to a 7. [ph] So that puts it in a little bit into context. But that being said, we are fortunate that we're in the very latter stages of our disposition process. So not every property that we put into the market is transacted. If we don't like the pricing, then we haven't sold it, but we've been pretty successful so far this year and we think that we will be for the rest of the year. In regards to the second part of the question, I think that all buyer types, whether institutional or private, are chasing upside value add in some form or fashion. So it really is, regardless of the location, the flatter income streams without any foreseeable growth have been challenging to move.

Again, there's a lot of headwinds at the moment just relative to the supermarket industry between the food deflation that we've talked about. And quite candidly, the IPO market is still pretty challenging. Having said that, the business is performing very well. The synergies that have been forecasted are coming to fruition and the longer we go, more of those synergies come and create more EBITDA for the company. So it's really, the group itself, us and our partners, are monitoring the market closely. You see that with keeping our S-1 current. So we are watching very closely for the right opportunity to begin to monetize the investment. You can look at where our partners are and know that at some point, where it makes sense, we are going to look to monetize the investment. That is clearly the path for all of us. But we want to do it prudently and where it makes the most sense to create the most shareholder value for us and everybody else in the group.

We obviously know them very well, having owned, leased and managed them for well over a decade. So we believe that there's still opportunity. They fit the program for us really well. In fact, we've already executed a 56,000-square-foot lease at our property in Atlanta. So we're already seeing the benefits of that ownership piece. So it's -- when you look at the JV program sort of its the totality, we continue to see it as an opportunity for us to acquire interests in very high quality assets that we already have a strong familiarity with. So we'll continue to seek opportunities from the JVs when the opportunity presents themselves."

I am pleased to announce another strong quarter, driven by our high-quality operating portfolio and the tireless efforts of our team.This quarter, we made the decision to remove any contribution to our NARE",703,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. I am pleased to announce another strong quarter, driven by our high-quality operating portfolio and the tireless efforts of our team.
This quarter, we made the decision to remove any contribution to our NAREIT-defined FFO from an Albertsons monetization for 2 major reasons. First and foremost, we believe we should not succumb to the pressures of short-termism and pursue the sale of a portion of our Albertsons investment in an environment that would negatively impact, creating long-term value for our shareholders.
Currently, grocery stores are dealing with food deflation while the IPO market remains challenging. Despite these headwinds, Albertsons continues to increase EBITDA, providing substantial free cash flow to pay down debt and invest in the business.
Second, and sometimes forgotten, are the significant real estate holdings of the company. Close to half of the chain's 2,300 stores are either owned or under long-term ground leases, with concentrations in desirable markets, such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Washington, D.C. In fact, the recently updated S-1 noted an estimated value of $12.1 billion for its real estate holdings.
We believe that over a medium-term horizon, our investment in Albertsons will provide Kimco with significant capital to reinvest in our recurring business activities and create long-term shareholder value. As a reminder, we are just shy of 2 years into the merger of Albertsons and Safeway, and the company continues to reap the benefits of scale through execution on the planned synergies.
The S-1 remains current and we continue to monitor the markets with our partners. To be clear, we remain focused on our core business, and we'll continue to fund capital requirements with free cash flow after dividends, opportunistic use of our ATM and disposition proceeds.
Our 2020 vision outlines our plan to create long-term shareholder value by focusing on our building blocks of growth, reducing leverage and maintaining a cost-efficient capital structure. The fundamentals of our open-air shopping center portfolio remains strong due to the favorable balance of supply and demand in the major metro markets.
As the performance on key metrics demonstrates, our operating platform continues to deliver value to our shareholders. A wide range of open-air retailers, including our first Nike store, continues to expand and seek growth opportunities in high-quality real estate.
Supply has modestly increased recently due to bankruptcies and announced store closings, and we are monitoring closely the shadow supply coming from struggling department stores at enclosed malls. Overall, however, this environment provides the ability for us to position our real estate with best-in-class retailers that drive more traffic and sales.
While the Sports Authority liquidation drove a dip in anchor occupancy, we are pleased with the leasing momentum on those boxes. Seven of our 25 Sports Authority boxes are now fully committed. The deals include DICK'S Sporting Goods, a Land Rover Jaguar dealership, Orchard Supply Hardware, HomeGoods-Ulta combo, Burlington and H mart grocery.
Anchor leasing volume was the strongest this quarter year-to-date, with 19 anchored deals fully executed. Small shop leasing continues to progress. Even though pro rata occupancy remained flat this quarter, this is primarily due to the dispositions of a number of fully occupied centers that had limited upside remaining and the purchase of assets, with significant redevelopment potential that included considerable small shop vacancy, which we believe offers future upsides.
The strategic redevelopment and development pipeline, which we are calling our Signature Series, continues to mature and deliver results. As an update, we moved the first phase of our flagship Suburban Square redevelopment to the active pipeline, where we have an executed lease to expand Trader Joe's and construction underway to build a new parking facility to provide Kimco with further densification opportunities.
Separately, our Whole Foods development is now open and thriving in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania and has moved out of our development pipeline and into the operating portfolio. Our Signature Series continues to provide the company with significant internal growth opportunities, and we remain laser-focused on the execution. This quarter, we delivered $65 million of redevelopment projects, producing on incremental ROI of 10%.
I will now turn the call over to Ross, who will provide a deeper dive into the transaction activity this quarter."

The third quarter was a successful continuation of our strategy and transformation of the portfolio composition, resulting in a higher-quality asset base, with stronger demographics and tenancy. This includes our Kentlands Marketplace acquisition in Metro D.C., which offers significant value creation and redevelopment opportunities for our team. In just 2 short months of ownership, our plans to reposition the asset are underway, and the preliminary leasing interest has been very strong. We expect to begin seeking municipal input regarding our plans in the coming month.
Also, during the third quarter, we bought out a JV partner on a 4-property portfolio, with assets located in our core markets of Atlanta, Houston Washington, D.C. and Pittsburgh and acquiring additional JV asset, Gateway Center in Seattle, where we are working on a supermarket and pharmacy lease to reposition this well-located asset.
These acquisitions, along with the Canadian asset sales, helped further reduce our JV portfolio as we continue to simplify our ownership position while increasing the percentage of wholly owned net operating income coming from the overall portfolio. The wholly owned NOI is now 85% compared to being at a low of 60% level a few years earlier. In Q3 2015, we had 264 JV properties, and at Q3 2016, we have only 135 JV properties, nearly a 50% reduction in 1 year.
The acquisitions market continues to be extremely competitive for core assets as investors of all types chase hard assets in the United States. Pension fund advisers, REITs and private operators have all narrowed the definition of core, which has further limited the available supply of institutional quality assets. This has created bidding wars for the highest-quality assets in major MSAs, pushing down cap rates even further, notwithstanding the potential risk of interest rate hikes in the future.
While some may view the current real estate environment as expensive, on a relative basis, we continue to believe that compared to alternative investment options, our asset class remains a wonderful investment, with a healthy spread between cap rates and treasuries. Our focus remains on making investments in solid real estate with a strong business plan.
We also consider the dynamic that new shopping center development remains at all-time lows, together with the living and shopping tenants of millennials to recognize that the first ring outside the Irving core has become extremely desirable for investment, redevelopment and repurposing. This has created mix use opportunities offering a live, work, play environment, which we believe offer attractive investment opportunities. We are constantly evaluating these types of projects while remaining disciplined in our search for quality assets.
On the disposition side, the sale of our interest in 5 Canadian assets has reduced our ownership in Canada to 1 remaining shopping center and 2 land parcels. In just 12 months, the NOI coming from Canada has gotten from approximately $19 million in the third quarter of 2015 to roughly $1 million in the third quarter of 2016. We are thrilled with our progress.
In the United States, we sold 7 assets for $53.3 million, 49 million Kimco share. Execution on sales of noncore assets has become more challenging, and it is critical to perform due diligence to the buyer pool before selecting the buyer. In addition, we've seen the pricing between the core trophy and the secondary market assets, particularly nongrocery, widen from 9 to 12 months ago. Fortunately, we're at the tail end of the heavy lifting and expect to close approximately $100 million of asset sales in the fourth quarter. We will continue to review the portfolio and judiciously sell assets that do not fit within our long-term 2020 vision.
Now I would like to introduce Glenn to provide additional color and insight on our financial performance for the quarter."

Our execution during the third quarter takes another step forward towards achieving our 2020 vision. Our operating results were solid despite the short-term headwinds of The Sports Authority store closing.  We also successfully completed 3 strategic initiatives related to our Canadian debt repayment, U.S. debt repayment and the merger of our TRS into the REIT.
Headline FFO per share, which represents the official NAREIT definition, was $0.18 per diluted share for the third quarter. Included in the headline result is $45.7 million of early extinguishment of debt charges in connection with the prepayment of $350 million Canadian-denominated bonds with a weighted average interest rate of 4.77%, the prepayment of our 5.7% $291 million U.S. bond and the prepayment of $137 million of 6.32% mortgage debt encumbering 10 properties.
Also included in the headline result is a noncash FFO charge of $36.2 million associated with a deferred tax valuation allowance in connection with the TRS REIT merger. The onetime charges associated with the prepayments in the TRS REIT merger totaled $0.20 per share. These initiatives will enhance our future profitability and our tax efficiencies.
FFO as adjusted or recurring FFO, which excludes transactional income and expenses and nonoperating impairments, was $0.38 per diluted share for the third quarter, up 5.6% from $0.36 per diluted share last year. These solid results include the diluted impact of further transforming and simplifying the business over the past year with the sale of over $1 billion of U.S. assets and another $1.1 billion of assets in Canada and Mexico.
The proceeds raised from these efforts were used to acquire $800 million of high-quality, wholly owned U.S. assets in our key markets from our joint venture partners and third parties. The net effect of this activity reduced net operating income, including our pro rata share from the joint ventures, by $23.5 million. This was largely offset by a reduction in financing costs of $18.2 million related to lower debt levels of $1 billion, lower interest rates on debt refinancings and the redemption of our $175 million, 6.9% preferred stock last year. Recurring tax savings from the TRS REIT merger were an additional contributor.
Turning to our operating metrics. U.S. occupancy stands at 95.1%, down 90 basis points from last quarter and 50 basis points from a year ago. The Sports Authority store closures account for 85 basis points of the decrease from last quarter. Positive net absorption of 35 basis points from a year ago mitigated the TSA impact. As Conor mentioned, our operating team is making great strides in releasing these boxes, with higher-quality tenants that will drive increased traffic to the centers.
Occupancy of our boxes over 10,000 square feet remain a healthy 97% in our small shop occupancy, this is 89.2% of 120 basis points from a year ago. Leasing spreads continue to be strong, with new leasing spreads up 26.6% and renewal on option spreads up 7.8% for combined spreads of 12.9%.
U.S. same-site NOI growth was 3.3% for the quarter, notwithstanding 110 basis point negative impact from The Sports Authority bankruptcy. Redevelopments contributed 60 basis points this quarter. For the 9 months, U.S. same-site NOI growth stands at 2.9%, including a negative 60 basis point impact from TSA. We have narrowed our U.S. same-site NOI guidance for the full year to a range of 2.7% to 3.3% from the previous range of 2.5% to 3.5%.
We remain focused on further strengthening our balance sheet metrics and debt maturity profile. Consolidated net debt to EBITDA as adjusted is 5.8x with a target of 5 to 5.5x. On a look-through basis, including pro rata joint venture debt and perpetual preferred stock, the look-through metric was 7.1x with a goal of 6.4 to 6.9x.
During the quarter, we issued a new $500 million 10-year unsecured bond and a coupon of 2.8%, the second-lowest 10-year coupon ever issued by a REIT. Over the last year, we have extended our consolidated weighted average debt maturity profile to 6.7 years from 4.3 years just a year ago.
We opportunistically utilized our ATM program to issue 4.8 million shares of common stock at a weighted average sale price of $30.59 per share, raising $146.7 million of proceeds. The proceeds, we used for accretive and value-creating acquisitions of the 4 property joint venture buyouts and the Kentlands project that Ross mentioned in his remarks. Year-to-date, we have issued 9.8 million shares of common stock, raising net proceeds of $285 million.
Let me spend a moment on guidance. Based on the solid results during the first 9 months, achieving $1.12 per diluted share for FFO as adjusted, we are narrowing our FFO as adjusted per share guidance range to $1.49 to $1.51 from the previous per share guidance range of $1.48 to $1.52. For the 9 months, we achieved NAREIT-defined FFO of $0.94 per diluted share. We previously stated that our 2016 NAREIT-defined FFO guidance included a partial Albertsons monetization in the fourth quarter.
As Conor mentioned, we're not anticipating a monetization of our Albertsons investment this year. As such, we revised our NAREIT-defined FFO guidance to a range of $1.30 to $1.32 with a midpoint of $1.31 from the previous range of $1.34 to $1.42 with a midpoint of $1.38. The reduction is solely attributable to not monetizing a portion of our Albertsons investment this year. We remain confident that we will be able to do so in accordance with our 2020 vision.
We are currently deeply into our property-by-property budget process, and we'll provide 2017 guidance on our next earnings call. Our initial 2017 NAREIT-defined guidance range will not include any transactional encumbered expense. As such, our NAREIT-defined FFO per share range and our FFO as adjusted per share range will be comparable at the start of the year and will only differ upon the execution of specifically identified transactional events. We remain focused on growing our recurring earnings and cash flows.
Lastly, we are pleased to announce that based on our 2016 performance and expectations for 2017, our Board of Directors has approved an increase in the common stock quarterly cash dividend to $0.27 per share from $0.255, an increase of 5.9% on an annualized basis. Our FFO as adjusted payout ratio remains conservative, among the lowest in the peer group.
And with that, we'd be happy to answer your questions."

But we feel really confident in the projects we've identified. We're also making big strides on announcing pre-leasing on all those projects. So I think when you look at the risk-reward, we still feel really strong about what they will deliver to our shareholders over the next 5 years. That said, going forward, we're going to be very careful on what we add to the pipeline. We want to be sure that it's something that checks all the boxes with our strategy and where we want to take the company and the portfolio. And we also want to be very careful in terms of how much more we add to the pipeline. You'll probably see maybe another development deal or 2, but maybe probably not much more than that over the 5 years. But you will see us ramp up redevelopment where we see the opportunity because we continue to believe that that's the best use of our capital risk-adjusted, and continue to think that there's more to come when you look at our shadow supply."

When we look sort of in our experience in the market today, the fully occupied stabilized assets are the ones where we're really seeing the shallower buyer pull, particularly without a grocery anchor. The grocery-anchored shopping center still sees a bit of a deeper bench of bidders. But by way of example, our Q3 dispositions average in the mid-7s on a cap rate range. Overall, for the year, blended, we're closer to a 7.  So that puts it in a little bit into context. But that being said we are fortunate that we're in the very latter stages of our disposition process. So not every property that we put into the market is transacted. If we don't like the pricing, then we haven't sold it, but we've been pretty successful so far this year and we think that we will be for the rest of the year. In regards to the second part of the question, I think that all buyer types, whether institutional or private, are chasing upside value add in some form or fashion. So it really is, regardless of the location, the flatter income streams without any foreseeable growth have been challenging to move. But certainly, I think the definitions of core, from a market perspective, continue to narrow to the major markets, and it's the secondary and the tertiary markets where the institutional investors are just really not focused at all, regardless of the quality of the assets within that market."

I am pleased to announce another strong quarter, driven by our high-quality operating portfolio and the tireless efforts of our team.This quarter, we made the decision to remove any contribution to our NARE",703,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. I am pleased to announce another strong quarter, driven by our high-quality operating portfolio and the tireless efforts of our team.
This quarter, we made the decision to remove any contribution to our NAREIT-defined FFO from an Albertsons monetization for 2 major reasons. First and foremost, we believe we should not succumb to the pressures of short-termism and pursue the sale of a portion of our Albertsons investment in an environment that would negatively impact, creating long-term value for our shareholders.
Currently, grocery stores are dealing with food deflation while the IPO market remains challenging. Despite these headwinds, Albertsons continues to increase EBITDA, providing substantial free cash flow to pay down debt and invest in the business.
Second, and sometimes forgotten, are the significant real estate holdings of the company. Close to half of the chain's 2,300 stores are either owned or under long-term ground leases, with concentrations in desirable markets, such as Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Washington, D.C. In fact, the recently updated S-1 noted an estimated value of $12.1 billion for its real estate holdings.
We believe that over a medium-term horizon, our investment in Albertsons will provide Kimco with significant capital to reinvest in our recurring business activities and create long-term shareholder value. As a reminder, we are just shy of 2 years into the merger of Albertsons and Safeway, and the company continues to reap the benefits of scale through execution on the planned synergies.
The S-1 remains current and we continue to monitor the markets with our partners. To be clear, we remain focused on our core business, and we'll continue to fund capital requirements with free cash flow after dividends, opportunistic use of our ATM and disposition proceeds.
Our 2020 vision outlines our plan to create long-term shareholder value by focusing on our building blocks of growth, reducing leverage and maintaining a cost-efficient capital structure. The fundamentals of our open-air shopping center portfolio remains strong due to the favorable balance of supply and demand in the major metro markets.
As the performance on key metrics demonstrates, our operating platform continues to deliver value to our shareholders. A wide range of open-air retailers, including our first Nike store, continues to expand and seek growth opportunities in high-quality real estate.
Supply has modestly increased recently due to bankruptcies and announced store closings, and we are monitoring closely the shadow supply coming from struggling department stores at enclosed malls. Overall, however, this environment provides the ability for us to position our real estate with best-in-class retailers that drive more traffic and sales.
While the Sports Authority liquidation drove a dip in anchor occupancy, we are pleased with the leasing momentum on those boxes. Seven of our 25 Sports Authority boxes are now fully committed. The deals include DICK'S Sporting Goods, a Land Rover Jaguar dealership, Orchard Supply Hardware, HomeGoods-Ulta combo, Burlington and H mart grocery.
Anchor leasing volume was the strongest this quarter year-to-date, with 19 anchored deals fully executed. Small shop leasing continues to progress. Even though pro rata occupancy remained flat this quarter, this is primarily due to the dispositions of a number of fully occupied centers that had limited upside remaining and the purchase of assets, with significant redevelopment potential that included considerable small shop vacancy, which we believe offers future upsides.
The strategic redevelopment and development pipeline, which we are calling our Signature Series, continues to mature and deliver results. As an update, we moved the first phase of our flagship Suburban Square redevelopment to the active pipeline, where we have an executed lease to expand Trader Joe's and construction underway to build a new parking facility to provide Kimco with further densification opportunities.
Separately, our Whole Foods development is now open and thriving in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania and has moved out of our development pipeline and into the operating portfolio. Our Signature Series continues to provide the company with significant internal growth opportunities, and we remain laser-focused on the execution. This quarter, we delivered $65 million of redevelopment projects, producing on incremental ROI of 10%.
I will now turn the call over to Ross, who will provide a deeper dive into the transaction activity this quarter."

The third quarter was a successful continuation of our strategy and transformation of the portfolio composition, resulting in a higher-quality asset base, with stronger demographics and tenancy. This includes our Kentlands Marketplace acquisition in Metro D.C., which offers significant value creation and redevelopment opportunities for our team. In just 2 short months of ownership, our plans to reposition the asset are underway, and the preliminary leasing interest has been very strong. We expect to begin seeking municipal input regarding our plans in the coming month.
Also, during the third quarter, we bought out a JV partner on a 4-property portfolio, with assets located in our core markets of Atlanta, Houston Washington, D.C. and Pittsburgh and acquiring additional JV asset, Gateway Center in Seattle, where we are working on a supermarket and pharmacy lease to reposition this well-located asset.
These acquisitions, along with the Canadian asset sales, helped further reduce our JV portfolio as we continue to simplify our ownership position while increasing the percentage of wholly owned net operating income coming from the overall portfolio. The wholly owned NOI is now 85% compared to being at a low of 60% level a few years earlier. In Q3 2015, we had 264 JV properties, and at Q3 2016, we have only 135 JV properties, nearly a 50% reduction in 1 year.
The acquisitions market continues to be extremely competitive for core assets as investors of all types chase hard assets in the United States. Pension fund advisers, REITs and private operators have all narrowed the definition of core, which has further limited the available supply of institutional quality assets. This has created bidding wars for the highest-quality assets in major MSAs, pushing down cap rates even further, notwithstanding the potential risk of interest rate hikes in the future.
While some may view the current real estate environment as expensive, on a relative basis, we continue to believe that compared to alternative investment options, our asset class remains a wonderful investment, with a healthy spread between cap rates and treasuries. Our focus remains on making investments in solid real estate with a strong business plan.
We also consider the dynamic that new shopping center development remains at all-time lows, together with the living and shopping tenants of millennials to recognize that the first ring outside the Irving core has become extremely desirable for investment, redevelopment and repurposing. This has created mix use opportunities offering a live, work, play environment, which we believe offer attractive investment opportunities. We are constantly evaluating these types of projects while remaining disciplined in our search for quality assets.
On the disposition side, the sale of our interest in 5 Canadian assets has reduced our ownership in Canada to 1 remaining shopping center and 2 land parcels. In just 12 months, the NOI coming from Canada has gotten from approximately $19 million in the third quarter of 2015 to roughly $1 million in the third quarter of 2016. We are thrilled with our progress.
In the United States, we sold 7 assets for $53.3 million, 49 million Kimco share. Execution on sales of noncore assets has become more challenging, and it is critical to perform due diligence to the buyer pool before selecting the buyer. In addition, we've seen the pricing between the core trophy and the secondary market assets, particularly nongrocery, widen from 9 to 12 months ago. Fortunately, we're at the tail end of the heavy lifting and expect to close approximately $100 million of asset sales in the fourth quarter. We will continue to review the portfolio and judiciously sell assets that do not fit within our long-term 2020 vision.
Now I would like to introduce Glenn to provide additional color and insight on our financial performance for the quarter."

Our execution during the third quarter takes another step forward towards achieving our 2020 vision. Our operating results were solid despite the short-term headwinds of The Sports Authority store closing.  We also successfully completed 3 strategic initiatives related to our Canadian debt repayment, U.S. debt repayment and the merger of our TRS into the REIT.
Headline FFO per share, which represents the official NAREIT definition, was $0.18 per diluted share for the third quarter. Included in the headline result is $45.7 million of early extinguishment of debt charges in connection with the prepayment of $350 million Canadian-denominated bonds with a weighted average interest rate of 4.77%, the prepayment of our 5.7% $291 million U.S. bond and the prepayment of $137 million of 6.32% mortgage debt encumbering 10 properties.
Also included in the headline result is a noncash FFO charge of $36.2 million associated with a deferred tax valuation allowance in connection with the TRS REIT merger. The onetime charges associated with the prepayments in the TRS REIT merger totaled $0.20 per share. These initiatives will enhance our future profitability and our tax efficiencies.
FFO as adjusted or recurring FFO, which excludes transactional income and expenses and nonoperating impairments, was $0.38 per diluted share for the third quarter, up 5.6% from $0.36 per diluted share last year. These solid results include the diluted impact of further transforming and simplifying the business over the past year with the sale of over $1 billion of U.S. assets and another $1.1 billion of assets in Canada and Mexico.
The proceeds raised from these efforts were used to acquire $800 million of high-quality, wholly owned U.S. assets in our key markets from our joint venture partners and third parties. The net effect of this activity reduced net operating income, including our pro rata share from the joint ventures, by $23.5 million. This was largely offset by a reduction in financing costs of $18.2 million related to lower debt levels of $1 billion, lower interest rates on debt refinancings and the redemption of our $175 million, 6.9% preferred stock last year. Recurring tax savings from the TRS REIT merger were an additional contributor.
Turning to our operating metrics. U.S. occupancy stands at 95.1%, down 90 basis points from last quarter and 50 basis points from a year ago. The Sports Authority store closures account for 85 basis points of the decrease from last quarter. Positive net absorption of 35 basis points from a year ago mitigated the TSA impact. As Conor mentioned, our operating team is making great strides in releasing these boxes, with higher-quality tenants that will drive increased traffic to the centers.
Occupancy of our boxes over 10,000 square feet remain a healthy 97% in our small shop occupancy, this is 89.2% of 120 basis points from a year ago. Leasing spreads continue to be strong, with new leasing spreads up 26.6% and renewal on option spreads up 7.8% for combined spreads of 12.9%.
U.S. same-site NOI growth was 3.3% for the quarter, notwithstanding 110 basis point negative impact from The Sports Authority bankruptcy. Redevelopments contributed 60 basis points this quarter. For the 9 months, U.S. same-site NOI growth stands at 2.9%, including a negative 60 basis point impact from TSA. We have narrowed our U.S. same-site NOI guidance for the full year to a range of 2.7% to 3.3% from the previous range of 2.5% to 3.5%.
We remain focused on further strengthening our balance sheet metrics and debt maturity profile. Consolidated net debt to EBITDA as adjusted is 5.8x with a target of 5 to 5.5x. On a look-through basis, including pro rata joint venture debt and perpetual preferred stock, the look-through metric was 7.1x with a goal of 6.4 to 6.9x.
During the quarter, we issued a new $500 million 10-year unsecured bond and a coupon of 2.8%, the second-lowest 10-year coupon ever issued by a REIT. Over the last year, we have extended our consolidated weighted average debt maturity profile to 6.7 years from 4.3 years just a year ago.
We opportunistically utilized our ATM program to issue 4.8 million shares of common stock at a weighted average sale price of $30.59 per share, raising $146.7 million of proceeds. The proceeds, we used for accretive and value-creating acquisitions of the 4 property joint venture buyouts and the Kentlands project that Ross mentioned in his remarks. Year-to-date, we have issued 9.8 million shares of common stock, raising net proceeds of $285 million.
Let me spend a moment on guidance. Based on the solid results during the first 9 months, achieving $1.12 per diluted share for FFO as adjusted, we are narrowing our FFO as adjusted per share guidance range to $1.49 to $1.51 from the previous per share guidance range of $1.48 to $1.52. For the 9 months, we achieved NAREIT-defined FFO of $0.94 per diluted share. We previously stated that our 2016 NAREIT-defined FFO guidance included a partial Albertsons monetization in the fourth quarter.
As Conor mentioned, we're not anticipating a monetization of our Albertsons investment this year. As such, we revised our NAREIT-defined FFO guidance to a range of $1.30 to $1.32 with a midpoint of $1.31 from the previous range of $1.34 to $1.42 with a midpoint of $1.38. The reduction is solely attributable to not monetizing a portion of our Albertsons investment this year. We remain confident that we will be able to do so in accordance with our 2020 vision.
We are currently deeply into our property-by-property budget process, and we'll provide 2017 guidance on our next earnings call. Our initial 2017 NAREIT-defined guidance range will not include any transactional encumbered expense. As such, our NAREIT-defined FFO per share range and our FFO as adjusted per share range will be comparable at the start of the year and will only differ upon the execution of specifically identified transactional events. We remain focused on growing our recurring earnings and cash flows.
Lastly, we are pleased to announce that based on our 2016 performance and expectations for 2017, our Board of Directors has approved an increase in the common stock quarterly cash dividend to $0.27 per share from $0.255, an increase of 5.9% on an annualized basis. Our FFO as adjusted payout ratio remains conservative, among the lowest in the peer group.
And with that, we'd be happy to answer your questions."

But we feel really confident in the projects we've identified. We're also making big strides on announcing pre-leasing on all those projects. So I think when you look at the risk-reward, we still feel really strong about what they will deliver to our shareholders over the next 5 years. That said, going forward, we're going to be very careful on what we add to the pipeline. We want to be sure that it's something that checks all the boxes with our strategy and where we want to take the company and the portfolio. And we also want to be very careful in terms of how much more we add to the pipeline. You'll probably see maybe another development deal or 2, but maybe probably not much more than that over the 5 years. But you will see us ramp up redevelopment where we see the opportunity because we continue to believe that that's the best use of our capital risk-adjusted, and continue to think that there's more to come when you look at our shadow supply."

When we look sort of in our experience in the market today, the fully occupied stabilized assets are the ones where we're really seeing the shallower buyer pull, particularly without a grocery anchor. The grocery-anchored shopping center still sees a bit of a deeper bench of bidders. But by way of example, our Q3 dispositions average in the mid-7s on a cap rate range. Overall, for the year, blended, we're closer to a 7.  So that puts it in a little bit into context. But that being said we are fortunate that we're in the very latter stages of our disposition process. So not every property that we put into the market is transacted. If we don't like the pricing, then we haven't sold it, but we've been pretty successful so far this year and we think that we will be for the rest of the year. In regards to the second part of the question, I think that all buyer types, whether institutional or private, are chasing upside value add in some form or fashion. So it really is, regardless of the location, the flatter income streams without any foreseeable growth have been challenging to move. But certainly, I think the definitions of core, from a market perspective, continue to narrow to the major markets, and it's the secondary and the tertiary markets where the institutional investors are just really not focused at all, regardless of the quality of the assets within that market."

So the way we view the investment today is it is really upside when the monetization does happen. Yes, we did -- we have it as part of our capital plan through our 5-year period through our 2020 vision. But it's relatively modest amounts in any given year. So we have plenty of other levers to work through if the monetization wouldn't happen during 2017. We're very comfortable with our capital plan and our liquidity position, certainly, to deal with our redevelopments or developments and things that we're doing because the company generates between $125 million and $150 million of free cash flow after we pay our dividends."

Our share price has moved to -- with -- along with the interest rates environments, and we obviously can't control that. We did take advantage of the ATM when -- last quarter when we thought that it was prudent, and we used it accordingly and we'll continue to monitor that. But for us, when we look in the open market, we want to be extremely selective. A company of our size, we feel like we need right now to be extremely selective on third-party acquisitions, and you've seen us do that, and continue to finish off our disposition.
