With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's fourth quarter 2015 results. This podcast is supplemented by our 2015 fourth quarter earnings release issued today, January 26, and other information available on our Investor Relations website. This material contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current view of the competitive market and the overall environment. Future risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please see our SEC filings, including our most recent periodic reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, which are available on our Investor Relations website for a discussion of factors that may affect our forward-looking statements.
Tables reconciling non-GAAP measures accompany the script of this podcast in today's earnings release and are both available on our Investor Relations website.
The macroeconomic conditions faced by our industry in 2015 are well documented and largely understood. What's less understood is that we took action by reducing costs and continued to invest more in the business. Our full year revenue was in line with our previous guidance, and adjusted earnings per share results were above the midpoint of our guidance.
As mentioned in the press release, we also reiterated our 2016 sales guidance of negative 1% to 7% and earnings per share guidance of $10.80 to $13 which was first issued on November 12, 2015. At the end of this podcast, we will provide more color around our assumptions.
Now let's take a look at our performance. For the full year, company sales of $10 billion were flat with 2014. Net earnings decreased 4% to $769 million, and earnings per share increased 1% to $11.58. The year contained restructuring/nonoperating items that lowered reported earnings by $0.36 per share. The year 2014 contained charges that lowered reported earnings by $0.81 per share. To better understand our performance, the majority of the analysis and commentary for the remainder of this podcast excludes the effect of these items in 2015 and 2014 unless specifically noted.  Details regarding the items can be found in the earnings release posted on the Investor Relations' website and in the exhibits at the end of this podcast.
Excluding these items from 2015 and 2014, company operating earnings decreased 5% for the year while net earnings declined 8%. Adjusted earnings per share were $11.94 for the year, representing a 3% decline versus $12.26 in 2014. Earnings per share performance benefited from fewer shares outstanding as a result of 6.1 million shares repurchased during the year.
Now let's turn to the 2015 fourth quarter. Company sales in the fourth quarter declined 1%. Reported operating earnings decreased 6%, and reported net earnings decreased 2%. Reported earnings per share were $2.30, a 7% increase versus the 2014 quarter.
Overall, our quarterly results were above our guidance issued at our analyst meeting on November 12. As a reminder, our guidance does not include restructuring or nonoperating items. Excluding the items from 2015 and 2014, adjusted operating earnings decreased 11%, while net earnings decreased 19%.
Adjusted earnings per share were $2.49 for the quarter, representing a decline of 11% versus the 2014 fourth quarter. Results in 2015 benefited from a net $0.16 per share of non-repeating operating items in the fourth quarter, primarily related to the shift in timing of the implementation of SAP in Canada into 2016 and a onetime reduction in health care liabilities in the United States.
Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement. Adjusted gross margins were 40.5% compared to 42.5% in the 2014 fourth quarter due to lower price, unfavorable customer mix and lower gross profit margins from the Cromwell acquisition.
On an adjusted basis, company operating earnings for the quarter decreased 11%. The earnings decline was driven by the 1% sales decrease and lower gross profit margins. Adjusted operating expenses declined 3%, including $32 million in incremental growth-related spending. Adjusted company operating margins decreased 130 basis points to 11.4% for the quarter from 12.7% a year ago.
Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: First, sales by segment in the quarter, the month of December and January sales so far; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2016 guidance and other key items.
As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter decreased 1%. We had 64 selling days in the quarter, the same as the previous year. The 1% sales decline for the quarter consisted of a 2 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange, a 1 percentage point decline from price, a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products and a 1 percentage point decline from sales of Ebola-related safety products in 2014 that did not repeat, partially offset by a 4 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition.
Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 segments: The United States and Canada. Our remaining operations, located primarily in Europe, Asia and Latin America, are reported under a group titled Other Businesses, and also include results for the single-channel online model businesses in Japan, the United States and Europe.
Sales in the United States, which accounted for 74% of total company revenue in the quarter, decreased 3%. The 3% sales decline for the quarter was driven by 2 percentage points decline from volume, a 1 percentage point decline from price, a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products and a 1 percentage point decline from sales of Ebola-related safety products in 2014 that did not repeat, partially offset by a 1 percentage point from higher intercompany sales to Zoro and a 1 percentage point benefit from the timing of the Christmas holiday.
Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Retail was up in the mix in the digits. Government was up in the low single digits. Light Manufacturing was flat. Contractor and Commercial were down in the mid-single-digits. Heavy Manufacturing was down in the high single digits. Reseller was down in the low double digits, and Natural Resources was down in the low 20s.
Weak oil prices continued to affect our sales to Natural Resources and Heavy Manufacturing customers. Based on our analysis of relevant SIC codes, oil represented about a 150-basis-point drag on U.S. sales in the quarter. This compares to a 110-basis-point drag for the year, indicating sequential deceleration.
Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian segment. Sales in Canada represented 8% of total company revenues in the quarter. For the quarter, sales in Canada decreased 27% in U.S. dollars, 14% in local currency. The 14% sales decrease consisted of a 17 percentage point decrease from volume and a 1 percentage point decrease from lower sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 4 percentage point contribution from price. Weakness in the Oil and Gas industries continued to affect sales to Canada's customers. All end markets, except Government and Forestry, were down versus the prior year.
From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down about 30% in the quarter, whereas sales in all other provinces, in aggregate, were down 4% versus the prior year.
Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations primarily in Europe, Asia and Latin America and currently represents about 18% of total company sales. Sales for this group increased to 41% in the 2015 fourth quarter versus the prior year. This performance consisted of 33 percentage points from the acquisition of Cromwell and 18 percentage points of growth from volume and price, partially offset by a 10 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales growth in the Other Businesses was primarily driven by MonotaRO in Japan and Zoro in the United States.
Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for October or November and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Now let's take a look at December. There were 22 selling days in December in both years. Total company sales were flat versus December 2014, and consisted of 4 percentage points from acquisitions and a 1 percentage point benefit from the favorable timing of the Christmas holiday, offset by a 2 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange, a 1 percentage point decline from volume, a 1 percentage point decline from price and a 1 percentage point decline from sales of Ebola-related safety products in 2014 that did not repeat.
In the United States, December sales decreased a 2%, driven by a 2 percentage point decline in volume, a 1 percentage point decline in price, a 1 percentage point decline from sales of seasonal products and a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of Ebola-related safety products that did not repeat, partially offset by 1 percentage point from higher intercompany sales to Zoro and a 2 percentage point benefit from the timing of the Christmas holiday.
December customer end market performance in the United States was as follows: Retail was up in the mid-single-digits; Light Manufacturing and Government were up in the low single digits; Contractor, Commercial and Heavy Manufacturing were down in the mid-single-digits; Reseller was down in the high single digits; and Natural Resources was down in the low 20s.
Daily sales in Canada for December decreased 30% in U.S. dollars, and were down 17% in local currency. This 17% sales decrease consisted of an 18% percentage point decline from volume and a 1 percentage point decrease from sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 2 percentage point benefit from price. Similar to the quarter, all end markets, except Government and Forestry, were down versus prior year. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down about 30% in December, whereas sales in all the other provinces in aggregate were down 8% versus the prior year.
Daily sales for the Other Businesses increased 41% in December, consisting of 30 percentage points from acquisitions and 18 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by a 7 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. The organic growth was driven by Zoro in the United States and MonotaRO in Japan.
Let's move on to January. Please note that we benefited from New Year's Day falling on a Friday in 2016. In 2015, the holiday was on a Thursday, resulting in light sales on Friday, January 2. Daily sales growth in the month of January to date is trending better than December's flat sales performance, even after adjusting for the holiday benefit. Late January  sales may be affected by the winter storm in the northeast. There were 35 branches closed on Friday, January 22, and at this point, we do not have a clear picture as to the magnitude of lost sales.
Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman."

As a reminder, results in this discussion exclude the restructuring, nonoperating items detailed in the earnings press release, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website and in the exhibits at the end of this podcast.
Adjusted operating earnings in the United States decreased 9% versus the 2014 fourth quarter, driven by lower sales and a lower gross profit. Gross profit margins in the quarter decreased 160 basis points as a result of price deflation exceeding cost deflation and better relative performance with lower-margin customers.
Operating expenses declined due to lower employee benefits, partially offset by higher contract service costs and included $22 million of growth in infrastructure spending. On an adjusted basis, the U.S. operating margin decreased 90 basis points to 16.1% for the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2014.
Let's move on to our business in Canada. Adjusted operating earnings declined 60% versus the 2014 fourth quarter. This decrease was driven by a lower sales and a lower gross profit. The 2015 fourth quarter contained favorable inventory adjustments versus the 2014 fourth quarter. The gross profit margin in Canada improved 150 basis points versus the prior year. In the absence of those inventory adjustments, the gross profit margin would have been down 200 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses in Canada were down 15%.
On an adjusted basis, the Other Businesses had $10 million in operating earnings in the 2015 fourth quarter versus breakeven in the 2014 period. The increase in adjusted earnings was driven by better performance from MonotaRO and Zoro. In addition, Cromwell's results were in line with our expectations.
Other income and expense was a net expense of $17 million in the 2015 fourth quarter versus net expense of $5 million in the 2014 fourth quarter. This increase was primarily attributable to higher interest expense and losses from the company's investment in clean energy that began in 2015.
The effective tax rate in 2015 was 36.5% for the quarter and 37.2% for the full year. Excluding the effect of restructuring, nonoperating items, the adjusted tax rate was 39.2% for the quarter and 37.6% for 2015 compared to 38.2% in the 2014 quarter and year. The increase in the adjusted quarterly rate was primarily due to a higher proportion of earnings in the United States versus geographies with lower tax rates. The company's clean energy investment generated $0.09 per share of earnings for the year.
The company is currently projecting a tax rate of 35.2% to 36.2% in 2016 compared to the prior projection of 36.3% to 37.3% on November 12, 2015. The lower tax rate is driven by the incremental benefit from the company's second clean energy investment which closed in early January of this year.
Lastly, let's take a look at our cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $256 million versus $300 million in the 2014 quarter. We used the cash generated during the quarter, along with proceeds from debt, to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Gross capital expenditures for the quarter were $121 million versus $147 million in 2014. We paid dividends of $75 million in the quarter, reflecting the 8% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2015. In addition, we bought back 1 million shares of stock for $224 million and ended the quarter with 9.5 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Share repurchases made throughout the year contributed $0.21 per share to earnings per share in the fourth quarter. In total, we returned $299 million to shareholders in the quarter.
As we noted earlier, we reiterated our 2016 sales and EPS guidance. The following information is provided to help you better model our 2016 financials. Keep in mind, this reflects adjusted results in 2015 as a basis for comparison. 
Sales: Please note that the first quarter contains an extra sales day versus 2015. The trend reverses in the fourth quarter when we have 1 less selling day versus 2015. Also, please be aware that the first quarter is our most difficult comparison of 2016, as the 2015 third quarter saw the strongest sales growth from the U.S. segment. Please see exhibit 6.
Canada. While the macroeconomic conditions are well understood, we want to stress that operating results in Canada will remain under pressure for much of 2016. The installation of SAP is the business's top priority, and there will be a stabilization period following. In addition, certain expenses tied to the installation of SAP that were planned to be spent in the fourth quarter of 2015, shifted to the first quarter of 2016. As a result, the first quarter will contain an additional expense of about $10 million.
Supplier funding. We have modified how we account for supplier funding of our annual trade shows which take place in the first quarter. Previously, both gross profit and operating expenses, as a percent of sales, were inflated in the first quarter relative to other quarters by about 100 basis points. Starting in 2016, a portion of the funds received from suppliers will now be accounted for as a reduction in the trade show expenses, rather than a reduction of cost of goods sold. In addition, the portion of the funds applied to cost of goods sold will now be able to spread between the first and second quarters.
While this change has no impact on the full year, operating expenses will now be inflated by about 55 basis points in the first quarter relative to the other quarters. Gross profit will now be inflated by about 35 basis points in the first quarter and 20 basis points in the second quarter. There is no impact to operating margin.
Gross profit margins. We expect gross profit margins to be down 50 to 70 basis points for full year 2016 versus the full year 2015, primarily driven by the ongoing foreign exchange deterioration in Canada. For the first quarter, we forecast gross profit margins to be -- went down 175 to 225 basis points versus the 2015 first quarter, reflecting the change in accounting for supplier funding, which has an effect of about 70 basis points, and the expectation of lower performance in Canada.
Operating margin. For the full year, we now expect operating margin will be down 40 to 150 basis points, driven by 2015 results that were better than our November guidance, including the $0.16 per share of non-repeating operating benefits and lower 2016 expectations for Canada.
For the first quarter, we forecast the operating margins will be down 175 to 225 basis points versus the 2015 first quarter due primarily to lower gross profit margins, as mentioned above. The supplier funding changes have no effect on operating margins.
Branch closures. As previously announced, we will continue to adjust the U.S. branch network in 2016, and plan to close 55 branches this year. Total restructuring costs are in line with the guidance given at the analyst meeting on November 12, 2015.
Clean energy investment. Our first investment in clean energy resulted in a benefit of $0.09 per share for the full year 2015. Earlier this month, we entered into a second clean energy investment. As a result, we now expect a $0.15 to $0.20 per share of benefit to EPS in 2016 from the 2 investments. We expect the new investment will lower our effective tax rate by 250 to 300 basis points, as reflected in our updated tax rate guidance.
Earnings per share. As compared to our November guidance, we expect to receive a $0.15 per share benefit in 2016 from a lower share count and the tax benefit from the second clean energy investment. However, that will essentially offset the timing of SAP spending and the lower performance in Canada.

This material contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current view of the competitive market and the overall environment.

The macroeconomic conditions faced by our industry in 2015 are well documented and largely understood. What's less understood is that we took action by reducing costs and continued to invest more in the business. Our full year revenue was in line with our previous guidance. And adjusted earnings per share results were above the midpoint of our guidance.

Now let's take a look at our performance. For the full year, company sales of $10 billion were flat with 2014. Net earnings decreased 4% to $769 million, and earnings per share increased 1% to $11.58. The year contained restructuring/nonoperating items that lowered reported earnings by $0.36 per share. The year 2014 contained charges that lowered reported earnings by $0.81 per share. To better understand our performance, the majority of the analysis and commentary for the remainder of this podcast excludes the effect of these items in 2015 and 2014 unless specifically noted.  Details regarding the items can be found in the earnings release posted on the Investor Relations' website and in the exhibits at the end of this podcast.
Excluding these items from 2015 and 2014, company operating earnings decreased 5% for the year while net earnings declined 8%. Adjusted earnings per share were $11.94 for the year, representing a 3% decline versus $12.26 in 2014. Earnings per share performance benefited from fewer shares outstanding as a result of 6.1 million shares repurchased during the year.
Now let's turn to the 2015 fourth quarter. Company sales in the fourth quarter declined 1%. Reported operating earnings decreased 6%, and reported net earnings decreased 2%. Reported earnings per share were $2.30, a 7% increase versus the 2014 quarter.
Overall, our quarterly results were above our guidance issued at our analyst meeting on November 12. As a reminder, our guidance does not include restructuring or nonoperating items. Excluding the items from 2015 and 2014, adjusted operating earnings decreased 11%, while net earnings decreased 19%.
Adjusted earnings per share were $2.49 for the quarter, representing a decline of 11% versus the 2014 fourth quarter. Results in 2015 benefited from a net $0.16 per share of nonrepeating operating items in the fourth quarter, primarily related to the shift in timing of the implementation of SAP in Canada into 2016 and a onetime reduction in health care liabilities in the United States.
Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement. Adjusted gross margins were 40.5% compared to 42.5% in the 2014 fourth quarter due to lower price, unfavorable customer mix and lower gross profit margins from the Cromwell acquisition.
On an adjusted basis, company operating earnings for the quarter decreased 11%. The earnings decline was driven by the 1% sales decrease and lower gross profit margins. Adjusted operating expenses declined 3%, including $32 million in incremental growth-related spending. Adjusted company operating margins decreased 130 basis points to 11.4% for the quarter from 12.7% a year ago.
Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter, the month of December and January sales so far; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2016 guidance and other key items.
As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter decreased 1%. We had 64 selling days in the quarter, the same as the previous year. The 1% sales decline for the quarter consisted of a 2 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange, a 1 percent point decline from price, a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products and a 1 percentage point decline from sales of Ebola-related safety products in 2014 that did not repeat, partially offset by a 4 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition.
Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 segments: the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations located primarily in Europe, Asia and Latin America, are reported under a group titled Other Businesses, and also include results for the single-channel online model businesses in Japan, the United States and Europe.
Sales in the United States, which accounted for 74% of total company revenue in the quarter decreased 3%. The 3% sales decline for the quarter was driven by 2 percentage points decline from volume, a 1 percentage point decline from price, a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products and a 1 percentage point decline from sales of Ebola-related safety products in 2014 that did not repeat, partially offset by a 1 percentage point from higher intercompany sales to Zoro and a 1 percentage point benefit from the timing of the Christmas holiday.
Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Retail was up in the mid-single digits. Government was up in the low single digits. Light Manufacturing was flat. Contractor and Commercial were down in the mid-single digits. Heavy Manufacturing was down in the high single digits. Reseller was down in the low double digits, and Natural Resources was down in the low 20s.
Weak oil prices continued to affect our sales to Natural Resources and Heavy Manufacturing customers. Based on our analysis of relevant SIC codes, oil represented about a 150 basis point drag on U.S. sales in the quarter. This compares to a 110 basis point drag for the year, indicating sequential deceleration.
Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian segment. Sales in Canada represented 8% of total company revenues in the quarter. For the quarter, sales in Canada decreased 27% in U.S. dollars, 14% in local currency. The 14% sales decrease consisted of a 17 percentage point decrease from volume and a 1 percentage point decrease from lower sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 4 percentage point contribution from price. Weakness in the Oil and Gas industries continued to affect sales to Canada's customers. All end markets, except Government and Forestry, were down versus the prior year. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down about 30% in the quarter, whereas sales in all other provinces, in aggregate, were down 4% versus the prior year.
Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations primarily in Europe, Asia and Latin America and currently represents about 18% of total company sales. Sales for this group increased to 41% in the 2015 fourth quarter versus the prior year. This performance consisted of 33 percentage points from the acquisition of Cromwell and 18 percentage points of growth from volume and price, partially offset by a 10 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales growth in the Other Businesses was primarily driven by MonotaRO in Japan and Zoro in the United States.
Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for October and November and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Now let's take a look at December. There were 22 selling days in December in both years. Total company sales were flat versus December 2014 and consisted of 4 percentage points from acquisitions and a 1 percentage point benefit from the favorable timing of the Christmas holiday, offset by a 2 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange, a 1 percentage point decline from volume, a 1 percentage point decline from price and a 1 percentage point decline from sales of Ebola-related safety products in 2014 that did not repeat.
In the United States, December sales decreased 2%, driven by a 2 percentage point decline in volume, a 1 percentage point decline in price, a 1 percentage point decline from sales of seasonal products and a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of Ebola-related safety products that did not repeat, partially offset by 1 percentage point from higher intercompany sales to Zoro and a 2 percentage point benefit from the timing of the Christmas holiday.
December customer end market performance in the United States was as follows: Retail was up in the mid-single digits; Light Manufacturing and Government were up in the low single digits; Contractor, Commercial and Heavy Manufacturing were down in the mid-single digits; Reseller was down in the high single digits; and Natural Resources was down in the low 20s.
Daily sales in Canada for December decreased 30% in U.S. dollars and were down 17% in local currency. The 17% sales decrease consisted of an 18 percentage point decline from volume and a 1 percentage point decrease from sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 2 percentage point benefit from price. Similar to the quarter, all end markets, except Government and Forestry, were down versus prior year. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down about 30% in December, whereas sales in all the other provinces in aggregate were down 8% versus the prior year.
Daily sales for the Other Businesses increased 41% in December, consisting of 30 percentage points from acquisitions and 18 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by a 7 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. The organic growth was driven by Zoro in the United States and MonotaRO in Japan.
Let's move on to January. Please note that we benefited from New Year's Day falling on a Friday in 2016. In 2015, the holiday was on a Thursday, resulting in light sales on Friday, January 2. Daily sales growth in the month of January to date is trending better than December's flat sales performance, even after adjusting for the holiday benefit. Late January sales may be affected by the winter storm in the northeast. There were 35 branches closed on Friday, January 22. And at this point, we do not have a clear picture as to the magnitude of lost sales.
Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman."

Adjusted operating earnings in the United States decreased 9% versus the 2014 fourth quarter, driven by lower sales and a lower gross profit. Gross profit margins in the quarter decreased 160 basis points as a result of price deflation exceeding cost deflation and better relative performance with lower-margin customers.
Operating expenses declined due to lower employee benefits, partially offset by higher contract service costs and included $22 million of growth in infrastructure spending. On an adjusted basis, the U.S. operating margin decreased 90 basis points to 16.1% for the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2014.
Let's move on to our business in Canada. Adjusted operating earnings declined 60% versus the 2014 fourth quarter. This decrease was driven by lower sales and a lower gross profit. The 2015 fourth quarter contained favorable inventory adjustments versus the 2014 fourth quarter. The gross profit margin in Canada improved 150 basis points versus the prior year. In the absence of those inventory adjustments, the gross profit margin would have been down 200 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses in Canada were down 15%.
On an adjusted basis, the Other Businesses had $10 million in operating earnings in the 2015 fourth quarter versus breakeven in the 2014 period. The increase in adjusted earnings was driven by better performance from MonotaRO and Zoro. In addition, Cromwell's results were in line with our expectations.
Other income and expense was a net expense of $17 million in the 2015 fourth quarter versus net expense of $5 million in the 2014 fourth quarter. This increase was primarily attributable to higher interest expense and losses from the company's investment in clean energy that began in 2015.
The effective tax rate in 2015 was 36.5% for the quarter and 37.2% for the full year. Excluding the effect of restructuring, nonoperating items, the adjusted tax rate was 39.2% for the quarter and 37.6% for 2015 compared to 38.2% in the 2014 quarter and year. The increase in the adjusted quarterly rate was primarily due to a higher proportion of earnings in the United States versus geographies with lower tax rates. The company's clean energy investment generated $0.09 per share of earnings for the year.
The company is currently projecting a tax rate of 35.2% to 36.2% in 2016 compared to the prior projection of 36.3% to 37.3% on November 12, 2015. The lower tax rate is driven by the incremental benefit from the company's second clean energy investment which closed in early January of this year.
Lastly, let's take a look at our cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $256 million versus $300 million in the 2014 quarter. We used the cash generated during the quarter, along with proceeds from debt, to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Gross capital expenditures for the quarter were $121 million versus $147 million in 2014. We paid dividends of $75 million in the quarter, reflecting the 8% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2015. In addition, we bought back 1 million shares of stock for $224 million and ended the quarter with 9.5 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Share repurchases made throughout the year contributed $0.21 per share to earnings per share in the fourth quarter. In total, we returned $299 million to shareholders in the quarter.
As we noted earlier, we reiterated our 2016 sales and EPS guidance. The following information is provided to help you better model our 2016 financials. Keep in mind, this reflects adjusted results in 2015 as a basis for comparison. 
Sales. Please note that the first quarter contains an extra sales day versus 2015. The trend reverses in the fourth quarter when we have 1 less selling day versus 2015. Also, please be aware that the first quarter is our most difficult comparison of 2016 as the 2015 first quarter saw the strongest sales growth from the U.S. segment. Please see Exhibit 6.
Canada. While the macroeconomic conditions are well understood, we want to stress that operating results in Canada will remain under pressure for much of 2016. The installation of SAP is the business' top priority, and there will be a stabilization period following. In addition, certain expenses tied to the installation of SAP, that were planned to be spent in the fourth quarter of 2015, shifted to the first quarter of 2016. As a result, the first quarter will contain an additional expense of about $10 million.
Supplier funding. We have modified how we account for supplier funding of our annual trade shows which take place in the first quarter. Previously, both gross profit and operating expenses, as a percent of sales, were inflated in the first quarter relative to other quarters by about 100 basis points. Starting in 2016, a portion of the funds received from suppliers will now be accounted for as a reduction in the trade show expenses rather than a reduction of cost of goods sold. In addition, the portion of the funds applied to cost of goods sold will now be able to spread between the first and second quarters.
While this change has no impact on the full year, operating expenses will now be inflated by about 55 basis points in the first quarter relative to the other quarters. Gross profit will now be inflated by about 35 basis points in the first quarter and 20 basis points in the second quarter. There is no impact to operating margin.
Gross profit margins. We expect gross profit margins to be down 50 to 70 basis points for full year 2016 versus the full year 2015, primarily driven by the ongoing foreign exchange deterioration in Canada. For the first quarter, we forecast gross profit margins to be -- will be down 175 to 225 basis points versus the 2015 first quarter, reflecting the change in accounting for supplier funding, which has an effect of about 70 basis points and the expectation of lower performance in Canada.
Operating margin. For the full year, we now expect operating margin will be down 40 to 150 basis points, driven by 2015 results that were better than our November guidance, including the $0.16 per share of nonrepeating operating benefits and lower 2016 expectations for Canada.
For the first quarter, we forecast operating margins will be down 175 to 225 basis points versus the 2015 first quarter due primarily to lower gross profit margins as mentioned above. The supplier funding changes have no effect on operating margins.
Branch closures. As previously announced, we will continue to adjust the U.S. branch network in 2016 and plan to close 55 branches this year. Total restructuring costs are in line with the guidance given at the analyst meeting on November 12, 2015.
Clean energy investment. Our first investment in clean energy resulted in a benefit of $0.09 per share for the full year 2015. Earlier this month, we entered into a second clean energy investment. As a result, we now expect a $0.15 to $0.20 per share of benefit to EPS in 2016 from the 2 investments. We expect the new investment will lower our effective tax rate by 250 to 300 basis points as reflected in our updated tax rate guidance.
Earnings per share. As compared to our November guidance, we expect to receive a $0.15 per share benefit in 2016 from a lower share count and the tax benefit from the second clean energy investment. However, that will essentially offset the timing of SAP spending and lower performance in Canada.

With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. 
The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's fourth quarter 2015 results. This podcast is supplemented by our 2015 fourth quarter earnings release issued today, January 26, and other information available on our Investor Relations website. This material contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current view of the competitive market and the overall environment. Future risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please see our SEC filings, including our most recent periodic reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, which are available on our Investor Relations website for a discussion of factors that may affect our forward-looking statements. Tables reconciling non-GAAP measures accompany the script of this podcast in today's earnings release and are both available on our Investor Relations website.
The macroeconomic conditions faced by our industry in 2015 are well documented and largely understood. What's less understood is that we took action by reducing costs and continued to invest more in the business. Our full year revenue was in line with our previous guidance. And adjusted earnings per share results were above the midpoint of our guidance.
As mentioned in the press release, we also reiterated our 2016 sales guidance of negative 1% to 7% and earnings per share guidance of $10.80 to $13 which was first issued on November 12, 2015. At the end of this podcast, we will provide more color around our assumptions.
Now let's take a look at our performance. For the full year, company sales of $10 billion were flat with 2014. Net earnings decreased 4% to $769 million, and earnings per share increased 1% to $11.58. The year contained restructuring/nonoperating items that lowered reported earnings by $0.36 per share. The year 2014 contained charges that lowered reported earnings by $0.81 per share. To better understand our performance, the majority of the analysis and commentary for the remainder of this podcast excludes the effect of these items in 2015 and 2014 unless specifically noted.  Details regarding the items can be found in the earnings release posted on the Investor Relations' website and in the exhibits at the end of this podcast.
Excluding these items from 2015 and 2014, company operating earnings decreased 5% for the year while net earnings declined 8%. Adjusted earnings per share were $11.94 for the year, representing a 3% decline versus $12.26 in 2014. Earnings per share performance benefited from fewer shares outstanding as a result of 6.1 million shares repurchased during the year.
Now let's turn to the 2015 fourth quarter. Company sales in the fourth quarter declined 1%. Reported operating earnings decreased 6%, and reported net earnings decreased 2%. Reported earnings per share were $2.30, a 7% increase versus the 2014 quarter.
Overall, our quarterly results were above our guidance issued at our analyst meeting on November 12. As a reminder, our guidance does not include restructuring or nonoperating items. Excluding the items from 2015 and 2014, adjusted operating earnings decreased 11%, while net earnings decreased 19%.
Adjusted earnings per share were $2.49 for the quarter, representing a decline of 11% versus the 2014 fourth quarter. Results in 2015 benefited from a net $0.16 per share of nonrepeating operating items in the fourth quarter, primarily related to the shift in timing of the implementation of SAP in Canada into 2016 and a onetime reduction in health care liabilities in the United States.
Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement. Adjusted gross margins were 40.5% compared to 42.5% in the 2014 fourth quarter due to lower price, unfavorable customer mix and lower gross profit margins from the Cromwell acquisition.
On an adjusted basis, company operating earnings for the quarter decreased 11%. The earnings decline was driven by the 1% sales decrease and lower gross profit margins. Adjusted operating expenses declined 3%, including $32 million in incremental growth-related spending. Adjusted company operating margins decreased 130 basis points to 11.4% for the quarter from 12.7% a year ago.
Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter, the month of December and January sales so far; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2016 guidance and other key items.
As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter decreased 1%. We had 64 selling days in the quarter, the same as the previous year. The 1% sales decline for the quarter consisted of a 2 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange, a 1 percent point decline from price, a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products and a 1 percentage point decline from sales of Ebola-related safety products in 2014 that did not repeat, partially offset by 4 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition.
Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 segments: the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations located primarily in Europe, Asia and Latin America, are reported under a group titled Other Businesses, and also include results for the single-channel online model businesses in Japan, the United States and Europe.
Sales in the United States, which accounted for 74% of total company revenue in the quarter decreased 3%. The 3% sales decline for the quarter was driven by 2 percentage point decline from volume, a 1 percentage point decline from price, a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products and a 1 percentage point decline from sales of Ebola-related safety products in 2014 that did not repeat, partially offset by a 1 percentage point from higher intercompany sales to Zoro and a 1 percentage point benefit from the timing of the Christmas holiday.
Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Retail was up in the mid-single digits. Government was up in the low single digits. Light Manufacturing was flat. Contractor and Commercial were down in the mid-single digits. Heavy Manufacturing was down in the high single digits. Reseller was down in the low double digits, and Natural Resources was down in the low 20s.
Weak oil prices continued to affect our sales to Natural Resources and Heavy Manufacturing customers. Based on our analysis of relevant SIC codes, oil represented about a 150 basis point drag on U.S. sales in the quarter. This compares to a 110 basis point drag for the year, indicating sequential deceleration.
Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian segment. Sales in Canada represented 8% of total company revenues in the quarter. For the quarter, sales in Canada decreased 27% in U.S. dollars, 14% in local currency. The 14% sales decrease consisted of a 17 percentage point decrease from volume and a 1 percentage point decrease from lower sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 4 percentage point contribution from price. Weakness in the Oil and Gas industries continued to affect sales to Canada's customers. All end markets, except Government and Forestry, were down versus the prior year. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down about 30% in the quarter, whereas sales in all other provinces, in aggregate, were down 4% versus the prior year.
Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. Again, this group includes our operations primarily in Europe, Asia and Latin America and currently represents about 18% of total company sales. Sales for this group increased 41% in the 2015 fourth quarter versus the prior year. This performance consisted of 33 percentage points from the acquisition of Cromwell and 18 percentage points of growth from volume and price, partially offset by a 10 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales growth in the Other Businesses was primarily driven by MonotaRO in Japan and Zoro in the United States.
Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for October and November and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Now let's take a look at December. There were 22 selling days in December in both years. Total company sales were flat versus December 2014 and consisted of 4 percentage points from acquisitions and a 1 percentage point benefit from the favorable timing of the Christmas holiday, offset by a 2 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange, a 1 percentage point decline from volume, a 1 percentage point decline from price and a 1 percentage point decline from sales of Ebola-related safety products in 2014 that did not repeat.
In the United States, December sales decreased 2%, driven by a 2 percentage point decline in volume, a 1 percentage point decline in price, a 1 percentage point decline from sales of seasonal products and a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of Ebola-related safety products that did not repeat, partially offset by 1 percentage point from higher intercompany sales to Zoro and a 2 percentage point benefit from the timing of the Christmas holiday.
December customer end market performance in the United States was as follows: Retail was up in the mid-single digits; Light Manufacturing and Government were up in the low single digits; Contractor, Commercial and Heavy Manufacturing were down in the mid-single digits; Reseller was down in the high single digits; and Natural Resources was down in the low 20s.
Daily sales in Canada for December decreased 30% in U.S. dollars and were down 17% in local currency. The 17% sales decrease consisted of an 18 percentage point decline from volume and a 1 percentage point decrease from sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 2 percentage point benefit from price. Similar to the quarter, all end markets, except Government and Forestry, were down versus prior year. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down about 30% in December, whereas sales in all other provinces in aggregate were down 8% versus the prior year.
Daily sales for the Other Businesses increased 41% in December, consisting of 30 percentage points from acquisitions and 18 percentage points from volume and price, partially offset by a 7 percentage point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. The organic growth was driven by Zoro in the United States and MonotaRO in Japan.
Let's move on to January. Please note that we benefited from New Year's Day falling on a Friday in 2016. In 2015, the holiday was on a Thursday, resulting in light sales on Friday, January 2. Daily sales growth in the month of January to date is trending better than December's flat sales performance, even after adjusting for the holiday benefit. Late January sales may be affected by the winter storm in the northeast. There were 35 branches closed on Friday, January 22. And at this point, we do not have a clear picture as to the magnitude of lost sales.
Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman."

As a reminder, results in this discussion exclude the restructuring, nonoperating items detailed in the earnings press release, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website and in the exhibits at the end of this podcast.
Adjusted operating earnings in the United States decreased 9% versus the 2014 fourth quarter, driven by lower sales and a lower gross profit. Gross profit margins in the quarter decreased 160 basis points as a result of price deflation exceeding cost deflation and better relative performance with lower-margin customers.
Operating expenses declined due to lower employee benefits, partially offset by higher contract service costs and included $22 million of growth in infrastructure spending. On an adjusted basis, the U.S. operating margin decreased 90 basis points to 16.1% for the quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2014.
Let's move on to our business in Canada. Adjusted operating earnings declined 60% versus the 2014 fourth quarter. This decrease was driven by lower sales and a lower gross profit. The 2015 fourth quarter contained favorable inventory adjustments versus the 2014 fourth quarter. The gross profit margin in Canada improved 150 basis points versus the prior year. In the absence of those inventory adjustments, the gross profit margin would have been down 200 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted operating expenses in Canada were down 15%.
On an adjusted basis, the Other Businesses had $10 million in operating earnings in the 2015 fourth quarter versus breakeven in the 2014 period. The increase in adjusted earnings was driven by better performance from MonotaRO and Zoro. In addition, Cromwell's results were in line with our expectations.
Other income and expense was a net expense of $17 million in the 2015 fourth quarter versus net expense of $5 million in the 2014 fourth quarter. This increase was primarily attributable to higher interest expense and losses from the company's investment in clean energy that began in 2015.
The effective tax rate in 2015 was 36.5% for the quarter and 37.2% for the full year. Excluding the effect of restructuring, nonoperating items, the adjusted tax rate was 39.2% for the quarter and 37.6% for 2015 compared to 38.2% in the 2014 quarter and year. The increase in the adjusted quarterly rate was primarily due to a higher proportion of earnings in the United States versus geographies with lower tax rates. The company's clean energy investment generated $0.09 per share of earnings for the year.
The company is currently projecting a tax rate of 35.2% to 36.2% in 2016 compared to the prior projection of 36.3% to 37.3% on November 12, 2015. The lower tax rate is driven by the incremental benefit from the company's second clean energy investment which closed in early January of this year.
Lastly, let's take a look at our cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $256 million versus $300 million in the 2014 quarter. We used the cash generated during the quarter, along with proceeds from debt, to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Gross capital expenditures for the quarter were $121 million versus $147 million in 2014. We paid dividends of $75 million in the quarter, reflecting the 8% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2015. In addition, we bought back 1 million shares of stock for $224 million and ended the quarter with 9.5 million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Share repurchases made throughout the year contributed $0.21 per share to earnings per share in the fourth quarter. In total, we returned $299 million to shareholders in the quarter.
As we noted earlier, we reiterated our 2016 sales and EPS guidance. The following information is provided to help you better model our 2016 financials. Keep in mind, this reflects adjusted results in 2015 as a basis for comparison. 
Sales. Please note that the first quarter contains an extra sales day versus 2015. The trend reverses in the fourth quarter when we have 1 less selling day versus 2015. Also, please be aware that the first quarter is our most difficult comparison of 2016 as the 2015 first quarter saw the strongest sales growth from the U.S. segment. Please see Exhibit 6.
Canada. While the macroeconomic conditions are well understood, we want to stress that operating results in Canada will remain under pressure for much of 2016. The installation of SAP is the business' top priority, and there will be a stabilization period following. In addition, certain expenses tied to the installation of SAP that were planned to be spent in the fourth quarter of 2015, shifted to the first quarter of 2016. As a result, the first quarter will contain an additional expense of about $10 million.
Supplier funding. We have modified how we account for supplier funding of our annual trade shows which take place in the first quarter. Previously, both gross profit and operating expenses, as a percent of sales, were inflated in the first quarter relative to other quarters by about 100 basis points. Starting in 2016, a portion of the funds received from suppliers will now be accounted for as a reduction in the trade show expenses rather than a reduction of cost of goods sold. In addition, the portion of the funds applied to cost of goods sold will now be spread between the first and second quarters.
While this change has no impact on the full year, operating expenses will now be inflated by about 55 basis points in the first quarter relative to the other quarters. Gross profit will now be inflated by about 35 basis points in the first quarter and 20 basis points in the second quarter. There is no impact to operating margin.
Gross profit margins. We expect gross profit margins to be down 50 to 70 basis points for full year 2016 versus the full year 2015, primarily driven by the ongoing foreign exchange deterioration in Canada. For the first quarter, we forecast gross profit margins to be -- will be down 175 to 225 basis points versus the 2015 first quarter, reflecting the change in accounting for supplier funding, which has an effect of about 70 basis points and the expectation of lower performance in Canada.
Operating margin. For the full year, we now expect operating margin will be down 40 to 150 basis points, driven by 2015 results that were better than our November guidance, including the $0.16 per share of nonrepeating operating benefits and lower 2016 expectations for Canada.
For the first quarter, we forecast operating margins will be down 175 to 225 basis points versus the 2015 first quarter due primarily to lower gross profit margins as mentioned above. The supplier funding changes have no effect on operating margins.
Branch closures. As previously announced, we will continue to adjust the U.S. branch network in 2016 and plan to close 55 branches this year. Total restructuring costs are in line with the guidance given at the analyst meeting on November 12, 2015.
Clean energy investment. Our first investment in clean energy resulted in a benefit of $0.09 per share for the full year 2015. Earlier this month, we entered into a second clean energy investment. As a result, we now expect a $0.15 to $0.20 per share of benefit to EPS in 2016 from the 2 investments. We expect the new investment will lower our effective tax rate by 250 to 300 basis points as reflected in our updated tax rate guidance.
Earnings per share. As compared to our November guidance, we expect to receive a $0.15 per share benefit in 2016 from a lower share count and the tax benefit from the second clean energy investment. However, that will essentially offset the timing of SAP spending and lower performance in Canada.

The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's First Quarter 2016 results. This podcast is supplemented by our 2016 first quarter earnings release issued today, April 18th, and other information available on our Investor Relations website. This material contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current view of the competitive market and the overall environment. Future risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially.

Tables reconciling non-GAAP measures accompany the script of this podcast in today's earnings release, which are both available on our Investor Relations website.
Today, we reported our 2016 first quarter results. While we are currently experiencing economic headwinds and our short term results are affected, we continue to manage the business for the long term. Our investments in eCommerce, KeepStock and supply chain, including the New Jersey and Toronto distribution centers, will provide and support growth for years to come. We have also invested in tools and processes that will make us more productive, including a new CRM system and SAP in Canada and Mexico. Now let's cover the specifics for the quarter.
A stronger-than-expected January due to carryover spending from fourth quarter customer shutdowns and favorable holiday timing contributed to our sales performance. The difficult economic environment and headwind from last year sales of seasonal products and Ebola-related products were also considerations. Solid expense management and the timing of planned spending offset some of the gross margin pressure. 
In Canada, we completed the installation of SAP, which will drive better service and increased productivity over time. However, we saw a further slowdown in February and March due to the implementation, which also had an unfavorable impact on expenses. And our single channel online businesses of Zoro in the United States and MonotaRO in Japan posted continued strong performance. 
Now let's look at the quarter in detail. Company sales increased 3%. We had 64 selling days in the quarter, one more than the previous year. On a daily basis, sales increased 1%. Reported operating earnings declined 10% and net earnings were down 12%. Reported earnings per share of $2.98 were down 3% versus $3.07 in the previous year. 
The first quarter in both years contained the restructuring items as noted in the press release issued today, April 18th. Please refer to the adjusted results found in the press release. All results referenced in the remainder of this podcast are adjusted unless specifically noted.
Not let's walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail. Gross profit margins decreased 300 basis points versus the prior year to 41.8% driven by lower performance in the U.S. and Canada segments. Operating expenses for the company declined 4% driven by a restructuring benefits and the timing of planned spending. 
Company operating earnings declined 5% versus the 2015 quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by lower gross profit margins partially offset by lower operating expenses. Company operating margins were down 110 basis points versus the prior year to 13.4%. 
Net income was $199 million, down 6%. Earnings per share of $3.18 were up 3% from the 2015 first quarter. 
Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter in the month of March; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2016 guidance and other key items.
Before we begin our sales discussion, please note that some of our businesses have a different number of selling days due to local holidays. For consistency, we used the number of selling days in the United States as the basis for our calculation of the daily sales.
Company sales for the quarter increased 1% on a daily basis. The 1% sales growth included 4 percentage point from Cromwell, acquired on September 1, 2015, and a 1 percentage point reduction from foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales declined 2%, driven by a 3 percentage point reduction in price and a 1 percentage point reduction in lower sales of seasonal products partially offset by a 2 percentage point increase from higher volume. By month, daily sales were as follows: up 4% in January, up 1% in February and down 1% in March. 
Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 business segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations located primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America are reported under a grouping titled Other Businesses. Our Other Businesses also include results from our single channel online businesses in Japan, MonotaRO, the United States, Zoro, and Europe. 
Sales in the United States which accounted for 75% of total company revenue in the quarter were down 2% on a daily basis. The 2% decrease was driven by a 3 percentage point decline in price and a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products, partially offset by 1% from volume growth and a 1 percentage point contribution from increased sales to Zoro, the single channel online business in the United States.
Let's review sales performance by customer end market for the quarter in the United States. Government was up in the mid-single digits, Light Manufacturing and Retail were up in the low-single digits, Commercial was down in the low-single digits, Contractor and Heavy Manufacturing were down in the mid-single digits, Reseller was down in the low double digits and Natural Resources was down in the mid-teens.
Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 7% of total company revenues in the quarter. The business in Canada continues to face a challenging economy given the country's exposure to Oil and Gas. Results reported in U.S. dollars were further affected by the stronger U.S. dollar. Sales for our business in Canada declined 25% on a daily basis and 17% on a daily basis in local currency.  
The 17% decline consisted of 14 percentage points from lower volume and 6 percentage points from the SAP implementation, partially offset by 3 percentage points from price. The Canadian business installed SAP on February 1, 2016. As expected, the business experienced lower sales following implementation as team members became acclimated to the new system. 
All customer end markets were lower in the quarter. On a geographic basis, daily sales in the province of Alberta, which represents about 1/3 of the company's business in Canada, was down 26% in local currency. Local currency sales for all other provinces were down 10%.
Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. This group includes our operations in Europe, Asia and Latin America and represents about 18% of total company sales. Sales for this group increased 47% on a daily basis, consisting of 33 percentage points from Cromwell, acquired on September 1, 2015, and 17 percentage points of growth from volume and price, partially offset by a 3 percentage point decline from foreign exchange. Sales growth in the Other Businesses was driven by the strong performance from the single channel online businesses in the United States and Japan, which grew 34% on a daily basis.
Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for January and February and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Now let's take a look at March. There were 23 selling days in March of 2016, 1 more than in 2015. Company daily sales declined 1% versus March of 2015. Sales results in March included 4 percentage points from acquisitions and foreign exchange was essentially flat for the month. Excluding acquisitions, organic daily sales declined 5% driven by a 3 percentage point decline in price, a 1 percentage point reduction from the timing of the Easter holiday, a 1 percentage point reduction in lower sales of seasonal products, and a 1 percentage point reduction in lower sales of Ebola-related products, partially offset by a 1 percentage point contribution from volume.
In the United States, daily sales in March declined 5%. This decline was due to a 3 percentage point decline in price, a 1 percentage point reduction from the timing of the Easter holiday, a 1 percentage point reduction in lower sales of seasonal products, and  a 1 percentage point reduction in lower sales of Ebola-related products, partially offset by a 1 percentage point contribution from increased sales to Zoro. 
March customer end market performance in the United States was as follows: Government was up in the mid-single digits; Light Manufacturing was flat; Retail was down in the low-single digits; Commercial was down in the mid-single digits; Heavy Manufacturing and Contractor were down in the high-single digits; and Natural Resources and Reseller were down in the mid-teens. 
Daily sales in Canada for March were down 20% and down 18% [ph] in local currency. The 18% [ph] daily sales declined consisted of a 16 percentage point decline in volume, a 3 percentage point decline from the SAP implementation, and a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products, partially offset by 2 percentage point benefit from price. The volume decline was seen in all customer end markets. 
On a geographic basis, sales performance in Canada was driven by softness in the province of Alberta, which was down 24% in local currency in March. All other provinces were down about 18%.
Daily sales in March for our Other Businesses increased 41%. The daily sales growth consisted of 31 percentage points from Cromwell and 10 percentage points from volume and was primarily driven by Zoro U.S. and MonotaRO. 
Performance for the Other Businesses was driven by 28% daily sales growth for the single channel online businesses. Our businesses in Latin America and Fabory in Europe were affected by timing of Easter, where extended holidays are more common. 
Turning to April. Daily sales growth to date has benefited from the timing of the Easter holiday. We are expecting low single-digit sales growth for the full month. 
Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman."

Since we have already analyzed company operating performance, let's move right into results by reportable segment. As a reminder, all results in the podcast are adjusted to exclude restructuring unless specifically noted. 
Operating earnings in the United States declined 5% versus the 2015 first quarter, with operating margins down 90 basis points to 17.7% versus 18.6% in the prior year. Gross profit margins for the quarter declined 260 basis points driven by a greater sales to lower-margin customers and price deflation greater than COGS deflation. 
Approximately 80 basis points of the reduction was due to changes in the classification of certain funding received from vendors related to the annual trade show. 
Operating expenses in the U.S. segment decreased 7%, driven by lower payroll and benefits costs and timing of planned spending, and $10 million of supplier funding for the trade show.
Let's move on to our business in Canada, which had a loss of $9 million in the quarter versus $9 million in profit in the prior year. The decrease was driven by the sales decline, lower gross profit margins and unfavorable operating expense leverage. The gross profit margin in Canada was down 660 basis points, with about 1/3 of the decline due to not having a trade show this year in Canada and about 2/3 from product mix driven by unfavorable foreign exchange. 
Expenses were down 18% versus the prior year, but the business experienced negative expense leverage given the 24% decline in reported revenue. We believe our investments in Supply Chain and IT in Canada set the stage for improved performance for this business. 
Our Other Businesses generated $22 million in operating earnings for the 2016 quarter versus $12 million in 2015. This performance was primarily driven by strong results from Zoro in the United States and MonotaRO, along with incremental earnings from Cromwell acquired on September 1, 2015.
Operating margin for the Other Businesses in the quarter increased 100 basis points from 3.9% to 4.9% year-over-year. 
Below the operating line, other income and expense was a net expense of $20 million in the 2016 first quarter versus $4 million in the 2015 first quarter. The increase is due to interest expense from the $1 billion of debt the company issued in 2015 as well as expected losses from the company's investment in clean energy.
For the quarter, the effective tax rate in 2016 was 35.6% versus 38.4% in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the company's investments in clean energy. 
We are still projecting an effective tax rate of 35.2% to 36.2% in the full year 2016. 
Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $154 million in the 2016 first quarter versus $156 million in the 2015 first quarter. The company used the cash generated, along with short-term borrowings, to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. 
Capital expenditures were $52 million in the 2016 first quarter versus $99 million in the first quarter of 2015, reflecting a slower planned spend for 2016 and the timing of ongoing projects. 
We returned $245 million to shareholders through $73 million of dividends and $172 million to buy back 893,000 shares of stock. 
Now let's take a look at guidance. As mentioned in the press release, we narrowed our 2016 guidance range for sales and earnings per share. Our new guidance reflects increased gross profit pressure for the year and increased operating expense favorability, although not to the same extent as the first quarter. Let's look more closely at the underlying elements of our expectations versus adjusted results in 2015. 
We'll begin with sales. We narrowed our sales guidance range and maintained a midpoint of 3% reported growth. We now expect price to be a little worse, down 2%, and foreign exchange to be a little better, down 1%, both for the full year. Although price was down 3% in the first quarter, we expect price to improve slightly in the final 3 quarters. We normally issue a price increase in January, but we intend to increase prices on a selected group of items as the year progresses.
Moving on to gross profit margins. Given the inflationary environment, we are taking a cautious view on gross margins and are lowering our gross margin expectations by 80 basis points. So for the full year, we now expect gross profit margins to be down 130 to 150 basis points versus 2015.
For the 2016 second quarter, we are expecting gross profit margins to be down 130 to 150 basis points versus the 2015 second quarter. 
On operating expense, for the year we expect operating expense to sales to be flat to down 90 basis points. For the second quarter, we expect operating expense to sales to be down 40 to 60 basis points. 
Let's take a closer look at operating margin expectations. The gross profit and operating expense adjustments offset resulting in unchanged operating margin guidance from January. So for the full year, we expect 40 to 150 basis points of operating margin compression versus the prior year. For the 2016 second quarter, operating margins are forecasted to be down 70 to 110 basis points. 
On restructuring in the first quarter, we closed 5 branches in the United States and we expect to close 50 more in the remainder of the year. While negligible in the first quarter, we now anticipate gains on sales of restructuring related assets to be $5 million to $10 million pretax over the rest of the year. Unlike the $7 million gain on sale of the former Toronto distribution center due to relocation, the branch gains are an offset to restructuring cost and are not in our guidance. We wanted to share this detail as it drives reported results from the expenses to earnings per share and networking assets to cash flow.
Now on our nonoperating initiatives. We anticipate our next issuance of $400 million in long-term debt in the second quarter and as part of our planned $800 million in share repurchases for 2016. 
As communicated earlier this year, we entered into a second clean energy investment, which generates operating losses but is also eligible for tax credits. We expect about $0.15 per share benefit to earnings per share in 2016 from the 2 clean energy investments. Please see Exhibit 4 for more information. 
Finally, earnings per share. We narrowed our range for earnings per share. Similar to sales, we did not adjust the midpoint due to uncertainty about the economy in the first quarter expense favorability that will not repeat to the same extent.
Please mark your calendar for the following upcoming events. On April 27, we will host our annual meeting of shareholders. The script from that meeting will be available on our website following the event. We plan to report April sales information on May 13th. And on May 18, Jim Ryan, Ron Jadin and D.G. Macpherson will present at the Electrical Products Group meeting in Longboat Key, Florida. This event will also be webcast.

This material contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current view of the competitive market and the overall environment. Future risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially.

Today, we reported our 2016 first quarter results. While we are currently experiencing economic headwinds and our short-term results are affected, we continue to manage the business for the long term. Our investments in e-commerce, KeepStock and supply chain, including the New Jersey and Toronto distribution centers, will provide and support growth for years to come. We have also invested in tools and processes that will make us more productive, including a new CRM system and SAP in Canada and Mexico. 
Now let's cover the specifics for the quarter. A stronger-than-expected January due to carryover spending from fourth quarter customer shutdowns and favorable holiday timing contributed to our sales performance. The difficult economic environment and headwind from last year's sales of seasonal products and Ebola-related products were also considerations. Solid expense management and the timing of planned spending offset some of the gross margin pressure. 
In Canada, we completed the installation of SAP, which will drive better service and increased productivity over time. However, we saw a further slowdown in February and March due to the implementation, which also had an unfavorable impact on expenses. And our single channel online businesses of Zoro in the United States and MonotaRO in Japan posted continued strong performance. 
Now let's look at the quarter in detail. Company sales increased 3%. We have 64 selling days in the quarter, 1 more than the previous year. On a daily basis, sales increased 1%. Reported operating earnings declined 10%, and net earnings were down 12%. Reported earnings per share of $2.98 were down 3% versus $3.07 in the previous year. 
The first quarter in both years contained the restructuring items as noted in the press release issued today, April 18. Please refer to the adjusted results found in the press release. All results referenced in the remainder of this podcast are adjusted unless specifically noted.
Not let's walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail. Gross profit margins decreased 300 basis points versus the prior year to 41.8% driven by lower performance in the U.S. and Canada segments. Operating expenses for the company declined 4% driven by a restructuring benefits and the timing of planned spending. 
Company operating earnings declined 5% versus the 2015 quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by lower gross profit margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Company operating margins were down 110 basis points versus the prior year to 13.4%. Net income was $199 million, down 6%. Earnings per share of $3.18 were up 3% from the 2015 first quarter. 
Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of March; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2016 guidance and other key items.
Before we begin our sales discussion, please note that some of our businesses have a different number of selling days due to local holidays. For consistency, we used the number of selling days in the United States as the basis for our calculation of daily sales.
Company sales for the quarter increased 1% on a daily basis. The 1% sales growth included 4 percentage point from Cromwell, acquired on September 1, 2015, and a 1 percentage point reduction from foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales declined 2%, driven by a 3 percentage point reduction in price and a 1 percentage point reduction in lower sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 2 percentage point increase from higher volume. By month, daily sales were as follows: up 4% in January, up 1% in February and down 1% in March. 
Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 business segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations located primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America are reported under a grouping titled, Other Businesses. Our Other Businesses also include results from our single channel online businesses in Japan, MonotaRO, the United States, Zoro and Europe. 
Sales in the United States which accounted for 75% of total company revenue in the quarter were down 2% on a daily basis. The 2% decrease was driven by a 3 percentage point decline in price and a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products, partially offset by 1% from volume growth and a 1 percentage point contribution from increased sales to Zoro, the single channel online business in the United States.
Let's review sales performance by customer end market for the quarter in the United States: Government was up in the mid-single digits, Light Manufacturing and Retail were up in the low single digits, Commercial was down in the low single digits, Contractor and Heavy Manufacturing were down in the mid-single digits, Reseller was down in the low double digits and Natural Resources was down in the mid-teens.
Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 7% of total company revenues in the quarter. The business in Canada continues to face a challenging economy given the country's exposure to Oil and Gas. Results reported in U.S. dollars were further affected by the strong U.S. dollar. Sales for our business in Canada declined 25% on a daily basis and 17% on a daily basis in local currency. The 17% decline consisted of 14 percentage points from lower volume and 6 percentage points from the SAP implementation, partially offset by 3 percentage points from price. The Canadian business installed SAP on February 1, 2016. As expected, the business experienced lower sales following implementation as team members became acclimated to the new system. 
All customer end markets were lower in the quarter. On a geographic basis, daily sales in the province of Alberta, which represents about 1/3 of the company's business in Canada, was down 26% in local currency. Local currency sales for all other provinces were down 10%.

Reported operating earnings declined 10%, and net earnings were down 12%. Reported earnings per share of $2.98 were down 3% versus $3.07 in the previous year. 
The first quarter in both years contained the restructuring items as noted in the press release issued today, April 18. Please refer to the adjusted results found in the press release. All results referenced in the remainder of this podcast are adjusted unless specifically noted.
Not let's walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail. Gross profit margins decreased 300 basis points versus the prior year to 41.8% driven by lower performance in the U.S. and Canada segments. Operating expenses for the company declined 4%,  driven by a restructuring benefits and the timing of planned spending. 
Company operating earnings declined 5% versus the 2015 quarter. This decrease was primarily driven by lower gross profit margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Company operating margins were down 110 basis points versus the prior year to 13.4%. Net income was $199 million, down 6%. Earnings per share of $3.18 were up 3% from the 2015 first quarter. 
Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of March; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2016 guidance and other key items.
Before we begin our sales discussion, please note that some of our businesses have a different number of selling days due to local holidays. For consistency, we used the number of selling days in the United States as the basis for our calculation of daily sales.
Company sales for the quarter increased 1% on a daily basis. The 1% sales growth included 4 percentage point from Cromwell, acquired on September 1, 2015, and a 1 percentage point reduction from foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales declined 2%, driven by a 3 percentage point reduction in price and a 1 percentage point reduction in lower sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 2 percentage point increase from higher volume. By month, daily sales were as follows: up 4% in January, up 1% in February and down 1% in March. 
Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 business segments, the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations located primarily in Asia, Europe and Latin America are reported under a grouping titled, Other Businesses. Our Other Businesses also include results from our single channel online businesses in Japan, MonotaRO, the United States, Zoro and Europe. 
Sales in the United States, which accounted for 75% of total company revenue in the quarter, were down 2% on a daily basis. The 2% decrease was driven by a 3 percentage point decline in price and a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products, partially offset by 1% from volume growth and a 1 percentage point contribution from increased sales to Zoro, the single channel online business in the United States.
Let's review sales performance by customer end market for the quarter in the United States: Government was up in the mid-single digits, Light Manufacturing and Retail were up in the low single digits, Commercial was down in the low single digits, Contractor and Heavy Manufacturing were down in the mid-single digits, Reseller was down in the low double digits and Natural Resources was down in the mid-teens.
Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 7% of total company revenues in the quarter. The business in Canada continues to face a challenging economy given the country's exposure to Oil and Gas. Results reported in U.S. dollars were further affected by the strong U.S. dollar. Sales for our business in Canada declined 25% on a daily basis and 17% on a daily basis in local currency. The 17% decline consisted of 14 percentage points from lower volume and 6 percentage points from the SAP implementation, partially offset by 3 percentage points from price. The Canadian business installed SAP on February 1, 2016. As expected, the business experienced lower sales following implementation as team members became acclimated to the new system. 
All customer end markets were lower in the quarter. On a geographic basis, daily sales in the province of Alberta, which represents about 1/3 of the company's business in Canada, was down 26% in local currency. Local currency sales for all other provinces were down 10%.
Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses. This group includes our operations in Europe, Asia and Latin America and represents about 18% of total company sales. Sales for this group increased 47% on a daily basis, consisting of 33 percentage points from Cromwell, acquired on September 1, 2015, and 17 percentage points of growth from volume and price, partially offset by a 3 percentage point decline from foreign exchange. Sales growth in the Other Businesses was driven by the strong performance from the single channel online businesses in the United States and Japan, which grew 34% on a daily basis.
Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for January and February and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Now let's take a look at March. There were 23 selling days in March of 2016, 1 more than in 2015. Company daily sales declined 1% versus March of 2015. Sales results in March included 4 percentage points from acquisitions, and foreign exchange was essentially flat for the month. Excluding acquisitions, organic daily sales declined 5% driven by a 3 percentage point decline in price, a 1 percentage point reduction from the timing of the Easter holiday, a 1 percentage point reduction in lower sales of seasonal products and a 1 percentage point reduction in lower sales of Ebola-related products, partially offset by a 1 percentage point contribution from volume.
In the United States, daily sales in March declined 5%. This decline was due to a 3 percentage point decline in price, a 1 percentage point reduction from the timing of the Easter holiday, a 1 percentage point reduction in lower sales of seasonal products and a 1 percentage point reduction in lower sales of Ebola-related products, partially offset by a 1 percentage point contribution from increased sales to Zoro. 
March customer end market performance in the United States was as follows: Government was up in the mid-single digits, Light Manufacturing was flat, Retail was down in the low single digits, Commercial was down in the mid-single digits, Heavy Manufacturing and Contractor were down in the high single digits and Natural Resources and Reseller were down in the mid-teens. 
Daily sales in Canada for March were down 20% and down 18% in local currency. The 18% daily sales decline consisted of a 16 percentage point decline in volume, a 3 percentage point decline from the SAP implementation and a 1 percentage point decline from lower sales of seasonal products, partially offset by a 2 percentage point benefit from price. The volume decline was seen in all customer end markets. 
On a geographic basis, sales performance in Canada was driven by softness in the province of Alberta, which was down 24% in local currency in March. All other provinces were down about 18%.
Daily sales in March for our Other Businesses increased 41%. The daily sales growth consisted of 31 percentage points from Cromwell and 10 percentage points from volume and was primarily driven by Zoro U.S. and MonotaRO. 
Performance for the Other Businesses was driven by 28% daily sales growth for the single channel online businesses. Our businesses in Latin America and Fabory in Europe were affected by the timing of Easter, where extended holidays are more common. 
Turning to April. Daily sales growth to date has benefited from the timing of the Easter holiday. We are expecting low single digit sales growth for the full month. 
Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman."

Since we have already analyzed company operating performance, let's move right into results by reportable segment.

Since we have already analyzed company operating performance, let's move right into results by reportable segment. As a reminder, all results in the podcast are adjusted to exclude restructuring unless specifically noted. 
Operating earnings in the United States declined 5% versus the 2015 first quarter, with operating margins down 90 basis points to 17.7% versus 18.6% in the prior year. Gross profit margins for the quarter declined 260 basis points driven by greater sales to lower-margin customers and price deflation greater than COGS deflation. Approximately 80 basis points of the reduction was due to changes in the classification of certain funding received from vendors related to the Annual Trade Show. Operating expenses in the U.S. segment decreased 7%, driven by lower payroll and benefits costs and timing of planned spending and $10 million of supplier funding for the trade show.
Let's move on to our business in Canada, which had a loss of $9 million in the quarter versus $9 million in profit in the prior year. The decrease was driven by the sales decline, lower gross profit margins and unfavorable operating expense leverage. The gross profit margin in Canada was down 660 basis points with about 1/3 of the decline due to not having a trade show this year in Canada and about 2/3 from product mix driven by unfavorable foreign exchange. 
Expenses were down 18% versus the prior year, but the business experienced negative expense leverage given the 24% decline in reported revenue. We believe our investments in supply chain and IT in Canada set the stage for improved performance for this business. 
Our Other Businesses generated $22 million in operating earnings for the 2016 quarter versus $12 million in 2015. This performance was primarily driven by strong results from Zoro in the United States and MonotaRO, along with incremental earnings from Cromwell acquired on September 1, 2015.
Operating margin for the Other Businesses in the quarter increased 100 basis points from 3.9% to 4.9% year-over-year. Below the operating line, other income and expense was a net expense of $20 million in the 2016 first quarter versus $4 million in the 2015 first quarter. The increase is due to interest expense from the $1 billion of debt the company issued in 2015 as well as expected losses from the company's investment in clean energy. 
For the quarter, the effective tax rate in 2016 was 35.6% versus 38.4% in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the company's investments in clean energy. We are still projecting an effective tax rate of 35.2% to 36.2% in the full year 2016. 
Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $154 million in the 2016 first quarter versus $156 million in the 2015 first quarter. The company used the cash generated, along with short-term borrowings, to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. Capital expenditures were $52 million in the 2016 first quarter versus $99 million in the first quarter of 2015, reflecting a lower planned spend for 2016 and the timing of ongoing projects. We returned $245 million to shareholders through $73 million in dividends and $172 million to buy back 893,000 shares of stock. 
Now let's take a look at guidance. As mentioned in the press release, we narrowed our 2016 guidance range for sales and earnings per share. Our new guidance reflects increased gross profit pressure for the year and increased operating expense favorability, although not to the same extent as the first quarter. 
Let's look more closely at the underlying elements of our expectations versus adjusted results in 2015. We'll begin with sales. We narrowed our sales guidance range and maintained a midpoint of 3% reported growth. We now expect price to be a little worse, down 2%; and foreign exchange to be a little better, down 1%, both for the full year. Although price was down 3% in the first quarter, we expect price to improve slightly in the final 3 quarters. We normally issue a price increase in January, but we intend to increase prices on a selective group of items as the year progresses.
Moving on to gross profit margins. Given the inflationary environment, we are taking a cautious view on gross margins and are lowering our gross margin expectations by 80 basis points. So for the full year, we now expect gross profit margins to be down 130 to 150 basis points versus 2015. For the 2016 second quarter, we are expecting gross profit margins to be down 130 to 150 basis points versus the 2015 second quarter. 
On operating expense for the year, we expect operating expense to sales to be flat to down 90 basis points. For the second quarter, we expect operating expense to sales to be down 40 to 60 basis points. 
Let's take a closer look at operating margin expectations. The gross profit and operating expense adjustments offset, resulting in unchanged operating margin guidance from January. So for the full year, we expect 40 to 150 basis points of operating margin compression versus the prior year. For the 2016 second quarter, operating margins are forecasted to be down 70 to 110 basis points. 
On restructuring in the first quarter, we closed 5 branches in the United States, and we expect to close 50 more in the remainder of the year. While negligible in the first quarter, we now anticipate gains on sales of restructuring-related assets to be $5 million to $10 million pretax over the rest of the year. Unlike the $7 million gain on sale of the former Toronto distribution center due to relocation, the branch gains are an offset to restructuring costs and are not in our guidance. We wanted to share this detail as it drives reported results from the expenses to earnings per share and networking assets to cash flow.
Now on our nonoperating initiatives. We anticipate our next issuance of $400 million in long-term debt in the second quarter as part of our planned $800 million in share repurchases for 2016. As communicated earlier this year, we entered into a second clean energy investment, which generates operating losses but is also eligible for tax credits. We expect about $0.15 per share benefit to earnings per share in 2016 from the 2 clean energy investments. Please see Exhibit 4 for more information. 
Finally, earnings per share. We narrowed our range for earnings per share. Similar to sales, we did not adjust the midpoint due to uncertainty about the economy and the first quarter expense favorability that will not repeat to the same extent.
Please mark your calendar for the following upcoming events: On April 27, we will host our annual meeting of shareholders. The script from that meeting will be available on our website following the event. We plan to report April sales information on May 13. And on May 18, Jim Ryan, Ron Jadin and D.G. Macpherson will present at the Electrical Products Group Meeting in Longboat Key, Florida. This event will also be webcast.

With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. 
The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's 2016 second quarter results. This podcast supplements our 2016 second quarter earnings release issued today, July 19, and other information available on our Investor Relations website. 
This material contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current view of the competitive market and the overall environment. Future risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please see our SEC filings, including our most recent periodic reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, which are available on our Investor Relations website for a discussion of factors that may affect our forward-looking statements. 
Today, we reported results for the 2016 second quarter and updated our sales and earnings per share guidance for the full year to reflect our performance to date in the challenging industrial economy. I also want to report on our progress on key initiatives since we're at the midpoint of the year. We've made many important investments in this business despite the current economic challenges. We're investing in our supply chain, our eCommerce capability, our on-site services and tools to make our sales force more efficient. 
In the United States, in the quarter, we launched a new inside sales teams, which has 275 representatives calling on our medium-sized customers. We closed 27 branches in the United States as part of a previously announced plan to adjust the U.S. branch network. 
In Canada, we installed SAP to allow for better visibility to our data and our inventory in the North American level. We also increased direct-to-customer shipping to improve service and efficiency. As of the end of the quarter, 24% of shipments were going direct to the customer. 
eCommerce represented 46% of sales in the first half of the year, up from 40% in the first half of 2015, illustrating our strength in helping customers using the tools and channels they prefer. And the single channel online businesses increased revenue 34% on a daily basis over the 2015 second quarter. 
Overall, we remain confident in our U.S. performance for the year despite the tough environment we're operating in. Canada's results were lower than anticipated and significantly contributed to the earning shortfall versus our expectations, but we believe in the long-term prospects of the business and are executing a plan to improve performance. Finally, our single channel online businesses continued their rapid growth, serving mostly small customers in the United States and Japan. 
Before we begin review of our results, I'd like to remind you of the adjustments to reported results in the second quarters of 2016 and 2015. In general, we will adjust the reported results to exclude items that are unrelated to the ongoing operations of the business. We believe this gives investors a better view of our core operational performance. Tables reconciling reported to adjusted results and other non-GAAP measures accompany today's earnings release and the transcript of this podcast, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website. 
In the quarter, we took several actions to restructure the business for long-term success. We initiated $6 million of restructuring cost in the United States. Those costs were more than offset by gains on sales of branch real estate of $15 million. Overall, we realized a net savings of $0.09 earnings per share. We had restructuring cost of $8 million in Canada primarily related to severance or $0.09 per share. Also, in Canada, we reported a $10 million or $0.12 per share negative adjustment to inventory as a result of the revisions to the reserves methodology based on additional visibility of inventory performance provided by the recent conversion to the U.S. SAP system. We wrote down the value of a claim we are selling as part of eliminating aviation operations, which had a $0.09 impact to earnings per share. Lastly, the quarter also included a benefit of $0.11 per share from the effect of settlement of certain Federal income tax issues under audit for the years 2009 to 2012. These actions had a net effect of $0.10 of charges to earnings per share. In 2015, we took $0.02 per share in charges related to restructuring at Fabory and the shutdown of the Brazil business. 
With that as a backdrop, let's look at our results for the 2016 second quarter. All figures below reflect adjusted results unless specifically noted. Company sales for the quarter increased 2% versus the 2015 second quarter. Excluding acquisitions, organic sales decreased 2%. There were 64 selling days in both quarters. Operating earnings decreased 10%, and net earnings decreased 20%. Earnings per share were $2.89, down 12% versus the prior year. Bill will cover our revised guidance in detail at the end of the podcast. We now expect 2016 sales growth of 1% to 4% and earnings per share of $11.20 to $12.20. Our 2016 guidance issued on April 18, 2016, included 0 to 6% sales growth and earnings per share of $11 to $12.80. 
Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail. Gross profit margins in the second quarter decreased 160 basis points to 41% versus 42.6% in 2015 due to unfavorable price cost mix in the United States and Canada. Operating expenses for the company increased 2%, primarily due to the addition of Cromwell expenses not recorded in last year's results. Operating expenses as a percent of sales were 28.4%, up 10 basis points versus the prior year. Total company operating earnings were $323 million, a decrease of 10% versus the prior year. The operating margin was 12.6%, a decrease of 160 basis points versus the prior year. 
Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of June; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2016 guidance. 
Before we begin our sales discussion, please note that some of the businesses have a different number of selling days due to local holidays. Despite this, we use the number of selling days in the United States as a basis for our calculation of daily sales. As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased to 2%. Sales growth by month were as follows: up 4% in April, up 1% in May and flat in June. Results for the quarter included 4 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition. Excluding acquisitions, organic sales decreased 2%, driven by a 1 percentage point decline in volume and a 1 percentage point decline in price. 
Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 business segments: the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations are reported under Other Businesses. Sales in the United States, which accounted for 74% of total company revenue in the quarter, decreased 3%. Results for the quarter included a 2 percentage point decline from volume and a 2 percentage point decline from price, partially offset by 1 percentage point from intercompany sales, primarily to Zoro. 
Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Government and Retail were up in the low single digits. Light Manufacturing was flat. Commercial was down in the low single digits. Heavy Manufacturing was down in the mid-single digits. Contractor was down in the high single digits. And Natural Resources and Reseller were down in the mid-teens. As we announced previously, we realigned our sales force on May 1 to better serve government, manufacturing, commercial and healthcare customers. We're currently experiencing some sales disruption due to the transition, but we expect the new structure to drive increased growth, share gain and better efficiency. 
Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represent 8% of total company revenues. Reflecting the tough Canadian economy and particularly the energy sector, sales for the quarter decreased 19% in U.S. dollars and declined 16% in local currency versus the prior year. The 16% sales decrease consisted of a 14 percentage point decline in volume and a 2 percentage point decline from the wildfires in Alberta. All end markets, except Government and Forestry, were down for the quarter. From a geographic standpoint, sales in oil-producing Alberta were down 28% compared to all other provinces, which were down 11% in aggregate. 
Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses, which represented 18% of total company sales. Sales for the Other Businesses increased 49% consisting of 31 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition, 17 percentage points of growth from volume and price and 1 percentage point from foreign exchange. The organic sales increase was primarily due to the growth from the single channel online businesses of Zoro U.S. and MonotaRO, partially offset by lower sales in Latin America. 
Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for April and May and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at June. There were 22 selling days in June of 2016, the same as 2015. Company sales were flat in June versus the prior year. The sales performance included 4 percentage points from acquisitions, offset by a 3 percentage point decline from volume and a 1 percentage point decline from price. In the United States, June daily sales decreased 3%, driven by a 4 percentage point decline from volume and a 1 percentage point decline from price, partially offset by 2 percentage points from intercompany sales, primarily to Zoro. June customer end market performance in the United States was as follows: retail was flat; Light Manufacturing, Government and Commercial were down in the low single digits; Heavy Manufacturing was down in the mid-single digits; Contractor was down in the high single digits; Reseller was down in the mid-teens; and Natural Resources was down in the high-teens. The performance of the Government end market was affected by softer sales to state and local customers at the June fiscal year-end compared to 2015. Given that 2015 was exceptionally strong, the low digit -- single-digit decline was within our expectations. Similar to the quarter, sluggish demand and sales force changes contributed to the lower sales performance in June. 
Sales in Canada for June were down 23% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency. The 18% decrease was driven by a 17 percentage point decline in volume and a 2 percentage point decline from the wildfires in Alberta, partially offset by 1 percentage point from price. All end markets were negative. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down 30% compared to all other provinces, which were down 11% in aggregate. Sales for our Other Businesses increased 46% in June, consisting of 31 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition, 14 percentage points from volume and price and 1 percentage point from foreign exchange. The organic sales increase was primarily due to strong revenue growth from Zoro U.S. and Japan, partially offset by lower sales for Fabory in Europe and Latin America. As a reminder, we will anniversary the Cromwell acquisition on September 1, 2016. Sales growth in the month of July to date is in line with the sales performance in June. 
Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman."
276060,345758948,1007696,"W.W. Grainger, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2016",2016-07-19,"Earnings Calls","W.W. Grainger, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Laura. Let's talk about performance by reportable segment since we've already analyzed company operating performance. As a reminder, all the figures below represent adjusted results. In the United States, operating earnings decreased 8% in the q",1145,"Thanks, Laura. Let's talk about performance by reportable segment since we've already analyzed company operating performance. As a reminder, all the figures below represent adjusted results. 
In the United States, operating earnings decreased 8% in the quarter, driven by lower sales and lower gross profit margins. The operating margin for the U.S. segment was 17.2% versus 18.2% in the 2015 quarter. Gross profit margins for the quarter declined 90 basis points, primarily driven by negative customer selling mix and price deflation greater than product cost deflation. Operating expenses were down 2% due to lower advertising cost. 
Let's move on to our business in Canada, which had an operating loss of $10 million in the quarter versus operating earnings of $9 million in the 2015 second quarter, driven by lower sales and lower gross profit. The gross profit margin in Canada declined 640 basis points versus the prior year, driven by the combination of price deflation and cost of goods sold inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange from products sourced from the United States. Operating expenses were down 12% versus the 2015 quarter, driven by lower SAP cost versus the prior year and lower advertising cost. The Canadian business is undergoing significant change management as a result of the SAP conversion though we have confidence in our leadership team and the plan to return the business to long-term profitable growth. 
Operating earnings in the Other Businesses were $30 million in the 2016 second quarter. Operating earnings in the 2015 second quarter were $17 million, representing an earnings increase of $13 million or 73% versus the prior year. Results included strong performance from Zoro U.S. and Japan and the earnings contribution from Cromwell. 
Below the operating line, other income and expense was a net $23 million of expense in the 2016 second quarter versus a net $8 million expense in the 2015 second quarter. The increase was driven by higher interest expense from the company's debt offerings in 2015 and 2016. Operating losses from the clean energy investments were lower than expected in the quarter as a result of lower demand for refined coal given relatively mild weather. 
For the quarter, the reported effective tax rate in 2016 was 36.6% versus 35.4% in 2015. The 2016 second quarter included an $0.11 per share benefit from the effective settlement of certain Federal income tax issues under audit for the years 2009 through 2012. Excluding this discrete benefit, the company's effective tax rate was 39.1%. The effective tax rate for the 2015 second quarter, excluding a year-to-date adjustment for the benefit from the company's first clean energy investment, was 36.9%. The year-over-year increase in the tax rate, excluding the settlement benefit, was primarily due to a larger proportion of earnings from higher tax rate jurisdictions and lower benefit from the clean energy investments in the quarter. We currently project an effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, of 36.8% to 37.8% for the full year 2016 versus 35.2% to 36.2% provided on April 19, 2016. The increase since April is driven by the expectation of [Audio Gap] concentration in the higher tax rate jurisdictions and lower benefit from the clean energy investments. 
Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $173 million versus $213 million in 2015 as a result of lower earnings. We used the cash generated during the quarter, along with borrowings, to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. We bought back 1,033,000 shares of stock for $241 million in the second quarter. Grainger returned a total of $315 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $75 million in dividends, reflecting the 4% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2016. Capital expenditures were $54 million in the quarter versus $71 million in the second quarter of 2015. We have revised our full year guidance for capital expenditures to $300 million to $325 million from $300 million to $350 million announced in November of 2015. As reported in our 2016 second quarter earnings release, we revised our 2016 sales and earnings per share guidance. For the full year 2016, we now expect 1% to 4% sales growth and earnings per share of $11.20 to $12.20. 
Let's look more closely at our current expectations. We'll begin with sales. For the full year, the midpoint of guidance is now 2.5% growth, reflecting lower-than-expected volume in the United States and Canada. We now expect foreign exchange to have no net impact on sales for the full year due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen. As a reminder, we anniversary-ed the Cromwell acquisition at the beginning of September. 
Moving on to gross profit margins. For the full year, we still expect gross profit margins to be down 130 to 150 basis points versus 2015. Gross profit margins for the third quarter are forecasted to be down the 100 to 140 basis points versus the prior year. 
Let's take a closer look at the operating margin expectations. For the full year, we now expect operating margin compression of 60 to 130 basis points. The midpoint of operating margin guidance remains unchanged as gross profit improvements of our April guidance offset expense deleveraging on lower sales. The full year guidance implies modest improvement in the second half of the year versus previous guidance. This is due to continued strong expense management and better-than-expected gross profit margin in the United States. So for the third quarter, we expect operating margins to be down 80 to 170 basis points versus the prior year. 
Next, other income and expense. We issued $400 million of new debt in mid-May, so there was about 1/2 of a quarter's worth of increased interest expense in the second quarter. The third and fourth quarters will contain the full 3 months of higher interest expense. 
Finally, earnings per share. As noted, we revised our guidance and we now expect earnings per share of $11.20 to $12.20. We now expect a $0.07 per share benefit to earnings per share in 2016 from the 2 clean energy investments compared to the prior projection of $0.15 per share benefit on April 18, 2016. Please see Exhibit 4 for more detail. The earnings per share guidance includes the projected tax rate of 36.8% to 37.8% for 2016, reflecting a higher proportion of earnings from higher tax jurisdictions. 
Finally, please mark your calendar for the following important dates: on August 11, we plan to release July sales; and we will host our annual Analyst Meeting on the morning of Friday, November 11, which will be held at our headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Laura Brown at (847) 535-0409; Michael Ferreter at (847) 535-1439; or me, Bill Chapman, at (847) 535-0881.

This is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations.
The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's 2016 second quarter results. This podcast supplements our 2016 second quarter earnings release issued today, July 19, and other information available on our Investor Relations website. This material contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current view of the competitive market and the overall environment. Future risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please see our SEC filings, including our most recent periodic reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, which are available on our Investor Relations website, for a discussion of factors that may affect our forward-looking statements.
Today, we reported results for the 2016 second quarter and updated our sales and earnings per share guidance for the full year to reflect our performance to date in the challenging industrial economy. I also wanted to report on our progress on key initiatives since we're at the midpoint of the year. We've made many important investments in this business despite the current economic challenges. We're investing in our supply chain, our eCommerce capability, our on-site services and tools to make our sales force more efficient.
In the United States, in the quarter, we launched a new inside sales teams which has 275 representatives calling on our medium-sized customers. We closed 27 branches in the United States as part of a previously announced plan to adjust the U.S. branch network. In Canada, we installed SAP to allow for better visibility to our data and our inventory in the North American level. We also increased direct-to-customer shipping to improve service and efficiency. As of the end of the quarter, 24% of shipments were going direct to the customer.
eCommerce represented 46% of sales in the first half of the year, up from 40% in the first half 2015, illustrating our strength in helping customers using the tools and channels they prefer. And the single-channel online businesses increased revenue 34% on a daily basis over the 2015 second quarter.
Overall, we remain confident in our U.S. performance for the year despite the tough environment we're operating in. Canada's results were lower than anticipated and significantly contributed to the earnings shortfall versus our expectations, but we believe in the long-term prospects of the business and are executing a plan to improve performance. Finally, our single-channel online businesses continued their rapid growth, serving mostly small customers in the United States and Japan.
Before we begin review of our results, I'd like to remind you of the adjustments to reported results in the second quarters of 2016 and 2015. In general, we will adjust the reported results to exclude items that are unrelated to the ongoing operations of the business. We believe this gives investors a better view of our core operational performance. Tables reconciling reported to adjusted results and other non-GAAP measures accompany today's earnings release and the transcript of this podcast, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website.
In the quarter, we took several actions to restructure the business for long-term success. We initiated $6 million of restructuring costs in the United States. Those costs were more than offset by gains on sales of branch real estate of $15 million. Overall, we realized a net savings of $0.09 earnings per share. We had restructuring costs of $8 million in Canada, primarily related to severance, or $0.09 per share. Also in Canada, we reported a $10 million or $0.12 per share negative adjustment to inventory as a result of revisions to the reserves methodology based on additional visibility of inventory performance provided by the recent conversion to the U.S. SAP system. We wrote down the value of a plane we are selling as part of eliminating aviation operations, which had a $0.09 impact to earnings per share. Lastly, the quarter also included a benefit of $0.11 per share from the effective settlement of certain federal income tax issues under audit for the years 2009 through 2012.
These actions had a net effect of $0.10 of charges to earnings per share. In 2015, we took $0.02 per share in charges related to restructuring at Fabory and the shutdown of the Brazil business.
With that as a backdrop, let's look at our results for the 2016 second quarter. All figures below reflect adjusted results unless specifically noted.
Company sales for the quarter increased 2% versus the 2015 second quarter. Excluding acquisitions, organic sales decreased 2%. There were 64 selling days in both quarters. Operating earnings decreased 10%, and net earnings decreased 20%. Earnings per share were $2.89, down 12% versus the prior year.
Bill will cover our revised guidance in detail at the end of the podcast. We now expect 2016 sales growth of 1% to 4% and earnings per share of $11.20 to $12.20. Our 2016 guidance issued on April 18, 2016, included 0 to 6% sales growth and earnings per share of $11 to $12.80.
Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail.
Gross profit margins in the second quarter decreased 160 basis points to 41% versus 42.6% in 2015 due to unfavorable price-cost mix in the United States and Canada. Operating expenses for the company increased 2% primarily due to the addition of Cromwell expenses not recorded in last year's results. Operating expenses as a percent of sales were 28.4%, up 10 basis points versus the prior year.
Total company operating earnings were $323 million, a decrease of 10% versus the prior year. The operating margin was 12.6%, a decrease of 160 basis points versus the prior year.
Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of June; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment. And finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2016 guidance. Before we begin our sales discussion, please note that some of the businesses have a different number of selling days due to local holidays. Despite this, we use the number of selling days in the United States as the basis for our calculation of daily sales.
As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 2%. Sales growth by month was as follows: up 4% in April, up 1% in May and flat in June. Results for the quarter included 4 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition. Excluding acquisitions, organic sales decreased 2%, driven by a 1 percentage point decline in volume and a 1 percentage point decline in price.
Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 business segments: the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations are reported under Other Businesses.
Sales in the United States, which accounted for 74% of total company revenue in the quarter, decreased 3%. Results for the quarter included a 2 percentage point decline from volume and a 2 percentage point decline from price, partially offset by 1 percentage point from intercompany sales, primarily to Zoro.
Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Government and Retail were up in the low single digits. Light Manufacturing was flat. Commercial was down in the low single digits. Heavy Manufacturing was down in the mid-single digits. Contractor was down in the high single digits, and Natural Resources and Reseller were down in the mid-teens. As we announced previously, we realigned our sales force on May 1 to better serve Government, manufacturing, Commercial and health care customers. We are currently experiencing some sales disruption due to the transition, but we expect the new structure to drive increased growth, share gain and better efficiency.
Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represent 8% of total company revenues. Reflecting the tough Canadian economy and particularly the energy sector, sales for the quarter decreased 19% in U.S. dollars and declined 16% in local currency versus the prior year. The 16% sales decrease consisted of a 14 percentage point decline in volume and a 2 percentage point decline from the wildfires in Alberta. All end markets, except Government and Forestry, were down for the quarter. From a geographic standpoint, sales in oil-producing Alberta were down 28% compared to all other provinces, which were down 11% in aggregate.
Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses, which represented 18% of total company sales. Sales for the Other Businesses increased 49%, consisting of 31 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition, 17 percentage points of growth from volume and price and 1 percentage point from foreign exchange. The organic sales increase was primarily due to the growth from the single-channel online businesses of Zoro U.S. and MonotaRO, partially offset by lower sales in Latin America.
Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for April and May and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at June. There were 22 selling days in June of 2016, the same as 2015. Company sales were flat in June versus the prior year. The sales performance included 4 percentage points from acquisitions, offset by a 3 percentage point decline from volume and a 1 percentage point decline from price.
In the United States, June daily sales decreased 3%, driven by a 4 percentage point decline from volume and a 1 percentage point decline from price, partially offset by 2 percentage points from intercompany sales primarily to Zoro. June customer end market performance in the United States was as follows: Retail was flat. Light Manufacturing, Government and Commercial were down in the low single digits. Heavy Manufacturing was down in the mid-single digits. Contractor was down in the high single digits. Reseller was down in the mid-teens, and Natural Resources was down in the high teens. The performance of the Government end market was affected by softer sales to state and local customers at the June fiscal year-end compared to 2015. Given that 2015 was exceptionally strong, the low digit -- single-digit decline was within our expectations. Similar to the quarter, sluggish demand and sales force changes contributed to the lower sales performance in June.
Sales in Canada for June were down 23% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency. The 18% decrease was driven by a 17 percentage point decline in volume and a 2 percentage point decline from the wildfires in Alberta, partially offset by 1 percentage point from price. All end markets were negative. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down 30% compared to all other provinces, which were down 11% in aggregate.
Sales for our Other Businesses increased 46% in June, consisting of 31 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition, 14 percentage points from volume and price and 1 percentage point from foreign exchange. The organic sales increase was primarily due to strong revenue growth from Zoro U.S. and Japan, partially offset by lower sales for Fabory in Europe and Latin America.
As a reminder, we will anniversary the Cromwell acquisition on September 1, 2016.
Sales growth in the month of July to date is in line with the sales performance in June.
Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman."

Let's talk about performance by reportable segment since we have already analyzed company operating performance. As a reminder, all figures below represent adjusted results.
In the United States, operating earnings decreased 8% in the quarter, driven by lower sales and lower gross profit margins. The operating margin for the U.S. segment was 17.2% versus 18.2% in the 2015 quarter. Gross profit margins for the quarter declined 90 basis points, primarily driven by negative customer selling mix and price deflation greater than product cost deflation. Operating expenses were down 2% due to lower advertising costs.
Let's move on to our business in Canada, which had an operating loss of $10 million in the quarter versus operating earnings of $9 million in the 2015 second quarter driven by lower sales and lower gross profit. The gross profit margin in Canada declined 640 basis points versus the prior year, driven by the combination of price deflation and cost of goods sold inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange from products sourced from the United States. Operating expenses were down 12% versus the 2015 quarter, driven by lower SAP costs versus the prior year and lower advertising costs. The Canadian business is undergoing significant change management as a result of the SAP conversion, though we have confidence in our leadership team and the plan to return the business to long-term profitable growth.
Operating earnings in the Other Businesses were $30 million in the 2016 second quarter. Operating earnings in the 2015 second quarter were $17 million, representing an earnings increase of $13 million or 73% versus the prior year. Results included strong performance from Zoro U.S. and Japan and the earnings contribution from Cromwell.
Below the operating line, other income and expense was a net $23 million of expense in the 2016 second quarter versus a net $8 million expense in the 2015 second quarter. The increase was driven by higher interest expense from the company's debt offerings in 2015 and 2016. Operating losses from the clean energy investments were lower than expected in the quarter as a result of lower demand for refined coal given relatively mild weather.
For the quarter, the reported effective tax rate, in 2016, was 36.6% versus 35.4% in 2015. The 2016 second quarter included an $0.11 per share benefit from the effective settlement of certain federal income tax issues under audit for the years 2009 through 2012. Excluding this discrete benefit, the company's effective tax rate was 39.1%. The effective tax rate for the 2015 second quarter, excluding a year-to-date adjustment for the benefit from the company's first clean energy investment, was 36.9%. The year-over-year increase in the tax rate, excluding the settlement benefit, was primarily due to a larger proportion of earnings from higher-tax-rate jurisdictions and lower benefit from the clean energy investments in the quarter. We currently project an effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, of 36.8% to 37.8% for the full year 2016 versus 35.2% to 36.2% provided on April 19, 2016. The increase since April is driven by the expectation of continued earnings concentration in higher-tax-rate jurisdictions and lower benefit from the clean energy investments.
Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $173 million versus $213 million in 2015 as a result of lower earnings. We used the cash generated during the quarter, along with borrowings, to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. We bought back 1,033,000 shares of stock for $241 million in the second quarter. Grainger returned a total of $315 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $75 million in dividends, reflecting the 4% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2016.
Capital expenditures were $54 million in the quarter versus $71 million in the second quarter of 2015. We have revised our full year guidance for capital expenditures to $300 million to $325 million from $300 million to $350 million announced in November of 2015.
As reported in our 2016 second quarter earnings release, we revised our 2016 sales and earnings per share guidance. For the full year 2016, we now expect 1% to 4% sales growth and earnings per share of $11.20 to $12.20.
Let's look more closely at our current expectations. We'll begin with sales. For the full year, the midpoint of guidance is now 2.5% growth, reflecting lower-than-expected volume in the United States and Canada. We now expect foreign exchange to have no net impact on sales for the full year due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen. As a reminder, we anniversaried the Cromwell acquisition at the beginning of September.
Moving on to gross profit margins. For the full year, we still expect gross profit margins be -- to be down 130 to 150 basis points versus 2015. Gross profit margins for the third quarter are forecasted to be down 100 to 140 basis points versus the prior year. Let's take a closer look at operating margin expectations: For the full year, we now expect operating margin compression of 60 to 130 basis points. The midpoint of operating margin guidance remains unchanged, as gross profit improvements over April guidance offset expense deleveraging on lower sales. The full year guidance implies modest improvement in the second half of the year versus previous guidance. This is due to continued strong expense management and better-than-expected gross profit margin in the United States. So for the third quarter, we expect operating margins to be down 80 to 170 basis points versus the prior year.
Next, other income and expense. We issued $400 million of new debt in mid-May, so there was about half of a quarter's worth of increased interest expense in the second quarter. The third and fourth quarters will contain the full 3 months of the higher interest expense.
Finally, earnings per share. As noted, we revised our guidance and we now expect earnings per share of $11.20 to $12.20. We now expect a $0.07 per share benefit to earnings per share in 2016 from the 2 clean energy investments compared to the prior projection of $0.15 per share benefit on April 18, 2016. Please see Exhibit 4 for more detail. The earnings per share guidance includes the projected tax rate of 36.8% to 37.8% for 2016, reflecting a higher proportion of earnings from higher-tax jurisdictions.
Finally, please mark your calendar for the following important dates. On August 11, we plan to release July sales. And we will host our annual Analyst Meeting on the morning of Friday, November 11, which will be held at our headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois.

Company sales for the quarter increased 2% versus the 2015 second quarter. Excluding acquisitions, organic sales decreased 2%. There were 64 selling days in both quarters. Operating earnings decreased 10%, and net earnings decreased 20%. Earnings per share were $2.89, down 12% versus the prior year.
Bill will cover our revised guidance in detail at the end of the podcast. We now expect 2016 sales growth of 1% to 4% and earnings per share of $11.20 to $12.20. Our 2016 guidance issued on April 18, 2016, included 0 to 6% sales growth and earnings per share of $11 to $12.80.
Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail.
Gross profit margins in the second quarter decreased 160 basis points to 41% versus 42.6% in 2015 due to unfavorable price-cost mix in the United States and Canada. Operating expenses for the company increased 2% primarily due to the addition of Cromwell expenses not recorded in last year's results. Operating expenses as a percent of sales were 28.4%, up 10 basis points versus the prior year.
Total company operating earnings were $323 million, a decrease of 10% versus the prior year. The operating margin was 12.6%, a decrease of 160 basis points versus the prior year.
Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of June; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment. And finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2016 guidance. Before we begin our sales discussion, please note that some of the businesses have a different number of selling days due to local holidays. Despite this, we use the number of selling days in the United States as the basis for our calculation of daily sales.
As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 2%. Sales growth by month was as follows: up 4% in April, up 1% in May and flat in June. Results for the quarter included 4 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition. Excluding acquisitions, organic sales decreased 2%, driven by a 1 percentage point decline in volume and a 1 percentage point decline in price.
Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 business segments: the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations are reported under Other Businesses.
Sales in the United States, which accounted for 74% of total company revenue in the quarter, decreased 3%. Results for the quarter included a 2 percentage point decline from volume and a 2 percentage point decline from price, partially offset by 1 percentage point from intercompany sales, primarily to Zoro.
Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Government and Retail were up in the low single digits. Light Manufacturing was flat. Commercial was down in the low single digits. Heavy Manufacturing was down in the mid-single digits. Contractor was down in the high single digits, and Natural Resources and Reseller were down in the mid-teens. As we announced previously, we realigned our sales force on May 1 to better serve Government, manufacturing, Commercial and health care customers. We are currently experiencing some sales disruption due to the transition, but we expect the new structure to drive increased growth, share gain and better efficiency.
Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represent 8% of total company revenues. Reflecting the tough Canadian economy and particularly the energy sector, sales for the quarter decreased 19% in U.S. dollars and declined 16% in local currency versus the prior year. The 16% sales decrease consisted of a 14 percentage point decline in volume and a 2 percentage point decline from the wildfires in Alberta. All end markets, except Government and Forestry, were down for the quarter. From a geographic standpoint, sales in oil-producing Alberta were down 28% compared to all other provinces, which were down 11% in aggregate.
Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses, which represented 18% of total company sales. Sales for the Other Businesses increased 49%, consisting of 31 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition, 17 percentage points of growth from volume and price and 1 percentage point from foreign exchange. The organic sales increase was primarily due to the growth from the single-channel online businesses of Zoro U.S. and MonotaRO, partially offset by lower sales in Latin America.
Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for April and May and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at June. There were 22 selling days in June of 2016, the same as 2015. Company sales were flat in June versus the prior year. The sales performance included 4 percentage points from acquisitions, offset by a 3 percentage point decline from volume and a 1 percentage point decline from price.
In the United States, June daily sales decreased 3%, driven by a 4 percentage point decline from volume and a 1 percentage point decline from price, partially offset by 2 percentage points from intercompany sales primarily to Zoro. June customer end market performance in the United States was as follows: Retail was flat; Light Manufacturing, Government and Commercial were down in the low single digits; Heavy Manufacturing was down in the mid-single digits; Contractor was down in the high single digits; Reseller was down in the mid-teens and Natural Resources was down in the high teens. The performance of the Government end market was affected by softer sales to state and local customers at the June fiscal year-end compared to 2015. Given that 2015 was exceptionally strong, the low digit -- single-digit decline was within our expectations. Similar to the quarter, sluggish demand and sales force changes contributed to the lower sales performance in June.
Sales in Canada for June were down 23% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency. The 18% decrease was driven by a 17 percentage point decline in volume and a 2 percentage point decline from the wildfires in Alberta, partially offset by 1 percentage point from price. All end markets were negative. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down 30% compared to all other provinces, which were down 11% in aggregate.
Sales for our Other Businesses increased 46% in June, consisting of 31 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition, 14 percentage points from volume and price and 1 percentage point from foreign exchange. The organic sales increase was primarily due to strong revenue growth from Zoro U.S. and Japan, partially offset by lower sales for Fabory in Europe and Latin America.
As a reminder, we will anniversary the Cromwell acquisition on September 1, 2016.
Sales growth in the month of July to date is in line with the sales performance in June.
Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman."

In the United States, operating earnings decreased 8% in the quarter, driven by lower sales and lower gross profit margins. The operating margin for the U.S. segment was 17.2% versus 18.2% in the 2015 quarter. Gross profit margins for the quarter declined 90 basis points, primarily driven by negative customer selling mix and price deflation greater than product cost deflation. Operating expenses were down 2% due to lower advertising costs.
Let's move on to our business in Canada, which had an operating loss of $10 million in the quarter versus operating earnings of $9 million in the 2015 second quarter driven by lower sales and lower gross profit. The gross profit margin in Canada declined 640 basis points versus the prior year, driven by the combination of price deflation and cost of goods sold inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange from products sourced from the United States. Operating expenses were down 12% versus the 2015 quarter, driven by lower SAP costs versus the prior year and lower advertising costs. The Canadian business is undergoing significant change management as a result of the SAP conversion, though we have confidence in our leadership team and the plan to return the business to long-term profitable growth.
Operating earnings in the Other Businesses were $30 million in the 2016 second quarter. Operating earnings in the 2015 second quarter were $17 million, representing an earnings increase of $13 million or 73% versus the prior year. Results included strong performance from Zoro U.S. and Japan and the earnings contribution from Cromwell.
Below the operating line, other income and expense was a net $23 million of expense in the 2016 second quarter versus a net $8 million expense in the 2015 second quarter. The increase was driven by higher interest expense from the company's debt offerings in 2015 and 2016. Operating losses from the clean energy investments were lower than expected in the quarter as a result of lower demand for refined coal given relatively mild weather.
For the quarter, the reported effective tax rate, in 2016, was 36.6% versus 35.4% in 2015. The 2016 second quarter included an $0.11 per share benefit from the effective settlement of certain federal income tax issues under audit for the years 2009 through 2012. Excluding this discrete benefit, the company's effective tax rate was 39.1%. The effective tax rate for the 2015 second quarter, excluding a year-to-date adjustment for the benefit from the company's first clean energy investment, was 36.9%. The year-over-year increase in the tax rate, excluding the settlement benefit, was primarily due to a larger proportion of earnings from higher-tax-rate jurisdictions and lower benefit from the clean energy investments in the quarter. We currently project an effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, of 36.8% to 37.8% for the full year 2016 versus 35.2% to 36.2% provided on April 19, 2016. The increase since April is driven by the expectation of continued earnings concentration in higher-tax-rate jurisdictions and lower benefit from the clean energy investments.
Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $173 million versus $213 million in 2015 as a result of lower earnings. We used the cash generated during the quarter, along with borrowings, to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. We bought back 1,033,000 shares of stock for $241 million in the second quarter. Grainger returned a total of $315 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $75 million in dividends, reflecting the 4% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2016.
Capital expenditures were $54 million in the quarter versus $71 million in the second quarter of 2015. We have revised our full year guidance for capital expenditures to $300 million to $325 million from $300 million to $350 million announced in November of 2015.
As reported in our 2016 second quarter earnings release, we revised our 2016 sales and earnings per share guidance. For the full year 2016, we now expect 1% to 4% sales growth and earnings per share of $11.20 to $12.20.
Let's look more closely at our current expectations. We'll begin with sales. For the full year, the midpoint of guidance is now 2.5% growth, reflecting lower-than-expected volume in the United States and Canada. We now expect foreign exchange to have no net impact on sales for the full year due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen. As a reminder, we anniversaried the Cromwell acquisition at the beginning of September.
Moving on to gross profit margins. For the full year, we still expect gross profit margins be -- to be down 130 to 150 basis points versus 2015. Gross profit margins for the third quarter are forecasted to be down 100 to 140 basis points versus the prior year. Let's take a closer look at operating margin expectations: For the full year, we now expect operating margin compression of 60 to 130 basis points. The midpoint of operating margin guidance remains unchanged, as gross profit improvements over April guidance offset expense deleveraging on lower sales. The full year guidance implies modest improvement in the second half of the year versus previous guidance. This is due to continued strong expense management and better-than-expected gross profit margin in the United States. So for the third quarter, we expect operating margins to be down 80 to 170 basis points versus the prior year.
Next, other income and expense. We issued $400 million of new debt in mid-May, so there was about 0.5 quarter's worth of increased interest expense in the second quarter. The third and fourth quarters will contain the full 3 months of the higher interest expense.
Finally, earnings per share. As noted, we revised our guidance and we now expect earnings per share of $11.20 to $12.20. We now expect a $0.07 per share benefit to earnings per share in 2016 from the 2 clean energy investments compared to the prior projection of $0.15 per share benefit on April 18, 2016. Please see Exhibit 4 for more detail. The earnings per share guidance includes the projected tax rate of 36.8% to 37.8% for 2016, reflecting a higher proportion of earnings from higher-tax jurisdictions.
Finally, please mark your calendar for the following important dates. On August 11, we plan to release July sales. And we will host our annual Analyst Meeting on the morning of Friday, November 11, which will be held at our headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois.

This is Laura Brown, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor Relations. With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations.
The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's 2016 second quarter results. This podcast supplements our 2016 second quarter earnings release issued today, July 19, and other information available on our Investor Relations website. This material contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current view of the competitive market and the overall environment. Future risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please see our SEC filings, including our most recent periodic reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, which are available on our Investor Relations website, for a discussion of factors that may affect our forward-looking statements.
Today, we reported results for the 2016 second quarter and updated our sales and earnings per share guidance for the full year to reflect our performance to date in the challenging industrial economy. I also wanted to report on our progress on key initiatives since we're at the midpoint of the year. We've made many important investments in this business despite the current economic challenges. We're investing in our supply chain, our eCommerce capability, our on-site services and tools to make our sales force more efficient.
In the United States, in the quarter, we launched a new inside sales teams which has 275 representatives calling on our medium-sized customers. We closed 27 branches in the United States as part of a previously announced plan to adjust the U.S. branch network. In Canada, we installed SAP to allow for better visibility to our data and our inventory in the North American level. We also increased direct-to-customer shipping to improve service and efficiency. As of the end of the quarter, 24% of shipments were going direct to the customer.
eCommerce represented 46% of sales in the first half of the year, up from 40% in the first half 2015, illustrating our strength in helping customers using the tools and channels they prefer. And the single-channel online businesses increased revenue 34% on a daily basis over the 2015 second quarter.
Overall, we remain confident in our U.S. performance for the year despite the tough environment we're operating in. Canada's results were lower than anticipated and significantly contributed to the earnings shortfall versus our expectations, but we believe in the long-term prospects of the business and are executing a plan to improve performance. Finally, our single-channel online businesses continued their rapid growth, serving mostly small customers in the United States and Japan.
Before we begin review of our results, I'd like to remind you of the adjustments to reported results in the second quarters of 2016 and 2015. In general, we will adjust the reported results to exclude items that are unrelated to the ongoing operations of the business. We believe this gives investors a better view of our core operational performance. Tables reconciling reported to adjusted results and other non-GAAP measures accompany today's earnings release and the transcript of this podcast, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website.
In the quarter, we took several actions to restructure the business for long-term success. We initiated $6 million of restructuring costs in the United States. Those costs were more than offset by gains on sales of branch real estate of $15 million. Overall, we realized a net savings of $0.09 earnings per share. We had restructuring costs of $8 million in Canada, primarily related to severance, or $0.09 per share. Also in Canada, we reported a $10 million or $0.12 per share negative adjustment to inventory as a result of revisions to the reserves methodology based on additional visibility of inventory performance provided by the recent conversion to the U.S. SAP system. We wrote down the value of a plane we are selling as part of eliminating aviation operations, which had a $0.09 impact to earnings per share. Lastly, the quarter also included a benefit of $0.11 per share from the effective settlement of certain federal income tax issues under audit for the years 2009 through 2012.
These actions had a net effect of $0.10 of charges to earnings per share. In 2015, we took $0.02 per share in charges related to restructuring at Fabory and the shutdown of the Brazil business.
With that as a backdrop, let's look at our results for the 2016 second quarter. All figures below reflect adjusted results unless specifically noted.
Company sales for the quarter increased 2% versus the 2015 second quarter. Excluding acquisitions, organic sales decreased 2%. There were 64 selling days in both quarters. Operating earnings decreased 10%, and net earnings decreased 20%. Earnings per share were $2.89, down 12% versus the prior year.
Bill will cover our revised guidance in detail at the end of the podcast. We now expect 2016 sales growth of 1% to 4% and earnings per share of $11.20 to $12.20. Our 2016 guidance issued on April 18, 2016, included 0 to 6% sales growth and earnings per share of $11 to $12.80.
Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail.
Gross profit margins in the second quarter decreased 160 basis points to 41% versus 42.6% in 2015 due to unfavorable price-cost mix in the United States and Canada. Operating expenses for the company increased 2% primarily due to the addition of Cromwell expenses not recorded in last year's results. Operating expenses as a percent of sales were 28.4%, up 10 basis points versus the prior year.
Total company operating earnings were $323 million, a decrease of 10% versus the prior year. The operating margin was 12.6%, a decrease of 160 basis points versus the prior year.
Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of June; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment. And finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2016 guidance. Before we begin our sales discussion, please note that some of the businesses have a different number of selling days due to local holidays. Despite this, we use the number of selling days in the United States as the basis for our calculation of daily sales.
As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 2%. Sales growth by month was as follows: up 4% in April, up 1% in May and flat in June. Results for the quarter included 4 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition. Excluding acquisitions, organic sales decreased 2%, driven by a 1 percentage point decline in volume and a 1 percentage point decline in price.
Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 business segments: the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations are reported under Other Businesses.
Sales in the United States, which accounted for 74% of total company revenue in the quarter, decreased 3%. Results for the quarter included a 2 percentage point decline from volume and a 2 percentage point decline from price, partially offset by 1 percentage point from intercompany sales, primarily to Zoro.
Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Government and Retail were up in the low single digits. Light Manufacturing was flat. Commercial was down in the low single digits. Heavy Manufacturing was down in the mid-single digits. Contractor was down in the high single digits, and Natural Resources and Reseller were down in the mid-teens. As we announced previously, we realigned our sales force on May 1 to better serve Government, manufacturing, Commercial and health care customers. We are currently experiencing some sales disruption due to the transition, but we expect the new structure to drive increased growth, share gain and better efficiency.
Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represent 8% of total company revenues. Reflecting the tough Canadian economy and particularly the energy sector, sales for the quarter decreased 19% in U.S. dollars and declined 16% in local currency versus the prior year. The 16% sales decrease consisted of a 14 percentage point decline in volume and a 2 percentage point decline from the wildfires in Alberta. All end markets, except Government and Forestry, were down for the quarter. From a geographic standpoint, sales in oil-producing Alberta were down 28% compared to all other provinces, which were down 11% in aggregate.
Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses, which represented 18% of total company sales. Sales for the Other Businesses increased 49%, consisting of 31 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition, 17 percentage points of growth from volume and price and 1 percentage point from foreign exchange. The organic sales increase was primarily due to the growth from the single-channel online businesses of Zoro U.S. and MonotaRO, partially offset by lower sales in Latin America.
Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for April and May and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at June. There were 22 selling days in June of 2016, the same as 2015. Company sales were flat in June versus the prior year. The sales performance included 4 percentage points from acquisitions, offset by a 3 percentage point decline from volume and a 1 percentage point decline from price.
In the United States, June daily sales decreased 3%, driven by a 4 percentage point decline from volume and a 1 percentage point decline from price, partially offset by 2 percentage points from intercompany sales primarily to Zoro. June customer end market performance in the United States was as follows: Retail was flat; Light Manufacturing, Government and Commercial were down in the low single digits; Heavy Manufacturing was down in the mid-single digits; Contractor was down in the high single digits; Reseller was down in the mid-teens and Natural Resources was down in the high teens. The performance of the Government end market was affected by softer sales to state and local customers at the June fiscal year-end compared to 2015. Given that 2015 was exceptionally strong, the low digit -- single-digit decline was within our expectations. Similar to the quarter, sluggish demand and sales force changes contributed to the lower sales performance in June.
Sales in Canada for June were down 23% in U.S. dollars and 18% in local currency. The 18% decrease was driven by a 17 percentage point decline in volume and a 2 percentage point decline from the wildfires in Alberta, partially offset by 1 percentage point from price. All end markets were negative. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down 30% compared to all other provinces, which were down 11% in aggregate.
Sales for our Other Businesses increased 46% in June, consisting of 31 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition, 14 percentage points from volume and price and 1 percentage point from foreign exchange. The organic sales increase was primarily due to strong revenue growth from Zoro U.S. and Japan, partially offset by lower sales for Fabory in Europe and Latin America.
As a reminder, we will anniversary the Cromwell acquisition on September 1, 2016.
Sales growth in the month of July to date is in line with the sales performance in June.
Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman."

Let's talk about performance by reportable segment since we have already analyzed company operating performance. As a reminder, all figures below represent adjusted results.
In the United States, operating earnings decreased 8% in the quarter, driven by lower sales and lower gross profit margins. The operating margin for the U.S. segment was 17.2% versus 18.2% in the 2015 quarter. Gross profit margins for the quarter declined 90 basis points, primarily driven by negative customer selling mix and price deflation greater than product cost deflation. Operating expenses were down 2% due to lower advertising costs.
Let's move on to our business in Canada, which had an operating loss of $10 million in the quarter versus operating earnings of $9 million in the 2015 second quarter driven by lower sales and lower gross profit. The gross profit margin in Canada declined 640 basis points versus the prior year, driven by the combination of price deflation and cost of goods sold inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange from products sourced from the United States. Operating expenses were down 12% versus the 2015 quarter, driven by lower SAP costs versus the prior year and lower advertising costs. The Canadian business is undergoing significant change management as a result of the SAP conversion, though we have confidence in our leadership team and the plan to return the business to long-term profitable growth.
Operating earnings in the Other Businesses were $30 million in the 2016 second quarter. Operating earnings in the 2015 second quarter were $17 million, representing an earnings increase of $13 million or 73% versus the prior year. Results included strong performance from Zoro U.S. and Japan and the earnings contribution from Cromwell.
Below the operating line, other income and expense was a net $23 million of expense in the 2016 second quarter versus a net $8 million expense in the 2015 second quarter. The increase was driven by higher interest expense from the company's debt offerings in 2015 and 2016. Operating losses from the clean energy investments were lower than expected in the quarter as a result of lower demand for refined coal given relatively mild weather.
For the quarter, the reported effective tax rate, in 2016, was 36.6% versus 35.4% in 2015. The 2016 second quarter included an $0.11 per share benefit from the effective settlement of certain federal income tax issues under audit for the years 2009 through 2012. Excluding this discrete benefit, the company's effective tax rate was 39.1%. The effective tax rate for the 2015 second quarter, excluding a year-to-date adjustment for the benefit from the company's first clean energy investment, was 36.9%. The year-over-year increase in the tax rate, excluding the settlement benefit, was primarily due to a larger proportion of earnings from higher-tax-rate jurisdictions and lower benefit from the clean energy investments in the quarter. We currently project an effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, of 36.8% to 37.8% for the full year 2016 versus 35.2% to 36.2% provided on April 19, 2016. The increase since April is driven by the expectation of continued earnings concentration in higher-tax-rate jurisdictions and lower benefit from the clean energy investments.
Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow in the quarter. Operating cash flow was $173 million versus $213 million in 2015 as a result of lower earnings. We used the cash generated during the quarter, along with borrowings, to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. We bought back 1,033,000 shares of stock for $241 million in the second quarter. Grainger returned a total of $315 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $75 million in dividends, reflecting the 4% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2016.
Capital expenditures were $54 million in the quarter versus $71 million in the second quarter of 2015. We have revised our full year guidance for capital expenditures to $300 million to $325 million from $300 million to $350 million announced in November of 2015.
As reported in our 2016 second quarter earnings release, we revised our 2016 sales and earnings per share guidance. For the full year 2016, we now expect 1% to 4% sales growth and earnings per share of $11.20 to $12.20.
Let's look more closely at our current expectations. We'll begin with sales. For the full year, the midpoint of guidance is now 2.5% growth, reflecting lower-than-expected volume in the United States and Canada. We now expect foreign exchange to have no net impact on sales for the full year due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen. As a reminder, we anniversaried the Cromwell acquisition at the beginning of September.
Moving on to gross profit margins. For the full year, we still expect gross profit margins be -- to be down 130 to 150 basis points versus 2015. Gross profit margins for the third quarter are forecasted to be down 100 to 140 basis points versus the prior year. Let's take a closer look at operating margin expectations: For the full year, we now expect operating margin compression of 60 to 130 basis points. The midpoint of operating margin guidance remains unchanged, as gross profit improvements over April guidance offset expense deleveraging on lower sales. The full year guidance implies modest improvement in the second half of the year versus previous guidance. This is due to continued strong expense management and better-than-expected gross profit margin in the United States. So for the third quarter, we expect operating margins to be down 80 to 170 basis points versus the prior year.
Next, other income and expense. We issued $400 million of new debt in mid-May, so there was about 0.5 quarter's worth of increased interest expense in the second quarter. The third and fourth quarters will contain the full 3 months of the higher interest expense.
Finally, earnings per share. As noted, we revised our guidance and we now expect earnings per share of $11.20 to $12.20. We now expect a $0.07 per share benefit to earnings per share in 2016 from the 2 clean energy investments compared to the prior projection of $0.15 per share benefit on April 18, 2016. Please see Exhibit 4 for more detail. The earnings per share guidance includes the projected tax rate of 36.8% to 37.8% for 2016, reflecting a higher proportion of earnings from higher-tax jurisdictions.
Finally, please mark your calendar for the following important dates. On August 11, we plan to release July sales. And we will host our annual Analyst Meeting on the morning of Friday, November 11, which will be held at our headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois.

Today, we reported results for the 2016 third quarter and updated our sales and earnings per share guidance for the full year to reflect our performance to date and the challenging industrial economy. 
Before we begin our review of results, I'd like to remind you of the adjustments to reported results in the third quarters of 2016 and 2015. In general, we adjust the reported results to exclude any items that are unrelated to the ongoing operations of the business. We believe this gives investors a better view of our core operational performance. Tables reconciling reported to adjusted results and other non-GAAP measures accompany today's earnings release and the transcript of this podcast, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website.
The 2016 third quarter included restructuring charges in the U.S. and Canadian segments. In both countries, we are closing branches and reducing headcount to proactively address changes in customer-buying behavior and better position the business for profitable growth. These actions had a net charge of $0.01 to earnings per share. In 2015, we took restructuring actions that resulted in net charges of $0.11 per share. All figures from this point forward represent adjusted amounts unless specifically noted.
With that as a backdrop, let's look at our results for the 2016 third quarter. 
Company sales for the quarter increased 3% versus the 2015 third quarter. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales were flat. There were 64 selling days in both quarters. Operating earnings decreased 5%, and net earnings decreased 6%. Earnings per share was $3.06, up 1% versus the prior year.
Bill will cover our revised guidance in detail at the end of this podcast. 
We now expect 2016 sales growth of 1.5% to 2.5% and earnings per share of $11.40 to $11.70. Our 2016 guidance issued on July 19, 2016, was 1% to 4% sales growth and earnings per share of $11.20 to $12.20.
Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail. 
Gross profit margins in the third quarter decreased 180 basis points to 40.1% versus 41.9% in 2015, due primarily to unfavorable customer mix and modest negative price-cost mix in the United States and price deflation versus product cost inflation in Canada.
Operating expenses for the company were essentially flat. We attained positive expense leverage, as operating expenses as a percent of sales were 27.3%, down 80 basis points versus the prior year. The third quarter benefited from operating expense favorability from the timing of certain professional expenses and other program-related expenses.
Total company operating earnings were $332 million, a decrease of 5% versus the prior year. Company operating margin for the quarter was 12.8%, a decline of 110 basis points versus the 2015 quarter.
Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and [ph] the month of September; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2016 guidance.
Before we begin our sales discussion, please note that some of our businesses have a different number of selling days due to local holidays. Despite this, we use the number of selling days in the United States as a basis for our calculation of daily sales. 
As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 3%. Daily sales performance by month was as follows: up 3% in July; up 4% in August; and flat in September. Excluding the Cromwell acquisition in the first 2 months of the quarter, sales performance by month was down 1% in July, up 1% in August and flat in September. Results for the quarter included 2 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition, which we anniversaried on September 1, and 1 percentage point contribution from foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales were flat, consisting of a 1 percentage point contribution from sales of seasonal products, offset by a 1 percentage point decline in price.
Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 business segments: the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations are reported under Other Businesses. 
Sales in the United States, which accounted for 74% of total company revenue in the quarter, decreased 1%. Results for the quarter included a 1 percentage point decline from volume and a 1 percentage point decline from price, partially offset by 1 percentage point from intercompany sales, primarily to Zorro.
Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. 
Government and Retail were up in the mid-single digits. Light Manufacturing was up in the low single digits. Commercial was flat. Heavy Manufacturing and contractor were down in the mid-single digits. Reseller was down in the low double digits. And Natural Resources was down in the midteens.
We believe that growth in the Government and Retail end markets was primarily a function of share gain as we outperformed our estimated growth of the market.
Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. 
Sales in Canada represented 7% of total company revenues. Sales for the quarter decreased 16% in U.S. dollars and local currency, consisting of a 15 percentage point decline in volume and a 1 percentage point decline in price.
All end markets in Canada were down for the quarter. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down 22% compared to all other provinces, which were down 12% in aggregate. In addition to a challenging economy, we are aggressively working through process standardization and change management related to the new IT system, and expect improvement in the coming months.
Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses, which represented 19% of total company sales. 
Sales for the Other Businesses increased 36%, consisting of 16 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition, 15 percentage points from volume and price, and 5 percentage points from foreign exchange. The organic sales increase was primarily due to growth from the single channel online businesses of Zoro U.S. and MonotaRO. 
[ph] Early in the quarter, we reported sales results for July and August and shared some information regarding performance in those months. 
Let's now take a look at September. There were 21 selling days in September of 2016, the same as 2015. Company sales were essentially flat in September versus the prior year. The sales performance consisted of 1 percentage point from volume, offset by a 1 percentage point decline in price. In the United States, [ph] September daily sales were flat, driven by a 1 percentage point from intercompany sales, primarily to Zoro, offset by a 1 percentage point decline from price.  
September customer end market performance in the United States was as follows. Government and Retail were up in the low single digits. Light Manufacturing was flat. Commercial and Heavy Manufacturing were down in the low single digits. Contractor was down in the mid-single digits. And Natural Resources and reseller were down in the low double digits. 
The benefit often seen from Federal Government customers at the September fiscal year-end appears to have been realized a month early, as we saw strong growth to that end market in August. In addition, the strong sales of seasonal products that benefited August did not continue into September.
Sales in Canada for September were down 14% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency. The 15% decrease was driven by a 15 percentage point decline in volume. All end markets except Light Manufacturing were negative.
From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down 22% compared to all other provinces, which were down 13% in aggregate. As mentioned in the quarter recap, we are aggressively working through process standardization and change management related to the new IT system.
Sales for our Other Businesses increased 17% in September, consisting of 14 percentage points from volume and price and 3 percentage points from foreign exchange. September was the first month where Cromwell sales were already included in the base results. The organic sales increase was primarily due to strong revenue growth from Zoro U.S., MonotaRO in Japan and the business in Mexico.
Sales growth in the month of October to date is slightly below the sales performance in September. Multiple branches in the Southeast and the distribution center in Jacksonville, Florida were closed earlier this month due to hurricane Matthew[ph] . We believe there may be an effect on October sales, but it is too early to quantify that impact or any possible cleanup benefit. 
Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman."

Let's talk about performance by reportable segment since we have already analyzed company operating performance. As a reminder, all figures below represent results adjusted for restructuring charges that Laura discussed earlier. 
In the United States, operating earnings decreased 6% in the quarter, driven by lower sales and lower gross profit margins. Gross profit margins for the quarter declined 130 basis points, primarily driven by negative customer selling mix and price deflation exceeding product cost deflation. Operating expenses were down 2% due to lower payroll and benefits costs. The operating margin for the U.S. segment was 17.2% versus 18.1% in the 2015 quarter.
Let's move on to our business in Canada, which had an operating loss of $11 million in the quarter versus operating earnings of $5 million in the 2015 third quarter, primarily driven by lower sales and lower gross profit.
The gross profit margin in Canada declined 520 basis points versus the prior year, driven by product cost inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange from products sourced from the United States. Due to service gaps stemming from the systems transition, we have not passed on price increases to customers this year, and this is putting pressure on our gross profit margins. 
Operating expenses were down 9% versus the 2015 quarter, driven by lower SAP costs and lower headcount. The new IT system continues to be a change management challenge for this business. However, we are making progress in areas, such as direct-to-customer shipping, which has already increased each quarter for the year. In the third quarter, 38% of shipments went direct to the customer, bypassing the branch network.
We will provide more detail about the Canadian business at our Analyst Meeting in November.
Operating earnings for the Other Businesses were $25 million in the 2016 third quarter versus $15 million in the prior year, representing an earnings increase of 68%. Results included strong performance from Zoro U.S. and Japan and the earnings contribution from Cromwell.
Below the operating line, other income and expense was a net $29 million expense in the 2016 third quarter versus a net $21 million expense in the 2015 third quarter. The increase was driven by a higher interest expense from the company's $400 million debt offering in May of 2016. Operating losses from the clean energy investments were higher as a result of higher demand from a warm summer, resulting in a higher overall benefit to company net of tax credits. 
For the quarter, the reported effective tax rate in 2016 was 34% versus 38.4% in 2015. The year-over-year decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to a higher benefit from the company's clean energy investments, partially offset by a larger proportion of earnings from higher tax rate jurisdictions. The 2016 third quarter also included a benefit from the conclusion of the federal income tax audit for the years 2009 through 2012 and other discrete items.
Excluding the discrete items, the company's effective tax rate was 36.1%. We currently project an effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, of 36.1% to 37.1% for the full year 2016 versus 36.8% to 37.8% provided on July 19, 2016. This decrease is driven by the expectation of higher benefit from the clean energy investments, partially offset by a larger proportion of earnings from higher tax rate jurisdictions.
Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. 
Operating cash flow was $344 million versus $366 million in 2015, primarily the result of lower net income. We used the cash generated during the quarter and proceeds from the May 2016 debt offering to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. We returned a total of $275 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $74 million in dividends, reflecting the 4% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2016. In addition, we bought back 887,000 shares of stock for $201 million in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $108 million in the quarter versus $82 million in the third quarter of 2015.
As reported in our 2016 third quarter earnings release, we updated our 2016 guidance. For the full year 2016, we now expect 1.5% to 2.5% sales growth and earnings per share of $11.40 to $11.70.
Let's look more closely at our current expectations. 
We'll begin with sales. For the full year, our guidance is lower to reflect year-to-date performance and the expectation of continued modest sales growth in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we will have 63 selling days in the 2016 fourth quarter, 1 fewer than the 64 selling days in the 2015 fourth quarter.
Moving on to gross profit margins. For the full year, we expect gross profit margins to be down 170 to 180 basis points. We continued to see gross profit pressure due to unfavorable price cost spread for the businesses in the United States and Canada, along with faster growth with the lower margin single channel businesses. We expect gross margin pressure to continue into the fourth quarter.
Let's take a closer look at operating margin expectations. 
For the full year, we now anticipate operating margin of 12.3% to 12.5%, down 100 to 120 basis points. For the fourth quarter, we expect operating expenses to increase as a percentage of sales versus the 2016 third quarter, reflecting the following: number 1, the loss of a selling day; 2, 3 months of depreciation for the new distribution center in New Jersey versus 2 months in the 2016 third quarter; 3, the hiring of 30 new inside sales representatives in the fourth quarter to call on medium-sized customers given the success of the 275 inside sales reps added in the 2016 second quarter; and fourth, the operating expense favorability in the 2016 third quarter related to the timing of program-related expenses and professional services that are not expected to repeat in the 2016 fourth quarter.
Finally, earnings per share. As noted earlier, we expect 2016 EPS of $11.40 to $11.70. For the full year, we now expect a $0.10 benefit to earnings per share in 2016 from the 2 clean energy investments compared to our prior projection of a $0.07 benefit on July 19, 2016. Through the first 9 months of the year, we have realized $0.06 per share of benefit from the investments. Please see Exhibit 4 for more detail.
Finally, please mark your calendar for the following important dates. We will host our Annual Analyst Meeting on the morning of Friday, November 11, which will be held at our headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois. We also plan to release October sales on November 11. On Tuesday, November 15, we will participate in the Barclays Select Series Industrial Distribution Forum in New York, New York.

This podcast supplements our 2016 third quarter earnings release issued today, October 18, and other information available on our Investor Relations website. 
This material contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current view of the competitive market and the overall environment. Future risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please see our SEC filings, including our most recent periodic reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, which are available on our Investor Relations website for a discussion of factors that may affect our forward-looking statements.
Today, we reported results for the 2016 third quarter and updated our sales and earnings per share guidance for the full year to reflect our performance to date and the challenging industrial economy. 
Before we begin our review of results, I'd like to remind you of the adjustments to reported results in the third quarters of 2016 and 2015. In general, we adjust the reported results to exclude any items that are unrelated to the ongoing operations of the business. We believe this gives investors a better view of our core operational performance. Tables reconciling reported to adjusted results and other non-GAAP measures accompany today's earnings release and the transcript of this podcast, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website.
The 2016 third quarter included restructuring charges in the U.S. and Canadian segments. In both countries, we are closing branches and reducing headcount to proactively address changes in customer-buying behavior and better position the business for profitable growth. These actions had a net charge of $0.01 to earnings per share. In 2015, we took restructuring actions that resulted in net charges of $0.11 per share. All figures from this point forward represent adjusted amounts unless specifically noted.
With that as a backdrop, let's look at our results for the 2016 third quarter. 
Company sales for the quarter increased 3% versus the 2015 third quarter. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales were flat. There were 64 selling days in both quarters. Operating earnings decreased 5%, and net earnings decreased 6%. Earnings per share was $3.06, up 1% versus the prior year.
Bill will cover our revised guidance in detail at the end of this podcast. 
We now expect 2016 sales growth of 1.5% to 2.5% and earnings per share of $11.40 to $11.70. Our 2016 guidance issued on July 19, 2016, was 1% to 4% sales growth and earnings per share of $11.20 to $12.20.
Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail. 
Gross profit margins in the third quarter decreased 180 basis points to 40.1% versus 41.9% in 2015, due primarily to unfavorable customer mix and modest negative price-cost mix in the United States and price deflation versus product cost inflation in Canada.
Operating expenses for the company were essentially flat. We attained positive expense leverage, as operating expenses as a percent of sales were 27.3%, down 80 basis points versus the prior year. The third quarter benefited from operating expense favorability from the timing of certain professional expenses and other program-related expenses.
Total company operating earnings were $332 million, a decrease of 5% versus the prior year. Company operating margin for the quarter was 12.8%, a decline of 110 basis points versus the 2015 quarter.
Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and [ph] the month of September; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2016 guidance.
Before we begin our sales discussion, please note that some of our businesses have a different number of selling days due to local holidays. Despite this, we use the number of selling days in the United States as a basis for our calculation of daily sales. 
As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 3%. Daily sales performance by month was as follows: up 3% in July; up 4% in August; and flat in September. Excluding the Cromwell acquisition in the first 2 months of the quarter, sales performance by month was down 1% in July, up 1% in August and flat in September. Results for the quarter included 2 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition, which we anniversaried on September 1, and 1 percentage point contribution from foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales were flat, consisting of a 1 percentage point contribution from sales of seasonal products, offset by a 1 percentage point decline in price.
Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 business segments: the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations are reported under Other Businesses. 
Sales in the United States, which accounted for 74% of total company revenue in the quarter, decreased 1%. Results for the quarter included a 1 percentage point decline from volume and a 1 percentage point decline from price, partially offset by 1 percentage point from intercompany sales, primarily to Zorro.
Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. 
Government and Retail were up in the mid-single digits. Light Manufacturing was up in the low single digits. Commercial was flat. Heavy Manufacturing and contractor were down in the mid-single digits. Reseller was down in the low double digits. And Natural Resources was down in the midteens.
We believe that growth in the Government and Retail end markets was primarily a function of share gain as we outperformed our estimated growth of the market.
Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. 
Sales in Canada represented 7% of total company revenues. Sales for the quarter decreased 16% in U.S. dollars and local currency, consisting of a 15 percentage point decline in volume and a 1 percentage point decline in price.
All end markets in Canada were down for the quarter. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down 22% compared to all other provinces, which were down 12% in aggregate. In addition to a challenging economy, we are aggressively working through process standardization and change management related to the new IT system, and expect improvement in the coming months.
Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses, which represented 19% of total company sales. 
Sales for the Other Businesses increased 36%, consisting of 16 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition, 15 percentage points from volume and price, and 5 percentage points from foreign exchange.

Results for the quarter included 2 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition, which we anniversaried on September 1, and 1 percentage point contribution from foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales were flat, consisting of a 1 percentage point contribution from sales of seasonal products, offset by a 1 percentage point decline in price.
Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 business segments: the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations are reported under Other Businesses. 
Sales in the United States, which accounted for 74% of total company revenue in the quarter, decreased 1%. Results for the quarter included a 1 percentage point decline from volume and a 1 percentage point decline from price, partially offset by 1 percentage point from intercompany sales, primarily to Zoro.
Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. 
Government and Retail were up in the mid-single digits. Light Manufacturing was up in the low single digits. Commercial was flat. Heavy Manufacturing and contractor were down in the mid-single digits. Reseller was down in the low double digits. And Natural Resources was down in the midteens.
We believe that growth in the Government and Retail end markets was primarily a function of share gain as we outperformed our estimated growth of the market.
Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. 
Sales in Canada represented 7% of total company revenues. Sales for the quarter decreased 16% in U.S. dollars and local currency, consisting of a 15 percentage point decline in volume and a 1 percentage point decline in price.
All end markets in Canada were down for the quarter. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down 22% compared to all other provinces, which were down 12% in aggregate. In addition to a challenging economy, we are aggressively working through process standardization and change management related to the new IT system, and expect improvement in the coming months.
Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses, which represented 19% of total company sales. 
Sales for the Other Businesses increased 36%, consisting of 16 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition, 15 percentage points from volume and price, and 5 percentage points from foreign exchange. The organic sales increase was primarily due to growth from the single channel online businesses of Zoro U.S. and MonotaRO. 
Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for July and August and shared some information regarding performance in those months. 
Let's now take a look at September. There were 21 selling days in September of 2016, the same as 2015. Company sales were essentially flat in September versus the prior year. The sales performance consisted of 1 percentage point from volume, offset by a 1 percentage point decline in price. In the United States, September daily sales were flat, driven by a 1 percentage point from intercompany sales, primarily to Zoro, offset by a 1 percentage point decline from price.  
September customer end market performance in the United States was as follows. Government and Retail were up in the low single digits. Light Manufacturing was flat. Commercial and Heavy Manufacturing were down in the low single digits. Contractor was down in the mid-single digits. And Natural Resources and Reseller were down in the low double digits. 
The benefit often seen from Federal Government customers at the September fiscal year-end appears to have been realized a month early, as we saw strong growth to that end market in August. In addition, the strong sales of seasonal products that benefited August did not continue into September.
Sales in Canada for September were down 14% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency. The 15% decrease was driven by a 15 percentage point decline in volume. All end markets except Light Manufacturing were negative.
From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down 22% compared to all other provinces, which were down 13% in aggregate. As mentioned in the quarter recap, we are aggressively working through process standardization and change management related to the new IT system.
Sales for our Other Businesses increased 17% in September, consisting of 14 percentage points from volume and price and 3 percentage points from foreign exchange. September was the first month where Cromwell sales were already included in the base results. The organic sales increase was primarily due to strong revenue growth from Zoro U.S., MonotaRO in Japan and the business in Mexico.
Sales growth in the month of October to date is slightly below the sales performance in September. Multiple branches in the Southeast and the distribution center in Jacksonville, Florida were closed earlier this month due to Hurricane Matthew. We believe there may be an effect on October sales, but it is too early to quantify that impact or any possible cleanup benefit. 
Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman."

Let's talk about performance by reportable segment since we have already analyzed company operating performance. As a reminder, all figures below represent results adjusted for restructuring charges that Laura discussed earlier. 
In the United States, operating earnings decreased 6% in the quarter, driven by lower sales and lower gross profit margins. Gross profit margins for the quarter declined 130 basis points, primarily driven by negative customer selling mix and price deflation exceeding product cost deflation. Operating expenses were down 2% due to lower payroll and benefits costs. The operating margin for the U.S. segment was 17.2% versus 18.1% in the 2015 quarter.
Let's move on to our business in Canada, which had an operating loss of $11 million in the quarter versus operating earnings of $5 million in the 2015 third quarter, primarily driven by lower sales and lower gross profit.
The gross profit margin in Canada declined 520 basis points versus the prior year, driven by product cost inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange from products sourced from the United States. Due to service gaps stemming from the systems transition, we have not passed on price increases to customers this year, and this is putting pressure on our gross profit margins. 
Operating expenses were down 9% versus the 2015 quarter, driven by lower SAP costs and lower headcount. The new IT system continues to be a change management challenge for this business. However, we are making progress in areas such as direct-to-customer shipping, which has already increased each quarter for the year. In the third quarter, 38% of shipments went direct to the customer, bypassing the branch network.
We will provide more detail about the Canadian business at our Analyst Meeting in November.
Operating earnings for the Other Businesses were $25 million in the 2016 third quarter versus $15 million in the prior year, representing an earnings increase of 68%. Results included strong performance from Zoro U.S. and Japan and the earnings contribution from Cromwell.
Below the operating line, other income and expense was a net $29 million expense in the 2016 third quarter versus a net $21 million expense in the 2015 third quarter. The increase was driven by higher interest expense from the company's $400 million debt offering in May of 2016. Operating losses from the clean energy investments were higher as a result of higher demand from a warm summer, resulting in a higher overall benefit to company net of tax credits. 
For the quarter, the reported effective tax rate in 2016 was 34% versus 38.4% in 2015. The year-over-year decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to a higher benefit from the company's clean energy investments, partially offset by a larger proportion of earnings from higher tax rate jurisdictions. The 2016 third quarter also included a benefit from the conclusion of the federal income tax audit for the years 2009 through 2012 and other discrete items.
Excluding the discrete items, the company's effective tax rate was 36.1%. We currently project an effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, of 36.1% to 37.1% for the full year 2016 versus 36.8% to 37.8% provided on July 19, 2016. This decrease is driven by the expectation of higher benefit from the clean energy investments, partially offset by a larger proportion of earnings from higher tax rate jurisdictions.
Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. 
Operating cash flow was $344 million versus $366 million in 2015, primarily the result of lower net income. We used the cash generated during the quarter and proceeds from the May 2016 debt offering to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. We returned a total of $275 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $74 million in dividends, reflecting the 4% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2016. In addition, we bought back 887,000 shares of stock for $201 million in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $108 million in the quarter versus $82 million in the third quarter of 2015.
As reported in our 2016 third quarter earnings release, we updated our 2016 guidance. For the full year 2016, we now expect 1.5% to 2.5% sales growth and earnings per share of $11.40 to $11.70.
Let's look more closely at our current expectations. 
We'll begin with sales. For the full year, our guidance is lower to reflect year-to-date performance and the expectation of continued modest sales growth in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we will have 63 selling days in the 2016 fourth quarter, 1 fewer than the 64 selling days in the 2015 fourth quarter.
Moving on to gross profit margins. For the full year, we expect gross profit margins to be down 170 to 180 basis points. We continue to see gross profit pressure due to unfavorable price-cost spread for the businesses in the United States and Canada, along with faster growth with the lower-margin single channel businesses. We expect gross margin pressure to continue into the fourth quarter.
Let's take a closer look at operating margin expectations. 
For the full year, we now anticipate operating margin of 12.3% to 12.5%, down 100 to 120 basis points. For the fourth quarter, we expect operating expenses to increase as a percentage of sales versus the 2016 third quarter, reflecting the following: number one, the loss of a selling day; two, 3 months of depreciation for the new distribution center in New Jersey versus 2 months in the 2016 third quarter; three, the hiring of 30 new inside sales representatives in the fourth quarter to call on medium-sized customers given the success of the 275 inside sales reps added in the 2016 second quarter; and fourth, the operating expense favorability in the 2016 third quarter related to the timing of program-related expenses and professional services that are not expected to repeat in the 2016 fourth quarter.
Finally, earnings per share. As noted earlier, we expect 2016 EPS of $11.40 to $11.70. For the full year, we now expect a $0.10 benefit to earnings per share in 2016 from the 2 clean energy investments compared to our prior projection of a $0.07 benefit on July 19, 2016. Through the first 9 months of the year, we have realized $0.06 per share of benefit from the investments. Please see Exhibit 4 for more detail.
Finally, please mark your calendar for the following important dates. We will host our Annual Analyst Meeting on the morning of Friday, November 11, which will be held at our headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois. We also plan to release October sales on November 11. On Tuesday, November 15, we will participate in the Barclays Select Series Industrial Distribution Forum in New York, New York.

With me is Bill Chapman, Senior Director of Investor Relations. The purpose of this podcast is to provide you with additional information regarding Grainger's 2016 third quarter results. This podcast supplements our 2016 third quarter earnings release issued today, October 18, and other information available on our Investor Relations website. 
This material contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current view of the competitive market and the overall environment. Future risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please see our SEC filings, including our most recent periodic reports filed on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, which are available on our Investor Relations website for a discussion of factors that may affect our forward-looking statements.
Today, we reported results for the 2016 third quarter and updated our sales and earnings per share guidance for the full year to reflect our performance to date and the challenging industrial economy. 
Before we begin our review of results, I'd like to remind you of the adjustments to reported results in the third quarters of 2016 and 2015. In general, we adjust the reported results to exclude any items that are unrelated to the ongoing operations of the business. We believe this gives investors a better view of our core operational performance. Tables reconciling reported to adjusted results and other non-GAAP measures accompany today's earnings release and the transcript of this podcast, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website.
The 2016 third quarter included restructuring charges in the U.S. and Canadian segments. In both countries, we are closing branches and reducing headcount to proactively address changes in customer-buying behavior and better position the business for profitable growth. These actions had a net charge of $0.01 to earnings per share. In 2015, we took restructuring actions that resulted in net charges of $0.11 per share. All figures from this point forward represent adjusted amounts unless specifically noted.
With that as a backdrop, let's look at our results for the 2016 third quarter. Company sales for the quarter increased 3% versus the 2015 third quarter. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales were flat. There were 64 selling days in both quarters. Operating earnings decreased 5%, and net earnings decreased 6%. Earnings per share was $3.06, up 1% versus the prior year.
Bill will cover our revised guidance in detail at the end of this podcast. We now expect 2016 sales growth of 1.5% to 2.5% and earnings per share of $11.40 to $11.70. Our 2016 guidance issued on July 19, 2016, was 1% to 4% sales growth and earnings per share of $11.20 to $12.20.
Let's now walk down the operating section of the income statement in more detail. Gross profit margins in the third quarter decreased 180 basis points to 40.1% versus 41.9% in 2015, due primarily to unfavorable customer mix and modest negative price-cost mix in the United States and price deflation versus product cost inflation in Canada.
Operating expenses for the company were essentially flat. We attained positive expense leverage, as operating expenses as a percent of sales were 27.3%, down 80 basis points versus the prior year. The third quarter benefited from operating expense favorability from the timing of certain professional expenses and other program-related expenses.
Total company operating earnings were $332 million, a decrease of 5% versus the prior year. Company operating margin for the quarter was 12.8%, a decline of 110 basis points versus the 2015 quarter.
Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of September; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2016 guidance.
Before we begin our sales discussion, please note that some of our businesses have a different number of selling days due to local holidays. Despite this, we use the number of selling days in the United States as a basis for our calculation of daily sales. 
As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 3%. Daily sales performance by month was as follows: up 3% in July; up 4% in August; and flat in September. Excluding the Cromwell acquisition in the first 2 months of the quarter, sales performance by month was down 1% in July, up 1% in August and flat in September. Results for the quarter included 2 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition, which we anniversary-ed on September 1, and 1 percentage point contribution from foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales were flat, consisting of a 1 percentage point contribution from sales of seasonal products, offset by a 1 percentage point decline in price.

Gross profit margins in the third quarter decreased 180 basis points to 40.1% versus 41.9% in 2015, due primarily to unfavorable customer mix and modest negative price-cost mix in the United States and price deflation versus product cost inflation in Canada.
Operating expenses for the company were essentially flat. We attained positive expense leverage, as operating expenses as a percent of sales were 27.3%, down 80 basis points versus the prior year. The third quarter benefited from operating expense favorability from the timing of certain professional expenses and other program-related expenses.
Total company operating earnings were $332 million, a decrease of 5% versus the prior year. Company operating margin for the quarter was 12.8%, a decline of 110 basis points versus the 2015 quarter.
Let's now focus on performance drivers during the quarter. In doing so, we'll cover the following topics: first, sales by segment in the quarter and the month of September; second, operating performance by segment; third, cash generation and capital deployment; and finally, we'll wrap up with a discussion of our 2016 guidance.
Before we begin our sales discussion, please note that some of our businesses have a different number of selling days due to local holidays. Despite this, we use the number of selling days in the United States as a basis for our calculation of daily sales. 
As mentioned earlier, company sales for the quarter increased 3%. Daily sales performance by month was as follows: up 3% in July; up 4% in August; and flat in September. Excluding the Cromwell acquisition in the first 2 months of the quarter, sales performance by month was down 1% in July, up 1% in August and flat in September. Results for the quarter included 2 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition, which we anniversary-ed on September 1, and 1 percentage point contribution from foreign exchange. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales were flat, consisting of a 1 percentage point contribution from sales of seasonal products, offset by a 1 percentage point decline in price.
Let's move on to sales by segment. We report 2 business segments: the United States and Canada. Our remaining operations are reported under Other Businesses. 
Sales in the United States, which accounted for 74% of total company revenue in the quarter, decreased 1%. Results for the quarter included a 1 percentage point decline from volume and a 1 percentage point decline from price, partially offset by 1 percentage point from intercompany sales, primarily to Zoro.
Let's review sales performance by customer end market in the United States. Government and Retail were up in the mid-single digits. Light Manufacturing was up in the low single digits. Commercial was flat. Heavy Manufacturing and contractor were down in the mid-single digits. Reseller was down in the low double digits. And Natural Resources was down in the mid-teens.
We believe that growth in the Government and Retail end markets was primarily a function of share gain as we outperformed our estimated growth of the market.
Now let's turn our attention to the Canadian business. Sales in Canada represented 7% of total company revenues. Sales for the quarter decreased 16% in U.S. dollars and local currency, consisting of a 15 percentage point decline in volume and a 1 percentage point decline in price.
All end markets in Canada were down for the quarter. From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down 22% compared to all other provinces, which were down 12% in aggregate. In addition to a challenging economy, we are aggressively working through process standardization and change management related to the new IT system, and expect improvement in the coming months.
Let's conclude our discussion of sales for the quarter by looking at the Other Businesses, which represented 19% of total company sales. Sales for the Other Businesses increased 36%, consisting of 16 percentage points from the Cromwell acquisition, 15 percentage points from volume and price, and 5 percentage points from foreign exchange. The organic sales increase was primarily due to growth from the single channel online businesses of Zoro U.S. and MonotaRO. 
Earlier in the quarter, we reported sales results for July and August and shared some information regarding performance in those months. Let's now take a look at September. There were 21 selling days in September of 2016, the same as 2015. Company sales were essentially flat in September versus the prior year. The sales performance consisted of 1 percentage point from volume, offset by a 1 percentage point decline in price. In the United States, September daily sales were flat, driven by a 1 percentage point from intercompany sales, primarily to Zoro, offset by a 1 percentage point decline from price.  
September customer end-market performance in the United States was as follows. Government and Retail were up in the low single digits. Light Manufacturing was flat. Commercial and Heavy Manufacturing were down in the low single digits. Contractor was down in the mid-single digits. And Natural Resources and Reseller were down in the low double digits. 
The benefit often seen from Federal Government customers at the September fiscal year-end appears to have been realized a month early, as we saw strong growth to that end market in August. In addition, the strong sales of seasonal products that benefited August did not continue into September.
Sales in Canada for September were down 14% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currency. The 15% decrease was driven by a 15 percentage point decline in volume. All end markets except Light Manufacturing were negative.
From a geographic standpoint, sales in Alberta were down 22% compared to all other provinces, which were down 13% in aggregate. As mentioned in the quarter recap, we are aggressively working through process standardization and change management related to the new IT system.
Sales for our Other Businesses increased 17% in September, consisting of 14 percentage points from volume and price and 3 percentage points from foreign exchange. September was the first month where Cromwell sales were already included in the base results. The organic sales increase was primarily due to strong revenue growth from Zoro U.S., MonotaRO in Japan and the business in Mexico.
Sales growth in the month of October to date is slightly below the sales performance in September. Multiple branches in the Southeast and the distribution center in Jacksonville, Florida were closed earlier this month due to Hurricane Matthew. We believe there may be an effect on October sales, but it is too early to quantify that impact or any possible cleanup benefit. 
Now I would like to turn the discussion over to Bill Chapman."

Let's talk about performance by reportable segment since we have already analyzed company operating performance. As a reminder, all figures below represent results adjusted for restructuring charges that Laura discussed earlier. 
In the United States, operating earnings decreased 6% in the quarter, driven by lower sales and lower gross profit margins. Gross profit margins for the quarter declined 130 basis points, primarily driven by negative customer selling mix and price deflation exceeding product cost deflation. Operating expenses were down 2% due to lower payroll and benefits costs. The operating margin for the U.S. segment was 17.2% versus 18.1% in the 2015 quarter.
Let's move on to our business in Canada, which had an operating loss of $11 million in the quarter versus operating earnings of $5 million in the 2015 third quarter, primarily driven by lower sales and lower gross profit.
The gross profit margin in Canada declined 520 basis points versus the prior year, driven by product cost inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange from products sourced from the United States. Due to service gaps stemming from the systems transition, we have not passed on price increases to customers this year, and this is putting pressure on our gross profit margins. 
Operating expenses were down 9% versus the 2015 quarter, driven by lower SAP costs and lower headcount. The new IT system continues to be a change management challenge for this business. However, we are making progress in areas such as direct-to-customer shipping, which has already increased each quarter for the year. In the third quarter, 38% of shipments went direct to the customer, bypassing the branch network.
We will provide more detail about the Canadian business at our Analyst Meeting in November.
Operating earnings for the Other Businesses were $25 million in the 2016 third quarter versus $15 million in the prior year, representing an earnings increase of 68%. Results included strong performance from Zoro U.S. and Japan and the earnings contribution from Cromwell.
Below the operating line, other income and expense was a net $29 million expense in the 2016 third quarter versus a net $21 million expense in the 2015 third quarter. The increase was driven by higher interest expense from the company's $400 million debt offering in May of 2016. Operating losses from the clean energy investments were higher as a result of higher demand from a warm summer, resulting in a higher overall benefit to the company net of tax credits. 
For the quarter, the reported effective tax rate in 2016 was 34% versus 38.4% in 2015. The year-over-year decrease in the tax rate was primarily due to a higher benefit from the company's clean energy investments, partially offset by a larger proportion of earnings from higher tax rate jurisdictions. The 2016 third quarter also included a benefit from the conclusion of the federal income tax audit for the years 2009 through 2012 and other discrete items. Excluding the discrete items, the company's effective tax rate was 36.1%. 
We currently project an effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, of 36.1% to 37.1% for the full year 2016 versus 36.8% to 37.8% provided on July 19, 2016. This decrease is driven by the expectation of higher benefit from the clean energy investments, partially offset by a larger proportion of earnings from higher tax rate jurisdictions.
Lastly, let's take a look at cash flow for the quarter. Operating cash flow was $344 million versus $366 million in 2015, primarily the result of lower net income. We used the cash generated during the quarter and proceeds from the May 2016 debt offering to invest in the business and return cash to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends. We returned a total of $275 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $74 million in dividends, reflecting the 4% increase in the quarterly dividend announced in April of 2016. In addition, we bought back 887,000 shares of stock for $201 million in the third quarter. Capital expenditures were $108 million in the quarter versus $82 million in the third quarter of 2015.
As reported in our 2016 third quarter earnings release, we updated our 2016 guidance. For the full year 2016, we now expect 1.5% to 2.5% sales growth and earnings per share of $11.40 to $11.70.
Let's look more closely at our current expectations. We'll begin with sales. For the full year, our guidance is lower to reflect year-to-date performance and the expectation of continued modest sales growth in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we will have 63 selling days in the 2016 fourth quarter, 1 fewer than the 64 selling days in the 2015 fourth quarter.
Moving on to gross profit margins. For the full year, we expect gross profit margins to be down 170 to 180 basis points. We continue to see gross profit pressure due to unfavorable price-cost spread for the businesses in the United States and Canada, along with faster growth with the lower-margin single channel businesses. We expect gross margin pressure to continue into the fourth quarter.
Let's take a closer look at operating margin expectations. For the full year, we now anticipate operating margin of 12.3% to 12.5%, down 100 to 120 basis points. For the fourth quarter, we expect operating expenses to increase as a percentage of sales versus the 2016 third quarter, reflecting the following: number one, the loss of a selling day; two, 3 months of depreciation for the new distribution center in New Jersey versus 2 months in the 2016 third quarter; three, the hiring of 30 new inside sales representatives in the fourth quarter to call on medium-sized customers given the success of the 275 inside sales reps added in the 2016 second quarter; and fourth, the operating expense favorability in the 2016 third quarter related to the timing of program-related expenses and professional services that are not expected to repeat in the 2016 fourth quarter.
Finally, earnings per share. As noted earlier, we expect 2016 EPS of $11.40 to $11.70. For the full year, we now expect a $0.10 benefit to earnings per share in 2016 from the 2 clean energy investments compared to our prior projection of a $0.07 benefit on July 19, 2016. Through the first 9 months of the year, we have realized $0.06 per share of benefit from the investments. Please see Exhibit 4 for more detail.
Finally, please mark your calendar for the following important dates. We will host our Annual Analyst Meeting on the morning of Friday, November 11, which will be held at our headquarters in Lake Forest, Illinois. We also plan to release October sales on November 11. On Tuesday, November 15, we will participate in the Barclays Select Series Industrial Distribution Forum in New York, New York.
