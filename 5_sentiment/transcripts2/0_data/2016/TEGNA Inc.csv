This morning, I'm going to provide some highlights on our overall performance in each of our businesses and then I'll be turning it over to our business heads: Dave Lougee, Presi",1467,"Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our call. This morning, I'm going to provide some highlights on our overall performance in each of our businesses and then I'll be turning it over to our business heads: Dave Lougee, President of TEGNA Media; Alex Vetter, CEO of Cars.com; and Matt Fergusons, CEO of CareerBuilder. They'll do a deep dive on each of their respective areas and then Victoria will touch on the financial highlights for the quarter at the end. So let's get right into it.
Our progress in our first 6 months as a highly focused media and digital company has been very strong. When we made the decision to separate our businesses into 2, we had a very specific vision in mind for TEGNA and when we held our Investor Day in June, we were confident in the expectations and projects that we laid out for you. But we know, that for all of you, confidence does not necessarily equate to absolute certainty. But in just 6 short months, we have removed a great deal of those uncertainties, including those around our affiliation agreements and retransmission fees and replaced them with certainties for years to come. We have even more confidence that we have built a strong foundation that will enable us to capitalize on the rapidly growing demand in the industries we serve, a foundation that best leverages our unique mix of advantages, including top-performing assets, scale and partnerships, which give us the tremendous negotiating platform you've seen over the last several months. High margins and consistently strong and dependable cash flows, experienced industry experts running each of our businesses and a shareholder-focused capital structure. Now we've leveraged those strengths to create a strong platform that can and will support our growth throughout 2016 and beyond. 
So let's turn to fourth quarter results. Company-wide, as you saw, our revenue totaled about $805 million. Now there were lots of ins and outs as you probably saw in the press release. TEGNA Media had to overcome a record level of $92 million of political revenue in the fourth quarter last year, which masked otherwise strong results. Double-digit increases in retransmission and online companies and higher core advertising. When you exclude that impact of the unfavorable political spending comparison, TEGNA Media revenues would have been up 12%. 
Now our Digital Segment revenue was impacted by the sale of our PointRoll business, which we completed in November. And as you can see on Page 4 of our press release this morning, we show that excluding PointRoll from both the 2014 and 2015 fourth quarter periods and adjusting for exchange rates, so on a pro forma constant currency basis, Digital Segment revenues were over 2% higher. 
New product launches and revenue growth at Cars.com, higher revenue per dealer at Cars.com was offset by a revenue decline at CareerBuilder as it continues its transition to higher margin software-as-a-service solutions and builds a leadership position in that space. 
As you probably saw, expenses in the quarter were down over 4% on a non-GAAP basis. Now you've heard me say it quarter-after-quarter, but I think it bears repeating, our disciplined and proven approach to managing expenses and ensuring we are optimizing the efficiency of our operations, while investing fully in our future will continue to be an important tenet of our strategy, while we successfully grow our businesses. 
Equally important, EBITDA was strong and our EBITDA margin of 38% was comparable to the fourth quarter last year, despite the absence of substantial higher-margin political spending. 
Another important pillar of our strategy is a commitment to a shareholder-friendly capital allocation structure. As you saw in October, we announced a $75 million increase in our share repurchase programming -- program, bringing it up to $825 million, which will be used over the original 3-year term ending in June of 2018. The increase reflects a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our corporate headquarters, which enabled us to increase the return of cash to our shareholders, while at the same time, strengthening our balance sheet through debt reduction. 
As we've noted before, we have more than ample financial flexibility to pay our dividend, repurchase shares based on business conditions and new opportunities, reduce debt and invest in our businesses. 
Now I'd like to switch gears for a moment and provide you with a handful of highlights on each of our businesses before turning to Dave, Alex and Matt. 
As you saw, TEGNA Media achieved revenues in line with our previous guidance, driven by, as I noted, core advertising revenue growth, double-digital revenue growth and very strong retransmission revenue, due in part to our recently completed agreements. Additionally, I would be remiss not to mention that TEGNA Media was named Station group of the year for 2015 by Broadcasting and Cable based on our outstanding group of local television stations that have fantastic reporting, leading ratings and financial results and an innovated strategic approach. We are very proud of our team and I want to congratulate Dave and his entire team on this well-deserved honor and a very strong year. 
2016 is looking to be even more promising for a number of reasons. First, the outcomes of all of our recent network affiliation agreements and several carriage agreements have been consistently with, and in some cases, exceeded the long-term projections we outlined at our Investor Day in June. Not only are our successful negotiations a testament to the high demand for the engaging content we provide, more importantly, they replace the uncertainty around TEGNA Media that may have existed several months ago with absolute longer-term certainty. 
As you saw in January, we reached an agreement with NBC of which we are the largest independent affiliate group. We are thrilled that we are set to deliver NBC's outstanding content from sports to news to primetime for years to come. 
We also, in the quarter, secured multiyear agreements or continued carriage of TEGNA Media television stations on DirecTV and AT&T Uverse and DISH Network at more appropriately favorable rates. And as you know, this summer, we announced the renewal of our agreements with CBS for 10 TEGNA Media markets nationwide. TEGNA will participate in the CBS All Access video-on-demand service. And we believe that partnering with CBS on both of these fronts ensures that TEGNA audiences have access to must-see content on all their devices. 
Now our rising retransmission revenues and successful negotiations are driven by our track record for delivering best-in-class content. As a result, we've gone one step further and have successfully entered the content creation arena with the TV Jake show. We took a terrific personality, created and produced a talkshow around him and entered it on 4 of our local stations. Dave is going to provide some additional details, but for my perspective, this is a testament to our ability to deliver home-grown content, which further diversifies our business and ensures an ongoing stream of quality programming for our audiences. Yet another reason we are very optimistic about 2016 is our outstanding positioning for the upcoming presidential election as well as of the Summer Olympics which will air on NBC. 
TEGNA is very well positioned to the key battleground [indiscernible] to take a larger share of political ad spending going forward. 
As Dave will highlight, we will have a tremendous platform and set of stations in this election. We, of course, expect a significantly more substantial impact in 2016 and are looking forward to a record-breaking year. 
Turning now to Cars.com. We continue to see strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter. We fully expect this positive growth trajectory to continue, and we're looking ahead to a strong 2016. We anticipate revenue growth of 10% plus for the full year through new product development and continued innovation. In fact, we introduced 5 new products over the course of 2015, each of which continues to show strong returns. Alex will provide further details on our new products and other strategic initiatives in just a few moments. 
Moving to CareerBuilder. 2015, as we've said, represented a transformative year. We launched the world's first and only prehire platform and new recruitment software products, shifting a majority of our business to a higher growth, stickier higher-margin solutions. We also unveiled an exciting new look and feel for our brand that aligns with our new Software-as-a-Service focused strategy. 
CareerBuilder is fast becoming a leading global HR Software-as-a-Service company with a presence in more than 60 markets worldwide, a move that complements and enhances its successful job business. Matt is going to provide you with an update on on ongoing transition in just a few moments. 
But now, let me turn it over to Dave Lougee for his comments on TEGNA Media. Dave?"
20571,325031717,933740,"TEGNA Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2016",2016-02-16,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gracia, Let me begin by giving more color on the certainty that Gracia referenced. We finished 2015 by concluding key strategic negotiations with our largest network partners and some of our largest distribution partners. Specifically, we successf",975,"Thanks, Gracia, Let me begin by giving more color on the certainty that Gracia referenced. We finished 2015 by concluding key strategic negotiations with our largest network partners and some of our largest distribution partners. Specifically, we successfully negotiated retransmission consent agreements covering 58% of our distributors paying subscribers. We also reached a long-term agreement with our largest network partner, NBC, and earlier had reached an agreement with CBS. Both network deals true-up all the TEGNA stations and former Belo stations under single coterminous contracts. 
In the case of CBS, you may recall that the Belo stations agreement went until the beginning of 2017 and they'll continue to operate this year, 2016, under the same financial terms of the previous agreement. 
In the case of NBC, it's the inverse of CBS, the original TEGNA station agreement didn't expire until January of 2017 and that contract did not include reverse comp. So even under a new agreement, those original TEGNA stations will not begin paying reverse comp until January of next year, while the former Belo stations under NBC which were already paying reverse comp under their previous NBC agreement now fall under the financial terms of the new agreement. 
So the net of all these deals is this, between our NBC and CBS deals this year and our ABC agreement the year before, the reverse comp part of our equation is set for years to come with our largest partner, NBC, going out to early 2021. That, combined with the 58% of our subs renewed, 31% of which go out to late 2020, means that we have as Gracia said, certainty and stability around the retransmission piece of our business for the long term and in line with our overall model outlined at Investor Day last summer at the time of our company's split. 
And the final word on retrans. As I've said before, our trends on subscriber numbers look materially different than most, if not all, cable channels, and that's for 2 important reasons. One, given the geographic nature of our portfolio following the Belo acquisition, we're adding homes and population growth but the second dynamic is the fact that there appears to be far more cord shavers than cord cutters. MVPDs are moving many of their video subscribers to basic tier packages that only include broadcasters and that has some very key potential long-term implications in add dollar applications as there will be a growing gap and this is of distribution for us versus cable channels.
Now let's turn to 2016 and other topics, and I'll start with political as Gracia referenced. Our footprint for the primaries like the later general election is superb, specifically between now and March 26 -- 22, we have presidential primaries in 31 of our 38 markets. Our total spending, of course, is hard to predict as anything with this election, it's hard to predict, as you know, but we know it will end up at record levels for the primary season.  Between political, et retrans, the Olympics and the gel sales growth, TEGNA Media will have a record year. 
Further driving our growth in '16 is a series of key initiatives we're investing in that leverage the scale we've been able to achieve. First, content innovation. We're taking a development mindset to our core in this product. We had 8 pilots in production that are not married to traditional formats, for example, Care 11 in Minneapolis just recently launched our first pilot, breaking the news, indeed we launched that in January. In its first 3 weeks, it's already the #1 news show in its time period. 
Second, sales transformation. Through centralized world-class pricing and sophisticated marketing capabilities, we're putting the right tools and the right pitches in the hands of our glocal clients. In the fourth quarter, we completed the staffing of our centralized sales marketing team called Hatch. With hatch, we're leveraging our local relationships across all our markets to sell larger marketing-based solutions that go well beyond traditional TV ad dollars. We estimate that for every dollar in advertising at our local markets, there's $3 in marketing. 
In addition, our new in-house business intelligence team is ramping up quickly, building a proprietary pricing platform to increase the yield and value of the TEGNA's Media inventory. 
Together, we expect the Hatch and proprietary pricing initiatives to generate about $25 million to $30 million of incremental EBITDA this year. And as I outlined last summer at Investor Day, these initiatives will accelerate in 2017 and '18 and will be accompanied by significant EBITDA growth from other core and adjacent initiatives underway. 
Now let's turn to the original program that Gracia referenced. TEGNA Media is the first broadcaster to own 100% of a syndicated daytime property, TV Jakes'. Beyond the 29 TEGNA Media markets we'll initially launched in, we've signed an additional 13 markets and the number continues to grow. Between Facebook and Twitter, TV Jake has a loyal social following of more than 7 million people, which we will be leveraging for both show content and promotion. 
And social media is now the core of all we do. And in fact, in 2015, we, in the aggregate, were 1 of Facebook's top 5 largest media players, generating more engagement than national players like CNN and New York Times. In fact, our Denver station, has the #1 Facebook post at any local news organization in 2015, a post that generated more than 4 million interactions. 
Now  on the amortization side. Our success in digital content creation offers us new opportunities with all platform publishers. We've agreed with Facebook to be one of the first local broadcasters to participate in their instant articles beta program, and we're engaging an off-platform publishing conversation with many others as well. 
And with that, let me turn it over to Matt from CareerBuilder."

We're excited about the launch of FindYourColleagues.com we know students today graduate with more than $30,000 in debt, [indiscernible] free site that enable students to view easy-to-use, real-time labor market data for any occupation that matches their interest from job growth projection, salary ranges and businesses that are hiring to programs that they can apply to today. We're partnering with high schools around the country to help students make better decisions about majors, degrees in schools so that they have the outcomes they want once they enter the labor force. 
We're also helping to reskill workers of all ages so we can raise income levels of individuals, families and communities and help close the skills gap in the United States. We recently announced a partnership with the Pelican University [ph] that will enable workers to develop skills in in-demand fields in less than 3 months at a little cost to intensive online training. We're helping workers develop 21st century skills for 21st centuries job, such as web development and information security and believe this will have a lasting impact on labor market. 
Overall, we expect our revenue growth in 2016 to be in the mid-single digits and reach double digits by the end of 2017. 
As Gracia said, 2015 was a transitional year for us as we made calculated, strategic moves to facilitate more robust revenue growth in the future. We generated just under $700 million of revenue, which was essentially flat year-over-year when you exclude the impact of currency. [indiscernible] business we moved away from some low-margin transactional revenue and focused on higher-margin platform solutions. 
I'll give you an example of one of those that I discussed in the last earnings call. We saw year-over-year decline of $18.6 million in revenue or 2.5 percentage points in 2015 in our employer services unit. We moved from a transactional offering for sourcing and screening candidates to platform-based one that has longer commitments and built in software. 
Our platform sourcing screen business has grown sequentially over the last several months and we have enough book business to estimate that March revenue will be up year-over-year around 10%. Based on this trend, we believe we're on track to grow $7 million in this business line in 2016 or about 1 percentage points as we had projected earlier. 
In 2015, we also were impacted by moving several thousand low-margin transactional advertising accounts from our field sales force to a group that focuses exclusively on these accounts. It was disruptive for some clients and others were no longer a fit. Fortunately, since that move, the business is flat sequentially, revenue declining, but it's still weighing on 2015 results. If you remove that currency impact, the Source and Screen revenue I discussed earlier, and the low margin transactional accounts we moved to that specialized group, our business was actually up 4.6% year-over-year in 2015. 
Overall, we recognize the job business will continue to experience pricing pressure at the unit level in 2016, however, we included that pricing pressure in our projections. We have a lot of opportunities to after more job volume though the price per unit will be lower as we move into less skilled jobs. 
Moreover, we've seen good growth in our software solutions in our resume database in 2015 and we expect that to continue. We believe we are through most of the transition are set up for growth again in the coming year with a more seasoned sales force. 
We also continue to pursue key acquisitions and roll out new software products. We believe we will see double-digit growth in our SaaS-based products in 2016, that's our software solutions line, resume database and employer services, which will lead to revenue growth in the mid-single digits in 2016 and 10% growth by the end of 2017. 
We're excited about the opportunity ahead as we break new ground in the industry. And at this point, I'd like to turn it over to Alex for [indiscernible]."
20571,325031717,933740,"TEGNA Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2016",2016-02-16,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Matt. We're very pleased to close out 2015 on such a strong footing.

We're very pleased to close out 2015 on such a strong footing. The strong growth is primarily been driven by increased dealer market penetration, new products, an increased purchase of display advertising. 
We achieved solid growth in Q4 as our direct sales and major account teams did a great job throughout the quarter growing revenues by 10%. National revenues were also equally strong, up 12%. 
As Gracia mentioned, our robust product pipeline yielded 5 new products in 2015, delivering customer value and generating revenues. As you know, the total addressable market for service and repair digital advertising for franchise dealers is fairly large and generally unaddressed, estimated to about $250 million and our entering into this area with RepairPal Certified continues to show strong returns. 
Event Positions, another one of our 2015 innovations, is a new opportunity with an emphasis on mobile that provides customers an opportunity to dominate a specific targeted geography for a 7-day period. This product has far exceeded our expectations, outperforming projected revenue by 230% in the second half of 2015. This is evidenced that Cars.com is delivering solutions that meet our customers' needs. 
Looking ahead, our sell and trade solutions allow us to help consumers sell their vehicles quickly and help dealers acquire inventory. They were tested largely in the fourth quarter and based on strong test results and national launch is scheduled for the first quarter of 2016, with a total addressable market of about 380 million. 
At the same time, we've continued to move to a more responsive design on our website, which ultimately provides a more consistent user experience for consumers across all device types. 
As part of our multifaceted digital advertising strategy, our Cars.com on-the-lot report continues to quantify the influence that we're having on walk-in shoppers by using geofence technology to move beyond basic lead generation measurement. And through our ad modernization efforts, additional advertising units will be available on the Cars.com mobile properties. This is designed to capture new revenues as consumers continue to migrate to the use of mobile devices. 
We've achieved several major accomplishments at this year's North American International auto show in Detroit where we hosted our annual best award show for manufacturers and other automotive businesses. Selected by the company's editorial experts, these awards are designed to help shoppers across a variety of segments and budgets to choose the best vehicle for their need. Award categories include the best of 2016, best pickup truck for 2016, Eco-friendly car of the year, the family car of the year, the luxury car of the year and at the play car of the year. This show is now in its sixth year and the best of awards has been one of the most talked events during the Detroit auto show, drawing an audience of over 1,000 attendees. 
This year, we hosted CEOs from BMW and Volvo as well as dozen of C-suite executives from other car companies and related businesses. In addition to our editorial team covered the auto show in full force and published 65 articles and 16 videos highlighting the biggest news from the press days. 
Our coverage of the auto show didn't stop there. We unveiled a brand-new online video series called Car Kids, which features 2 very young reporters hitting the show floor to offer their take on the hottest cars through humor-field clips and interviews with the manufacturer executives. Most importantly, the auto show provides us an opportunity to connect directly with OEMs and in doing so, we're able to discuss some of the macro trends, expanded diversified revenue stream and new partnership opportunities. We gained valuable insights on the industry. And with a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate vehicles growing, Tier 2 OEM budgets have increased. We've added coverage from both the sales and support levels to help capture these regional dealers association advertising dollars across the country. We've targeted messaging becoming much easier to execute our platforms become a great place to get regionally focused offers and messaging to consumers in the light of these advertisements. 
As manufacturers and agencies begin to build teams to analyze the best amount of data being captured in real-time, we're having important conversations about the ways in which data with its incredibly available intense signals can be become productized. Manufacturers and their agencies are looking for more streamlined access to content and data and if we can provide it to them, we have a win-win opportunity where we can boost their brands and bolster the Cars.com brand in the process. 
As you can see, we have several reasons to be optimistic about 2016 and our new products continue to gain traction and our pipeline of innovative ideas continues to grow. As previously discussed, we expect to deliver revenue growth of 10% or more in 2016 through new product development and continued innovation. While growth may not be evenly dispersed from quarter-to-quarter, we're confident in our projections to remain on target. 
With that, let me turn over to Victoria for a detailed financial review."
20571,325031717,933740,"TEGNA Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2016",2016-02-16,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia has already mentioned, 2015 was a monumental year for TEGNA. The strength of our businesses during the fourth quarter give us great confidence for 2016 and beyond. We're very pleased with our fourth quar",1400,"Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia has already mentioned, 2015 was a monumental year for TEGNA. The strength of our businesses during the fourth quarter give us great confidence for 2016 and beyond. We're very pleased with our fourth quarter financial results despite being up against challenging year-over-year comparisons due to absence of significant political advertising spending that benefited us during the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Before I review our consolidated financial results, as well as capital allocation during the quarter, I'd like to highlight several special items, which totaled $62 million during the fourth quarter of 2015, with GAAP EPS benefit of $0.16 per share, primarily related to a gain on the sale of the corporate headquarters building, offset in part by workforce restructuring, facility consolidation and impairment charges. 
Now let's briefly review the operating results for the quarter. As a reminder, although I'll be focusing on our non-GAAP performance results today, you can find all of our reported data and comparatives in our press release. Also, as we mentioned during the last earnings call, we converted to a calendar year after the spin of our publishing assets in June. As a result, the fourth quarter results include the impact an additional 4 days, contributing about $10 million to Media Segment revenues with an EPS benefit of about $0.01. 
During the quarter, with solid performances by both Digital and Media Segments, we achieved earnings per share of $0.53. Year-over-year, earnings per share were up 8%, driven by organic growth at Cars.com and despite the challenging year-over-year political comparison in TEGNA Media. Total company revenues of $805 million were down 4% year-over-year, but it's important to note that excluding the impact of record nonpresidential political advertising revenue during the prior year, total revenues were in fact up 6%, driven by continued growth in retransmission as well as higher digital and core revenues within the Media Segment as well as a strong Cars.com revenues. 
During the quarter, total company operating expenses of $549 million were lower by 4% over last year, mainly due to seasonally lower quarter -- fourth quarter marketing cost at Cars.com and direct cost reductions at CareerBuilder, as well as the absence of publishing, back-office related stranded costs, which impacted expenses during the fourth quarter of last year. 
Now let's turn to a more detailed review of Media and Digital Segment results. As we previously noted, largely to the absence of record nonpresidential political revenues of over $92 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, TEGNA Media revenues of $462 million declined by 7% year-over-year, in line with our previous comments on our last call. However, excluding the impact of political advertising compared to the fourth quarter last year, Media Segment revenues would have been up by about 12%. 
Retransmission fees boosted by retransmission agreements negotiated during the second half of last year and annual rate increases were up 27% to a historical high of $120 million during the fourth quarter. 
Beyond this, TEGNA Media digital advertising revenues were also up 15% driven by digital marketing services, which continue to gain traction across all our television stations, driven by G/O Digital sales, extended reach networks and national digital revenues. 
Core advertising was also up by about 7% in part due to the impact of political displacement last year. Our strongest revenue categories for fourth quarter included auto, professional services, entertainment, medical services and home improvement. 
Now focusing on Q1 2016 projections. Based on current trends, we expect a growth in Media Segment revenues for the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015 to be in a range of 10% to 12%, driven by increases in political advertising, retransmission revenue and digital revenues. Core advertising is expected to be about the same as the first quarter last year, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of Super Bowl advertising, which aired on our 11 CBS stations in 2016 versus our 17 NBC stations in 2015. Excluding the impact of the Super Bowl, the percentage growth in core advertising is expected to be up in the low single digits.
During the fourth quarter, the Media Segment operating expenses were up 4% year-over-year due to increased programming costs, investment in our digital sales initiatives, including sales force expansion and newly launched product offerings. 
During the quarter, Digital Segment revenue on a pro forma basis, excluding the impact of the sale of PointRoll and adjusting for exchange rate, increased by 2% year-over-year, reflecting continued growth at Cars.com, offset by revenue declines at CareerBuilder. 
During the quarter, Cars.com revenues increased by 6%, in line with our comments in December and our previous earnings call. These results reflect strong market penetration in direct sales markets, a continued success of new products, such as RepairPal Certified and Event Positions, as well as increased purchasing of display advertising by auto manufacturers. These increases were partly offset by the absence of wholesale price increases, which occurred in the first quarter of 2016 but occurred during the fourth quarter last year at the time the transaction closed. 
As Matt mentioned, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and [indiscernible] lower sales of lower-margin transactional products, CareerBuilder revenues would have been slightly up year-over-year. 
With these impacts, CareerBuilder's revenue declined 4% on a constant currency basis. 
Digital Segment operating expenses were down 2% due to a slight increase in expenses at Cars.com, primarily driven by revenue growth, partly offset by direct cost reductions, reflecting lower revenues at CareerBuilder. 
As a result, we achieved solid adjusted EBITDA of $306 million this quarter for the total company and our EBITDA margin of 38% was relatively unchanged year-over-year, despite the negative impacts of the absence of significantly higher margin political revenues that benefited last year. 
Our capital investments during the quarter of $44 million reflect our ongoing commitment to our business priorities, including digital development, media content, product integration and platform enhancement, as well as several real estate initiatives, which produced immediate cost savings. 
For the year, $98 million was invested in capital projects, including onetime build-out impacts of the relocation of our Seattle television station to more appropriately sized space. 
During the quarter, strong cash flow from operations, combined with the proceeds from the sale of our headquarters building and the sales of some small noncore businesses, were used to pay off $180 million in 2018 senior notes while funding accelerated share repurchases of $70 million at an average price of $26.78. Interest payments of $82 million and to make investments in business initiatives of $44 million. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt stood at $4.2 billion and cash on the balance sheet was $129 million. 
As we look ahead to 2016, as Gracia and Dave both noted, we expect it to be a banner year, although we are still in the early stages of the campaign cycle, we project total Media Segment revenues to increase in the high-teens to low 20% range for the year. Also, we expect 10-plus percent revenue growth at Cars.com with CareerBuilder driving low to mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2016 through the adoption of the SaaS-based suite of products, which trends throughout the year. All of these drivers will contribute meaningfully to growth in total company revenues and a low to mid-teen range year-over-year. 
On the cost front, we expect total company expenses to increase in the range of 8% to 10%, reflecting primarily higher revenues as we expended richer content, as well as broader products and features across our media and digital businesses. Beyond this, we'll see increased programming costs resulting from new affiliation agreements negotiated during the second half of 2015. 
Capital expenditures for 2016 are expected to be in the range of $85 million to $95 million, a bit lower than 2015 due to fewer real estate projects planned for the year. Once again, in 2016, we expect the majority of our capital expenditures to be invested in digital development, media content, product integration and platform enhancement. 
For 2016, depreciation is projected to be approximately $90 million to $95 million and amortization of $110 million. Interest expense will be totaling -- will total nearly $235 million. As previously discussed, the tax rate is anticipated to be roughly in the 35% to 36% range in 2016 that will vary quarter-to-quarter. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for her closing remarks prior to the Q&A."

Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our call. This morning, I'm going to provide some highlights on our overall performance and each of our businesses and then I'll be turning it over to our business heads: Dave Lougee, President of TEGNA Media; Alex Vetter, CEO of Cars.com; and Matt Fergusons, CEO of CareerBuilder. They'll do a deep dive on each of their respective areas and then Victoria will touch on the financial highlights for the quarter at the end. So let's get right into it.
Our progress in our first 6 months as a highly focused media and digital company has been very strong. When we made the decision to separate our businesses into 2, we had a very specific vision in mind for TEGNA. And when we held our Investor Day in June, we were confident in the expectations and projects we laid out for you. But we know that for all of you, confidence does not necessarily equate to absolute certainty. But in just 6 short months, we have removed a great deal of those uncertainties, including those around our affiliation agreements and retransmission fees and replaced them with certainties for years to come. We have even more confidence that we have built a strong foundation that will enable us to capitalize on the rapidly growing demand in the industries we serve, a foundation that best leverages our unique mix of advantages, including top-performing assets, scale and partnerships, which give us the tremendous negotiating platform you've seen over the last several months; high margins and consistently strong and dependable cash flows; experienced industry experts running each of our businesses; and a shareholder-focused capital structure. Now we've leveraged those strengths to create a strong platform that can and will support our growth throughout 2016 and beyond.
So let's turn to fourth quarter results. Company-wide, as you saw, our revenue totaled about $805 million. Now there were lots of ins and outs as you probably saw in the press release. TEGNA Media had to overcome a record level of $92 million of political revenue in the fourth quarter last year, which masked otherwise strong results; double-digit increases in retransmission and online revenues; and higher core advertising. When you exclude that impact of the unfavorable political spending comparison, TEGNA Media revenues would have been up 12%.
Now our Digital Segment revenue was impacted by the sale of our PointRoll business, which we completed in November. And as you can see on Page 4 of our press release this morning, we show that excluding PointRoll from both the 2014 and 2015 fourth quarter periods and adjusting for exchange rates, so on a pro forma constant currency basis, Digital Segment revenues were over 2% higher.
New product launches and revenue growth at Cars.com, higher revenue per dealer at Cars.com was offset by a revenue decline at CareerBuilder as it continues its transition toward higher-margin Software-as-a-Service solutions and builds a leadership position in that space.
As you probably saw, expenses in the quarter were down over 4% on a non-GAAP basis. Now you've heard me say it quarter-after-quarter, but I think it bears repeating, our disciplined and proven approach to managing expenses and ensuring we are optimizing the efficiency of our operations while investing fully in our future will continue to be an important tenet of our strategy while we successfully grow our businesses.
Equally important, EBITDA was strong and our EBITDA margin of 38% was comparable to the fourth quarter of last year, despite the absence of substantial higher-margin political spending.
Another important pillar of our strategy is a commitment to a shareholder-friendly capital allocation structure. As you saw in October, we announced a $75 million increase in our share repurchase programming -- program, bringing it up to $825 million, which will be used over the original 3-year term ending in June of 2018. The increase reflects a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our corporate headquarters, which enabled us to increase the return of cash to our shareholders, while at the same time, strengthening our balance sheet through debt reduction.
As we've noted before, we have more than ample financial flexibility to pay our dividend, repurchase shares based on business conditions and new opportunities, reduce debt and invest in our businesses.
Now I'd like to switch gears for a moment and provide you with a handful of highlights on each of our businesses before turning it over to Dave, Alex and Matt.
As you saw, TEGNA Media achieved revenues in line with our previous guidance, driven by, as I noted, core advertising revenue growth, double-digit digital revenue growth and very strong retransmission revenue, due in part to our recently completed agreements. Additionally, I would be remiss not to mention that TEGNA Media was named Station Group of the Year for 2015 by Broadcasting & Cable based on our outstanding group of local television stations that have fantastic reporting, leading ratings and financial results and an innovative strategic approach. We are very proud of our team, and I want to congratulate Dave and his entire team on this well-deserved honor and a very strong year. 
2016 is looking to be even more promising for a number of reasons. First, the outcomes of all of our recent network affiliation agreements and several carriage agreements have been consistent with and, in some cases, exceeded the long-term projections we outlined at our Investor Day in June. Not only are our successful negotiations a testament to the high demand for the engaging content we provide, more importantly, they replace the uncertainty around TEGNA Media that may have existed several months ago with absolute longer-term certainty.
As you saw in January, we reached an agreement with NBC, of which we are the largest independent affiliate group. We are thrilled that we are set to deliver NBC's outstanding content from sports to news to prime time for years to come.
We also in the quarter secured multiyear agreements for continued carriage of TEGNA Media television stations on DirecTV and AT&T U-verse and DISH Network at more appropriately favorable rates. And as you know, this summer, we announced the renewal of our agreements with CBS for 10 TEGNA Media markets nationwide. TEGNA will participate in the CBS All Access video-on-demand service. And we believe that partnering with CBS on both of these fronts ensures that TEGNA audiences have access to must-see content on all their devices.
Now our rising retransmission revenues and successful negotiations are driven by our track record for delivering best-in-class content. As a result, we've gone one step further and have successfully entered the content creation arena with the T.D. Jakes Show. We took a terrific personality, created and produced a talk show around him and aired it on 4 of our local stations. Dave is going to provide some additional details. But from my perspective, this is a testament to our ability to deliver a home-grown content, which further diversifies our business and ensures an ongoing stream of quality programming for our audiences.
Yet another reason we are very optimistic about 2016 is our outstanding positioning for the upcoming presidential election as well as of the Summer Olympics, which will air on NBC. TEGNA is very well positioned in the key battleground states to take a larger share of political ad spending going forward.
As Dave will highlight, we will have a tremendous platform and set of stations in this election. We, of course, expect a significantly more substantial impact in 2016 and are looking forward to a record-breaking year.
Turning now to Cars.com. We continue to see strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter. We fully expect this positive growth trajectory to continue, and we're looking ahead to a strong 2016. We anticipate revenue growth of 10%-plus for the full year through new product development and continued innovation. In fact, we introduced 5 new products over the course of 2015, each of which continues to show strong returns. Alex will provide further details on our new products and other strategic initiatives in just a few moments.
Moving to CareerBuilder. 2015, as we've said, represented a transformative year. We launched the world's first and only pre-hire platform and new recruitment software products, shifting a majority of our business toward higher growth, stickier higher-margin solutions. We also unveiled an exciting new look and feel for our brand that aligns with our new Software-as-a-Service-focused strategy.
CareerBuilder is fast becoming a leading global HR Software-as-a-Service company with a presence in more than 60 markets worldwide, a move that complements and enhances its successful job board business. Matt's going to provide you with an update on ongoing transition in just a few moments.
But now let me turn it over to Dave Lougee for his comments on TEGNA Media. Dave?"
20571,325031717,933859,"TEGNA Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2016",2016-02-16,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gracia, Let me begin by giving more color on the certainty that Gracia referenced.

Specifically, we successf",974,"Thanks, Gracia, Let me begin by giving more color on the certainty that Gracia referenced. We finished 2015 by concluding key strategic negotiations with our largest network partners and some of our largest distribution partners. Specifically, we successfully negotiated retransmission consent agreements, covering 58% of our distributors paying subscribers. We also reached a long-term agreement with our largest network partner, NBC, and earlier had reached an agreement with CBS. Both network deals true up all the TEGNA stations and former Belo stations under single coterminous contracts.
In the case of CBS, you may recall that the Belo stations agreement went until the beginning of 2017 and they'll continue to operate this year, 2016, under the same financial terms of the previous agreement.
In the case of NBC, it's the inverse of CBS. The original TEGNA stations agreement didn't expire until January of 2017, and that contract did not include reverse comp. So even under a new agreement, those original TEGNA stations will not begin paying reverse comp until January of next year, while the former Belo stations under NBC, which were already paying reverse comp under their previous NBC agreement, now fall under the financial terms of the new agreement.
So the net of all these deals is this: between our NBC and CBS deals this year and our ABC agreement the year before, the reverse comp part of our equation is set for years to come with our largest partner, NBC, going out to early 2021. That, combined with the 58% of our subs renewed, 31% of which go out to late 2020, means that we have, as Gracia said, certainty and stability around the retransmission piece of our business for the long term and in line with our overall model outlined at Investor Day last summer at the time of our company's split.
And a final word on retrans. As I've said before, our trends on subscriber numbers look materially different than most, if not all, cable channels, and that's for 2 important reasons. One, given the geographic nature of our portfolio following the Belo acquisition, we're adding homes and population growth. But the second dynamic is the fact that there appears to be far more cord shavers than cord cutters. MVPDs are moving many of their video subscribers to basic tier packages that only include broadcasters, and that has some very key potential long-term implications in ad dollar allocations as there will be a growing gap in the size of distribution for us versus cable channels.
Now let's turn to 2016 and other topics, and I'll start with political, as Gracia referenced. Our footprint for the primaries, like the later general election, is superb. Specifically between now and March 26 -- 22, we have presidential primaries in 31 of our 38 markets. Our total spending, of course, is hard to predict, as anything with this election is hard to predict, as you know, but we know it will end up at record levels for the primary season.  Between political, net retrans, the Olympics and digital sales growth, TEGNA Media will have a record year.
Further driving our growth in '16 is a series of key initiatives we're investing in that leverage the scale we've been able to achieve. First, content innovation. We're taking a development mindset to our core news product. We had 8 pilots in production that are not married to traditional news formats. For example, KARE 11 in Minneapolis just recently launched our first pilot, Breaking the News. We launched that in January. In its first 3 weeks, it's already the #1 news show in its time period.
Second, sales transformation. Through centralized world-class pricing and sophisticated marketing capabilities, we're putting the right tools and the right pitches in the hands of our local clients. In the fourth quarter, we completed the staffing of our centralized sales marketing team called Hatch. With Hatch, we're leveraging our local relationships across all our markets to sell larger marketing-based solutions that go well beyond traditional TV ad dollars. We estimate that for every dollar in advertising at our local markets, there's $3 in marketing. 
In addition, our new in-house business intelligence team is ramping up quickly, building a proprietary pricing platform to increase the yield and value of TEGNA Media's inventory.
Together, we expect the Hatch and proprietary pricing initiatives to generate about $25 million to $30 million of incremental EBITDA this year. And as I outlined last summer at Investor Day, these initiatives will accelerate in 2017 and '18 and will be accompanied by significant EBITDA growth from other core and adjacent initiatives underway.
Now let's turn to the original program that Gracia referenced. TEGNA Media is the first broadcaster to own 100% of a syndicated daytime property, T.D. Jakes. Beyond the 29 TEGNA Media markets we initially launched in, we've signed an additional 13 markets and the number continues to grow. Between Facebook and Twitter, T.D. Jakes has a loyal social following of more than 7 million people, which we will be leveraging for both show content and promotion.
And social media is now at the core of all we do. And in fact, in 2015, we, in the aggregate, were 1 of Facebook's top 5 largest media players, generating more engagement than national players like CNN and New York Times. In fact, KUSA, our Denver station, had the #1 Facebook post than any local news organization in 2015, a post that generated more than 4 million interactions.
And on the monetization side, our success in digital content creation offers us new opportunities with off-platform publishers. We've agreed with Facebook to be one of the first local broadcasters to participate in their Instant Articles beta program, and we're engaging an off-platform publishing conversation with many others as well.
And with that, let me turn it over to Matt from CareerBuilder."

In addition to rolling out new software solutions, we're elevating our brand visibility through high-profile sponsorships like the CareerBuilder Challenge PGA tournament, TV advertising and community outreach. We're excited about the launch of findyourcalling.com As we know, students today graduate with more than $30,000 in debt. CareerBuilder created a free site that enables students to view easy-to-use, real-time labor market data for any occupation that matches their interest, from job growth projection, salary ranges and businesses that are hiring to programs that they can apply to today. We're partnering with high schools around the country to help students make better decisions about majors, degrees in schools so that they have the outcomes they want once they enter the labor force.
We're also helping to re-skilling up skilled workers of all ages so we can raise income levels of individuals, families and communities and help close the skills gap in the United States. We recently announced a partnership with Capella University that will enable workers to develop skills in in-demand fields in less than 3 months at a little cost through intensive online training. We're helping workers develop 21st century skills for 21st century jobs, such as web development and information security, and believe this will have a lasting impact on the labor market. 
Overall, we expect our revenue growth in 2016 to be in the mid-single digits and reach double digits by the end of 2017.
As Gracia said, 2015 was a transitional year for us as we made calculated, strategic moves to facilitate more robust revenue growth in the future. We generated just under $700 million in revenue, which was essentially flat year-over-year when you exclude the impact of currency. We expected this as we moved away from some low-margin transactional revenue and focused on higher-margin platform solutions.
I'll give you an example of one of those that I discussed in the last earnings call. We saw a year-over-year decline of $18.6 million in revenue or 2.5 percentage points in 2015 in our employer services unit. We moved from a transactional offering for sourcing and screening candidates to platform-based one that has longer commitments and builds in software.
Our platform Source and Screen business has grown sequentially over the last several months, and we have enough book business to estimate that March revenue will be up year-over-year around 10%. Based on this trend, we believe we're on track to grow $7 million in this business line in 2016 or about 1 percentage point as we had projected earlier.
In 2015, we also were impacted by moving several thousand low-margin transactional advertising accounts from our field sales force to a group that focuses exclusively on these accounts. It was disruptive for some clients and others were no longer a fit. Fortunately, since that move, the business is flat sequentially rather than declining, but it's still weighing on 2015 results. If you remove that currency impact, the Source and Screen revenue I discussed earlier and the low-margin transactional accounts we moved to that specialized group, our business was actually up 4.6% year-over-year in 2015.
Overall, we recognize the job business will continue to experience pricing pressure at the unit level in 2016. However, we included that pricing pressure in our projections. We have a lot of opportunities to go after more job volume, though the price per unit will be lower as we move into less skilled jobs.
Moreover, we've seen good growth in our software solutions in our résumé database in 2015, and we expect that to continue. We believe we are through most of the transition and are set up for growth again in the coming year with a more seasoned sales force.
We'll also continue to pursue key acquisitions and roll out new software products. We believe we will see double-digit growth in our SaaS-based products in 2016. That's our software solutions line, résumé database and employer services, which will lead to revenue growth in the mid-single digits in 2016 and 10% growth by the end of 2017.
We're excited about the opportunity ahead as we break new ground in the industry. And at this point, I'd like to turn it over to Alex Vetter from Cars.com."

We're very pleased to close out 2015 on such a strong footing. The strong growth has primarily been driven by increased dealer market penetration, new products and increased purchase of display advertising.
We achieved solid growth in Q4 as our direct sales and major account teams did a great job throughout the quarter growing revenues by 10%. National revenues were also equally strong, up 12%.
As Gracia mentioned, our robust product pipeline yielded 5 new products in 2015, delivering customer value and generating revenues. As you know, the total addressable market for service and repair digital advertising for franchise dealers is fairly large and generally unaddressed, estimated to about $250 million, and our entry into this area with RepairPal Certified continues to show strong returns.
Event Positions, another one of our 2015 innovations, is a new opportunity with an emphasis on mobile that provides customers an opportunity to dominate a specific targeted geography for a 7-day period. This product has far exceeded our expectations, outperforming projected revenue by 230% in the second half of 2015. This is evidenced that Cars.com is delivering solutions that meet our customers' needs.
Looking ahead, our sell and trade solutions allow us to help consumers sell their vehicles quickly and help dealers acquire inventory. They were tested largely in the fourth quarter and based on strong test results and national launch that's scheduled for the first quarter of 2016 with a total addressable market of about 380 million.
At the same time, we've continued to move to a more responsive design on our website, which ultimately provides a more consistent user experience for consumers across all device types.
As part of our multifaceted digital advertising strategy, our Cars.com on-the-lot report continues to help quantify the influence that we're having on walk-in shoppers by using geofence technology to move beyond basic lead generation measurement. And through our ad modernization efforts, additional advertising units will be available on the Cars.com mobile properties. This is designed to capture new revenues as consumers continue to migrate to the use of mobile devices.
We've achieved several major accomplishments at this year's North American International Auto Show in Detroit, where we hosted our annual Best of Awards show for manufacturers and other automotive businesses. Selected by the company's editorial experts, these awards are designed to help shoppers across a variety of segments and budgets choose the best vehicle for their needs. Award categories include the Best of 2016, Best Pickup Truck for 2016, Eco-Friendly Car of the Year, the Family Car of the Year, the Luxury Car of the Year and the Play Car of the Year. This show is now in its sixth year, and the Best of Awards has been one of the most talked about events during the Detroit Auto Show, drawing an audience of over 1,000 attendees.
This year, we hosted CEOs from BMW and Volvo as well as dozen of C-suite executives from other car companies and related businesses, in addition to our editorial team covered the auto show in full force and published 65 articles and 16 videos highlighting the biggest news from the press days.
Our coverage of the auto show didn't stop there. We unveiled a brand-new online video series called Car Kids, which features 2 very young reporters hitting the show floor to offer their take on the hottest cars through humor-field clips and interviews with manufacturer executives. Most importantly, the auto show provides us an opportunity to connect directly with OEMs. And in doing so, we're able to discuss some of the macro trends, expanded diversified revenue stream and new partnership opportunities. We gain valuable insights on the industry. And with a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of vehicles growing, Tier 2 OEM budgets have increased. We've added coverage from both a sales and support level to help capture these regional dealers association advertising dollars across the country. With targeted messaging becoming much easier to execute, our platforms become a great place to get regionally focused offers and messaging to consumers in the lines of these advertisements.
As manufacturers and agencies begin to build teams to analyze the vast amount of data being captured in real-time, we're having important conversations about the ways in which data with its incredibly valuable intent signals can become productized. Manufacturers and their agencies are looking for more streamlined access to content and data. And if we can provide it to them, we have a win-win opportunity where we can boast their brands and bolster the Cars.com brand in the process.
As you can see, we have several reasons to be optimistic about 2016, and our new products continue to gain traction and our pipeline of innovative ideas continues to grow. As previously discussed, we expect to deliver revenue growth of 10% or more in 2016 through new product development and continued innovation. While growth may not be evenly dispersed from quarter-to-quarter, we're confident in our projections to remain on target.
With that, let me turn over to Victoria for a detailed financial review."
20571,325031717,933859,"TEGNA Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2016",2016-02-16,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone.

We're very pleased with our fourth quar",1401,"Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia has already mentioned, 2015 was a monumental year for TEGNA. The strength of our businesses during the fourth quarter give us great confidence for 2016 and beyond. We're very pleased with our fourth quarter financial results despite being up against challenging year-over-year comparisons due to the absence of significant political advertising spending that benefited us during the fourth quarter of 2014.
Before I review our consolidated financial results as well as capital allocation during the quarter, I'd like to highlight several special items, which totaled $62 million during the fourth quarter of 2015, with GAAP EPS benefit of $0.16 per share, primarily related to a gain on the sale of the corporate headquarters building, offset in part by workforce restructuring, facility consolidation and impairment charges. 
Now let's briefly review the operating results for the quarter. As a reminder, although I'll be focusing on our non-GAAP performance results today, you can find all of our reported data and comparatives in our press release. Also, as we mentioned during the last earnings call, we converted to a calendar year after the spin of our publishing assets in June. As a result, the fourth quarter results include the impact an additional 4 days, contributing about $10 million to Media Segment revenues with an EPS benefit of about $0.01.
During the quarter, with solid performances by both Digital and Media Segments, we achieved earnings per share of $0.53. Year-over-year, earnings per share were up 8%, driven by organic growth at Cars.com and despite the challenging year-over-year political comparison in TEGNA Media. Total company revenues of $805 million were down 4% year-over-year. But it's important to note that excluding the impact of record nonpresidential political advertising revenue during the prior year, total revenues were, in fact, up 6%, driven by continued growth in retransmission as well as higher digital and core revenues within the Media Segment as well as strong Cars.com revenues.
During the quarter, total company operating expenses of $549 million were lower by 4% over last year, mainly due to seasonally lower quarter -- fourth quarter marketing costs at Cars.com and direct cost reductions at CareerBuilder as well as the absence of publishing, back-office-related stranded costs, which impacted expenses during the fourth quarter of last year.
Now let's turn to a more detailed review of Media and Digital Segment results. As we previously noted, largely due to the absence of record nonpresidential political revenues of over $92 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, TEGNA Media revenues of $462 million declined by 7% year-over-year, in line with our previous comments on our last call. However, excluding the impacts of political advertising compared to the fourth quarter last year, Media Segment revenues would have been up by about 12%.
Retransmission fees, boosted by retransmission agreements negotiated during the second half of last year and annual rate increases, were up 27% to a historical high of $120 million during the fourth quarter.
Beyond this, TEGNA Media digital advertising revenues were also up 15% driven by digital marketing services, which continued to gain traction across all our television stations, driven by G/O Digital sales, extended reach networks and national digital revenues.
Core advertising was also up by about 7%, in part due to the impact of political displacement last year. Our strongest revenue categories for fourth quarter included auto, professional services, entertainment, medical services and home improvement.
Now focusing on Q1 2016 projections. Based on current trends, we expect a growth in Media Segment revenues for the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015 to be in a range of 10% to 12%, driven by increases in political advertising, retransmission revenue and digital revenue. Core advertising is expected to be about the same as the first quarter last year, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of Super Bowl advertising, which aired on our 11 CBS stations in 2016 versus our 17 NBC stations in 2015. Excluding the impact of the Super Bowl, the percentage growth in core advertising is expected to be up in the low single digits.
During the fourth quarter, the Media Segment operating expenses were up 4% year-over-year due to increased programming costs, investment in our digital sales initiatives, including sales force expansion and newly launched product offerings.
During the quarter, Digital Segment revenue on a pro forma basis, excluding the impacts of the sale of PointRoll and adjusting for exchange rates, increased by 2% year-over-year, reflecting continued growth at Cars.com, offset by revenue declines at CareerBuilder.
During the quarter, Cars.com revenues increased by 6%, in line with our comments in December and our previous earnings call. These results reflect strong market penetration in direct sales markets, the continued success of new products, such as RepairPal Certified and Event Positions, as well as increased purchasing of display advertising by auto manufacturers. These increases were partly offset by the absence of wholesale price increases, which occurred in the first quarter of 2016 but occurred during the fourth quarter last year at the time the transaction closed.
As Matt mentioned, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the intentionally lower sales of lower-margin transaction products, CareerBuilder revenues would have been slightly up year-over-year. 
With these impacts, CareerBuilder's revenues declined 4% on a constant currency basis.
Digital Segment operating expenses were down 2% due to a slight increase in expenses at Cars.com, primarily driven by revenue growth, partly offset by direct cost reductions, reflecting lower revenues at CareerBuilder.
As a result, we achieved solid adjusted EBITDA of $306 million this quarter for the total company, and our EBITDA margin of 38% was relatively unchanged year-over-year despite the negative impacts of the absence of significantly higher-margin political revenues that benefited last year.
Our capital investments during the quarter of $44 million reflect our ongoing commitment to our business priorities, including digital development, media content, product integration and platform enhancements as well as several real estate initiatives, which produced immediate cost savings.
For the year, $98 million was invested in capital projects, including onetime build-out impacts of the relocation of our Seattle television station to a more appropriately sized space.
During the quarter, strong cash flow from operations, combined with the proceeds from the sale of our headquarters building and the sales of some small noncore businesses, were used to pay off $180 million in 2018 senior notes while funding accelerated share repurchases of $70 million at an average price of $26.78, interest payments of $82 million and to make investments in business initiatives of $44 million. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt stood at $4.2 billion and cash on the balance sheet was $129 million.
As we look ahead to 2016, as Gracia and Dave both noted, we expect it to be a banner year. Although we are still in the early stages of the campaign cycle, we project total Media Segment revenues to increase in the high-teens to low-20% range for the year. Also, we expect 10-plus percent revenue growth at Cars.com with CareerBuilder driving low to mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2016 through the adoption of their SaaS-based suite of products, which runs throughout the year. All of these drivers will contribute meaningfully to growth in total company revenues in the low- to mid-teen range year-over-year. 
On the cost front, we expect total company expenses to increase in the range of 8% to 10%, reflecting primarily higher revenues as we expand in richer content as well as broader products and features across our media and digital businesses. Beyond this, we'll see increased programming costs resulting from new affiliation agreements negotiated during the second half of 2015.
Capital expenditures for 2016 are expected to be in the range of $85 million to $95 million, a bit lower than 2015 due to fewer real estate projects planned for the year. Once again, in 2016, we expect the majority of our capital expenditures to be invested in digital development, media content, product integration and platform enhancement.
For 2016, depreciation is projected to be approximately $90 million to $95 million and amortization of $110 million. Interest expense will be -- will total nearly $235 million. As previously discussed, the tax rate is anticipated to be roughly in the 35% to 36% range in 2016, though it will vary quarter-to-quarter.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for her closing remarks prior to the Q&A."

Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our call. This morning, I'm going to provide some highlights on our overall performance and each of our businesses and then I'll be turning it over to our business heads: Dave Lougee, President of TEGNA Media; Alex Vetter, CEO of Cars.com; and Matt Fergusons, CEO of CareerBuilder. They'll do a deep dive on each of their respective areas and then Victoria will touch on the financial highlights for the quarter at the end. So let's get right into it.
Our progress in our first 6 months as a highly focused media and digital company has been very strong. When we made the decision to separate our businesses into 2, we had a very specific vision in mind for TEGNA. And when we held our Investor Day in June, we were confident in the expectations and projects we laid out for you. But we know that for all of you, confidence does not necessarily equate to absolute certainty. But in just 6 short months, we have removed a great deal of those uncertainties, including those around our affiliation agreements and retransmission fees and replaced them with certainties for years to come. We have even more confidence that we have built a strong foundation that will enable us to capitalize on the rapidly growing demand in the industries we serve, a foundation that best leverages our unique mix of advantages, including top-performing assets, scale and partnerships, which give us the tremendous negotiating platform you've seen over the last several months; high margins and consistently strong and dependable cash flows; experienced industry experts running each of our businesses; and a shareholder-focused capital structure. Now we've leveraged those strengths to create a strong platform that can and will support our growth throughout 2016 and beyond.
So let's turn to fourth quarter results. Company-wide, as you saw, our revenue totaled about $805 million. Now there were lots of ins and outs as you probably saw in the press release. TEGNA Media had to overcome a record level of $92 million of political revenue in the fourth quarter last year, which masked otherwise strong results; double-digit increases in retransmission and online revenues; and higher core advertising. When you exclude that impact of the unfavorable political spending comparison, TEGNA Media revenues would have been up 12%.
Now our Digital Segment revenue was impacted by the sale of our PointRoll business, which we completed in November. And as you can see on Page 4 of our press release this morning, we show that excluding PointRoll from both the 2014 and 2015 fourth quarter periods and adjusting for exchange rates, so on a pro forma constant currency basis, Digital Segment revenues were over 2% higher.
New product launches and revenue growth at Cars.com, higher revenue per dealer at Cars.com was offset by a revenue decline at CareerBuilder as it continues its transition toward higher-margin Software-as-a-Service solutions and builds a leadership position in that space.
As you probably saw, expenses in the quarter were down over 4% on a non-GAAP basis. Now you've heard me say it quarter-after-quarter, but I think it bears repeating, our disciplined and proven approach to managing expenses and ensuring we are optimizing the efficiency of our operations while investing fully in our future will continue to be an important tenet of our strategy while we successfully grow our businesses.
Equally important, EBITDA was strong and our EBITDA margin of 38% was comparable to the fourth quarter of last year, despite the absence of substantial higher-margin political spending.
Another important pillar of our strategy is a commitment to a shareholder-friendly capital allocation structure. As you saw in October, we announced a $75 million increase in our share repurchase programming -- program, bringing it up to $825 million, which will be used over the original 3-year term ending in June 2018. The increase reflects a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our corporate headquarters, which enabled us to increase the return of cash to our shareholders, while at the same time, strengthening our balance sheet through debt reduction.
As we've noted before, we have more than ample financial flexibility to pay our dividend, repurchase shares based on business conditions and new opportunities, reduce debt and invest in our businesses.
Now I'd like to switch gears for a moment and provide you with a handful of highlights on each of our businesses before turning it over to Dave, Alex and Matt.
As you saw, TEGNA Media achieved revenues in line with our previous guidance, driven by, as I noted, core advertising revenue growth, double-digit digital revenue growth and very strong retransmission revenue, due in part to our recently completed agreements. Additionally, I would be remiss not to mention that TEGNA Media was named Station Group of the Year for 2015 by Broadcasting & Cable based on our outstanding group of local television stations that have fantastic reporting, leading ratings and financial results and an innovative strategic approach. We are very proud of our team, and I want to congratulate Dave and his entire team on this well-deserved honor in a very strong year. 
2016 is looking to be even more promising for a number of reasons. First, the outcomes of all of our recent network affiliation agreements and several carriage agreements have been consistent with and, in some cases, exceeded the long-term projections we outlined at our Investor Day in June. Not only are our successful negotiations a testament to the high demand for the engaging content we provide, more importantly, they replace the uncertainty around TEGNA Media that may have existed several months ago with absolute longer-term certainty.
As you saw in January, we reached an agreement with NBC, of which we are the largest independent affiliate group. We are thrilled that we are set to deliver NBC's outstanding content from sports to news to prime time for years to come.
We also in the quarter secured multiyear agreements for continued carriage of TEGNA Media television stations on DirecTV and AT&T U-verse and DISH Network at more appropriately favorable rates. And as you know, this summer, we announced the renewal of our agreements with CBS for 10 TEGNA Media markets nationwide. TEGNA will participate in the CBS All Access video-on-demand service. And we believe that partnering with CBS on both of these fronts ensures that TEGNA audiences have access to must-see content on all their devices.
Now our rising retransmission revenues and successful negotiations are driven by our track record for delivering best-in-class content. As a result, we've gone one step further and have successfully entered the content creation arena with the T.D. Jakes Show. We took a terrific personality, created and produced a talk show around him and aired it on 4 of our local stations. Dave is going to provide some additional details. But from my perspective, this is a testament to our ability to deliver home-grown content, which further diversifies our business and ensures an ongoing stream of quality programming for our audiences.
Yet another reason we are very optimistic about 2016 is our outstanding positioning for the upcoming presidential election as well as the Summer Olympics, which will air on NBC. TEGNA is very well positioned in the key battleground states to take a larger share of political ad spending going forward.
As Dave will highlight, we will have a tremendous platform and set of stations in this election. We, of course, expect a significantly more substantial impact in 2016 and are looking forward to a record-breaking year.
Turning now to Cars.com. We continue to see strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter. We fully expect this positive growth trajectory to continue, and we're looking ahead to a strong 2016. We anticipate revenue growth of 10%-plus for the full year through new product development and continued innovation. In fact, we introduced 5 new products over the course of 2015, each of which continues to show strong returns. Alex will provide further details on our new products and other strategic initiatives in just a few moments.
Moving to CareerBuilder. 2015, as we've said, represented a transformative year. We launched the world's first and only pre-hire platform and new recruitment software products, shifting a majority of our business toward higher growth, stickier higher-margin solutions. We also unveiled an exciting new look and feel for our brand that aligns with our new Software-as-a-Service-focused strategy.
CareerBuilder is fast becoming a leading global HR Software-as-a-Service company with a presence in more than 60 markets worldwide, a move that complements and enhances its successful job board business. Matt's going to provide you with an update on ongoing transition in just a few moments.
But now let me turn it over to Dave Lougee for his comments on TEGNA Media. Dave?"
20571,325031717,933894,"TEGNA Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2016",2016-02-16,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gracia. Let me begin by giving more color on the certainty that Gracia referenced. We finished 2015 by concluding key strategic negotiations with our largest network partners and some of our largest distribution partners. Specifically, we successf",973,"Thanks, Gracia. Let me begin by giving more color on the certainty that Gracia referenced. We finished 2015 by concluding key strategic negotiations with our largest network partners and some of our largest distribution partners. Specifically, we successfully negotiated retransmission consent agreements covering 58% of our distributors paying subscribers. We also reached a long-term agreement with our largest network partner, NBC, and earlier had reached an agreement with CBS. Both network deals true up all the TEGNA stations and former Belo stations under single coterminous contracts.
In the case of CBS, you may recall that the Belo stations agreement went until the beginning of 2017 and they'll continue to operate this year, 2016, under the same financial terms of the previous agreement.
In the case of NBC, it's the inverse of CBS. The original TEGNA stations agreement didn't expire until January 2017, and that contract did not include reverse comp. So even under a new agreement, those original TEGNA stations will not begin paying reverse comp until January of next year, while the former Belo stations under NBC, which were already paying reverse comp under their previous NBC agreement, now fall under the financial terms of the new agreement.
So the net of all these deals is this: between our NBC and CBS deals this year and our ABC agreement the year before, the reverse comp part of our equation is set for years to come with our largest partner, NBC, going out to early 2021. That, combined with the 58% of our subs renewed, 31% of which go out to late 2020, means that we have, as Gracia said, certainty and stability around the retransmission piece of our business for the long term and in line with our overall model outlined at Investor Day last summer at the time of our company's split.
And a final word on retrans. As I've said before, our trends on subscriber numbers look materially different than most, if not all, cable channels, and that's for 2 important reasons. One, given the geographic nature of our portfolio following the Belo acquisition, we're adding homes and population growth. But the second dynamic is the fact that there appears to be far more cord shavers than cord cutters. MVPDs are moving many of their video subscribers to basic tier packages that only include broadcasters, and that has some very key potential long-term implications in ad dollar allocations as there will be a growing gap in the size of distribution for us versus cable channels.
Now let's turn to 2016 and other topics, and I'll start with political, as Gracia referenced. Our footprint for the primaries, like the later general election, is superb. Specifically, between now and March 26 -- 22, we have presidential primaries in 31 of our 38 markets. Our total spending, of course, is hard to predict, as anything with this election is hard to predict, as you know, but we know it will end up at record levels for the primary season.  Between political, net retrans, the Olympics and digital sales growth, TEGNA Media will have a record year.
Further driving our growth in '16 is a series of key initiatives we're investing in that leverage the scale we've been able to achieve. First, content innovation. We're taking a development mindset to our core news product. We have 8 pilots in production that are not married to traditional news formats. For example, KARE 11 in Minneapolis just recently launched our first pilot, Breaking the News. We launched that in January. In its first 3 weeks, it's already the #1 news show in its time period.
Second, sales transformation. Through centralized world-class pricing and sophisticated marketing capabilities, we're putting the right tools and the right pitches in the hands of our local clients. In the fourth quarter, we completed the staffing of our centralized sales marketing team called Hatch. With Hatch, we're leveraging our local relationships across all our markets to sell larger marketing-based solutions that go well beyond traditional TV ad dollars. We estimate that for every dollar in advertising at our local markets, there's $3 in marketing. 
In addition, our new in-house business intelligence team is ramping up quickly, building a proprietary pricing platform to increase the yield and value of TEGNA Media's inventory.
Together, we expect the Hatch and proprietary pricing initiatives to generate about $25 million to $30 million of incremental EBITDA this year. And as I outlined last summer at Investor Day, these initiatives will accelerate in 2017 and '18 and will be accompanied by significant EBITDA growth from other core and adjacent initiatives underway.
Now let's turn to the original program that Gracia referenced. TEGNA Media is the first broadcaster to own 100% of a syndicated daytime property, T.D. Jakes. Beyond the 29 TEGNA Media markets we'll initially launched in, we've signed an additional 13 markets and the number continues to grow. Between Facebook and Twitter, T.D. Jakes has a loyal social following of more than 7 million people, which we will be leveraging for both show content and promotion.
And social media is now at the core of all we do. And in fact, in 2015, we, in the aggregate, were 1 of Facebook's top 5 largest media players, generating more engagement than national players like CNN and New York Times. In fact, KUSA, our Denver station, had the #1 Facebook post of any local news organization in 2015, a post that generated more than 4 million interactions.
And on the monetization side, our success in digital content creation offers us new opportunities with off-platform publishers. We've agreed with Facebook to be one of the first local broadcasters to participate in their Instant Articles beta program, and we're engaging an off-platform publishing conversation with many others as well.
And with that, let me turn it over to Matt from CareerBuilder."

In addition to rolling out new software solutions, we're elevating our brand visibility through high-profile sponsorships like the CareerBuilder Challenge PGA tournament, TV advertising and community outreach. We're excited about the launch of findyourcalling.com As we know, students today graduate with more than $30,000 in debt. CareerBuilder created a free site that enables students to view easy-to-use, real-time labor market data for any occupation that matches their interest, from job growth projection, salary ranges and businesses that are hiring to programs that they can apply to today. We're partnering with high schools around the country to help students make better decisions about majors degrees in schools so that they have the outcomes they want once they enter the labor force.
We're also helping to re-skill enough skilled workers of all ages so we can raise income levels of individuals, families and communities and help close the skills gap in the United States. We recently announced a partnership with Capella University that will enable workers to develop skills in in-demand fields in less than 3 months at little cost through intensive online training. We're helping workers develop 21st century skills for 21st century jobs, such as web development and information security, and believe this will have a lasting impact on the labor market. 
Overall, we expect our revenue growth in 2016 to be in the mid-single digits and reach double digits by the end of 2017.
As Gracia said, 2015 was a transitional year for us as we made calculated, strategic moves to facilitate more robust revenue growth in the future. We generated just under $700 million in revenue, which was essentially flat year-over-year when you exclude the impact of currency. We expected this as we moved away from some low-margin transactional revenue and focused on higher-margin platform solutions.
I'll give you an example of one of those that I discussed in the last earnings call. We saw a year-over-year decline of $18.6 million in revenue or 2.5 percentage points in 2015 in our employer services unit. We moved from a transactional offering for sourcing and screening candidates to platform-based one that has longer commitments and builds in software.
Our platform Source and Screen business has grown sequentially over the last several months, and we have enough book business to estimate that March revenue will be up year-over-year around 10%. Based on this trend, we believe we're on track to grow $7 million in this business line in 2016 or about 1 percentage point as we had projected earlier.
In 2015, we also were impacted by moving several thousand low-margin transactional advertising accounts from our field sales force to a group that focuses exclusively on these accounts. It was disruptive for some clients and others were no longer a fit. Fortunately, since that move, the business is flat sequentially rather than declining, but it's still weighing on 2015 results. If you remove that currency impact, the Source and Screen revenue I discussed earlier and the low-margin transactional accounts we moved to that specialized group, our business was actually up 4.6% year-over-year in 2015.
Overall, we recognize the job business will continue to experience pricing pressure at the unit level in 2016. However, we included that pricing pressure in our projections. We have a lot of opportunities to go after more job volume, though the price per unit will be lower as we move into less skilled jobs.
Moreover, we've seen good growth in our software solutions in our résumé database in 2015, and we expect that to continue. We believe we are through most of the transition and are set up for growth again in the coming year with a more seasoned sales force.
We'll also continue to pursue key acquisitions and roll out new software products. We believe we will see double-digit growth in our SaaS-based products in 2016. That's our software solutions line, résumé database and employer services, which will lead to revenue growth in the mid-single digits in 2016 and 10% growth by the end of 2017.
We're excited about the opportunities ahead as we break new ground in the industry. And at this point, I'd like to turn it over to Alex Vetter from Cars.com."

We're very pleased to close out 2015 on such a strong footing. The strong growth has primarily been driven by increased dealer market penetration, new products and increased purchase of display advertising.
We achieved solid growth in Q4 as our direct sales and major account teams did a great job throughout the quarter growing revenues by 10%. National revenues were also equally strong, up 12%.
As Gracia mentioned, our robust product pipeline yielded 5 new products in 2015, delivering customer value and generating revenues. As you know, the total addressable market for service and repair digital advertising for franchise dealers is fairly large and generally unaddressed, estimated to about $250 million, and our entry into this area with RepairPal Certified continues to show strong returns.
Event Positions, another one of our 2015 innovations, is a new opportunity with an emphasis on mobile that provides customers an opportunity to dominate a specific targeted geography for a 7-day period. This product has far exceeded our expectations, outperforming projected revenue by 230% in the second half of 2015. This is evidence that Cars.com is delivering solutions that meet our customers' needs.
Looking ahead, our sell and trade solutions allow us to help consumers sell their vehicles quickly and help dealers acquire inventory. They were tested largely in the fourth quarter and based on strong test results and national launch that's scheduled for the first quarter of 2016 with a total addressable market of about 380 million.
At the same time, we've continued to move to a more responsive design on our website, which ultimately provides a more consistent user experience for consumers across all device types.
As part of our multifaceted digital advertising strategy, our Cars.com on-the-lot report continues to help quantify the influence that we're having on walk-in shoppers by using geofence technology to move beyond basic lead generation measurement. And through our ad modernization efforts, additional advertising units will be available on the Cars.com mobile properties. This is designed to capture new revenues as consumers continue to migrate to the use of mobile devices.
We've achieved several major accomplishments at this year's North American International Auto Show in Detroit, where we hosted our annual Best of Awards show for manufacturers and other automotive businesses. Selected by the company's editorial experts, these awards are designed to help shoppers across a variety of segments and budgets choose the best vehicle for their needs. Award categories include the Best of 2016, Best Pickup Truck for 2016, Eco-Friendly Car of the Year, the Family Car of the Year, the Luxury Car of the Year and the Play Car of the Year. This show is now in its sixth year, and the Best of Awards has been one of the most talked about events during the Detroit Auto Show, drawing an audience of over 1,000 attendees.
This year, we hosted CEOs from BMW and Volvo as well as a dozen of C-suite executives from other car companies and related businesses, in addition to our editorial team covered the auto show in full force and published 65 articles and 16 videos highlighting the biggest news from the press days.
Our coverage of the auto show didn't stop there. We unveiled a brand-new online video series called Car Kids, which features 2 very young reporters hitting the show floor to offer their take on the hottest cars through humor-filled clips and interviews with manufacturer executives. Most importantly, the auto show provides us an opportunity to connect directly with OEMs. And in doing so, we're able to discuss some of the macro trends, expanded diversified revenue stream and new partnership opportunities. We gain valuable insights on the industry. And with a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of vehicles growing, Tier 2 OEM budgets have increased. We've added coverage from both a sales and support level to help capture these regional dealers association advertising dollars across the country. With targeted messaging becoming much easier to execute, our platforms become a great place to get regionally focused offers and messaging to consumers in the lines of these advertisements.
As manufacturers and agencies begin to build teams to analyze the vast amount of data being captured in real-time, we're having important conversations about the ways in which data with its incredibly valuable intent signals can become productized. Manufacturers and their agencies are looking for more streamlined access to content and data. And if we can provide it to them, we have a win-win opportunity where we can boast their brands and bolster the Cars.com brand in the process.
As you can see, we have several reasons to be optimistic about 2016, and our new products continue to gain traction and our pipeline of innovative ideas continues to grow. As previously discussed, we expect to deliver revenue growth of 10% or more in 2016 through new product development and continued innovation. While growth may not be evenly dispersed from quarter-to-quarter, we're confident in our projections to remain on target.
With that, let me turn over to Victoria for a detailed financial review."
20571,325031717,933894,"TEGNA Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2016",2016-02-16,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone.

The strength of our businesses during the fourth quarter give us great confidence for 2016 and beyond. We're very pleased with our fourth quarter financial results despite being up against challenging year-over-year comparisons due to the absence of significant political advertising spending that benefited us during the fourth quarter of 2014.
Before I review our consolidated financial results as well as capital allocation during the quarter, I'd like to highlight several special items, which totaled $62 million during the fourth quarter of 2015, with GAAP EPS benefit of $0.16 per share, primarily related to a gain on the sale of the corporate headquarters building, offset in part by workforce restructuring, facility consolidation and impairment charges. 
Now let's briefly review the operating results for the quarter. As a reminder, although I'll be focusing on our non-GAAP performance results today, you can find all of our reported data and comparatives in our press release. Also, as we mentioned during the last earnings call, we converted to a calendar year after the spin of our publishing assets in June. As a result, the fourth quarter results include the impact an additional 4 days, contributing about $10 million to Media Segment revenues with an EPS benefit of about $0.01.
During the quarter, with solid performances by both Digital and Media Segments, we achieved earnings per share of $0.53. Year-over-year, earnings per share were up 8%, driven by organic growth at Cars.com and despite the challenging year-over-year political comparison in TEGNA Media. Total company revenues of $805 million were down 4% year-over-year. But it's important to note that excluding the impact of record nonpresidential political advertising revenue during the prior year, total revenues were, in fact, up 6%, driven by continued growth in retransmission as well as higher digital and core revenues within the Media Segment as well as strong Cars.com revenues.
During the quarter, total company operating expenses of $549 million were lower by 4% over last year, mainly due to seasonally lower quarter -- fourth quarter marketing costs at Cars.com and direct cost reductions at CareerBuilder as well as the absence of publishing, back-office-related stranded costs, which impacted expenses during the fourth quarter of last year.
Now let's turn to a more detailed review of Media and Digital Segment results. As we previously noted, largely due to the absence of record nonpresidential political revenues of over $92 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, TEGNA Media revenues of $462 million declined by 7% year-over-year, in line with our previous comments on our last call. However, excluding the impacts of political advertising compared to the fourth quarter last year, Media Segment revenues would have been up by about 12%.
Retransmission fees, boosted by retransmission agreements negotiated during the second half of last year and annual rate increases, were up 27% to a historical high of $120 million during the fourth quarter.
Beyond this, TEGNA Media digital advertising revenues were also up 15% driven by digital marketing services, which continued to gain traction across all our television stations, driven by G/O Digital sales, extended reach networks and national digital revenues.
Core advertising was also up by about 7%, in part due to the impact of political displacement last year. Our strongest revenue categories for fourth quarter included auto, professional services, entertainment, medical services and home improvement.
Now focusing on Q1 2016 projections. Based on current trends, we expect a growth in Media Segment revenues for the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015 to be in the range of 10% to 12%, driven by increases in political advertising, retransmission revenue and digital revenue. Core advertising is expected to be about the same as the first quarter last year, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of Super Bowl advertising, which aired on our 11 CBS stations in 2016 versus our 17 NBC stations in 2015. Excluding the impact of the Super Bowl, the percentage growth in core advertising is expected to be up in the low single digits.
During the fourth quarter, the Media Segment operating expenses were up 4% year-over-year due to increased programming costs, investment in our digital sales initiatives, including sales force expansion and newly launched product offerings.
During the quarter, Digital Segment revenue on a pro forma basis, excluding the impacts of the sale of PointRoll and adjusting for exchange rates, increased by 2% year-over-year, reflecting continued growth at Cars.com, offset by revenue declines at CareerBuilder.
During the quarter, Cars.com revenues increased by 6%, in line with our comments in December and our previous earnings call. These results reflect strong market penetration in direct sales markets, the continued success of new products, such as RepairPal Certified and Event Positions, as well as increased purchasing of display advertising by auto manufacturers. These increases were partly offset by the absence of wholesale price increases, which occurred in the first quarter of 2016 but occurred during the fourth quarter last year at the time the transaction closed.
As Matt mentioned, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the intentionally lower sales of lower-margin transaction products, CareerBuilder revenues would have been slightly up year-over-year. 
With these impacts, CareerBuilder's revenues declined 4% on a constant currency basis.
Digital Segment operating expenses were down 2% due to a slight increase in expenses at Cars.com, primarily driven by revenue growth, partly offset by direct cost reductions, reflecting lower revenues at CareerBuilder.
As a result, we achieved solid adjusted EBITDA of $306 million this quarter for the total company, and our EBITDA margin of 38% was relatively unchanged year-over-year despite the negative impacts of the absence of significantly higher-margin political revenues that benefited last year.
Our capital investments during the quarter of $44 million reflect our ongoing commitment to our business priorities, including digital development, media content, product integration and platform enhancements as well as several real estate initiatives, which produced immediate cost savings.
For the year, $98 million was invested in capital projects, including onetime build-out impacts of the relocation of our Seattle television station to a more appropriately sized space.
During the quarter, strong cash flow from operations, combined with the proceeds from the sale of our headquarters building and the sales of some small noncore businesses, were used to pay off $180 million in 2018 senior notes while funding accelerated share repurchases of $70 million at an average price of $26.78, interest payments of $82 million and to make investments in business initiatives of $44 million. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt stood at $4.2 billion and cash on the balance sheet was $129 million.
As we look ahead to 2016, as Gracia and Dave both noted, we expect it to be a banner year. Although we are still in the early stages of the campaign cycle, we project total Media Segment revenues to increase in the high-teens to low-20% range for the year. Also, we expect 10-plus percent revenue growth at Cars.com with CareerBuilder driving low to mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2016 through the adoption of their SaaS-based suite of products, which ramps throughout the year. All of these drivers will contribute meaningfully to growth in total company revenues in the low- to mid-teen range year-over-year. 
On the cost front, we expect total company expenses to increase in the range of 8% to 10%, reflecting primarily higher revenues as we expand in richer content as well as broader products and features across our media and digital businesses. Beyond this, we'll see increased programming costs resulting from new affiliation agreements negotiated during the second half of 2015.
Capital expenditures for 2016 are expected to be in the range of $85 million to $95 million, a bit lower than 2015 due to fewer real estate projects planned for the year. Once again, in 2016, we expect the majority of our capital expenditures to be invested in digital development, media content, product integration and platform enhancement.
For 2016, depreciation is projected to be approximately $90 million to $95 million and amortization of $110 million. Interest expense will be -- will total nearly $235 million. As previously discussed, the tax rate is anticipated to be roughly in the 35% to 36% range in 2016, though it will vary quarter-to-quarter.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for her closing remarks prior to the Q&A."

Good morning, everyone, and let me add my welcome to our call. This morning, I'm going to provide some highlights on our overall performance and each of our businesses and then I'll be turning it over to our business heads: Dave Lougee, President of TEGNA Media; Alex Vetter, CEO of Cars.com; and Matt Fergusons, CEO of CareerBuilder. They'll do a deep dive on each of their respective areas and then Victoria will touch on the financial highlights for the quarter at the end. So let's get right into it.
Our progress in our first 6 months as a highly focused media and digital company has been very strong. When we made the decision to separate our businesses into 2, we had a very specific vision in mind for TEGNA. And when we held our Investor Day in June, we were confident in the expectations and projects we laid out for you. But we know that for all of you, confidence does not necessarily equate to absolute certainty. But in just 6 short months, we have removed a great deal of those uncertainties, including those around our affiliation agreements and retransmission fees and replaced them with certainties for years to come. We have even more confidence that we have built a strong foundation that will enable us to capitalize on the rapidly growing demand in the industries we serve, a foundation that best leverages our unique mix of advantages, including top-performing assets, scale and partnerships, which give us the tremendous negotiating platform you've seen over the last several months; high margins and consistently strong and dependable cash flows; experienced industry experts running each of our businesses; and a shareholder-focused capital structure. Now we've leveraged those strengths to create a strong platform that can and will support our growth throughout 2016 and beyond.
So let's turn to fourth quarter results. Company-wide, as you saw, our revenue totaled about $805 million. Now there were lots of ins and outs as you probably saw in the press release. TEGNA Media had to overcome a record level of $92 million of political revenue in the fourth quarter last year, which masked otherwise strong results; double-digit increases in retransmission and online revenues; and higher core advertising. When you exclude that impact of the unfavorable political spending comparison, TEGNA Media revenues would have been up 12%.
Now our Digital Segment revenue was impacted by the sale of our PointRoll business, which we completed in November. And as you can see on Page 4 of our press release this morning, we show that excluding PointRoll from both the 2014 and 2015 fourth quarter periods and adjusting for exchange rates, so on a pro forma constant currency basis, Digital Segment revenues were over 2% higher.
New product launches and revenue growth at Cars.com, higher revenue per dealer at Cars.com was offset by a revenue decline at CareerBuilder as it continues its transition toward higher-margin Software-as-a-Service solutions and builds a leadership position in that space.
As you probably saw, expenses in the quarter were down over 4% on a non-GAAP basis. Now you've heard me say it quarter-after-quarter, but I think it bears repeating, our disciplined and proven approach to managing expenses and ensuring we are optimizing the efficiency of our operations while investing fully in our future will continue to be an important tenet of our strategy while we successfully grow our businesses.
Equally important, EBITDA was strong and our EBITDA margin of 38% was comparable to the fourth quarter of last year, despite the absence of substantial higher-margin political spending.
Another important pillar of our strategy is a commitment to a shareholder-friendly capital allocation structure. As you saw in October, we announced a $75 million increase in our share repurchase programming -- program, bringing it up to $825 million, which will be used over the original 3-year term ending in June 2018. The increase reflects a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our corporate headquarters, which enabled us to increase the return of cash to our shareholders, while at the same time, strengthening our balance sheet through debt reduction.
As we've noted before, we have more than ample financial flexibility to pay our dividend, repurchase shares based on business conditions and new opportunities, reduce debt and invest in our businesses.
Now I'd like to switch gears for a moment and provide you with a handful of highlights on each of our businesses before turning it over to Dave, Alex and Matt.
As you saw, TEGNA Media achieved revenues in line with our previous guidance, driven by, as I noted, core advertising revenue growth, double-digit digital revenue growth and very strong retransmission revenue, due in part to our recently completed agreements. Additionally, I would be remiss not to mention that TEGNA Media was named Station Group of the Year for 2015 by Broadcasting & Cable based on our outstanding group of local television stations that have fantastic reporting, leading ratings and financial results and an innovative strategic approach. We are very proud of our team, and I want to congratulate Dave and his entire team on this well-deserved honor in a very strong year. 
2016 is looking to be even more promising for a number of reasons. First, the outcomes of all of our recent network affiliation agreements and several carriage agreements have been consistent with and, in some cases, exceeded the long-term projections we outlined at our Investor Day in June. Not only are our successful negotiations a testament to the high demand for the engaging content we provide, more importantly, they replace the uncertainty around TEGNA Media that may have existed several months ago with absolute longer-term certainty.
As you saw in January, we reached an agreement with NBC, of which we are the largest independent affiliate group. We are thrilled that we are set to deliver NBC's outstanding content from sports to news to prime time for years to come.
We also in the quarter secured multiyear agreements for continued carriage of TEGNA Media television stations on DirecTV and AT&T U-verse and DISH Network at more appropriately favorable rates. And as you know, this summer, we announced the renewal of our agreements with CBS for 10 TEGNA Media markets nationwide. TEGNA will participate in the CBS All Access video-on-demand service. And we believe that partnering with CBS on both of these fronts ensures that TEGNA audiences have access to must-see content on all their devices.
Now our rising retransmission revenues and successful negotiations are driven by our track record for delivering best-in-class content. As a result, we've gone one step further and have successfully entered the content creation arena with the T.D. Jakes Show. We took a terrific personality, created and produced a talk show around him and aired it on 4 of our local stations. Dave is going to provide some additional details. But from my perspective, this is a testament to our ability to deliver home-grown content, which further diversifies our business and ensures an ongoing stream of quality programming for our audiences.
Yet another reason we are very optimistic about 2016 is our outstanding positioning for the upcoming presidential election as well as the Summer Olympics, which will air on NBC. TEGNA is very well positioned in the key battleground states to take a larger share of political ad spending going forward.
As Dave will highlight, we will have a tremendous platform and set of stations in this election. We, of course, expect a significantly more substantial impact in 2016 and are looking forward to a record-breaking year.
Turning now to Cars.com. We continue to see strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter. We fully expect this positive growth trajectory to continue, and we're looking ahead to a strong 2016. We anticipate revenue growth of 10%-plus for the full year through new product development and continued innovation. In fact, we introduced 5 new products over the course of 2015, each of which continues to show strong returns. Alex will provide further details on our new products and other strategic initiatives in just a few moments.
Moving to CareerBuilder. 2015, as we've said, represented a transformative year. We launched the world's first and only pre-hire platform and new recruitment software products, shifting a majority of our business toward higher growth, stickier higher-margin solutions. We also unveiled an exciting new look and feel for our brand that aligns with our new Software-as-a-Service-focused strategy.
CareerBuilder is fast becoming a leading global HR Software-as-a-Service company with a presence in more than 60 markets worldwide, a move that complements and enhances its successful job board business. Matt's going to provide you with an update on ongoing transition in just a few moments.
But now let me turn it over to Dave Lougee for his comments on TEGNA Media. Dave?"
20571,325031717,934086,"TEGNA Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 16, 2016",2016-02-16,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Gracia. Let me begin by giving more color on the certainty that Gracia referenced. We finished 2015 by concluding key strategic negotiations with our largest network partners and some of our largest distribution partners. Specifically, we successf",973,"Thanks, Gracia. Let me begin by giving more color on the certainty that Gracia referenced. We finished 2015 by concluding key strategic negotiations with our largest network partners and some of our largest distribution partners. Specifically, we successfully negotiated retransmission consent agreements covering 58% of our distributors paying subscribers. We also reached a long-term agreement with our largest network partner, NBC, and earlier had reached an agreement with CBS. Both network deals true up all the TEGNA stations and former Belo stations under single coterminous contracts.
In the case of CBS, you may recall that the Belo stations agreement went until the beginning of 2017 and they'll continue to operate this year, 2016, under the same financial terms of the previous agreement.
In the case of NBC, it's the inverse of CBS. The original TEGNA stations agreement didn't expire until January 2017, and that contract did not include reverse comp. So even under a new agreement, those original TEGNA stations will not begin paying reverse comp until January of next year, while the former Belo stations under NBC, which were already paying reverse comp under their previous NBC agreement, now fall under the financial terms of the new agreement.
So the net of all these deals is this: between our NBC and CBS deals this year and our ABC agreement the year before, the reverse comp part of our equation is set for years to come with our largest partner, NBC, going out to early 2021. That, combined with the 58% of our subs renewed, 31% of which go out to late 2020, means that we have, as Gracia said, certainty and stability around the retransmission piece of our business for the long term and in line with our overall model outlined at Investor Day last summer at the time of our company's split.
And a final word on retrans. As I've said before, our trends on subscriber numbers look materially different than most, if not all, cable channels, and that's for 2 important reasons. One, given the geographic nature of our portfolio following the Belo acquisition, we're adding homes and population growth. But the second dynamic is the fact that there appears to be far more cord shavers than cord cutters. MVPDs are moving many of their video subscribers to basic tier packages that only include broadcasters, and that has some very key potential long-term implications in ad dollar allocations as there will be a growing gap in the size of distribution for us versus cable channels.
Now let's turn to 2016 and other topics, and I'll start with political, as Gracia referenced. Our footprint for the primaries, like the later general election, is superb. Specifically, between now and March 26 -- 22, we have presidential primaries in 31 of our 38 markets. Our total spending, of course, is hard to predict, as anything with this election is hard to predict, as you know, but we know it will end up at record levels for the primary season. Between political, net retrans, the Olympics and digital sales growth, TEGNA Media will have a record year.
Further driving our growth in '16 is a series of key initiatives we're investing in that leverage the scale we've been able to achieve. First, content innovation. We're taking a development mindset to our core news product. We have 8 pilots in production that are not married to traditional news formats. For example, KARE 11 in Minneapolis just recently launched our first pilot, Breaking the News. We launched that in January. In its first 3 weeks, it's already the #1 news show in its time period.
Second, sales transformation. Through centralized world-class pricing and sophisticated marketing capabilities, we're putting the right tools and the right pitches in the hands of our local clients. In the fourth quarter, we completed the staffing of our centralized sales marketing team called Hatch. With Hatch, we're leveraging our local relationships across all our markets to sell larger marketing-based solutions that go well beyond traditional TV ad dollars. We estimate that for every dollar in advertising at our local markets, there's $3 in marketing. 
In addition, our new in-house business intelligence team is ramping up quickly, building a proprietary pricing platform to increase the yield and value of TEGNA Media's inventory.
Together, we expect the Hatch and proprietary pricing initiatives to generate about $25 million to $30 million of incremental EBITDA this year. And as I outlined last summer at Investor Day, these initiatives will accelerate in 2017 and '18 and will be accompanied by significant EBITDA growth from other core and adjacent initiatives underway.
Now let's turn to the original program that Gracia referenced. TEGNA Media is the first broadcaster to own 100% of a syndicated daytime property, T.D. Jakes. Beyond the 29 TEGNA Media markets we'll initially launched in, we've signed an additional 13 markets and the number continues to grow. Between Facebook and Twitter, T.D. Jakes has a loyal social following of more than 7 million people, which we will be leveraging for both show content and promotion.
And social media is now at the core of all we do. And in fact, in 2015, we, in the aggregate, were 1 of Facebook's top 5 largest media players, generating more engagement than national players like CNN and New York Times. In fact, KUSA, our Denver station, had the #1 Facebook post of any local news organization in 2015, a post that generated more than 4 million interactions.
And on the monetization side, our success in digital content creation offers us new opportunities with off-platform publishers. We've agreed with Facebook to be one of the first local broadcasters to participate in their Instant Articles beta program, and we're engaging an off-platform publishing conversation with many others as well.
And with that, let me turn it over to Matt from CareerBuilder."

In addition to rolling out new software solutions, we're elevating our brand visibility through high-profile sponsorships like the CareerBuilder Challenge PGA tournament, TV advertising and community outreach. We're excited about the launch of findyourcalling.com As we know, students today graduate with more than $30,000 in debt. CareerBuilder created a free site that enables students to view easy-to-use, real-time labor market data for any occupation that matches their interest, from job growth projection, salary ranges and businesses that are hiring to programs that they can apply to today. We're partnering with high schools around the country to help students make better decisions about majors degrees in schools so that they have the outcomes they want once they enter the labor force.
We're also helping to re-skill enough skilled workers of all ages so we can raise income levels of individuals, families and communities and help close the skills gap in the United States. We recently announced a partnership with Capella University that will enable workers to develop skills in in-demand fields in less than 3 months at little cost through intensive online training. We're helping workers develop 21st century skills for 21st century jobs, such as web development and information security, and believe this will have a lasting impact on the labor market. 
Overall, we expect our revenue growth in 2016 to be in the mid-single digits and reach double digits by the end of 2017.
As Gracia said, 2015 was a transitional year for us as we made calculated, strategic moves to facilitate more robust revenue growth in the future. We generated just under $700 million in revenue, which was essentially flat year-over-year when you exclude the impact of currency. We expected this as we moved away from some low-margin transactional revenue and focused on higher-margin platform solutions.
I'll give you an example of one of those that I discussed in the last earnings call. We saw a year-over-year decline of $18.6 million in revenue or 2.5 percentage points in 2015 in our employer services unit. We moved from a transactional offering for sourcing and screening candidates to platform-based one that has longer commitments and builds in software.
Our platform Source and Screen business has grown sequentially over the last several months, and we have enough book business to estimate that March revenue will be up year-over-year around 10%. Based on this trend, we believe we're on track to grow $7 million in this business line in 2016 or about 1 percentage point as we had projected earlier.
In 2015, we also were impacted by moving several thousand low-margin transactional advertising accounts from our field sales force to a group that focuses exclusively on these accounts. It was disruptive for some clients and others were no longer a fit. Fortunately, since that move, the business is flat sequentially rather than declining, but it's still weighing on 2015 results. If you remove that currency impact, the Source and Screen revenue I discussed earlier and the low-margin transactional accounts we moved to that specialized group, our business was actually up 4.6% year-over-year in 2015.
Overall, we recognize the job business will continue to experience pricing pressure at the unit level in 2016. However, we included that pricing pressure in our projections. We have a lot of opportunities to go after more job volume, though the price per unit will be lower as we move into less skilled jobs.
Moreover, we've seen good growth in our software solutions in our résumé database in 2015, and we expect that to continue. We believe we are through most of the transition and are set up for growth again in the coming year with a more seasoned sales force.
We'll also continue to pursue key acquisitions and roll out new software products. We believe we will see double-digit growth in our SaaS-based products in 2016. That's our software solutions line, résumé database and employer services, which will lead to revenue growth in the mid-single digits in 2016 and 10% growth by the end of 2017.
We're excited about the opportunities ahead as we break new ground in the industry. And at this point, I'd like to turn it over to Alex Vetter from Cars.com."

We're very pleased to close out 2015 on such a strong footing. The strong growth has primarily been driven by increased dealer market penetration, new products and increased purchase of display advertising.
We achieved solid growth in Q4 as our direct sales and major account teams did a great job throughout the quarter growing revenues by 10%. National revenues were also equally strong, up 12%.
As Gracia mentioned, our robust product pipeline yielded 5 new products in 2015, delivering customer value and generating revenues. As you know, the total addressable market for service and repair digital advertising for franchise dealers is fairly large and generally unaddressed, estimated to about $250 million, and our entry into this area with RepairPal Certified continues to show strong returns.
Event Positions, another one of our 2015 innovations, is a new opportunity with an emphasis on mobile that provides customers an opportunity to dominate a specific targeted geography for a 7-day period. This product has far exceeded our expectations, outperforming projected revenue by 230% in the second half of 2015. This is evidence that Cars.com is delivering solutions that meet our customers' needs.
Looking ahead, our sell and trade solutions allow us to help consumers sell their vehicles quickly and help dealers acquire inventory. They were tested largely in the fourth quarter and based on strong test results and national launch that's scheduled for the first quarter of 2016 with a total addressable market of about 380 million.
At the same time, we've continued to move to a more responsive design on our website, which ultimately provides a more consistent user experience for consumers across all device types.
As part of our multifaceted digital advertising strategy, our Cars.com on-the-lot report continues to help quantify the influence that we're having on walk-in shoppers by using geofence technology to move beyond basic lead generation measurement. And through our ad modernization efforts, additional advertising units will be available on the Cars.com mobile properties. This is designed to capture new revenues as consumers continue to migrate to the use of mobile devices.
We've achieved several major accomplishments at this year's North American International Auto Show in Detroit, where we hosted our annual Best of Awards show for manufacturers and other automotive businesses. Selected by the company's editorial experts, these awards are designed to help shoppers across a variety of segments and budgets choose the best vehicle for their needs. Award categories include the Best of 2016, Best Pickup Truck for 2016, Eco-Friendly Car of the Year, the Family Car of the Year, the Luxury Car of the Year and the Play Car of the Year. This show is now in its sixth year, and the Best of Awards has been one of the most talked about events during the Detroit Auto Show, drawing an audience of over 1,000 attendees.
This year, we hosted CEOs from BMW and Volvo as well as a dozen of C-suite executives from other car companies and related businesses, in addition to our editorial team covered the auto show in full force and published 65 articles and 16 videos highlighting the biggest news from the press days.
Our coverage of the auto show didn't stop there. We unveiled a brand-new online video series called Car Kids, which features 2 very young reporters hitting the show floor to offer their take on the hottest cars through humor-filled clips and interviews with manufacturer executives. Most importantly, the auto show provides us an opportunity to connect directly with OEMs. And in doing so, we're able to discuss some of the macro trends, expanded diversified revenue stream and new partnership opportunities. We gain valuable insights on the industry. And with a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of vehicles growing, Tier 2 OEM budgets have increased. We've added coverage from both a sales and support level to help capture these regional dealers association advertising dollars across the country. With targeted messaging becoming much easier to execute, our platforms become a great place to get regionally focused offers and messaging to consumers in the lines of these advertisements.
As manufacturers and agencies begin to build teams to analyze the vast amount of data being captured in real-time, we're having important conversations about the ways in which data with its incredibly valuable intent signals can become productized. Manufacturers and their agencies are looking for more streamlined access to content and data. And if we can provide it to them, we have a win-win opportunity where we can boast their brands and bolster the Cars.com brand in the process.
As you can see, we have several reasons to be optimistic about 2016, and our new products continue to gain traction and our pipeline of innovative ideas continues to grow. As previously discussed, we expect to deliver revenue growth of 10% or more in 2016 through new product development and continued innovation. While growth may not be evenly dispersed from quarter-to-quarter, we're confident in our projections to remain on target.
With that, let me turn over to Victoria for a detailed financial review."

We're very pleased with our fourth quar",1401,"Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia has already mentioned, 2015 was a monumental year for TEGNA. The strength of our businesses during the fourth quarter give us great confidence for 2016 and beyond. We're very pleased with our fourth quarter financial results despite being up against challenging year-over-year comparisons due to the absence of significant political advertising spending that benefited us during the fourth quarter of 2014.
Before I review our consolidated financial results as well as capital allocation during the quarter, I'd like to highlight several special items, which totaled $62 million during the fourth quarter of 2015, with GAAP EPS benefit of $0.16 per share, primarily related to a gain on the sale of the corporate headquarters building, offset in part by workforce restructuring, facility consolidation and impairment charges. 
Now let's briefly review the operating results for the quarter. As a reminder, although I'll be focusing on our non-GAAP performance results today, you can find all of our reported data and comparatives in our press release. Also, as we mentioned during the last earnings call, we converted to a calendar year after the spin of our publishing assets in June. As a result, the fourth quarter results include the impact an additional 4 days, contributing about $10 million to Media Segment revenues with an EPS benefit of about $0.01.
During the quarter, with solid performances by both Digital and Media Segments, we achieved earnings per share of $0.53. Year-over-year, earnings per share were up 8%, driven by organic growth at Cars.com and despite the challenging year-over-year political comparison in TEGNA Media. Total company revenues of $805 million were down 4% year-over-year. But it's important to note that excluding the impact of record nonpresidential political advertising revenue during the prior year, total revenues were, in fact, up 6%, driven by continued growth in retransmission as well as higher digital and core revenues within the Media Segment as well as strong Cars.com revenues.
During the quarter, total company operating expenses of $549 million were lower by 4% over last year, mainly due to seasonally lower quarter -- fourth quarter marketing costs at Cars.com and direct cost reductions at CareerBuilder as well as the absence of publishing, back-office-related stranded costs, which impacted expenses during the fourth quarter of last year.
Now let's turn to a more detailed review of Media and Digital Segment results. As we previously noted, largely due to the absence of record nonpresidential political revenues of over $92 million in the fourth quarter of 2014, TEGNA Media revenues of $462 million declined by 7% year-over-year, in line with our previous comments on our last call. However, excluding the impacts of political advertising compared to the fourth quarter last year, Media Segment revenues would have been up by about 12%.
Retransmission fees, boosted by retransmission agreements negotiated during the second half of last year and annual rate increases, were up 27% to a historical high of $120 million during the fourth quarter.
Beyond this, TEGNA Media digital advertising revenues were also up 15% driven by digital marketing services, which continued to gain traction across all our television stations, driven by G/O Digital sales, extended reach networks and national digital revenues.
Core advertising was also up by about 7%, in part due to the impact of political displacement last year. Our strongest revenue categories for fourth quarter included auto, professional services, entertainment, medical services and home improvement.
Now focusing on Q1 2016 projections. Based on current trends, we expect a growth in Media Segment revenues for the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015 to be in the range of 10% to 12%, driven by increases in political advertising, retransmission revenue and digital revenue. Core advertising is expected to be about the same as the first quarter last year, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of Super Bowl advertising, which aired on our 11 CBS stations in 2016 versus our 17 NBC stations in 2015. Excluding the impact of the Super Bowl, the percentage growth in core advertising is expected to be up in the low single digits.
During the fourth quarter, the Media Segment operating expenses were up 4% year-over-year due to increased programming costs, investment in our digital sales initiatives, including sales force expansion and newly launched product offerings.
During the quarter, Digital Segment revenue on a pro forma basis, excluding the impacts of the sale of PointRoll and adjusting for exchange rates, increased by 2% year-over-year, reflecting continued growth at Cars.com, offset by revenue declines at CareerBuilder.
During the quarter, Cars.com revenues increased by 6%, in line with our comments in December and our previous earnings call. These results reflect strong market penetration in direct sales markets, the continued success of new products, such as RepairPal Certified and Event Positions, as well as increased purchasing of display advertising by auto manufacturers. These increases were partly offset by the absence of wholesale price increases, which occurred in the first quarter of 2016 but occurred during the fourth quarter last year at the time the transaction closed.
As Matt mentioned, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the intentionally lower sales of lower-margin transaction products, CareerBuilder revenues would have been slightly up year-over-year. 
With these impacts, CareerBuilder's revenues declined 4% on a constant currency basis.
Digital Segment operating expenses were down 2% due to a slight increase in expenses at Cars.com, primarily driven by revenue growth, partly offset by direct cost reductions, reflecting lower revenues at CareerBuilder.
As a result, we achieved solid adjusted EBITDA of $306 million this quarter for the total company, and our EBITDA margin of 38% was relatively unchanged year-over-year despite the negative impacts of the absence of significantly higher-margin political revenues that benefited last year.
Our capital investments during the quarter of $44 million reflect our ongoing commitment to our business priorities, including digital development, media content, product integration and platform enhancements as well as several real estate initiatives, which produced immediate cost savings.
For the year, $98 million was invested in capital projects, including onetime build-out impacts of the relocation of our Seattle television station to a more appropriately sized space.
During the quarter, strong cash flow from operations, combined with the proceeds from the sale of our headquarters building and the sales of some small noncore businesses, were used to pay off $180 million in 2018 senior notes while funding accelerated share repurchases of $70 million at an average price of $26.78, interest payments of $82 million and to make investments in business initiatives of $44 million. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt stood at $4.2 billion and cash on the balance sheet was $129 million.
As we look ahead to 2016, as Gracia and Dave both noted, we expect it to be a banner year. Although we are still in the early stages of the campaign cycle, we project total Media Segment revenues to increase in the high-teens to low-20% range for the year. Also, we expect 10-plus percent revenue growth at Cars.com with CareerBuilder driving low to mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2016 through the adoption of their SaaS-based suite of products, which ramps throughout the year. All of these drivers will contribute meaningfully to growth in total company revenues in the low- to mid-teen range year-over-year. 
On the cost front, we expect total company expenses to increase in the range of 8% to 10%, reflecting primarily higher revenues as we expand in richer content as well as broader products and features across our media and digital businesses. Beyond this, we'll see increased programming costs resulting from new affiliation agreements negotiated during the second half of 2015.
Capital expenditures for 2016 are expected to be in the range of $85 million to $95 million, a bit lower than 2015 due to fewer real estate projects planned for the year. Once again, in 2016, we expect the majority of our capital expenditures to be invested in digital development, media content, product integration and platform enhancement.
For 2016, depreciation is projected to be approximately $90 million to $95 million and amortization of $110 million. Interest expense will be -- will total nearly $235 million. As previously discussed, the tax rate is anticipated to be roughly in the 35% to 36% range in 2016, though it will vary quarter-to-quarter.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for her closing remarks prior to the Q&A."

This morning, I'm going to provide some highlights on TEGNA's overall performance in each of our businesses and then I'm going to turn it over to our business leads, Dave Lougee, President of TEGNA Media; Alex Vetter, CEO of Cars.com, and Matt Ferguson, CEO of CareerBuilder and they're going do a deep dive on each of their respective businesses and then after that, Victoria will cover the financial highlights.
It's been a busy start to the year. We have made a significant progress on our first 9 months as an independent, focused media and digital company and we are well on our way toward reaching the guidance and achieving the goals that we detailed at our Investor Day last summer and reiterated in early December. We've established new partnerships, launched new products and services, completed new negotiations with important network in the MVPD partners networks and are achieving the record political advertising revenue we've been anticipating for this year. 
Our relentless drive to innovate has helped us remain ahead of the curve and ahead of our competitors as audiences, preferences and trends in content consumption continues to change our industry. 
We continue to harness the uniques strengths we've detailed when TEGNA became an independent company and those included high-quality assets with significant reach, strong margins and reliable significant cash flows, highly regarded industry leaders overseeing the businesses and a shareholder-friendly approach to the allocation of capital. 
So let's turn to the first quarter results. As you saw, companywide revenues were up substantially over last year's first quarter, mainly driven by strong results for TEGNA Media. TEGNA Digital revenue grew as well and also contributed to the strong quarter. 
Operating expenses increased in the first quarter year-over-year and the rise in Media and Digital Segment costs reflect significant investments we are making in the long-term growth and sustainability of our businesses. 
Overall, we continue to do a strong job of strategically investing for growth, while continuing our strong cost discipline. 
As importantly, we continue to grow profitability as well, operating income was up over 20% compared to the same period last year and we achieved an increase of 16% in adjusted EBITDA year-over-year. We also generated $111 million of free cash flow.
So now let me briefly touch on some highlights from each of our individual businesses before turning it over to the team. TEGNA Media revenue growth reached the high end of our guidance for the quarter, driven by substantial growth in retransmission and digital revenue in addition to record first quarter political revenue. As you'll hear from Dave in a few moments, our substantial broadcast footprints positions us to garner a substantial slice of the expanding political advertising pie and we anticipate our record pace will continue for 2016, particularly as we approach the November election. 
Beyond the financials, we made significant strides in our quest for continued innovation is TEGNA. It's within our partnership with a video call center, a pioneer of video color television, we also made a strategic investments in and partnership with [indiscernible], the leader in connecting the sports world to millennium audiences. And also partnered with proud Janco [ph], an innovative, social analytics company. All of these initiatives will allow us to continue to offer diverse, original content that meets our audiences changing preferences for how they access and engage with content.
As I mentioned, Dave will provide some additional detail on TEGNA begin shortly, including our progress on an emerging revenue stream that involves fully integrated marketing campaign. 
Switching now to TEGNA Digital. Cars.com continued its strong growth path with a big quarter from direct sales and major accounts. We are pleased with this strong growth, as with all of our businesses, we are always looking ahead to ensure we are laying the groundwork for the next wave of growth by launching new products and services. 
Cars.com in the quarter launched a new sell and trade product that helps consumers in the process of selling their cars to dealers. Additionally, our previously announced insights products is now up and running as well. And we're also building out additional service and repair features from which we expect to see traction in the back half of the year. 
Now Cars.com has received strong recognition from independent parties, such as JDPower that have recognized the company for its impact on dealers, its cutting-edge website and its overall impact on the industry. Alex will have more on all of this in a few moments. 
Moving to CareerBuilder, the company is continuing its successful push into HR Software-as-a-Service solutions. They have the most comprehensive and integrated offerings in the industry as none of their competitors can offer the same breadth of advertising, software and services, all in one place. 
CareerBuilder continues to make appropriate investments in maintaining its leadership as a one-stop shop for personnel solutions. And last month, it acquired Oracle [ph], a leader in employee background checks. Adding top-tier capabilities and yet another piece of the HR puzzle will attract even more employers to CareerBuilder's one-of-a-kind platform. 
We saw progress at CareerBuilder in the first quarter as total revenues were down just 2%, improved from a 5% decline in the fourth quarter last year. We anticipate continued innovation and significant growth in the SaaS business and for CareerBuilder more broadly and look forward to turning the revenue corner in the second quarter. Matt will be providing a comprehensive update on the quarter and the opportunities that lie ahead for CareerBuilder later in the call. 
So at this point, let me turn it over to Dave Lougee for comments on TEGNA Media."
20571,330692770,964133,"TEGNA Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gracia. On previous calls, I forecasted a record year for TEGNA Media and so far, we are well on track. [indiscernible] revenue in the first quarter finished at a record first quarter level of $15.7 million.

[indiscernible] revenue in the first quarter finished at a record first quarter level of $15.7 million. As we look ahead to the election, our market footprint is a healthy mutual fund of strong swing states like Ohio, Florida, Colorado, North Carolina, Virginia. Additionally, and significantly, a Trump or Cruz nomination on the Republican size will very likely expand the number of U.S. senate in the house seats that will come into play in our markets. And the pack spending for the control of Congress will almost certainly be unprecedented.
Back to the first quarter. The increase in net revenues more than offset a Super Bowl decrease across the TEGNA stations, specifically last year, the game aired in our 17 NBC stations versus our 11 CBS stations this year. So even though the year-to-year Bowl Super Bowl dollars are down simply due to the network change, TEGNA's Super Bowl stations performed very well. Our Super Bowl advertising was 45% above the last Super Bowl pro forma in 2013. Excluding the Super Bowl delta, core revenue finished up slightly above last year for the quarter.
As previously noted, we have several initiatives underway, which we expect to contribute $25 million to $30 million in EBITDA in 2016 and continue to grow from there. One of those initiatives and the fastest-growing aspect of our core business is Hatch revenue. Those are dollars associated with the sale of fully integrated multiplatform marketing campaigns that target clients' marketing budgets for versus more traditional transaction-based advertising budget. In the first quarter alone, we closed 81 campaign deals compared to 83 all of last year and its ramping fast. The value of those deals we closed in the first quarter was more than double what we closed in the fourth quarter.
Just to give you a sense for how the Hatch program has resonated, we've sold one single campaign to 10 different verticals. So this ability to develop and produce local integrated marketing campaigns at scale through a centralized service in Dallas is becoming a game changer for us in getting new local marketing dollars that wouldn't have an available to us in the past. 
Our progress on the revenue front is supporting brand new approaches to content as well. We're in the midst of a large scale content transformation effort that centers around the development of original programming for every screen. In the entertainment syndication space, we are on track for a fall premier of TV Jake's. TV Jake's is a unique voice in American culture and the program is already showing signs of success. We'll be clearing this show on 53 stations, 30 of those are TEGNA stations and 23 are nonTEGNA stations from 13 different station groups. And then our local news time periods, we're innovating there, too. As is discussed last quarter, Care 11 [ph] in Minneapolis will replace the popular syndicated show in the 6:30 p.m. time period with an all-new innovative program called Breaking the News. This unique talent-driven interactive newscast has become a hit in the very short time. The audience response and revenue gains generated by the show is strong and we expect to see a $0.5 million in incremental revenue above the show replaced.
We're also proud of our team in Atlanta. WXIA crated the groundbreaking, digital-only series called Inside the Triangle, which documented how Atlanta's wealthiest suburbs are impacted by teenage heroine addiction. We initially released the Triangle only on our digital platforms. In its just first week, it was discovered by many, many viewers. The series attracted 4 million page views and 200,000 video views at just that first week. And then from digital, we migrated the series to the linear network where it again received tremendous audience response and spurred a national dialogue around heroine addiction. 
And last week, a one-man band investigative journalist from Atlanta, won a prestigious Peabody award for an investigative series on the 9/11 emergency system in Atlanta, a series that used all platforms to engage and inform our audience. 
This type of innovation, especially in digital media, continues to be a key area of focus for us at TEGNA Media. We're leveraging new digital and social technologies every day to improve and reinvent our existing content. We're working with various new digital partners, such as Megaphone and X-item  [ph], which allows us to engage in real-time polling and social interaction with our audience live inside our newscast. 
Alongside our content innovation efforts, our new monetization strategies. In Q1, we were the first Asian group to participate in Facebook's Instant Articles beta. Test, off-platform publishing is a growth area for us that we are aggressively pursuing as a business and marketing strategy.
TEGNA Media is operating a high level of sophistication and urgency. We're maximizing the benefit of our traditional model, but more importantly, we're leveraging the power of disruption to generate new ways of connecting with audiences, advertisers and business partners. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Matt Ferguson from CareerBuilder"

We're off to a good start in 2016, seizing the opportunity in hand as we move aggressively to HR Software-as-a-Service. As I mentioned in the past, CareerBuilder built the world's first and only prehire platform. There's literally no one else in the industry who can offer the same breadth of advertising, software and services in one place. We are delivering the most innovative recruitment experience in the market and customers are very excited because our platform helps them hire faster and easier than before. 
In March of this year, CareerBuilder made a strategic move to expand the scope of that prehire platform offering. We acquired Oracle, a leading provider of background screening and drug testing. This allows us to tackle another critical step in the recruitment process. With our combined technology expertise, we're going to accelerate growth and profitability for this valuable service. 
As the deal closed in March, Oracle had a de minimis impact on Q1 revenue. We're still only a month -- a little over a month in operating the business, so as we spend more time with Oracle, we'll have more guidance on full year impact the next time we speak. 
CareerBuilder also continues to evolve with the business working with employers and consumers in new was that are differentiating us in the market having a positive impact on revenue. In the first quarter, our revenue totaled $171 million, that was down 2% year-over-year. The currency didn't have as big an impact in Q1, when you back out currency were down less than 2%. This is an improvement compared to the fourth quarter where revenue declined 5% year-over-year.
Our software solutions continue to experience strong growth. Software invoicing was up 12% year-over-year from December through March in North America. And when you look at customers under contract, that number grew 11% year-over-year in the first quarter in North America, so there's great momentum behind this business. 
As we look forward, it's important to note that we recognized our job posting business will continue to experience pricing pressure at the level in 2016. We've reflected that in our projections. Though the price premium will be lower, there's a good opportunity to increase the job posting inventory on our site as we go after mainstream, high-volume jobs.
CareerBuilder will continue to roll out new cutting-edge software solutions in the coming months and pursue acquisitions to enhance and expand our offering. We fully expect double-digit growth in our SaaS-based products this year, resonate database and our employer services. We're confident that this will lead to revenue growth in the mid-single digits in 2016 and 10% growth by the end of 2017 as CareerBuilder modernizes and transforms the way companies recruit. 
With that, I'd love to hand it over to Alex Vetter, CEO of Cars.com."

First of all, I'm excited to report that Cars.com's retail revenues were up nearly 10% in the quarter with growth driven by higher market penetration and new product sales.
Our national revenues were also strong, up almost 8% due mainly to an increase in display advertising by auto manufacturers. Including the impact of affiliate, or wholesale revenue performance, our revenues are up 6%. Last year, you may recall, we cycled through a onetime wholesale price increase to out affiliate partners and continue to work with them to improve their performance. But we are on track to deliver 10% growth through new product development and continued innovation.
You may have seen that earlier this year, we released new research to support that Cars.com influence 36% of all vehicle sales in 2015 in the United States. We continue to change the value equation in the market by providing a bridge between consumers, online shopping behavior and offline sales. As Cars.com works to illustrate, the impact that we're having on walk-in traffic to local dealerships across the country.
Our sales, marketing and product teams achieved a record steady performance to last month's National Auto Dealer Association Conference with several major accomplishments. First, our sales team realized more than $1.2 million in annualized product sales, exceeding our goals by over 12% for the 3-day event in Las Vegas, recording the most successful weakened at NDA and Cars.com's history. During an NDA, we officially launched 2 mobile focused solutions to bolster our position. First, our sell and trade product, which allows consumers to sell their vehicles and help dealers acquire inventory via our new mobile app, made a debut at the show and really posted strong results. And we officially launched our lot insights report for dealers, which help them quantify the influence we have on walk-in traffic at the dealership using geofence technology. We're currently the first in the market with this new technology and product iteration and we're working now with both dealers and auto manufacturers to leverage this new insights to help shift their media allocations towards digital.
During the quarter, we were also recognized for our industry-leading successful websites as we've moved our entire business more towards a responsive platform to serve consumers however they just to shop. Cars.com was ranked #3 in the JDPower third-party automotive website evaluation study, placed admirably as the #1 large marketplace site and only behind 2 narrowly specialized niche sites. In addition, we were recognized as the only third-party side in the category that has transition to our responsive design. Now that, that responsive design has taken place, we're eager to see the positive effects in both our consumer experience, our traffic and our SEO. 
Lastly, we continue to bolster our servicing and repair product suite and are currently piloting new features. These features will provide another channel for franchise dealers and auto manufacturers to promote the service offering that they have and to capture a new audience of consumers and a new segment of revenue. The service and repair is fairly large and unaddressed markets estimated about $250 million that we've had strong success starting 2016. 
We'll continue to make our investments in the sell and trade platform, our service and repair offering as well as new innovative mobile solutions. Overall, it was a great quarter for the business and sets the stage for continued growth. 
I'd now like to turn it over to Victoria."

As Gracia already mentioned, we're off to a strong start to what we expect to be a terrific year for TEGNA. We're very pleased with the strong performance of our businesses across both Media and Digital Segments",1230,"Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia already mentioned, we're off to a strong start to what we expect to be a terrific year for TEGNA. 
We're very pleased with the strong performance of our businesses across both Media and Digital Segments. 
Before I review our consolidated financial results, as well as capital allocation during the quarter, I'd like to note that there were just a few operating special items in the quarter, which totaled $10 million, primarily related to a TEGNA video voluntary early retirement program, which began in first quarter and will conclude a bit later this quarter, which reduced GAAP EPS by $0.03 per share. 
Now let's briefly review the operating results for the quarter. As a reminder, although I will be focusing on our non-GAAP performance results today, you can find all our reported data and comparatives in our press release.
With solid performances by both Media and Digital segments, we achieved earnings per share of $0.45, an increase of 88% over last year. Total company revenues of $782 million were up 7% year-over-year. On a pro forma basis, excluding the impact of PointRoll, which was sold at the end of last year, total revenues were up 8% and in line to achieve our full year projection. As you've seen from our release, this is driven by robust growth in the Media Segment's retransmission revenues and record first quarter political advertising revenue as well as continued growth in Cars.com revenue.
During the quarter, total company operating expenses of $569 million were higher by about 2% over last year, mainly due to higher Media programming fees as well as investments in growth initiatives within both the Media and Digital Segments. These were offset in part by significant reductions in corporate expenses, reflecting the absence of publishing related unallocated costs and continued efficiency efforts. 
Now let's turn to more detailed review of Media and Digital Segment results. TEGNA Media revenues increased 12% year-over-year, at the high end of the guidance we provided during the last earnings call, driven by significant growth and retransmission revenues and record first quarter political advertising as well as higher digital revenues.
As Dave mentioned, the Super Bowl revenue this quarter was negatively impacted by the network change from NBC to CBS this year. Excluding the impact of Super Bowl revenue, Media Segment revenues would have been up by about 14% compared to the first quarter of last year. 
Retransmission revenues boosted by agreements negotiated at the end of last year as well as annual rate increases within existing agreements continue to drive revenue growth within the Media Segment, up fully 33% to a historical high of $147 million in the first quarter. We will be negotiating additional retransmission agreements this year, which reflect 44% of our distributed subscriber base. 
Political advertising revenue during the quarter also posted record high results of $60 million, up 151% compared to the same quarter during the last presidential election cycle in 2012.
Beyond this, TEGNA Media digital advertising revenues were also up 16% during the quarter driven by Digital Marketing Services, which continue to gain traction across all our television stations as well as G/O Digital sales, extended reach networks and national digital revenues.
Now focusing on second quarter expectations for TEGNA Media. Based on current trends, we anticipate increases in retransmission revenue, political advertising and digital revenue to result in Media Segment's revenue growth of 10% to 12% for the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015. As you'd expect, revenue growth will, in part, be dependent on the timing of ad spending both within the campaigns as well as for concepts in both the house and the Senate over the balance of the year. 
During the first quarter, Media Segment operating expenses were up 15% year-over-year, primarily due to increased programming expenses and investments in our digital sales initiatives, including a sales force expansion with newly launched product offerings.
In the Digital Segment, during the quarter, Digital Segment revenues on a pro forma basis increased by 4% year-over-year, reflecting continued growth and new product launches at Cars.com. These were offset by revenue reductions and transaction-based product lines at CareerBuilder as it continues its transition toward higher-margin Software-as-a-Service solutions to extend the leadership position in that space. As Matt mentioned, CareerBuilder revenues were down 2% year-over-year, but improved sequentially over fourth quarter of last year and we expect this trajectory to continue as the year progresses, with revenue growth projected to be in the mid-single digits by the end of 2016.
Cars.com revenues sold by its direct sales channels were up 9% during the quarter, including the impact of affiliate revenue performance revenues increased by 6% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing strength in market penetration within the direct sale market and bolstered by the continued success of new products, such as RepairPal Certified and advance positions [ph]. 
National revenue was also strong, up almost 8% due to an increase in display advertising by auto manufacturers. With the new product development and continued innovation as well as strong organic growth, we're expecting Cars.com to reach our previous projection of 10% year-over-year revenue growth for 2016.
Digital Segment operating expenses were up 2% due to an increase in expenses, primarily reflecting accelerating investments in sales force and growth initiatives, partly offset by the absence of PointRoll. Overall, as a result of the solid performance of both segments, we achieved solid adjusted EBITDA of $264 million this quarter, up 16% over last year and our EBITDA margin was 34%, up 260 basis points compared to last year. 
During the quarter, our capital investments were $16 million, reflecting our ongoing commitment to reinvest in business priorities and include digital development, media content, product integration and platform enhancement, including automated sales tools, order tracking and other critical products enhancements.
You'll also note that in the first quarter, our overall tax rate was 32%, including the benefit of implementing the early adoption of a new accounting standards, ASU 201609, that changes certain aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment in order to improve transparency. As a result, all excess tax benefits and tax reduction shortfalls will now be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement as opposed to balance sheet as in paid in capital. The adoption of this accounting standard reduced the first quarter income tax provision by $4 million and the tax rate by 3 percentage points, with an EPS benefit of about $0.02 for the quarter. 
While we need to continue to assess the impact based on equity price fluctuations, the projected tax benefit for the year is about in the range of 1 percentage point at the current stock price, which would put our tax rate for the year at around 34% to 35% range. This will obviously need to continue to be recalibrated each quarter as the stock price and market fluctuates.
During the quarter, strong cash flow from operations was used to fund accelerated share repurchases of $75 million at an average price of $23.89 per share. Dividend payment of $31 million and investments and business initiatives of $16 million. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt stood at $4.2 billion and cash on the balance sheet was $79 million. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for concluding remarks prior to the Q&A."

This morning, I'm going to provide some highlights on TEGNA's overall performance and each of our businesses, and then I'm going to turn it over to our business leads, Dave Lougee, President of TEGNA Media; Alex Vetter, CEO of Cars.com, and Matt Ferguson, CEO of CareerBuilder and they're going do a deep dive on each of their respective businesses. And then after that, Victoria will cover the financial highlights.
It's been a busy start to the year. We have made significant progress on our first 9 months as an independent, focused media and digital company and we are well on our way toward reaching the guidance and achieving the goals that we detailed at our Investor Day last summer and reiterated in early December. We've established new partnerships, launched new products and services, completed negotiations with important network in MVPD partners, and are achieving the record political advertising revenue we've been anticipating for this year. 
Our relentless drive to innovate has helped us remain ahead of the curve and ahead of our competitors as audiences, preferences and trends in content consumption continues to change our industry. 
We continue to harness the unique strengths we've detailed when TEGNA became an independent company, and those included high-quality assets with significant reach, strong margins and reliable significant cash flows, highly regarded industry leaders overseeing the businesses and a shareholder-friendly approach to the allocation of capital. 
So let's turn to the first quarter results. As you saw, companywide revenues were up substantially over last year's first quarter, mainly driven by strong results for TEGNA Media. TEGNA Digital revenue grew as well and also contributed to the strong quarter. 
Operating expenses increased in the first quarter year-over-year and the rise in Media and Digital Segment costs reflect significant investments we are making in the long-term growth and sustainability of our businesses. 
Overall, we continued to do a strong job of strategically investing for growth, while continuing our strong cost discipline. 
As importantly, we continued to grow profitability as well. Operating income was up over 20% compared to the same period last year and we achieved an increase of 16% in adjusted EBITDA year-over-year. We also generated $111 million of free cash flow.
So now let me briefly touch on some highlights from each of our individual businesses before turning it over to the team. TEGNA Media revenue growth reached the high end of our guidance for the quarter, driven by substantial growth in retransmission and digital revenue in addition to record first quarter political revenue. As you'll hear from Dave in a few moments, our substantial broadcast footprint positions us to garner a substantial slice of the expanding political advertising pie, and we anticipate our record pace will continue for 2016, particularly as we approach the November election. 
Beyond the financials, we made significant strides on our quest for continued innovation at TEGNA. We strengthen our partnership with video call center, a pioneer of video color television, we also made a strategic investment in and partnership with Whistle Sports, the leader in connecting the sports world to millennial audiences. And also partnered with CrowdTangle, an innovative social analytics company. All of these initiatives will allow us to continue to offer diverse original content that meets our audiences changing preferences for how they access and engage with content.
As I mentioned, Dave will provide some additional detail on TEGNA Media shortly, including our progress on an emerging revenue stream that involves fully integrated marketing campaigns. 
Switching now to TEGNA Digital. Cars.com continued its strong growth path with a big quarter from direct sales and major accounts. We are pleased with this strong growth, as with all of our businesses, we are always looking ahead to ensure we are laying the groundwork for the next wave of growth by launching new products and services. 
Cars.com in the quarter launched a new sell and trade product that helps consumers in the process of selling their cars to dealers. Additionally, our previously announced Lot's Insights products is now up and running as well. And we're also building out additional service and repair features from which we expect to see traction in the back half of the year. 
Now Cars.com has received strong recognition from independent parties such as JDPower that have recognized the company for its impact on dealers, its cutting-edge website and its overall impact on the industry. Alex will have more on all of this in a few moments. 
Moving to CareerBuilder, the company is continuing its successful push into HR Software-as-a-Service solutions. They have the most comprehensive and integrated offerings in the industry as none of their competitors can offer the same breadth of advertising, software and services, all in one place. 
CareerBuilder continues to make appropriate investments in maintaining its leadership as a one-stop shop for personnel solutions. And last month, it acquired Aurico, a leader in employee background checks. Adding top-tier capabilities and yet another piece of the HR puzzle will attract even more employers to CareerBuilder's one-of-a-kind platform. 
We saw progress at CareerBuilder in the first quarter as total revenues were down just 2%, improved from a 5% decline in the fourth quarter last year. We anticipate continued innovation and significant growth in the SaaS business and for CareerBuilder more broadly, and look forward to turning the revenue corner in the second quarter. Matt will be providing a comprehensive update on the quarter and the opportunities that lie ahead for CareerBuilder later in the call. 
So at this point, let me turn it over to Dave Lougee for comments on TEGNA Media."
20571,330692770,964435,"TEGNA Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gracia. On previous calls, I forecasted a record year for TEGNA Media, and so far, we are well on track. Political revenue in the first quarter finished at a record first quarter level of $15.7 million. As we look ahead to the general election,",856,"Thank you, Gracia. On previous calls, I forecasted a record year for TEGNA Media, and so far, we are well on track. Political revenue in the first quarter finished at a record first quarter level of $15.7 million. As we look ahead to the general election, our market footprint is a healthy mutual fund of strong swing states like Ohio, Florida, Colorado, North Carolina and Virginia. Additionally, and significantly, a Trump or Cruz nomination on the Republican side will very likely expand the number of U.S. senate in the house seats that will come into play in our markets. And the pack spending for the control of Congress will almost certainly be unprecedented.
Back to the first quarter. The increase in net revenues more than offset a Super Bowl decrease across the TEGNA stations, specifically last year the game aired on our 17 NBC stations versus our 11 CBS stations this year. So even though the year-to-year Super Bowl dollars are down simply due to the network change, TEGNA's Super Bowl stations performed very well. Our Super Bowl advertising was 45% above the last Super Bowl pro forma in 2013. Excluding the Super Bowl delta, core revenue finished up slightly above last year for the quarter.
As I previously noted, we have several initiatives underway, which we expect to contribute $25 million to $30 million in EBITDA in 2016 and continue to grow from there. One of those initiatives and the fastest-growing aspect of our core business is Hatch revenue. Those are dollars associated with the sales of fully integrated multiplatform marketing campaigns that target clients' marketing budgets versus the more traditional transaction-based advertising budget. In the first quarter alone, we closed 81 campaign deals compared to 83 all of last year and its ramping fast. The value of those deals we closed in the first quarter was more than double what we closed in the fourth quarter.
Just to give you a sense for how the Hatch program has resonated, we've sold one single campaign to 10 different verticals. So this ability to develop and produce local integrated marketing campaigns at scale through a centralized service in Dallas is becoming a game changer for us in getting new local marketing dollars that wouldn't have been available to us in the past. 
Our progress on the revenue front is supporting brand new approaches to content as well. We're in the midst of a large scale content transformation effort that centers around the development of original programming for every screen. In the entertainment syndication space, we are on track for a fall premier T.D. Jakes. T.D. Jakes is a unique voice in American culture and the program is already showing signs of success. We'll be clearing this show on 53 stations, 30 of those are TEGNA stations and 23 are nonTEGNA stations from 13 different station groups. And then our local news time periods, we're innovating there, too. As I discussed last quarter, KARE 11 in Minneapolis, we've replaced the popular syndicated show in the 6:30 p.m. time period with an all-new innovative program called Breaking the News. This unique talent-driven interactive newscast has become a hit in the very short time. The audience response and revenue gains generated by the show are strong, and we expect to see a $0.5 million in incremental revenue above the show it replaced.
We're also proud of our team in Atlanta. WXIA crated the groundbreaking, digital-only series called Inside the Triangle, which documented how Atlanta's wealthiest suburbs are impacted by teenage heroin addiction. We initially released the Triangle only on our digital platforms. And its just first week, it was discovered by many, many viewers. The series attracted 4 million page views and 200,000 video views at just that first week. And then from digital, we migrated the series to the linear network where it again received tremendous audience response and spurred a national dialogue around heroin addiction. 
And last week, a one-man band investigative journalist from Atlanta, won a prestigious Peabody award for an investigative series on the broken 9/11 emergency system in Atlanta, a series that used all platforms to engage and inform our audience. 
This type of innovation, especially in digital media, continues to be a key area of focus for us at TEGNA Media. We're leveraging new digital and social technologies every day to improve and reinvent our existing content. We're working with various new digital partners such as Megaphone and X-item[ph], which allows us to engage in real-time polling and social interaction with our audience live inside our newscast. 
Alongside our content innovation efforts, our new monetization strategies. In Q1, we were the first Asian group to participate in Facebook's Instant Articles beta test. Off-platform publishing is a growth area for us that we are aggressively pursuing as the business and marketing strategy.
TEGNA Media is operating a high level of sophistication and urgency. We're maximizing the benefit of our traditional model, but more importantly, we're leveraging the power of disruption to generate new ways of connecting with audiences, advertisers and business partners. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Matt Ferguson from CareerBuilder"

We're off to a good start in 2016, seizing the opportunity at hand as we move aggressively into HR Software-as-a-Service. As I've mentioned in the past, CareerBuilder built the world's first and only prehire platform. There's literally no one else in the industry who can offer the same breadth of advertising, software and services in one place. We are delivering the most innovative recruitment experience in the market, and customers are very excited because our platform helps them hire faster and easier than ever before. 
In March of this year, CareerBuilder made a strategic move to expand the scope of that prehire platform offering. We acquired Aurico, a leading provider of background screening and drug testing. This allows us to tackle another critical step in the recruitment process. With our combined technology expertise, we're going to accelerate growth and profitability for this valuable service. 
As the deal closed in March, Aurico had a de minimis impact on Q1 revenue. We're still only a month -- a little over a month into operating the business, so as we spend more time with Aurico, we'll have more guidance on full year impact the next time we speak. 
CareerBuilder also continues to evolve with the business working with employers and consumers in new ways that are differentiating us in the market, having a positive impact on revenue. In the first quarter, our revenue totaled $171 million, that was down 2% year-over-year. The currency didn't have as big an impact in Q1. When you back out currency, we were down less than 2%. This is an improvement compared to the fourth quarter where revenue declined 5% year-over-year.
Our software solutions continue to experience strong growth. Software invoicing was up 12% year-over-year from December through March in North America. And when you look at customers under contract, that number grew 11% year-over-year in the first quarter in North America, so there's great momentum behind this business. 
As we look forward, it's important to note that we recognize our job posting business will continue to experience pricing pressure at the unit level in 2016. We've reflected that in our projections. Though the price premium will be lower, there's a good opportunity to increase the job posting inventory on our site as we go after mainstream, high-volume jobs.
CareerBuilder will continue to roll out new cutting-edge software solutions in the coming months and pursue acquisitions to enhance and expand our offerings. We fully expect double-digit growth in our SaaS-based products this year, resume database and our employer services. We're confident that this will lead to revenue growth in the mid-single digits in 2016 and 10% growth by the end of 2017 as CareerBuilder modernizes and transforms the way companies recruit. 
With that, I'd love to hand it over to Alex Vetter, CEO of Cars.com."

First of all, I'm excited to report that Cars.com's retail revenues were up nearly 10% in the quarter with growth driven by higher dealer market penetration and new product sales.
Our national revenues were also strong, up almost 8% due mainly to an increase in display advertising by auto manufacturers. Including the impact of affiliate or wholesale revenue performance, our revenues are up 6%. Last year, you may recall, we cycled through a onetime wholesale price increase to our affiliate partners and continue to work with them to improve their performance. But we are on track to deliver 10% growth through new product development and continued innovation.
You may have seen that earlier this year, we released new research that supports the Cars.com influence 36% of all vehicle sales in 2015 in the United States. We continue to change the value equation in the market by providing a bridge between consumers, online shopping behavior and offline sales as Cars.com works to illustrate the impact that we're having on walk-in traffic to local dealerships across the country.
Our sales, marketing and product teams achieved a record-setting performance at last month's National Auto Dealer Association Conference with several major accomplishments. First, our sales team realized more than $1.2 million in annualized product sales, exceeding our goals by over 12% for the 3-day event in Las Vegas, recording the most successful weekend at NADA and Cars.com's history. During NADA, we officially launched 2 mobile focused solutions to bolster our position. First, our sell and trade product, which allows consumers to sell their vehicles and help dealers acquire inventory via our new mobile app made the debut at the show and really posted strong results. And we officially launched our Lot Insights report for dealers, which helps them quantify the influence we have on walk-in traffic at the dealership using geofence technology. We're currently the first in the market with this new technology and product iteration and we're working now with both dealers and auto manufacturers to leverage these new insights to help shift their media allocations towards digital.
During the quarter, we were also recognized for our industry-leading successful websites as we've moved our entire business more towards a responsive platform to serve consumers however they choose to shop. Cars.com was ranked #3 in the JDPower third-party automotive website evaluation study, placed admirably as the #1 large marketplace site and only behind 2 narrowly specialized niche sites. In addition, we were recognized as the only third-party site in the category that has transitioned to our responsive design. Now that, that responsive design has taken place, we're eager to see the positive effects in both our consumer experience, our traffic and our SEO. 
Lastly, we continue to bolster our service and repair product suite, and are currently piloting new features. These features will provide another channel for franchise dealers and auto manufacturers to promote the service offerings that they have, and to capture a new audience of consumers and a new segment of revenue. The service and repair is fairly large and unaddressed market estimated at about $250 million that we've had strong success starting 2016. 
We'll continue to make our investments in the sell and trade platform, our service and repair offering as well as new innovative mobile solutions. Overall, it was a great quarter for the business and sets the stage for continued growth. 
I'd now like to turn it over to Victoria."

As Gracia has already mentioned, we're off to a strong start to what we expect to be a terrific year for TEGNA.

As Gracia has already mentioned, we're off to a strong start to what we expect to be a terrific year for TEGNA. 
We're very pleased with the strong performance of our businesses across both Media and Digital Segments. 
Before I review our consolidated financial results as well as capital allocation during the quarter, I'd like to note that there were just a few operating special items in the quarter, which totaled $10 million, primarily related to a TEGNA Media voluntary early retirement program, which began in first quarter and will conclude a bit later this quarter, which reduced GAAP EPS by $0.03 per share. 
Now let's briefly review the operating results for the quarter. As a reminder, although I will be focusing on our non-GAAP performance results today, you can find all of our reported data and comparatives in our press release.
With solid performances by both Media and Digital segments, we achieved earnings per share of $0.45, an increase of 88% over last year. Total company revenues of $782 million were up 7% year-over-year. On a pro forma basis, excluding the impact of PointRoll, which was sold at the end of last year, total revenues were up 8% and in line to achieve our full year projection. And as you've seen from our release, this is driven by robust growth in the Media Segment's retransmission revenues and record first quarter political advertising revenue as well as continued growth in Cars.com revenue.
During the quarter, total company operating expenses of $569 million were higher by about 2% over last year, mainly due to higher Media programming fees as well as investments in growth initiatives within both the Media and Digital Segments. These were offset in part by significant reductions in corporate expenses, reflecting the absence of publishing related unallocated costs and continued efficiency efforts. 
Now let's turn to more detailed review of Media and Digital Segment results. TEGNA Media revenues increased 12% year-over-year, at the high end of the guidance we provided during the last earnings call, driven by significant growth and retransmission revenues and record first quarter political advertising as well as higher digital revenues.
As Dave mentioned, the Super Bowl revenue this quarter was negatively impacted by the network change from NBC to CBS this year. Excluding the impact of Super Bowl revenue, Media Segment revenues would have been up by about 14% compared to the first quarter of last year. 
Retransmission revenues boosted by agreements negotiated at the end of last year as well as annual rate increases within existing agreements continue to drive revenue growth within the Media Segment, up fully 33% to a historical high of $147 million in the first quarter. We will be negotiating additional retransmission agreements this year, which reflect 44% of our distributed subscriber base. 
Political advertising revenue during the quarter also posted record high results of $60 million, up 151% compared to the same quarter during the last presidential election cycle in 2012.
Beyond this, TEGNA Media digital advertising revenues were also up 16% during the quarter driven by Digital Marketing Services, which continue to gain traction across all our television stations as well as G/O Digital sales, extended reach networks and national digital revenues.
Now focusing on second quarter expectations for TEGNA Media. Based on current trends, we anticipate increases in retransmission revenue, political advertising and digital revenue to result in Media Segment's revenue growth of 10% to 12% for the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015. As you'd expect, revenue growth will, in part, be dependent on the timing of ad spending both within the Presidential campaigns as well as for contests in both the house and the Senate over the balance of the year. 
During the first quarter, Media Segment operating expenses were up 15% year-over-year, primarily due to increased programming expenses and investments in our digital sales initiatives, including a sales force expansion with newly launched product offerings.
In the Digital Segment, during the quarter, Digital Segment revenues on a pro forma basis increased by 4% year-over-year, reflecting continued growth and new product launches at Cars.com. These were offset by revenue reductions and transaction-based product lines in CareerBuilder as it continues its transition toward higher-margin Software-as-a-Service solutions to extend the leadership position in that space. As Matt mentioned, CareerBuilder revenues were down 2% year-over-year, but improved sequentially over fourth quarter of last year and we expect this trajectory to continue as the year progresses, with revenue growth projected to be in the mid-single digits by the end of 2016.
Cars.com revenues sold by its direct sales channels were up 9% during the quarter, including the impact of affiliate revenue performance revenues increased by 6% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing strength in market penetration within their direct sale market and bolstered by the continued success of new products such as RepairPal Certified and Event Positions. 
National revenue was also strong, up almost 8% due to an increase in display advertising by auto manufacturers. With the new product development and continued innovation as well as strong organic growth, we're expecting Cars.com to reach our previous projection of 10% year-over-year revenue growth for 2016.
Digital Segment operating expenses were up 2% due to an increase in expenses, primarily reflecting accelerating investments in sales force and growth initiatives, partly offset by the absence of PointRoll. Overall, as a result of the solid performance of both segments, we achieved solid adjusted EBITDA of $264 million this quarter, up 16% over last year and our EBITDA margin was 34%, up 260 basis points compared to last year. 
During the quarter, our capital investments were $16 million, reflecting our ongoing commitment to reinvestment in business priorities and include digital development, media content, product integration and platform enhancement, including automated sales tools, order tracking and other critical products enhancements.
You'll also note that in the first quarter, our overall tax rate was 32%, including the benefit of implementing the early adoption of a new accounting standard, ASU 2016-09, that changes certain aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payments in order to improve transparency. As a result, all excess tax benefits and tax reduction shortfalls will now be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement as opposed to balance sheet as in paid in capital. The adoption of this accounting standard reduced the first quarter income tax provision by $4 million and the tax rate by 3 percentage points, with an EPS benefit of about $0.02 for the quarter. 
While we need to continue to assess the impacts based on equity price fluctuations, the projected tax limit for the year is about in the range of 1 percentage points at the current stock price, which would put our tax rate for the year at around 34% to 35% range. This will obviously need to continue to be recalibrated each quarter as the stock price and market fluctuates.
During the quarter, strong cash flow from operations was used to fund accelerated share repurchases of $75 million at an average price of $23.89 per share. Dividend payments of $31 million and investments in business initiatives is $60 million. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt stood at $4.2 billion and cash on the balance sheet was $79 million. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for concluding remarks prior to the Q&A."

The hard-working teams at TEGNA Media and TEGNA Digital continue to produce strong results as they innovate and forge new paths toward growth and enhanced value. Now while we still have a lot more work to do and the journey never really ends as we all know, we're already starting to see the fruits of our labor, and I am more confident than ever of reaching the goals we set out for you at our Investor Day last summer.

This morning, I'm going to provide some highlights on TEGNA's overall performance and each of our businesses, and then I'm going to turn it over to our business leads, Dave Lougee, President of TEGNA Media; Alex Vetter, CEO of Cars.com, and Matt Ferguson, CEO of CareerBuilder and they're going do a deep dive on each of their respective businesses. And then after that, Victoria will cover the financial highlights.
It's been a busy start to the year. We have made significant progress on our first 9 months as an independent, focused media and digital company and we are well on our way toward reaching the guidance and achieving the goals that we detailed at our Investor Day last summer and reiterated in early December. We've established new partnerships, launched new products and services, completed negotiations with important network and MVPD partners, and are achieving the record political advertising revenue we've been anticipating for this year. 
Our relentless drive to innovate has helped us remain ahead of the curve and ahead of our competitors as audiences, preferences and trends in content consumption continues to change our industry. 
We continue to harness the unique strengths we've detailed when TEGNA became an independent company, and those included high-quality assets with significant reach, strong margins and reliable significant cash flows, highly regarded industry leaders overseeing the businesses and a shareholder-friendly approach to the allocation of capital. 
So let's turn to the first quarter results. As you saw, companywide revenues were up substantially over last year's first quarter, mainly driven by strong results for TEGNA Media. TEGNA Digital revenue grew as well and also contributed to the strong quarter. 
Operating expenses increased in the first quarter year-over-year and the rise in Media and Digital Segment costs reflect significant investments we are making in the long-term growth and sustainability of our businesses. 
Overall, we continued to do a strong job of strategically investing for growth, while continuing our strong cost discipline. 
As importantly, we continued to grow profitability as well. Operating income was up over 20% compared to the same period last year and we achieved an increase of 16% in adjusted EBITDA year-over-year. We also generated $111 million of free cash flow.
So now let me briefly touch on some highlights from each of our individual businesses before turning it over to the team. TEGNA Media revenue growth reached the high end of our guidance for the quarter, driven by substantial growth in retransmission and digital revenue in addition to record first quarter political revenue. As you'll hear from Dave in a few moments, our substantial broadcast footprint positions us to garner a substantial slice of the expanding political advertising pie, and we anticipate our record pace will continue for 2016, particularly as we approach the November election. 
Beyond the financials, we made significant strides on our quest for continued innovation at TEGNA. We strengthen our partnership with video call center, a pioneer of video caller television, we also made a strategic investment in and partnership with Whistle Sports, the leader in connecting the sports world to millennial audiences. And also partnered with CrowdTangle, an innovative social analytics company. All of these initiatives will allow us to continue to offer diverse original content that meets our audiences changing preferences for how they access and engage with content.
As I mentioned, Dave will provide some additional detail on TEGNA Media shortly, including our progress on an emerging revenue stream that involves fully integrated marketing campaigns. 
Switching now to TEGNA Digital. Cars.com continued its strong growth path with a big quarter from direct sales and major accounts. We are pleased with this strong growth, as with all of our businesses, we are always looking ahead to ensure we are laying the groundwork for the next wave of growth by launching new products and services. 
Cars.com in the quarter launched a new sell and trade product that helps consumers in the process of selling their cars to dealers. Additionally, our previously announced Lot's Insights products is now up and running as well. And we're also building out additional service and repair features from which we expect to see traction in the back half of the year. 
Now Cars.com has received strong recognition from independent parties such as JDPower that have recognized the company for its impact on dealers, its cutting-edge website and its overall impact on the industry. Alex will have more on all of this in a few moments. 
Moving to CareerBuilder, the company is continuing its successful push into HR Software-as-a-Service solutions. They have the most comprehensive and integrated offerings in the industry as none of their competitors can offer the same breadth of advertising, software and services, all in one place. 
CareerBuilder continues to make appropriate investments in maintaining its leadership as a one-stop shop for personnel solutions. And last month, it acquired Aurico, a leader in employee background checks. Adding top-tier capabilities and yet another piece of the HR puzzle will attract even more employers to CareerBuilder's one-of-a-kind platform. 
We saw progress at CareerBuilder in the first quarter as total revenues were down just 2%, improved from a 5% decline in the fourth quarter last year. We anticipate continued innovation and significant growth in the SaaS business and for CareerBuilder more broadly, and look forward to turning the revenue corner in the second quarter. Matt will be providing a comprehensive update on the quarter and the opportunities that lie ahead for CareerBuilder later in the call. 
So at this point, let me turn it over to Dave Lougee for comments on TEGNA Media."
20571,330692770,964719,"TEGNA Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gracia. On previous calls, I forecasted a record year for TEGNA Media, and so far, we are well on track. Political revenue in the first quarter finished at a record first quarter level of $15.7 million. As we look ahead to the general election,",855,"Thank you, Gracia. On previous calls, I forecasted a record year for TEGNA Media, and so far, we are well on track. Political revenue in the first quarter finished at a record first quarter level of $15.7 million. As we look ahead to the general election, our market footprint is a healthy mutual fund of strong swing states like Ohio, Florida, Colorado, North Carolina and Virginia. Additionally, and significantly, a Trump or Cruz nomination on the Republican side will very likely expand the number of U.S. senate and house seats that will come into play in our markets. And the pack spending for the control of Congress will almost certainly be unprecedented.
Back to the first quarter. The increase in net revenues more than offset a Super Bowl decrease across the TEGNA stations, specifically last year the game aired on our 17 NBC stations versus our 11 CBS stations this year. So even though the year-to-year Super Bowl dollars are down simply due to the network change, TEGNA's Super Bowl stations performed very well. Our Super Bowl advertising was 45% above the last Super Bowl pro forma in 2013. Excluding the Super Bowl delta, core revenue finished up slightly above last year for the quarter.
As I previously noted, we have several initiatives underway, which we expect to contribute $25 million to $30 million in EBITDA in 2016 and continue to grow from there. One of those initiatives and the fastest-growing aspect of our core business is Hatch revenue. Those are dollars associated with the sales of fully integrated multiplatform marketing campaigns that target clients' marketing budgets versus the more traditional transaction-based advertising budget. In the first quarter alone, we closed 81 campaign deals compared to 83 all of last year and it's ramping fast. The value of those deals we closed in the first quarter was more than double what we closed in the fourth quarter.
Just to give you a sense for how the Hatch program has resonated, we've sold one single campaign to 10 different verticals. So this ability to develop and produce local integrated marketing campaigns at scale through a centralized service in Dallas is becoming a game changer for us in getting new local marketing dollars that wouldn't have been available to us in the past. 
Our progress on the revenue front is supporting brand new approaches to content as well. We're in the midst of a large scale content transformation effort that centers around the development of original programming for every screen. In the entertainment syndication space, we are on track for a fall premier T.D. Jakes. T.D. Jakes is a unique voice in American culture and the program is already showing signs of success. We'll be clearing this show on 53 stations, 30 of those are TEGNA stations and 23 are nonTEGNA stations from 13 different station groups. And then our local news time periods, we're innovating there, too. As I discussed last quarter, KARE 11 in Minneapolis, we've replaced the popular syndicated show in the 6:30 p.m. time period with an all-new innovative program called Breaking the News. This unique talent-driven interactive newscast has become a hit in the very short time. The audience response and revenue gains generated by the show are strong, and we expect to see a $0.5 million in incremental revenue above the show it replaced.
We're also proud of our team in Atlanta. WXIA created the groundbreaking, digital-only series called Inside the Triangle, which documented how Atlanta's wealthiest suburbs are impacted by teenage heroin addiction. We initially released the Triangle only on our digital platforms. And its just first week, it was discovered by many, many viewers. The series attracted 4 million page views and 200,000 video views at just that first week. And then from digital, we migrated the series to the linear network where it again received tremendous audience response and spurred a national dialogue around heroin addiction. 
And last week, a one-man band investigative journalist from Atlanta, won a prestigious Peabody award for an investigative series on the broken 9/11 emergency system in Atlanta, a series that used all platforms to engage and inform our audience. 
This type of innovation, especially in digital media, continues to be a key area of focus for us at TEGNA Media. We're leveraging new digital and social technologies every day to improve and reinvent our existing content. We're working with various new digital partners such as Megaphone and X-item[ph], which allows us to engage in real-time polling and social interaction with our audience live inside our newscast. 
Alongside our content innovation efforts, our new monetization strategies. In Q1, we were the first station group to participate in Facebook's Instant Articles beta test. Off-platform publishing is a growth area for us that we are aggressively pursuing as the business and marketing strategy.
TEGNA Media is operating a high level of sophistication and urgency. We're maximizing the benefit of our traditional model, but more importantly, we're leveraging the power of disruption to generate new ways of connecting with audiences, advertisers and business partners. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Matt Ferguson from CareerBuilder"

We're off to a good start in 2016, seizing the opportunity at hand as we move aggressively into HR Software-as-a-Service. As I've mentioned in the past, CareerBuilder built the world's first and only prehire platform. There's literally no one else in the industry who can offer the same breadth of advertising, software and services in one place. We are delivering the most innovative recruitment experience in the market, and customers are very excited because our platform helps them hire faster and easier than ever before. 
In March of this year, CareerBuilder made a strategic move to expand the scope of that prehire platform offering. We acquired Aurico, a leading provider of background screening and drug testing. This allows us to tackle another critical step in the recruitment process. With our combined technology expertise, we're going to accelerate growth and profitability for this valuable service. 
As the deal closed in March, Aurico had a de minimis impact on Q1 revenue. We're still only a month -- a little over a month into operating the business, so as we spend more time with Aurico, we'll have more guidance on full year impact the next time we speak. 
CareerBuilder also continues to evolve with the business working with employers and consumers in new ways that are differentiating us in the market, having a positive impact on revenue. In the first quarter, our revenue totaled $171 million, that was down 2% year-over-year. The currency didn't have as big an impact in Q1. When you back out currency, we were down less than 2%. This is an improvement compared to the fourth quarter where revenue declined 5% year-over-year.
Our software solutions continue to experience strong growth. Software invoicing was up 12% year-over-year from December through March in North America. And when you look at customers under contract, that number grew 11% year-over-year in the first quarter in North America, so there's great momentum behind this business. 
As we look forward, it's important to note that we recognize our job posting business will continue to experience pricing pressure at the unit level in 2016. We've reflected that in our projections. Though the price per unit will be lower, there's a good opportunity to increase the job posting inventory on our site as we go after mainstream, high-volume jobs.
CareerBuilder will continue to roll out new cutting-edge software solutions in the coming months and pursue acquisitions to enhance and expand our offerings. We fully expect double-digit growth in our SaaS-based products this year, resume database and our employer services. We're confident that this will lead to revenue growth in the mid-single digits in 2016 and 10% growth by the end of 2017 as CareerBuilder modernizes and transforms the way companies recruit. 
With that, I'd love to hand it over to Alex Vetter, CEO of Cars.com."

First of all, I'm excited to report that Cars.com's retail revenues were up nearly 10% in the quarter with growth driven by higher dealer market penetration and new product sales.
Our national revenues were also strong, up almost 8% due mainly to an increase in display advertising by auto manufacturers. Including the impact of affiliate or wholesale revenue performance, our revenues are up 6%. Last year, you may recall, we cycled through a onetime wholesale price increase to our affiliate partners and continue to work with them to improve their performance. But we are on track to deliver 10% growth through new product development and continued innovation.
You may have seen that earlier this year, we released new research that supports the Cars.com influence 36% of all vehicle sales in 2015 in the United States. We continue to change the value equation in the market by providing a bridge between consumers, online shopping behavior and offline sales as Cars.com works to illustrate the impact that we're having on walk-in traffic to local dealerships across the country.
Our sales, marketing and product teams achieved a record-setting performance at last month's National Auto Dealer Association Conference with several major accomplishments. First, our sales team realized more than $1.2 million in annualized product sales, exceeding our goals by over 12% for the 3-day event in Las Vegas, recording the most successful weekend at NADA and Cars.com's history. During NADA, we officially launched 2 mobile focused solutions to bolster our position. First, our sell and trade product, which allows consumers to sell their vehicles and help dealers acquire inventory via our new mobile app made the debut at the show and really posted strong results. And we officially launched our Lot Insights report for dealers, which helps them quantify the influence we have on walk-in traffic at the dealership using geofence technology. We're currently the first in the market with this new technology and product iteration and we're working now with both dealers and auto manufacturers to leverage these new insights to help shift their media allocations towards digital.
During the quarter, we were also recognized for our industry-leading successful websites as we've moved our entire business more towards a responsive platform to serve consumers however they choose to shop. Cars.com was ranked #3 in the JDPower third-party automotive website evaluation study, placed admirably as the #1 large marketplace site and only behind 2 narrowly specialized niche sites. In addition, we were recognized as the only third-party site in the category that has transitioned to our responsive design. Now that, that responsive design has taken place, we're eager to see the positive effects in both our consumer experience, our traffic and our SEO. 
Lastly, we continue to bolster our service and repair product suite, and are currently piloting new features. These features will provide another channel for franchise dealers and auto manufacturers to promote the service offerings that they have, and to capture a new audience of consumers and a new segment of revenue. The service and repair industry is fairly large and unaddressed market estimated at about $250 million that we've had strong success starting 2016. 
We'll continue to make our investments in the sell and trade platform, our service and repair offering as well as new innovative mobile solutions. Overall, it was a great quarter for the business and sets the stage for continued growth. 
I'd now like to turn it over to Victoria."

As Gracia has already mentioned, we're off to a strong start to what we expect to be a terrific year for TEGNA. We're very pleased with the strong performance of our businesses across both Media and Digital Segm",1233,"Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia has already mentioned, we're off to a strong start to what we expect to be a terrific year for TEGNA. 
We're very pleased with the strong performance of our businesses across both Media and Digital Segments. 
Before I review our consolidated financial results as well as capital allocation during the quarter, I'd like to note that there were just a few operating special items in the quarter, which totaled $10 million, primarily related to a TEGNA Media voluntary early retirement program, which began in first quarter and will conclude a bit later this quarter, which reduced GAAP EPS by $0.03 per share. 
Now let's briefly review the operating results for the quarter. As a reminder, although I will be focusing on our non-GAAP performance results today, you can find all of our reported data and comparatives in our press release.
With solid performances by both Media and Digital segments, we achieved earnings per share of $0.45, an increase of 88% over last year. Total company revenues of $782 million were up 7% year-over-year. On a pro forma basis, excluding the impact of PointRoll, which was sold at the end of last year, total revenues were up 8% and in line to achieve our full year projection. And as you've seen from our release, this is driven by robust growth in the Media Segment's retransmission revenues and record first quarter political advertising revenue as well as continued growth in Cars.com revenue.
During the quarter, total company operating expenses of $569 million were higher by about 2% over last year, mainly due to higher Media programming fees as well as investments in growth initiatives within both the Media and Digital Segments. These were offset in part by significant reductions in corporate expenses, reflecting the absence of publishing related unallocated costs and continued efficiency efforts. 
Now let's turn to more detailed review of Media and Digital Segment results. TEGNA Media revenues increased 12% year-over-year, at the high end of the guidance we provided during the last earnings call, driven by significant growth in retransmission revenues and record first quarter political advertising as well as higher digital revenues.
As Dave mentioned, the Super Bowl revenue this quarter was negatively impacted by the network change from NBC to CBS this year. Excluding the impact of Super Bowl revenue, Media Segment revenues would have been up by about 14% compared to the first quarter of last year. 
Retransmission revenues boosted by agreements negotiated at the end of last year as well as annual rate increases within existing agreements continue to drive revenue growth within the Media Segment, up fully 33% to a historical high of $147 million in the first quarter. We will be negotiating additional retransmission agreements this year, which reflect 44% of our distributed subscriber base. 
Political advertising revenue during the quarter also posted record high results of $60 million, up 151% compared to the same quarter during the last presidential election cycle in 2012.
Beyond this, TEGNA Media digital advertising revenues were also up 16% during the quarter driven by Digital Marketing Services, which continue to gain traction across all our television stations as well as G/O Digital sales, extended reach networks and national digital revenues.
Now focusing on second quarter expectations for TEGNA Media. Based on current trends, we anticipate increases in retransmission revenue, political advertising and digital revenue to result in Media Segment's revenue growth of 10% to 12% for the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015. As you'd expect, revenue growth will, in part, be dependent on the timing of ad spending both within the Presidential campaigns as well as for contests in both the house and the Senate over the balance of the year. 
During the first quarter, Media Segment operating expenses were up 15% year-over-year, primarily due to increased programming expenses and investments in our digital sales initiatives, including a sales force expansion with newly launched product offerings.
In the Digital Segment, during the quarter, Digital Segment revenues on a pro forma basis increased by 4% year-over-year, reflecting continued growth and new product launches at Cars.com. These were offset by revenue reductions in transaction-based product lines in CareerBuilder as it continues its transition toward higher-margin Software-as-a-Service solutions to extend the leadership position in that space. As Matt mentioned, CareerBuilder revenues were down 2% year-over-year, but improved sequentially over fourth quarter of last year and we expect this trajectory to continue as the year progresses, with revenue growth projected to be in the mid-single digits by the end of 2016.
Cars.com revenues sold by its direct sales channels were up 9% during the quarter, including the impact of affiliate revenue performance revenues increased by 6% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing strength in market penetration within their direct sale market and bolstered by the continued success of new products such as RepairPal Certified and Event Positions. 
National revenue was also strong, up almost 8% due to an increase in display advertising by auto manufacturers. With the new product development and continued innovation as well as strong organic growth, we're expecting Cars.com to reach our previous projection of 10% year-over-year revenue growth for 2016.
Digital Segment operating expenses were up 2% due to an increase in expenses, primarily reflecting accelerating investments in sales force and growth initiatives, partly offset by the absence of PointRoll. Overall, as a result of the solid performance of both segments, we achieved solid adjusted EBITDA of $264 million this quarter, up 16% over last year and our EBITDA margin was 34%, up 260 basis points compared to last year. 
During the quarter, our capital investments were $16 million, reflecting our ongoing commitment to reinvestment in business priorities and include digital development, media content, product integration and platform enhancement, including automated sales tools, order tracking and other critical products enhancements.
You'll also note that in the first quarter, our overall tax rate was 32%, including the benefit of implementing the early adoption of a new accounting standard, ASU 2016-09, that changes certain aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payments in order to improve transparency. As a result, all excess tax benefits and tax reduction shortfalls will now be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement as opposed to balance sheet as in paid in capital. The adoption of this accounting standard reduced the first quarter income tax provision by $4 million and the tax rate by 3 percentage points, with an EPS benefit of about $0.02 for the quarter. 
While we need to continue to assess the impacts based on equity price fluctuations, the projected tax limit for the year is about in the range of 1 percentage point at the current stock price, which would put our tax rate for the year at around 34% to 35% range. This will obviously need to continue to be recalibrated each quarter as the stock price and market fluctuates.
During the quarter, strong cash flow from operations was used to fund accelerated share repurchases of $75 million at an average price of $23.89 per share. Dividend payments of $31 million and investments in business initiatives is $16 million. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt stood at $4.2 billion and cash on the balance sheet was $79 million. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for concluding remarks prior to the Q&A."

As an example, for instance, we haven't seen John McCain see -- be a contested seat with much spending ever. And right now, it looks like he will be. That's just one of many examples.

This morning, I'm going to provide some highlights on TEGNA's overall performance and each of our businesses, and then I'm going to turn it over to our business leads, Dave Lougee, President of TEGNA Media; Alex Vetter, CEO of Cars.com, and Matt Ferguson, CEO of CareerBuilder and they're going do a deep dive on each of their respective businesses. And then after that, Victoria will cover the financial highlights.
It's been a busy start to the year. We have made significant progress on our first 9 months as an independent, focused media and digital company and we are well on our way toward reaching the guidance and achieving the goals that we detailed at our Investor Day last summer and reiterated in early December. We've established new partnerships, launched new products and services, completed negotiations with important network and MVPD partners, and are achieving the record political advertising revenue we've been anticipating for this year. 
Our relentless drive to innovate has helped us remain ahead of the curve and ahead of our competitors as audiences, preferences and trends in content consumption continues to change our industry. 
We continue to harness the unique strengths we've detailed when TEGNA became an independent company, and those included high-quality assets with significant reach, strong margins and reliable significant cash flows, highly regarded industry leaders overseeing the businesses and a shareholder-friendly approach to the allocation of capital. 
So let's turn to the first quarter results. As you saw, companywide revenues were up substantially over last year's first quarter, mainly driven by strong results for TEGNA Media. TEGNA Digital revenue grew as well and also contributed to the strong quarter. 
Operating expenses increased in the first quarter year-over-year and the rise in Media and Digital Segment costs reflect significant investments we are making in the long-term growth and sustainability of our businesses. 
Overall, we continued to do a strong job of strategically investing for growth, while continuing our strong cost discipline. 
As importantly, we continued to grow profitability as well. Operating income was up over 20% compared to the same period last year and we achieved an increase of 16% in adjusted EBITDA year-over-year. We also generated $111 million of free cash flow.
So now let me briefly touch on some highlights from each of our individual businesses before turning it over to the team. TEGNA Media revenue growth reached the high end of our guidance for the quarter, driven by substantial growth in retransmission and digital revenue in addition to record first quarter political revenue. As you'll hear from Dave in a few moments, our substantial broadcast footprint positions us to garner a substantial slice of the expanding political advertising pie, and we anticipate our record pace will continue for 2016, particularly as we approach the November election. 
Beyond the financials, we made significant strides on our quest for continued innovation at TEGNA. We strengthen our partnership with video call center, a pioneer of video caller television, we also made a strategic investment in and partnership with Whistle Sports, the leader in connecting the sports world to millennial audiences; and also partnered with CrowdTangle, an innovative social analytics company. All of these initiatives will allow us to continue to offer diverse original content that meets our audiences changing preferences for how they access and engage with content.
As I mentioned, Dave will provide some additional detail on TEGNA Media shortly, including our progress on an emerging revenue stream that involves fully integrated marketing campaigns. 
Switching now to TEGNA Digital. Cars.com continued its strong growth path with a big quarter from direct sales and major accounts. We are pleased with this strong growth, as with all of our businesses, we are always looking ahead to ensure we are laying the groundwork for the next wave of growth by launching new products and services. 
Cars.com in the quarter launched a new sell and trade product that helps consumers in the process of selling their cars to dealers. Additionally, our previously announced Lot's Insights products is now up and running as well. And we're also building out additional service and repair features from which we expect to see traction in the back half of the year. 
Now Cars.com has received strong recognition from independent parties such as JDPower that have recognized the company for its impact on dealers, its cutting-edge website and its overall impact on the industry. Alex will have more on all of this in a few moments. 
Moving to CareerBuilder, the company is continuing its successful push into HR Software-as-a-Service solutions. They have the most comprehensive and integrated offerings in the industry as none of their competitors can offer the same breadth of advertising, software and services, all in one place. 
CareerBuilder continues to make appropriate investments in maintaining its leadership as a one-stop shop for personnel solutions. And last month, it acquired Aurico, a leader in employee background checks. Adding top-tier capabilities and yet another piece of the HR puzzle will attract even more employers to CareerBuilder's one-of-a-kind platform. 
We saw progress at CareerBuilder in the first quarter as total revenues were down just 2%, improved from a 5% decline in the fourth quarter last year. We anticipate continued innovation and significant growth in the SaaS business and for CareerBuilder more broadly, and look forward to turning the revenue corner in the second quarter. Matt will be providing a comprehensive update on the quarter and the opportunities that lie ahead for CareerBuilder later in the call. 
So at this point, let me turn it over to Dave Lougee for comments on TEGNA Media."
20571,330692770,965351,"TEGNA Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gracia. On previous calls, I forecasted a record year for TEGNA Media, and so far, we are well on track. Political revenue in the first quarter finished at a record first quarter level of $15.7 million. As we look ahead to the general election,",856,"Thank you, Gracia. On previous calls, I forecasted a record year for TEGNA Media, and so far, we are well on track. Political revenue in the first quarter finished at a record first quarter level of $15.7 million. As we look ahead to the general election, our market footprint is a healthy mutual fund of strong swing states like Ohio, Florida, Colorado, North Carolina and Virginia. Additionally, and significantly, a Trump or Cruz nomination on the Republican side will very likely expand the number of U.S. senate and house seats that will come into play in our markets. And the pack spending for the control of Congress will almost certainly be unprecedented.
Back to the first quarter. The increase in net revenues more than offset a Super Bowl decrease across the TEGNA stations, specifically last year the game aired on our 17 NBC stations versus our 11 CBS stations this year. So even though the year-to-year Super Bowl dollars are down simply due to the network change, TEGNA's Super Bowl stations performed very well. Our Super Bowl advertising was 45% above the last Super Bowl pro forma in 2013. Excluding the Super Bowl delta, core revenue finished up slightly above last year for the quarter.
As I previously noted, we have several initiatives underway, which we expect to contribute $25 million to $30 million in EBITDA in 2016 and continue to grow from there. One of those initiatives and the fastest-growing aspect of our core business is Hatch revenue. Those are dollars associated with the sales of fully integrated multiplatform marketing campaigns that target clients' marketing budgets versus the more traditional transaction-based advertising budget. In the first quarter alone, we closed 81 campaign deals compared to 83 all of last year and it's ramping fast. The value of those deals we closed in the first quarter was more than double what we closed in the fourth quarter.
Just to give you a sense for how the Hatch program has resonated, we've sold one single campaign to 10 different verticals. So this ability to develop and produce local integrated marketing campaigns at scale through a centralized service in Dallas is becoming a game changer for us in getting new local marketing dollars that wouldn't have been available to us in the past. 
Our progress on the revenue front is supporting brand new approaches to content as well. We're in the midst of a large scale content transformation effort that centers around the development of original programming for every screen. In the entertainment syndication space, we are on track for a fall premier T.D. Jakes. T.D. Jakes is a unique voice in American culture and the program is already showing signs of success. We'll be clearing this show on 53 stations, 30 of those are TEGNA stations and 23 are nonTEGNA stations from 13 different station groups. And then our local news time periods, we're innovating there, too. As I discussed last quarter, KARE 11 in Minneapolis, we've replaced the popular syndicated show in the 6:30 p.m. time period with an all-new innovative program called Breaking the News. This unique talent-driven interactive newscast has become a hit in the very short time. The audience response and revenue gains generated by the show are strong, and we expect to see a $0.5 million in incremental revenue above the show it replaced.
We're also proud of our team in Atlanta. WXIA created the groundbreaking, digital-only series called Inside the Triangle, which documented how Atlanta's wealthiest suburbs are impacted by teenage heroin addiction. We initially released the Triangle only on our digital platforms. And it's just first week, it was discovered by many, many viewers. The series attracted 4 million page views and 200,000 video views at just that first week. And then from digital, we migrated the series to the linear network where it again received tremendous audience response and spurred a national dialogue around heroin addiction. 
And last week, a one-man band investigative journalist from Atlanta, won a prestigious Peabody award for an investigative series on the broken 9/11 emergency system in Atlanta, a series that used all platforms to engage and inform our audience. 
This type of innovation, especially in digital media, continues to be a key area of focus for us at TEGNA Media. We're leveraging new digital and social technologies every day to improve and reinvent our existing content. We're working with various new digital partners such as Megaphone and X-item [ph], which allows us to engage in real-time polling and social interaction with our audience live inside our newscast. 
Alongside our content innovation efforts, our new monetization strategies. In Q1, we were the first station group to participate in Facebook's Instant Articles beta test. Off-platform publishing is a growth area for us that we are aggressively pursuing as the business and marketing strategy.
TEGNA Media is operating a high level of sophistication and urgency. We're maximizing the benefit of our traditional model, but more importantly, we're leveraging the power of disruption to generate new ways of connecting with audiences, advertisers and business partners. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Matt Ferguson from CareerBuilder"

We're off to a good start in 2016, seizing the opportunity at hand as we move aggressively into HR Software-as-a-Service. As I've mentioned in the past, CareerBuilder built the world's first and only prehire platform. There's literally no one else in the industry who can offer the same breadth of advertising, software and services in one place. We are delivering the most innovative recruitment experience in the market, and customers are very excited because our platform helps them hire faster and easier than ever before. 
In March of this year, CareerBuilder made a strategic move to expand the scope of that prehire platform offering. We acquired Aurico, a leading provider of background screening and drug testing. This allows us to tackle another critical step in the recruitment process. With our combined technology expertise, we're going to accelerate growth and profitability for this valuable service. 
As the deal closed in March, Aurico had a de minimis impact on Q1 revenue. We're still only a month -- a little over a month into operating the business, so as we spend more time with Aurico, we'll have more guidance on full year impact the next time we speak. 
CareerBuilder also continues to evolve with the business working with employers and consumers in new ways that are differentiating us in the market, having a positive impact on revenue. In the first quarter, our revenue totaled $171 million, that was down 2% year-over-year. The currency didn't have as big an impact in Q1. When you back out currency, we were down less than 2%. This is an improvement compared to the fourth quarter where revenue declined 5% year-over-year.
Our software solutions continue to experience strong growth. Software invoicing was up 12% year-over-year from December through March in North America. And when you look at customers under contract, that number grew 11% year-over-year in the first quarter in North America, so there's great momentum behind this business. 
As we look forward, it's important to note that we recognize our job posting business will continue to experience pricing pressure at the unit level in 2016. We've reflected that in our projections. Though the price per unit will be lower, there's a good opportunity to increase the job posting inventory on our site as we go after mainstream, high-volume jobs.
CareerBuilder will continue to roll out new cutting-edge software solutions in the coming months and pursue acquisitions to enhance and expand our offerings. We fully expect double-digit growth in our SaaS-based products this year, resume database and our employer services. We're confident that this will lead to revenue growth in the mid-single digits in 2016 and 10% growth by the end of 2017 as CareerBuilder modernizes and transforms the way companies recruit. 
With that, I'd love to hand it over to Alex Vetter, CEO of Cars.com."

First of all, I'm excited to report that Cars.com's retail revenues were up nearly 10% in the quarter with growth driven by higher dealer market penetration and new product sales.
Our national revenues were also strong, up almost 8% due mainly to an increase in display advertising by auto manufacturers. Including the impact of affiliate or wholesale revenue performance, our revenues are up 6%. Last year, you may recall, we cycled through a onetime wholesale price increase to our affiliate partners and continue to work with them to improve their performance. But we are on track to deliver 10% growth through new product development and continued innovation.
You may have seen that earlier this year, we released new research that supports the Cars.com influence 36% of all vehicle sales in 2015 in the United States. We continue to change the value equation in the market by providing a bridge between consumers, online shopping behavior and offline sales as Cars.com works to illustrate the impact that we're having on walk-in traffic to local dealerships across the country.
Our sales, marketing and product teams achieved a record-setting performance at last month's National Auto Dealer Association Conference with several major accomplishments. First, our sales team realized more than $1.2 million in annualized product sales, exceeding our goals by over 12% for the 3-day event in Las Vegas, recording the most successful weekend at NADA and Cars.com's history. During NADA, we officially launched 2 mobile focused solutions to bolster our position. First, our sell and trade product, which allows consumers to sell their vehicles and help dealers acquire inventory via our new mobile app made the debut at the show and really posted strong results. And we officially launched our Lot Insights report for dealers, which helps them quantify the influence we have on walk-in traffic at the dealership using geofence technology. We're currently the first in the market with this new technology and product iteration and we're working now with both dealers and auto manufacturers to leverage these new insights to help shift their media allocations towards digital.
During the quarter, we were also recognized for our industry-leading successful websites as we've moved our entire business more towards a responsive platform to serve consumers however they choose to shop. Cars.com was ranked #3 in the JDPower third-party automotive website evaluation study, placed admirably as the #1 large marketplace site and only behind 2 narrowly specialized niche sites. In addition, we were recognized as the only third-party site in the category that has transitioned to our responsive design. Now that, that responsive design has taken place, we're eager to see the positive effects in both our consumer experience, our traffic and our SEO. 
Lastly, we continue to bolster our service and repair product suite, and are currently piloting new features. These features will provide another channel for franchise dealers and auto manufacturers to promote the service offerings that they have, and to capture a new audience of consumers and a new segment of revenue. The service and repair industry is fairly large and unaddressed market estimated at about $250 million that we've had strong success starting 2016. 
We'll continue to make our investments in the sell and trade platform, our service and repair offering as well as new innovative mobile solutions. Overall, it was a great quarter for the business and sets the stage for continued growth. 
I'd now like to turn it over to Victoria."
20571,330692770,965351,"TEGNA Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia has already mentioned, we're off to a strong start to what we expect to be a terrific year for TEGNA.

As Gracia has already mentioned, we're off to a strong start to what we expect to be a terrific year for TEGNA. 
We're very pleased with the strong performance of our businesses across both Media and Digital Segments. 
Before I review our consolidated financial results as well as capital allocation during the quarter, I'd like to note that there were just a few operating special items in the quarter, which totaled $10 million, primarily related to a TEGNA Media voluntary early retirement program, which began in first quarter and will conclude a bit later this quarter, which reduced GAAP EPS by $0.03 per share. 
Now let's briefly review the operating results for the quarter. As a reminder, although I will be focusing on our non-GAAP performance results today, you can find all of our reported data and comparatives in our press release.
With solid performances by both Media and Digital segments, we achieved earnings per share of $0.45, an increase of 88% over last year. Total company revenues of $782 million were up 7% year-over-year. On a pro forma basis, excluding the impact of PointRoll, which was sold at the end of last year, total revenues were up 8% and in line to achieve our full year projection. And as you've seen from our release, this is driven by robust growth in the Media Segment's retransmission revenues and record first quarter political advertising revenue as well as continued growth in Cars.com revenue.
During the quarter, total company operating expenses of $569 million were higher by about 2% over last year, mainly due to higher Media programming fees as well as investments in growth initiatives within both the Media and Digital Segments. These were offset in part by significant reductions in corporate expenses, reflecting the absence of publishing related unallocated costs and continued efficiency efforts. 
Now let's turn to more detailed review of Media and Digital Segment results. TEGNA Media revenues increased 12% year-over-year, at the high end of the guidance we provided during the last earnings call, driven by significant growth in retransmission revenues and record first quarter political advertising as well as higher digital revenues.
As Dave mentioned, the Super Bowl revenue this quarter was negatively impacted by the network change from NBC to CBS this year. Excluding the impact of Super Bowl revenue, Media Segment revenues would have been up by about 14% compared to the first quarter of last year. 
Retransmission revenues boosted by agreements negotiated at the end of last year as well as annual rate increases within existing agreements continue to drive revenue growth within the Media Segment, up fully 33% to a historical high of $147 million in the first quarter. We will be negotiating additional retransmission agreements this year, which reflect 44% of our distributed subscriber base. 
Political advertising revenue during the quarter also posted record high results of $60 million, up 151% compared to the same quarter during the last presidential election cycle in 2012.
Beyond this, TEGNA Media digital advertising revenues were also up 16% during the quarter driven by Digital Marketing Services, which continue to gain traction across all our television stations as well as G/O Digital sales, extended reach networks and national digital revenues.
Now focusing on second quarter expectations for TEGNA Media. Based on current trends, we anticipate increases in retransmission revenue, political advertising and digital revenue to result in Media Segment's revenue growth of 10% to 12% for the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015. As you'd expect, revenue growth will, in part, be dependent on the timing of ad spending both within the Presidential campaigns as well as for contests in both the house and the Senate over the balance of the year. 
During the first quarter, Media Segment operating expenses were up 15% year-over-year, primarily due to increased programming expenses and investments in our digital sales initiatives, including a sales force expansion with newly launched product offerings.
In the Digital Segment, during the quarter, Digital Segment revenues on a pro forma basis increased by 4% year-over-year, reflecting continued growth and new product launches at Cars.com. These were offset by revenue reductions in transaction-based product lines in CareerBuilder as it continues its transition toward higher-margin Software-as-a-Service solutions to extend the leadership position in that space. As Matt mentioned, CareerBuilder revenues were down 2% year-over-year, but improved sequentially over fourth quarter of last year and we expect this trajectory to continue as the year progresses, with revenue growth projected to be in the mid-single digits by the end of 2016.
Cars.com revenues sold by its direct sales channels were up 9% during the quarter, including the impact of affiliate revenue performance revenues increased by 6% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing strength in market penetration within their direct sale market and bolstered by the continued success of new products such as RepairPal Certified and Event Positions. 
National revenue was also strong, up almost 8% due to an increase in display advertising by auto manufacturers. With the new product development and continued innovation as well as strong organic growth, we're expecting Cars.com to reach our previous projection of 10% year-over-year revenue growth for 2016.
Digital Segment operating expenses were up 2% due to an increase in expenses, primarily reflecting accelerating investments in sales force and growth initiatives, partly offset by the absence of PointRoll. Overall, as a result of the solid performance of both segments, we achieved solid adjusted EBITDA of $264 million this quarter, up 16% over last year and our EBITDA margin was 34%, up 260 basis points compared to last year. 
During the quarter, our capital investments were $16 million, reflecting our ongoing commitment to reinvestment in business priorities and include digital development, media content, product integration and platform enhancement, including automated sales tools, order tracking and other critical products enhancements.
You'll also note that in the first quarter, our overall tax rate was 32%, including the benefit of implementing the early adoption of a new accounting standard, ASU 2016-09, that changes certain aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payments in order to improve transparency. As a result, all excess tax benefits and tax reduction shortfalls will now be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement as opposed to balance sheet as in paid in capital. The adoption of this accounting standard reduced the first quarter income tax provision by $4 million and the tax rate by 3 percentage points, with an EPS benefit of about $0.02 for the quarter. 
While we need to continue to assess the impacts based on equity price fluctuations, the projected tax limit for the year is about in the range of 1 percentage point at the current stock price, which would put our tax rate for the year at around 34% to 35% range. This will obviously need to continue to be recalibrated each quarter as the stock price and market fluctuates.
During the quarter, strong cash flow from operations was used to fund accelerated share repurchases of $75 million at an average price of $23.89 per share. Dividend payments of $31 million and investments in business initiatives is $16 million. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt stood at $4.2 billion and cash on the balance sheet was $79 million. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for concluding remarks prior to the Q&A."

I think what you're going to see if Trump is the candidate that a lot of the pack money, a lot of the private donor money will move to Congress. Because if they fear that they've lost the White House, then there will be a very big effort to save the Senate. And I think that did makes all the sense. And for us, again, that's not concerning because we have a decent Senate footprint and because of Trump, it will be an expanded Senate footprint."

So I think that as Dave said, the dollars are going to be in the system. I think Mr. Trump, by the way, if he is the candidate, is going to have to spend. I mean, I think, there will be spending. I believe that Secretary Clinton will also be a big spender. And there could be expanded spending on the Senate and house side."

And let me join Jeff in welcoming you to our second quarter earnings call. I'm going to provide some highlights on TEGNA's overall performance in each of our businesses and them I'm going to turn it over to our business leads: Dave Lougee, President of TEGNA Media; Alex Vetter, CEO of Cars.com; and Matt Ferguson, CEO of CareerBuilder for a closer look at each of their respective businesses. And after that, Victoria will go over some of the financial highlights for the quarter. So let's jump right in. 
The end of June marked TEGNA's 1-year anniversary and we are all proud of everything that we've accomplished to-date. Over the last 4 quarters, we've grown both operationally and financially and have launched several successful initiatives and partnerships. More importantly, we remain on track overall toward achieving the goals we reviewed with you at our Investor Day last summer. 
The media and digital landscape continue to evolve and we've seen tremendous changes, even since this time last year. As always, our entire team has worked diligently to stay ahead of the trends and ensure that we remain as relevant as ever to our audiences and customers. 
But one thing that hasn't changed here at Gannett is the set of key drivers for our business, which include: Top-tier properties and their significant footprint, strong margins and steady cash flow, a talented team of experienced industry leaders and a shareholder first mindset with regard to the use of capital. 
So looking at our second quarter results. As you saw this morning, company-wide revenue increased 7% over last year and 9% on a pro forma basis, a result of positive top line growth across our segments. Our revenue growth substantially outpaced the low single-digit growth in operating expenses and as a result, our profitability was up significantly. 
Non-GAAP operating income increased 19%, adjusted EBITDA grew approximately 14% and non-GAAP earnings per share were up 67%. We also generated $79 million of free cash flow. 
Now during the quarter, we continued our strategy of partnering with, and investing in, leading-edge companies that is focused on the same kind of innovative audience engagement as we are. For example, last month, we announced a strategic investments in Keen [ph] community, the premier, home-focused content brand and create community that inspires and informs young women. This new partnership will enable content sharing across TEGNA Media's properties and give us exposure to a new group of young viewers. 
On the flip side, building on our efforts to leverage the strong creativity we possess in-house, this quarter, we cleared our original show, TV Jakes [ph], to air this coming September in more than 50 markets reaching over 40% of the country. 
Another example of how we are joining forces with innovative third parties is our announcement today that we have entered into an agreement subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions to acquire Dealer Ratar [ph]. Dealer Ratar is the industry's leading car dealer review site, so it's an outstanding step for Cars.com as they grow their brand and at their consumer connections. And Alex is going to discuss this further in his remarks. 
Now I'll provide more a few more specifics on each of our individual businesses and I'll begin with the Media Segment. There, as you saw, revenue was up 10% year-over-year in line with our guidance. Top line growth was impacted by the timing of political spending, as we noted on our first quarter earnings call. We noted then the potential for a low and political advertising in the second quarter before spending related to the presidential election campaign picks up in earnest. This year, the primaries were especially dramatic and drawn out and didn't wrap up until mid-June. As a result, spending from presidential candidates is just now beginning to come in but we are confident that spending will continue to ramp up in the back half of the year, typically where about 80% to 85% of all the political dollars we get occur, especially during the 5 weeks or so between Labor Day and election day as we all know, that's when candidates typically really feel the pressure to grab those voters. And when the real political dollars start flowing in, TEGNA is very well-positioned in many of the key presidential swing states as well as contested Senate and gubernatorial races. 
We also saw substantial bumps in digital and retransmission revenues. The initiatives we are launching, including hats, continue to gain traction. And if you remember from last quarter, our hatched initiative involves fully integrated marketing campaigns designed to give TEGNA access to company's marketing spend beyond just advertising. As well, our content transformation continues to progress and Dave is going to give us more details on all of that in a moment. 
So let's turn to the Digital Segment. There, pro forma revenues were up 7% year-over-year. The key driver there was Cars.com, which continue to achieve meaningful revenue growth. Our manufacturers and regular groups contributed significantly to the great this quarter. 
Cars.com is also seeing uptick in its new product sales, particularly with the note selling trade-off offering and they continue to build their new product pipeline. And Alex is going to share more details on all of that in a few minutes. 
Shifting to CareerBuilder, we were very pleased to see return to growth in the second quarter with HR Software-as-a-Service platform continuing to be the key story. with its small acquisition of Oracle last quarter, CareerBuilder continues to lead the pack with the best, most compelling offerings among its peers, providing solutions that are cleanly and powerfully integrated. There's obviously a lot going on at CareerBuilder and Matt is going to be able to speak to all of it in just a few moments. 
But first, let me hand it over to Dave Lougee for a deep dive into TEGNA Media."
20571,375878643,1011955,"TEGNA Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gracia. At the midway point in the year, we remain on track for a record year at TEGNA Media. Now let me first dive deeper on Gracia's comments on political, we are headed for another tremendous year in political spending. 2 factors led to this",1120,"Thank you, Gracia. At the midway point in the year, we remain on track for a record year at TEGNA Media. Now let me first dive deeper on Gracia's comments on political, we are headed for another tremendous year in political spending. 2 factors led to this temporary lull in the second quarter that Gracia referenced. The first is we didn't have any significant primaries in our particular footprint in that quarter. The second, and more significant, the partner's candidates, as Gracia referenced, were decided much later than 4 years ago. So this year, the start of the much larger spending for the general election or main event, if you will, just got underway at the end of the quarter. Conversely, the Rami [ph], Obama event 4 years ago was well underway in early second quarter. And as a reminder, we are, as Gracia said, positioned very, very well for that main event. We're in states that matter most, including Ohio, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, Colorado, Michigan. And given the close polling, we know Hillary will have a growing war chest coming out of this week's convention. 
I also want to address the so called Trump factor. His funding will now accelerate following the convention last week. And major Republican donors who don't give to him are going to move their money and are moving their money to control over key Senate house and gubernatorial seats and our footprint there is equally strong. We have contested Senate races in Ohio, Florida, Missouri, North Carolina and Arizona. And the Trump factor may widen the playing field further and open up other races, process, they're now polling, he and Hillary Clinton are polling neck in neck in one poll in Georgia. 
The bottom line, spending for all raises is now beginning and accelerating fast as expected. In addition to presidential race, major buys for Senate House and Governors races and  the very big statewide issue category are now being placed with that number going by the day. Those races always began in earnest in the third quarter. 
Now turning to core advertise them. Core advertising was down slightly for the second quarter and we're and favorably affected by 2 factors: Not having their final 4 game on CBS this year and a negative variance in insurance category due to Obama Care spending last year. We finally cycled past that issue starting in this third quarter. 
On the digital side. We're continuing to see strong growth in Q2 and sequential improvement over Q1, excluding a onetime revenue reclassification. And our G/O Digital Marketing Services continues to grow strong at 35% and is a home run with both new and existing clients. 
The real Olympics begins next week and we will have another year of record results. We are away outpacing the -- well outpacing the last Summer Games in 2012 and already have more revenue on the books today than where we finished in 2012. And we're way ahead of the Sochi Winter games in 2014. As with all past Olympics, our NBC stations will be among the very highest rated. And using our scale, we have a centralized crew in Rio that will be coproducing with NBC Sports on nightly half-hour program for all our NBC stations, giving us higher rated lead-in programming for prime time coverage, as well as more inventory to sell. 
Now let me turn to the initiatives we've been talking about since Investor Day last year. All aimed at closing net retrans gap in 2017, the gap due to the original TEGNA NBC stations paying reverse compensation for the first time starting in 2017. As we said on our last call, those initiatives will contribute $30 million of EBITDA this year and we remain on track to do just that and are rapidly ramping as projected giving us even more confidence in our ability to close that gap next year. 
Hatch, our centralized point solutions group that Gracia referenced, is ramping nicely and is ramping off of an essentially fixed cost basis. Our central pricing initiative is also ramping nice. We have established a centralized pricing desk and are beginning to roll out our SaaS-based pricing software, which are both contributing to pricing and revenue share gains right now looking dollars in our pocket by using data and analytics to make better and faster pricing decisions as political orders come in at the last minute with little visibility. 
Now turning to our content transformation. It is wide-ranging and in full swing. 
In news area, we have a development pipeline of 20 pilot projects as well as a number of new proven practices that are being scaled across the division that will accelerate our growth and share reviewing our linear newscast as well as other platforms. For example, one of those proven practices we call social listening using software programs like CrowdTangle, our journalists are now using crowd-sourced data to make real-time content decisions on every platform. The result is less repetition and more relevance, all part of our culture of data-driven decision-making across the board. 
An example of one of those pilots is called Verify, which we are piloting across all of our Texas stations next month after a successful test run at Republican convention last week. Verify lives at the intersection of Anthony Borden [ph] in local news, if you will, at a time when consumers are skeptical of what's fact and what's not, Verify will offer them a packaged transparent look at the truth. 
In the non-news arena, we have 6 different pilots now of new live local shows underway in 6 markets. And in the syndication space, as Gracia referenced, our TV Jake show begins taping tomorrow. He premiers on September 12. The show is now cleared in 58 markets across 43% of the country. And shortly, we expect to announce a national distribution deal with another program out let. Awareness of T.D. Jakes has sky rocketed in the aftermath of the tragic shootings in Dallas. He was sought out by civic leaders and media outlets everywhere and was a healing voice for the city and the nation on both traditional outlets as well as social media. 
The Justice Channel, a targeted content multi-cast channel, which we have an ownership interest continues to grow nicely and is about to grow to 60% clearance of the country of which we make up 30% of the total, or 50% of the 60%, if you will. 
Innovation and content, sales and process on all platforms is now the cultural norm in our stations and together, we are executing on the strategy we have laid out. 
With that, I want to turn it over to Matt Ferguson from CareerBuilder."

CareerBuilder had a strong second quarter returning to growth as we build solid momentum behind the sales of all of our human capital solutions. Our prehire platform, which is the first and only of its kind, provides huge benefits to our clients in terms of reducing the cost and the time it takes to the hire someone. It also provides a competitive advantage for CareerBuilder, no one else comes close to delivering the scope of advertising software and services in one place. We have the most cutting-edge recruitment offering other market employers are very excited about what we can do for them. 
In March of this year, CareerBuilder expanded our -- upon our platform by acquiring Oracle, a leader in background screening and drug testing. We're off to a great start with Oraco [ph] and are driving a lot of sales opportunities for them. In Q2 alone, Oraco's revenue was up 27% year-over-year and their invoicing was up 29%. With our sales, marketing and brand behind this business, we expect strong growth to continue to Oroco in the back half of the year and beyond. 
As CareerBuilder continues to evolve as a company, we're seeing a positive trajectory for our revenue. In the second quarter, CareerBuilder generated $181 million in revenue growing 3% year-over-year. This shows improvement over previous periods where our revenue was down 2% year-over-year in Q1 and down 5% year-over-year in Q4. 
Contributing to this growth is the strong performance our software solutions. Software invoicing sold by CareerBuilder in North America was up 10% year-over-year from December 2015 through June 2016. And monthly recurring revenue was up 12% in Q2 2016 compared to Q2 2015. 
In addition, our source and screen business is a good example of how we're reinventing our product. In 2015, we saw a sizable and anticipated revenue decline when we moved away from the transactional approach to this business. After transitioning to a platform-based offering, this business was up 47% from June 2015 to June 2016 and is trending the same way for July. 
As we look forward, it's important to note we recognize the job posting business will continue to experience pricing at the unit level in 2016 and we have reflected that in our projection. So the price per unit will be lower. There's a good opportunity for us to increase the job posting inventory if we decide go after mainstream higher volume jobs. 
Innovation is an everyday occurrence at CareerBuilder and in the coming months, you'll see us rollout exciting new software solutions, while also continue to explore acquisitions build on the success of our current offerings and create new revenue streams. We fully expect double-digit growth in our SaaS based software solutions, résumé database and employer services this year. Also reiterate, we anticipate mid-single digit revenue growth in 2016. We are seeing some good signs from some of the bigger does that we have been working on from the Oracle pipeline that we expect to hit really as we get closer to Q4. In addition, we still expect to reach 10% growth by the end is of 2017. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Alex Vetter, CEO of Cars."

We're pleased that all of our retail channels are growing, resulting in nearly 8% increase in revenue compared to the second quarter of last year. This growth has been primarily driven by an increase in dealer market penetration and direct markets, new products and increased purchase of display advertising by auto manufacturers. Our strongest growth can be attributed to auto manufacturers and major dealer groups. Our major accounts team is up 9.1% and national revenues are up 15.3%, so combined, we're up more than 11%. 
As we've discussed in the last few earnings call, we have been disappointed with our affiliate sales performance and have taken steps over the past several months, including additional training and support on product material to help them improve their trajectory. We're pleased in the second quarter, they began to reflect some improvements in their trends and we expect that to continue into the future. 
In addition, some of our direct sales channels initiatives kicked off in the first quarter took longer to ramp this year. Both of these factors have contributed to a shortfall in the year-to-date overall growth rate, but we're expecting improved performance in the second half across all channels to be around 9%. This is a result of our ramp initiatives as well as even quicker the product expansion through DealerRater, which we had originally been planned to have occurred through organic product development. 
As you heard earlier today, we've entered into an agreement to acquire DealerRater, the industry's largest automotive consumer review website. We know through a leading automotive consumer experience management company that nearly 80% of car buyers and 70% of service customers cite review sites as the most helpful resource in selecting a dealership. Then transaction as the natural extension of the Cars.com business and strategy and enhances our focus on dealers who provide great, local end market experiences for shoppers. 
With the completion of this acquisition later this summer, we will solidify our position as the leader in online automotive reviews and the preeminent authority for car shoppers and owners for deciding what to buy have now, and now where to buy it and who to buy it from. A stronger reputation and successful word-of-mouth referrals go hand-in-hand and we are uniquely positioned now to have a diverse a leverage of the reputation and connect with end-market shopper through the power of social. 
On the product front, we're pleased to also welcome Tony Zola [ph], our new Chief Product Officer. He comes to Cars.com with 18 years experience, building and leading high-performance organizations at some of the nation's top consumer brands. Most recently, he was the Senior Vice President of Product and Customer Experience for the $2 billion retailer, Red Box, and prior to that, at Ticketmaster. 
We also have good news to share regarding our new products. Last quarter, we launched the next phase of our sell and trade product offering, which includes a new quick offer mobile app, which allows consumers to easily sell their cars and real-time offers from local dealers. Dealers buy into the program to access a new audience of consumers and build their used car inventory. We're off to a great start with our sell and trade portfolio of products this year, Q2 sales are up over Q1 and we expect further updates in the sell portfolio soon.
Sales of our campaign-based event position products are up year-over-year due to an increase in vehicle sales incentive in the Memorial Day holiday and our dealer position prominent display product continues to perform well, more than doubling revenues expectations year-to-date. In the near term, we'll see additional new products hit the market, including our cross device offsite ad targeting product, cars 360x and our deep linking offering users to connect to directly vehicle detailed page on the dealers website directly through Cars.com.  This direct connection provides a seemless shopping experience for consumers and drive shoppers into our customers' environment even faster. 
We continue to improve our app experience for our highly engaged mobile audience. A few weeks ago, we launched price drop notifications, alerting shoppers of a price reduction on cars of interest bringing back repeat visitation.
And in the automotive industry, we know that consumer usage of third-party sites is undisputed. Shoppers trust the independent editorial opinions of sites like Cars.com to guide them through the decision-making process of what to buy and now where to buy it. We're harnessing the power of our independent critical voice through a variety of strategic initiatives. 
First ever year at Cars.com editors evaluate cars by segment type using their own in-house expertise outside experts and consumers looking to buy new cars in a series of multi-core comparisons known as challenges. In June, we hosted a midsized sedan challenge and awarded the Volkswagen Passat as the in-segment honors. The selection was supported by an integrated marketing and social media campaign that included cross promotion efforts by the winner and is in a licensing agreement that allows Volkswagen to promote the award on all of its advertising and in-dealer collateral. 
In addition, we're expanding our presence across other media channels with a weekly segment called Driving Smart that will air Saturday mornings on more than 30 TEGNA Media stations. These segments are produced by Cars.com in our studio and we use for our website video production and will feature our editors covering topics, such as car shopping 101 and other automotive news of interest to consumers. Our first segment aired last week.
We're thrilled with the DealerRater transaction, the tremendous growth coming in from auto manufacturers and major dealer groups, the potential on our product pipeline and the momentum we're beginning to gain with our affiliates and the ways of leveraging our unique editorial voice with consumers. 
Thank you for your time. I'm now going to turn it over to Victoria."
20571,375878643,1011955,"TEGNA Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia have already mentioned, we're very pleased with our solid results this quarter, driven by the strong performances of our businesses across both the media and Digital Segments. Before I review our conso",1005,"Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia have already mentioned, we're very pleased with our solid results this quarter, driven by the strong performances of our businesses across both the media and Digital Segments. 
Before I review our consolidated financial results, as well as capital allocation during the quarter, I'd like to note that there were just a few operating special items, which totaled $11 million, primarily related to a voluntary early retirement program within media, which began last quarter. All together, these items unfavorably impacted GAAP EPS by about $0.03 per share. Beyond this, total nonoperating special items totaled $5 million, impacting EPS by about $0.02 per share, driven by the write-off of a small equity investment and cost related to M&A activity. As a reminder, although I'll be focusing on our non-GAAP performance results today, you can find all our reported data and comparatives in our press release. 
Now let's briefly review the operating results for the quarter. With strong performances by both media and Digital Segments, we achieved earnings per share of $0.50, an increase of 67% over last year. Total company revenues of $812 million were up 7% year-over-year. On a pro forma basis, excluding the impact of PointRoll, which we sold at the end of last year, total revenues were up 9% and in line with our full year projection driven by significant growth in the Media Segment's retransmission and political advertising revenues, as well as continued growth in Cars.com and stronger CareerBuilder revenue within the Digital Segment. 
During the quarter, total company operating expenses of $575 million were higher by 3% over last year, mainly due to higher programming fees, expenses associated with revenue growth and our ongoing investments in growth initiatives within both the Media and Digital Segments. These were offset in part by a reduction in corporate expenses and the absence of publishing related unallocated costs as well as our continued efficiency efforts. 
Now let's turn to a more detailed review of Media and Digital Segment results. Media Segment revenues of $459 million increased by 10% year-over-year driven by significant growth in retransmission revenues, as well as higher political advertising and digital revenue. Retransmission revenues boosted by agreements negotiated at the end of last year, as well as annual rate increases within existing agreements were up 33% this quarter. 
As Dave mentioned, political campaign is spending continues to track and we achieved revenues of over $10 million of advertising in the second quarter despite the impact of the drawnout nomination process, fewer contested primaries in our footprint in the second quarter and the late presidential comping spending. Beyond this, Media segment digital advertising revenues were also up 12% driven by Digital Marketing Services, which continue to gain traction across our television stations, driven by G/O Digital sales, expanded reach networks and national digital revenue. As Dave mentioned, excluding a onetime Publishing Segment revenue reclassification at the time of the spin last year, digital revenues would have increased by 17%.
Now focusing on third quarter expectations within Media. Based on current trends, we anticipate increases in retransmission revenue, political advertising, Olympic advertising and digital revenue to resolve the Media segment revenue growth of 20% to 25% for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. As you'd expect, revenue growth will in part be dependent on political spending in the second half within the presidential campaigns as well as for content on both the House and the Senate. 
During the second quarter, the Media Segment operating expenses of $271 million were up 15% year-over-year, primarily due to increased programming costs and investments in our digital sales initiatives, including sales force transformation expansion to support newly launched product offerings.
Now on to the Digital Segment. During the quarter, Digital segment revenues of $353 million increased by 7% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, reflecting continued growth in dealers, consumer use, as well as new product launches at Cars.com and higher revenue at CareerBuilder. 
Cars.com revenues fell directly were up 8%. Including the impact of affiliate revenue performance, revenues increased by 6% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing strength in market penetration within the truck sales market. This was bolstered posted by the continued success of new products, such as sell and trade, campaign-based Event Positions and dealer position enhanced. 
National advertising revenue was also strong, up over 9% due mainly to an increase in display advertising by auto manufacturers. CareerBuilder revenues was up 3% year-over-year, the first quarterly increase since early last year as CareerBuilder continues into sales momentum of strong margin Software-as-a-Service solution. 
As Matt mentioned, the acquisition of Oraco and a higher resume database revenue also contributed to the growth this quarter. These were partially offset by headwinds in our job posting business. 
Digital Segment operating expenses of $288 million were up 5% due to an increase in expenses, primarily reflecting accelerating investments to sales force and growth initiatives within both Cars.com and CareerBuilder, partly offset by the absence of expenses at Pointrole. As a result of strong operational execution across the segments, TEGNA overall achieved solid adjusted EBITDA of $288 million this quarter and our EBITDA margin was up 35%, up 200 basis points compared to last year. 
Capital investments of $24 million during the quarter reflect our ongoing commitment to reinvestment in business priorities and include digital development, media content, product integration and platform enhancement, including automated sales tools, order tracking and other critical product enhancement. 
During the quarter, solid cash flow from operations was used to fund share repurchases of $76 million as an average price of $22.68 per share and we made dividend payments of $31 million. During April, we also extinguished $193 million of 10% senior notes which reach their maturity. This resulted in a net reduction of over $14 million in annual interest expense, respectively. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt was $4.3 billion and cash on the balance sheet was $102 million. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for her closing remarks."

We've also dedicated some of our sales, support resources to help them in-market, 4-legged [ph] calls to help them understand the products and how they can bring value to their end users. And I think the combination of that, as well as engaging with management to see the opportunities they have, they started to earmark more resources towards pursuing Cars.com product sales in their market. It is a little bit of a mixed bag because we're doing this on a market-by-market basis. But we've made it to through most of the affiliate market and those that we've been involved with, we've seen them term turn their performance around. So as guidance and the rest of the year, we maybe we feel like we need to keep the pressure up with them some help make sure that our products stay top of mind, but we do see modest improvement in their performance throughout the rest of the year. On the question regarding DealerRater, the deal will close later this summer, and we're not sharing details on the transaction. We do think it presents an enormous opportunity for us to diversify our revenues. As many dealers are already subscribing to Cars.com, we have now yet a new solution to offer them that leverages our vast sales network where DealerRater had an great product, but really lack the structure that we have so I think the combination of their has a tremendous synergy for us to bring a new solution to market that helps dealers capital is on where word-of-mouth and social marketing."

And let me join Jeff in welcoming you to our second quarter earnings call. I'm going to provide some highlights on TEGNA's overall performance in each of our businesses and then I'm going to turn it over to our business leads: Dave Lougee, President of TEGNA Media; Alex Vetter, CEO of Cars.com; and Matt Ferguson, CEO of CareerBuilder for a closer look at each of their respective businesses. And after that, Victoria will go over some of the financial highlights for the quarter. So let's jump right in.
The end of June marked TEGNA's 1 year anniversary, and we are all proud of everything that we've accomplished to-date. Over the last 4 quarters, we've grown both operationally and financially and have launched several successful initiatives and partnerships. More importantly, we remain on track overall toward achieving the goals we reviewed with you at our Investor Day last summer. 
The media and digital landscapes continue to evolve, and we've seen tremendous changes, even since this time last year. As always, our entire team has worked diligently to stay ahead of the trends and ensure that we remain as relevant as ever to our audiences and customers.
But one thing that hasn't changed here at Gannett is the set of key drivers for our business, which include: top-tier properties and their significant footprint, strong margins and steady cash flow, a talented team of experienced industry leaders and a shareholder-first mindset with regard to the use of capital.
So looking at our second quarter results. As you saw this morning, company-wide revenue increased 7% over last year and 9% on a pro forma basis, a result of positive top line growth across our segments. Our revenue growth substantially outpaced the low single-digit growth in operating expenses, and as a result, our profitability was up significantly.
Non-GAAP operating income increased 19%, adjusted EBITDA grew approximately 14% and non-GAAP earnings per share were up 67%. We also generated $79 million of free cash flow.
Now during the quarter, we continued our strategy of partnering with, and investing in, leading-edge companies that are as focused on the same kind of innovative audience engagement as we are. For example, last month, we announced a strategic investments in Kin Community, the premier home-focused content brand and creator community that inspires and informs young women. This new partnership will enable content sharing across TEGNA Media's properties and give us exposure to a new group of young viewers. 
On the flip side, building on our efforts to leverage the strong creativity we possess in-house, this quarter, we cleared our original show, T.D. Jakes to air this coming September in more than 50 markets reaching over 40% of the country.
Another example of how we are joining forces with innovative third parties is our announcement today that we have entered into an agreement subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions to acquire DealerRater. DealerRater is the industry's leading car dealer review site, so it is an outstanding step for Cars.com as they grow their brand and their consumer connections. And Alex is going to discuss this further in his remarks. 
Now I'll provide more -- a few more specifics on each of our individual businesses, and I'll begin with the Media Segment. There, as you saw, our revenue was up 10% year-over-year in line with our guidance. Top line growth was impacted by the timing of political spending as we noted on our first quarter earnings call. We noted then the potential for a lull in political advertising in the second quarter before spending related to the presidential election campaign picks up in earnest. This year, the primaries were especially dramatic and drawn out and didn't wrap up until mid-June. As a result, spending from presidential candidates is just now beginning to come in, but we are confident that spending will continue to ramp up in the back half of the year, typically where about 80% to 85% of all the political dollars we get occur especially during the 5 weeks or so between Labor Day and Election Day. As we all know, that's when candidates typically really feel the pressure to grab those voters. And when the real political dollars start flowing in, TEGNA is very well positioned in many of the key presidential swing states as well as contested Senate and gubernatorial races. 
We also saw substantial bumps in digital and retransmission revenues. The initiatives we are launching, including Hatch, continue to gain traction. And if you remember from last quarter, our Hatch initiative involves fully integrated marketing campaigns designed to give TEGNA access to company's marketing spend beyond just advertising. As well, our content transformation continues to progress and Dave is going to give us more details on all of that in a moment.
So let's turn to the Digital Segment. There, pro forma revenues were up 7% year-over-year. The key driver there was Cars.com, which continue to achieve meaningful revenue growth. Auto manufacturers and large dealer groups contributed significantly to the growth this quarter.
Cars.com is also seeing an uptick in its new product sales, particularly with the new sell and trade offering, and they continue to build their new product pipeline. And Alex is going to share more details on all of that in a few minutes.
Shifting to CareerBuilder. We were very pleased to see return to growth in the second quarter with its HR Software-as-a-Service platform continuing to be the key story. With its small acquisition of Aurico last quarter, CareerBuilder continues to lead the pack with the best, most compelling offerings among its peers, providing solutions that are cleanly and powerfully integrated. There's obviously a lot going on at CareerBuilder and Matt is going to be able to speak to all of it in just a few moments. 
But first, let me hand it over to Dave Lougee for a deep dive into TEGNA Media."
20571,375878643,1012388,"TEGNA Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gracia. At the midway point in the year, we remain on track for a record year at TEGNA Media. Now let me first dive deeper on Gracia's comments on political. We are headed for another tremendous year in political spending. Two factors led to th",1124,"Thank you, Gracia. At the midway point in the year, we remain on track for a record year at TEGNA Media. Now let me first dive deeper on Gracia's comments on political. We are headed for another tremendous year in political spending. Two factors led to this temporary lull in the second quarter that Gracia referenced. The first is that we didn't have any significant primaries in our particular footprint in that quarter. The second, and more significant, the party's candidates, as Gracia referenced, were decided much later than 4 years ago. So this year, the start of the much larger spending for the general election or main event, if you will, just got underway at the end of the quarter. Conversely, the Romney-Obama event 4 years ago was well underway in early second quarter. And as a reminder, we are, as Gracia said, positioned very, very well for that main event. We're in states that matter most, including Ohio, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, Colorado, Michigan. And given the close polling, we know Hillary will have a growing war chest coming out of this week's convention.
I also want to address the so called Trump factor. His funding will now accelerate following the convention last week. And major Republican donors who don't give to him are going to move their money and are moving their money to control over key Senate house and gubernatorial seats, and our footprint there is equally strong. We have contested Senate races in Ohio, Florida, Missouri, North Carolina and Arizona. And the Trump factor may widen the playing field further and open up other races. For instance, they're now polling -- he and Hillary Clinton are now polling neck in neck in one poll in Georgia. 
The bottom line, spending for all raises is now beginning and accelerating fast as expected. In addition to presidential race, major buys for Senate House and Governors races and the very big statewide issue category are now being placed with that number growing by the day. Those races always began in earnest in the third quarter.
Now turning to core advertising. Core advertising was down slightly for the second quarter, and we're unfavorably affected by 2 factors: not having the final 4 game on CBS this year and a negative variance in the insurance category due to Obamacare spending last year. We finally cycled past that issue starting in this third quarter.
On the digital side. We continue to see strong growth in Q2 and sequential improvement over Q1, excluding a onetime revenue reclassification. And our G/O Digital Marketing Services continues to grow strong at 35% and is a home run with both new and existing clients.
The real Olympics begins next week, and we will have another year of record results. We are away outpacing the last -- well outpacing the last Summer Games in 2012 and already have more revenue on the books today than where we finished in 2012. And we're way ahead of the Sochi Winter games in 2014. As with all past Olympics, our NBC stations will be among the very highest rated. And using our scale, we have a centralized crew in Rio that will be coproducing with NBC Sports on nightly half-hour program for all our NBC stations, giving us higher rated lead-in programming for primetime coverage, as well as more inventory to sell. 
Now let me turn to the initiatives we've been talking about since Investor Day last year. All aimed at closing the net retrans gap in 2017, the gap due to the original TEGNA NBC stations paying reverse compensation for the first time starting in 2017. As we said on our last call, those initiatives will contribute $30 million of EBITDA this year, and we remain on track to do just that and are rapidly ramping as projected giving us even more confidence in our ability to close that gap next year.
Hatch, our centralized client solutions group that Gracia referenced, is ramping nicely, and it's ramping off of an essentially fixed cost basis. Our central pricing initiative is also ramping nice. We have established a centralized pricing desk and are beginning to roll out our SaaS-based pricing software, which are both contributing to pricing and revenue share gains right now. They're putting dollars in our pocket by using data and analytics to make better and faster pricing decisions as political orders come in at the last minute with little visibility.
Now turning to our content transformation. It is wide-ranging and in full swing.
In the news area, we have a development pipeline of 20 pilot projects as well as a number of new proven practices that are being scaled across the division that will accelerate our growth and share reviewing in our linear newscast as well as other platforms. For example, one of those proven practices we call social listening using software programs like CrowdTangle, our journalists are now using crowd-sourced data to make real-time content decisions on every platform. The result is less repetition and more relevance, all part of our culture of data-driven decision-making across the board. An example of one of those pilots is called Verify, which we are piloting across all of our Texas stations next month after a successful test run at Republican convention last week. Verify lives at the intersection of Anthony Bourdain in local news, if you will, at a time when consumers are skeptical of what's fact and what's not, Verify will offer them a packaged transparent look at the truth. 
In the non-news arena, we have 6 different pilots now of new live local shows underway in 6 markets. And in the syndication space, as Gracia referenced, our T.D. Jakes show begins taping tomorrow. He premiers on September 12. The show is now cleared in 58 markets across 43% of the country, and shortly, we expect to announce a national distribution deal with another program outlet. Awareness of T.D. Jakes has sky rocketed in the aftermath of the tragic police shootings in Dallas. He was sought out by civic leaders and media outlets everywhere and was a healing voice for the city and the nation on both traditional outlets as well as social media.
The Justice Channel, a targeted content multi-cast channel, at which we have an ownership interest continues to grow nicely and is about to grow to 60% clearance of the country of which we make up 30% of the total, or 50% of the 60%, if you will.
Innovation in content, sales and process on all platforms is now the cultural norm at our stations, and together, we are executing on the strategy we have laid out. 
With that, I want to turn it over to Matt Ferguson from CareerBuilder."

CareerBuilder had a strong second quarter returning to growth as we build solid momentum behind the sales of all of our human capital solutions. Our pre-hire platform, which is the first and only of its kind, provides huge benefits to our clients in terms of reducing the cost and time it takes to hire someone. It also provides a competitive advantage for CareerBuilder, no one else comes close to delivering the scope of advertising software and services in one place. We have the most cutting-edge recruitment offering on the market, and employers are very excited about what we can do for them. 
In March of this year, CareerBuilder expanded our -- upon our platform by acquiring Aurico, a leader in background screening and drug testing. We're off to a great start with Aurico and are driving a lot of sales opportunities for them. In Q2 alone, Aurico's revenue was up 27% year-over-year and their invoicing was up 29%. With our sales, marketing and brand behind this business, we expect strong growth to continue to Aurico in the back half of the year and beyond. 
As CareerBuilder continues to evolve as a company, we're seeing a positive trajectory for our revenue. In the second quarter, CareerBuilder generated $181 million in revenue growing 3% year-over-year. This shows improvement over previous periods where our revenue was down 2% year-over-year in Q1 and down 5% year-over-year in Q4.
Contributing to this growth is the strong performance of our software solutions. Software invoicing sold by CareerBuilder in North America was up 10% year-over-year from December 2015 through June 2016. And monthly recurring revenue was up 12% in Q2 2016 compared to Q2 2015. 
In addition, our source and screen business is a good example of how we're reinventing our products. In 2015, we saw a sizable and anticipated revenue decline when we moved away from the transactional approach to this business. After transitioning to a platform-based offering, this business was up 47% from June 2015 to June 2016 and is trending the same way for July. 
As we look forward, it's important to note we recognize the job posting business will continue to experience pricing pressure at the unit level in 2016, and we have reflected that in our projection. So the price per unit will be lower. There is a good opportunity for us to increase the job posting inventory in our side if we go after mainstream higher volume jobs.
Innovation is an everyday occurrence at CareerBuilder, and in the coming months, you'll see us rollout exciting new software solutions. We also continue to explore acquisitions that build on the success of our current offerings and create new revenue stream. We fully expect double-digit growth in our SaaS-based software solutions, resume database and employer services this year. Also reiterate, we anticipate mid-single digit revenue growth in 2016. We are seeing some really good signs from some of the bigger deals that we have been working on from the Aurico pipeline that we expect to hit really as we get closer to Q4. In addition, we still expect to reach 10% growth by the end of 2017. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Alex Vetter, CEO of Cars."
20571,375878643,1012388,"TEGNA Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Matt. We're pleased that all of our retail channels are growing, resulting in nearly 8% increase in revenue compared to the second quarter of last year. This growth has been primarily driven by an increase in dealer market penetration in direct",974,"Thank you, Matt. We're pleased that all of our retail channels are growing, resulting in nearly 8% increase in revenue compared to the second quarter of last year. This growth has been primarily driven by an increase in dealer market penetration in direct markets, new products and increased purchase of display advertising by auto manufacturers. Our strongest growth can be attributed to auto manufacturers and major dealer groups. Our major accounts team is up 9.1% and national revenues are up 15.3%, so combined, we're up more than 11%. 
As we've discussed in the last few earnings calls, we have been disappointed with our affiliate sales performance and have taken steps over the past several months, including additional training and support on product materials to help them improve their trajectory. We're pleased that in the second quarter, they began to reflect some improvements in their trend, and we expect that to continue into the future.
In addition, some of our direct sales channels initiatives kicked off in the first quarter took longer to ramp this year. Both of these factors have contributed to a shortfall in the year-to-date overall growth rate, but we're expecting improved performance in the second half across all channels to be around 9%. This is a result of our ramped initiatives as well as even quicker product expansion through DealerRater, which we had originally been planned to have occurred through organic product development.
As you heard earlier today, we've entered into agreement to acquire DealerRater, the industry's largest automotive consumer review website. We know through a leading automotive consumer experience management company that nearly 80% of car buyers and 70% of service customers cite review sites as the most helpful resource in selecting a dealership. Then transaction as the natural extension of the Cars.com business and strategy and enhances our focus on dealers who provide great, local end-market experiences for shoppers.
With the completion of this acquisition later this summer, we will solidify our position as the leader in online automotive reviews and the preeminent authority for car shoppers and owners for deciding what to buy and now where to buy it and who to buy it from. A strong reputation and successful word-of-mouth referrals go hand-in-hand, and we are uniquely positioned now to help dealers leverage the reputation and connect with end-market shoppers through the power of social. 
On the product front, we're pleased to also welcome Tony Zolla, our new Chief Product Officer. He comes to Cars.com with 18 years experience, building and leading high-performance organizations at some of the nation's top consumer brand. Most recently, he was the Senior Vice President of product and customer experience for the $2 billion retailer Redbox, and prior to that at Ticketmaster. 
We also have good news to share regarding our new products. Last quarter, we launched the next phase of our sell and trade product offering, which includes a new quick offer mobile app, which allows consumers to easily sell their cars and receive real-time offers from local dealers. Dealers buy into the program to access a new audience of consumers and build their used car inventory. We're off to a great start with our sell and trade portfolio of products this year, Q2 sales are up over Q1, and we expect further updates in the sell portfolio soon.
Sales of our campaign-based event position products are up year-over-year due to an increase in vehicle sales incentive in the Memorial Day holiday. And our dealer position is a prominent display product continues to perform well, more than doubling revenue expectations year-to-date. In the near term, we'll see additional new products hit the market, including our cross-device off-site ad targeting products, cars 360x and our deep linking offering, which allows users to connect directly to the vehicle detailed page on a dealer's website directly through Cars.com. This direct connection provides a seemless shopping experience for consumers and drive shoppers into our customers' environment even faster. 
We continue to improve our app experience for our highly engaged mobile audience. A few weeks ago, we launched price drop notifications, alerting shoppers of a price reduction on cars of interest bringing back repeat visitation.
And in the automotive industry, we know that consumer usage of third-party sites is undisputed. Shoppers trust the independent editorial opinions for sites like Cars.com to guide them through the decision-making process of what to buy and now where to buy it. We're harnessing the power of our independent credible voice through a variety of strategic initiative.
First, every year, at Cars.com, editors evaluate cars by segment type using their own in-house expertise, outside experts and consumers looking to buy new cars in a series of multi-car comparisons known as challenges. In June, we hosted a midsized sedan challenge and awarded the Volkswagen Passat as the best in-segment honors. The selection was supported by an integrated marketing and social media campaign that included cross promotion efforts by the winner and is in a licensing agreement that allows Volkswagen to promote the award on all of its advertising and in-dealer collateral.
In addition, we're expanding our presence across other media channels with a weekly segment called Driving Smart that will air Saturday mornings on more than 30 TEGNA Media stations. These segments are produced by Cars.com in our studio, and we use for our website video production and will feature our editors covering topics, such as car shopping 101 and other automotive news of interest to consumers. Our first segment aired last week.
We're thrilled with the DealerRater transaction, the tremendous growth coming in from auto manufacturers and major dealer groups, the potential on our product pipeline and the momentum we're beginning to gain with our affiliates and the ways of leveraging our unique editorial voice with consumers.
Thank you for your time. I'm now going to turn it over to Victoria."
20571,375878643,1012388,"TEGNA Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia has already mentioned, we're very pleased with our solid results this quarter, driven by the strong performances of our businesses across both the Media and Digital Segments. Before I review our consol",1002,"Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia has already mentioned, we're very pleased with our solid results this quarter, driven by the strong performances of our businesses across both the Media and Digital Segments. 
Before I review our consolidated financial results, as well as capital allocation during the quarter, I'd like to note that there were just a few operating special items, which totaled $11 million, primarily related to a voluntary early retirement program within media, which began last quarter. All together, these items unfavorably impacted GAAP EPS by about $0.03 per share. Beyond this, total nonoperating special items totaled $5 million, impacting EPS by about $0.02 per share, driven by the write-off of a small equity investment and cost related to M&A activity. As a reminder, although I'll be focusing on our non-GAAP performance results today, you can find all our reported data and comparatives in our press release.
Now let's briefly review the operating results for the quarter. With strong performances by both Media and Digital Segments, we achieved earnings per share of $0.50, an increase of 67% over last year. Total company revenues of $812 million were up 7% year-over-year. On a pro forma basis, excluding the impact of PointRoll, which we sold at the end of last year, total revenues were up 9% and in line with our full year projection driven by significant growth in the Media Segment's retransmission and political advertising revenues, as well as continued growth in Cars.com and stronger CareerBuilder revenue within the Digital Segment.
During the quarter, total company operating expenses of $575 million were higher by 3% over last year, mainly due to higher programming fees, expenses associated with revenue growth and our ongoing investments in growth initiatives within both the Media and Digital Segments. These were offset in part by a reduction in corporate expenses and the absence of publishing related unallocated costs as well as our continued efficiency efforts.
Now let's turn to a more detailed review of Media and Digital Segment results. Media Segment revenues of $459 million increased by 10% year-over-year, driven by significant growth in retransmission revenues as well as higher political advertising and digital revenue. Retransmission revenues boosted by agreements negotiated at the end of last year, as well as annual rate increases within existing agreements were up 33% this quarter. 
As Dave mentioned, political campaign spending continues to track and we achieved revenues of over $10 million of advertising in the second quarter, despite the impact of the drawnout nomination process, fewer contested primaries in our footprint in second quarter and delayed presidential campaign spending. Beyond this, Media segment digital advertising revenues were also up 12%, driven by Digital Marketing Services, which continue to gain traction across our television stations, driven by G/O Digital sales, expanded reach networks and national digital revenue. As Dave mentioned, excluding a onetime Publishing Segment revenue reclassification at the time of the spin last year, digital revenues would have increased by 17%.
Now focusing on third quarter expectations within Media. Based on current trends, we anticipate increases in retransmission revenue, political advertising, Olympic advertising and digital revenue to resolve the Media segment revenue growth of 20% to 25% for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. As you'd expect, revenue growth will in part be dependent on political spending in the second half within the presidential campaigns as well as for content in both the House and the Senate. 
During the second quarter, the Media Segment operating expenses of $271 million were up 15% year-over-year, primarily due to increased programming costs and investments in our digital sales initiatives, including sales force transformation expansion to support newly launched product offerings.
Now on to the Digital Segment. During the quarter, Digital segment revenues of $353 million increased by 7% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, reflecting continued growth in dealers, consumer use, as well as new product launches at Cars.com and higher revenue at CareerBuilder. 
Cars.com revenues sold directly were up 8%. Including the impact of affiliate revenue performance, revenues increased by 6% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing strength in market penetration within the direct sales market. This was bolstered by the continued success of new products, such as sell and trade, campaign-based event positions and dealer position enhanced. 
National advertising revenue was also strong, up over 9% due mainly to an increase in display advertising by auto manufacturers. CareerBuilder revenues were up 3% year-over-year, the first quarterly increase since early last year. As CareerBuilder continues its sales momentum with strong margin Software-as-a-Service solution.
As Matt mentioned, the acquisition of Aurico and a higher resume database revenue also contributed to the growth this quarter. These were partially offset by headwinds in our job posting business.
Digital Segment operating expenses of $288 million were up 5% due to an increase in expenses, primarily reflecting accelerating investments to sales force and growth initiatives within both Cars.com and CareerBuilder, partly offset by the absence of expenses at PointRoll. As a result of this strong operational execution across the segments, TEGNA overall achieved solid adjusted EBITDA of $288 million this quarter and our EBITDA margin was up 35%, up 200 basis points compared to last year. 
Capital investments of $24 million during the quarter reflect our ongoing commitment to reinvestment in business priorities and include digital development, media content, product integration and platform enhancement, including automated sales tools, order tracking and other critical product enhancement.
During the quarter, solid cash flow from operations was used to fund share repurchases of $76 million as an average price of $22.68 per share, and we made dividend payments of $31 million. During April, we also extinguished $193 million of 10% senior notes which reached their maturity. This resulted in a net reduction of over $14 million in annual interest expense, respectively. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt was $4.3 billion and cash on the balance sheet was $102 million.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for her closing remarks."

We've also dedicated some of our sales support resources to help them in market 4-legged calls to help them understand the products and how they can bring value to their end users. And I think the combination of that, as well as engaging with management to see the opportunities they have, they've started to earmark more resources towards pursuing Cars.com product sales in their market. It is a little bit of a mixed bag because we're doing this on a market-by-market basis. But we've made it to through most of the affiliate market and those that we've been involved with, we've seen them term turn their performance around. So as guidance and the rest of the year, we maybe we feel like we need to keep the pressure up with them some help make sure that our products stay top of mind, but we do see modest improvement in their performance throughout the rest of the year. On the question regarding DealerRater, the deal will close later this summer, and we're not sharing details on the transaction. We do think it presents an enormous opportunity for us to diversify our revenues. As many dealers are already subscribing to Cars.com, we now have yet a new solution to offer them that leverages our vast sales network where DealerRater had an great product, but really lack the sales of the structure that we have. So I think the combination there has tremendous synergy for us to bring a new solution to market that helps dealers capitalize on word of mouth and social marketing."

And let me join Jeff in welcoming you to our second quarter earnings call. I'm going to provide some highlights on TEGNA's overall performance in each of our businesses and then I'm going to turn it over to our business leads: Dave Lougee, President of TEGNA Media; Alex Vetter, CEO of Cars.com; and Matt Ferguson, CEO of CareerBuilder for a closer look at each of their respective businesses. And after that, Victoria will go over some of the financial highlights for the quarter. So let's jump right in.
The end of June marked TEGNA's 1 year anniversary, and we are all proud of everything that we've accomplished to date. Over the last 4 quarters, we've grown both operationally and financially and have launched several successful initiatives and partnerships. More importantly, we remain on track overall toward achieving the goals we reviewed with you at our Investor Day last summer. 
The media and digital landscapes continue to evolve, and we've seen tremendous changes, even since this time last year. As always, our entire team has worked diligently to stay ahead of the trends and ensure that we remain as relevant as ever to our audiences and customers.
But one thing that hasn't changed here at Gannett is the set of key drivers for our business, which include: top-tier properties and their significant footprint, strong margins and steady cash flow, a talented team of experienced industry leaders and a shareholder-first mindset with regard to the use of capital.
So looking at our second quarter results. As you saw this morning, company-wide revenue increased 7% over last year and 9% on a pro forma basis, a result of positive top line growth across our segments. Our revenue growth substantially outpaced the low single-digit growth in operating expenses, and as a result, our profitability was up significantly.
Non-GAAP operating income increased 19%, adjusted EBITDA grew approximately 14% and non-GAAP earnings per share were up 67%. We also generated $79 million of free cash flow.
Now during the quarter, we continued our strategy of partnering with, and investing in, leading-edge companies that are as focused on the same kind of innovative audience engagement as we are. For example, last month, we announced a strategic investments in Kin Community, the premier home-focused content brand and creator community that inspires and informs young women. This new partnership will enable content sharing across TEGNA Media's properties and give us exposure to a new group of young viewers. 
On the flip side, building on our efforts to leverage the strong creativity we possess in-house, this quarter, we cleared our original show, T.D. Jakes to air this coming September in more than 50 markets reaching over 40% of the country.
Another example of how we are joining forces with innovative third parties is our announcement today that we have entered into an agreement subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions to acquire DealerRater. DealerRater is the industry's leading car dealer review site, so it is an outstanding fit for Cars.com as they grow their brand and their consumer connections. And Alex is going to discuss this further in his remarks. 
Now I'll provide more -- a few more specifics on each of our individual businesses, and I'll begin with the Media segment. There, as you saw, our revenue was up 10% year-over-year in line with our guidance. Top line growth was impacted by the timing of political spending as we noted on our first quarter earnings call. We noted then the potential for a lull in political advertising in the second quarter before spending related to the presidential election campaign picks up in earnest. This year, the primaries were especially dramatic and drawn out and didn't wrap up until mid-June. As a result, spending from presidential candidates is just now beginning to come in, but we are confident that spending will continue to ramp up in the back half of the year, typically where about 80% to 85% of all the political dollars we get occur especially during the 5 weeks or so between Labor Day and Election Day. As we all know, that's when candidates typically really feel the pressure to grab those voters. And when the real political dollars start flowing in, TEGNA is very well positioned in many of the key presidential swing states as well as contested Senate and gubernatorial races. 
We also saw substantial bumps in digital and retransmission revenues. The initiatives we are launching, including Hatch, continue to gain traction. And if you remember from last quarter, our Hatch initiative involves fully integrated marketing campaigns designed to give TEGNA access to companies' marketing spend beyond just advertising. As well, our content transformation continues to progress and Dave is going to give us more details on all of that in a moment.
So let's turn to the Digital segment. There, pro forma revenues were up 7% year-over-year. The key driver there was Cars.com, which continued to achieve meaningful revenue growth. Auto manufacturers and large dealer groups contributed significantly to the growth this quarter.
Cars.com is also seeing an uptick in its new product sales, particularly with the new sell and trade offering, and they continue to build their new product pipeline. And Alex is going to share more details on all of that in a few minutes.
Shifting to CareerBuilder. We were very pleased to see a return to growth in the second quarter with its HR Software-as-a-Service platform continuing to be the key story. With its small acquisition of Aurico last quarter, CareerBuilder continues to lead the pack with the best, most compelling offerings among its peers, providing solutions that are cleanly and powerfully integrated. There's obviously a lot going on at CareerBuilder and Matt's going to be able to speak to all of it in just a few moments. 
But first, let me hand it over to Dave Lougee for a deep dive into TEGNA Media."
20571,375878643,1012570,"TEGNA Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gracia. At the midway point in the year, we remain on track for a record year at TEGNA Media. Now let me first dive deeper on Gracia's comments on political. We are headed for another tremendous year in political spending. Two factors led to th",1129,"Thank you, Gracia. At the midway point in the year, we remain on track for a record year at TEGNA Media. Now let me first dive deeper on Gracia's comments on political. We are headed for another tremendous year in political spending. Two factors led to this temporary lull in the second quarter that Gracia referenced. The first is that we didn't have any significant primaries in our particular footprint in that quarter. The second, and more significant, the parties' candidates, as Gracia referenced, were decided much later than 4 years ago. So this year, the start of the much larger spending for the general election or main event, if you will, just got underway at the end of the quarter. Conversely, the Romney-Obama event 4 years ago was well underway in early second quarter. And as a reminder, we are, as Gracia said, positioned very, very well for that main event. We're in states that matter most, including Ohio, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, Colorado, Michigan. And given the close polling, we know Hillary will have a growing war chest coming out of this week's convention.
I also want to address the so-called Trump factor. His funding will now accelerate following the convention last week. And major Republican donors who don't give to him are going to move their money and are moving their money to control over key Senate house and gubernatorial seats, and our footprint there is equally strong. We have contested Senate races in Ohio, Florida, Missouri, North Carolina and Arizona. And the Trump factor may widen the playing field further and open up in other races. For instance, they're now polling -- he and Hillary Clinton are now polling neck in neck in one poll in Georgia. 
The bottom line, spending for all races is now beginning and accelerating fast as expected. In addition to the presidential race, major buys for Senate, House and governors races and the very big statewide issue category are now being placed with that number growing by the day. Those races always begin in earnest in the third quarter.
Now turning to core advertising. Core advertising was down slightly for second quarter, and we were unfavorably affected by 2 factors: not having the final 4 game on CBS this year and a negative variance in the insurance category due to Obamacare spending last year. We finally cycled past that issue starting in this third quarter.
On the digital side. We continue to see strong growth in Q2 and sequential improvement over Q1, excluding a onetime revenue reclassification. And our G/O Digital Marketing Services continues to grow strong at 35% and is a home run with both new and existing clients.
The Rio Olympics begin next week, and we will have another year of record results. We are away outpacing the last -- well outpacing the last Summer Games in 2012 and already have more revenue on the books today than where we finished in 2012. And we're way ahead of the Sochi Winter games in 2014. As with all past Olympics, our NBC stations will be among the very highest rated. And using our scale, we have a centralized crew in Rio that will be coproducing with NBC Sports a nightly half hour program for all our NBC stations, giving us higher rated lead-in programming for primetime coverage, as well as more inventory to sell. 
Now let me turn to the initiatives we've been talking about since Investor Day of last year, all aimed at closing the net retrans gap in 2017, the gap due to the original TEGNA NBC stations paying reverse compensation for the first time starting in 2017. As we said on our last call, those initiatives will contribute $30 million of EBITDA this year, and we remain on track to do just that and are rapidly ramping as projected giving us even more confidence in our ability to close that gap next year.
Hatch, our centralized client solutions group that Gracia referenced, is ramping nicely, and it's ramping off of an essentially fixed cost basis. Our central pricing initiative is also ramping nice. We have established a centralized pricing desk and are beginning to roll out our SaaS-based pricing software, which are both contributing to pricing and revenue share gains right now. They're putting dollars in our pocket by using data and analytics to make better and faster pricing decisions as political orders come in at the last minute with little visibility.
Now turning to our content transformation. It is wide-ranging and in full swing.
In the news area, we have a development pipeline of 20 pilot projects as well as a number of new proven practices that are being scaled across the division that will accelerate our growth in share we're viewing in our linear newscast as well as other platforms. For example, one of those proven practices we call social listening. Using software programs like CrowdTangle, our journalists are now using crowd-sourced data to make real-time content decisions on every platform. The result is less repetition and more relevance, all part of our culture of data-driven decision-making across the board. An example of one of those pilots is called Verify, which we are piloting across all of our Texas stations next month after a successful test run at the Republican convention last week. Verify lives at the intersection of Anthony Bourdain and local news, if you will, at a time when consumers are skeptical of what's fact and what's not, Verify will offer them a packaged transparent look at the truth. 
In the non-news arena, we have 6 different pilots now of new live local shows underway in 6 markets. And in the syndication space, as Gracia referenced, our T.D. Jakes show begins taping tomorrow. He premiers on September 12. The show is now cleared in 58 markets across 43% of the country, and shortly, we expect to announce a national distribution deal with another program outlet. Awareness of T.D. Jakes has sky rocketed in the aftermath of the tragic police shootings in Dallas. He was sought out by civic leaders and media outlets everywhere and was a healing voice for the city and the nation on both traditional outlets as well as social media.
The Justice Channel, a targeted content multi-cast channel, at which we have an ownership interest continues to grow nicely and is about to grow to 60% clearance of the country, of which we make up 30% of the total, or 50% of the 60%, if you will.
Innovation in content, sales and process on all platforms is now the cultural norm at our stations, and together, we are executing on the strategy we have laid out. 
With that, I want to turn it over to Matt Ferguson from CareerBuilder."

CareerBuilder had a strong second quarter returning to growth as we build solid momentum behind the sales of all of our human capital solutions.

CareerBuilder had a strong second quarter returning to growth as we build solid momentum behind the sales of all of our human capital solutions. Our pre-hire platform, which is the first and only of its kind, provides huge benefits to our clients in terms of reducing the cost and time it takes to hire someone. It also provides a competitive advantage for CareerBuilder. No one else comes close to delivering the scope of advertising software and services in one place. We have the most cutting-edge recruitment offering on the market, and employers are very excited about what we can do for them. 
In March of this year, CareerBuilder expanded our -- upon our platform by acquiring Aurico, a leader in background screening and drug testing. We're off to a great start with Aurico and are driving a lot of sales opportunities for them. In Q2 alone, Aurico's revenue was up 27% year-over-year and their invoicing was up 29%. With our sales, marketing and brand behind this business, we expect strong growth to continue at Aurico in the back half of the year and beyond. 
As CareerBuilder continues to evolve as a company, we're seeing a positive trajectory for our revenue. In the second quarter, CareerBuilder generated $181 million in revenue growing 3% year-over-year. This shows improvement over previous periods where our revenue was down 2% year-over-year in Q1 and down 5% year-over-year in Q4.
Contributing to this growth is the strong performance of our software solutions. Software invoicing sold by CareerBuilder in North America was up 10% year-over-year from December 2015 through June 2016. And monthly recurring revenue was up 12% in Q2 2016 compared to Q2 2015. 
In addition, our Source and Screen business is a good example of how we're reinventing our products. In 2015, we saw a sizable and anticipated revenue decline when we moved away from the transactional approach to this business. After transitioning to a platform-based offering, this business was up 47% from June 2015 to June 2016 and is trending the same way for July. 
As we look forward, it's important to note we recognize the job posting business will continue to experience pricing pressure at the unit level in 2016, and we have reflected that in our projection. Though the price per unit will be lower, there is a good opportunity for us to increase the job posting inventory on our site if we go after mainstream higher volume jobs.
Innovation is an everyday occurrence at CareerBuilder, and in the coming months, you'll see us rollout exciting new software solutions. We also continue to explore acquisitions that build on the success of our current offerings and create new revenue streams. We fully expect double-digit growth in our SaaS-based software solutions, resume database and employer services this year. I'll also reiterate, we anticipate mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2016. We are seeing some really good signs from some of the bigger deals that we have been working on from the Aurico pipeline that we expect to hit really as we get closer to Q4. In addition, we still expect to reach 10% growth by the end of 2017. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Alex Vetter, CEO of Cars."
20571,375878643,1012570,"TEGNA Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Matt. We're pleased that all of our retail channels are growing, resulting in nearly 8% increase in revenue compared to the second quarter of last year.

We're pleased that all of our retail channels are growing, resulting in nearly 8% increase in revenue compared to the second quarter of last year. This growth has been primarily driven by an increase in dealer market penetration in direct markets, new products and increased purchase of display advertising by auto manufacturers. Our strongest growth can be attributed to auto manufacturers and major dealer groups. Our major accounts team is up 9.1% and national revenues are up 15.3%, so combined, we're up more than 11%. 
As we've discussed in the last few earnings calls, we have been disappointed with our affiliate sales performance and have taken steps over the past several months, including additional training and support on product materials, to help them improve their trajectory. We're pleased that in the second quarter, they began to reflect some improvements in their trend, and we expect that to continue into the future.
In addition, some of our direct sales channels initiatives kicked off in the first quarter took longer to ramp this year. Both of these factors have contributed to a shortfall in the year-to-date overall growth rate, but we're expecting improved performance in the second half across all channels to be around 9%. This is a result of our ramped initiatives as well as even quicker product expansion through DealerRater, which we had originally been planned to have occurred through organic product development.
As you heard earlier today, we've entered into an agreement to acquire DealerRater, the industry's largest automotive consumer review website. We know through a leading automotive consumer experience management company that nearly 80% of car buyers and 70% of service customers cite review sites as the most helpful resource when selecting a dealership. The transaction is the natural extension of the Cars.com business and strategy and enhances our focus on dealers who provide great, local end-market experiences for shoppers.
With the completion of this acquisition later this summer, we will solidify our position as the leader in online automotive reviews and the preeminent authority for car shoppers and owners for deciding what to buy and now where to buy it and who to buy it from. A strong reputation and successful word-of-mouth referrals go hand-in-hand, and we are uniquely positioned now to help dealers leverage their reputation and connect with end-market shoppers through the power of social. 
On the product front, we're pleased to also welcome Tony Zolla, our new Chief Product Officer. He comes to Cars.com with 18 years' experience, building and leading high-performance organizations at some of the nation's top consumer brands. Most recently, he was the Senior Vice President of product and customer experience for the $2 billion retailer Redbox, and prior to that at Ticketmaster. 
We also have good news to share regarding our new products. Last quarter, we launched the next phase of our sell and trade product offering, which includes a new quick offer mobile app, which allows consumers to easily sell their cars and receive real-time offers from local dealers. Dealers buy into the program to access a new audience of consumers and build their used car inventories. We're off to a great start with our sell and trade portfolio of products this year, Q2 sales are up over Q1, and we expect further updates in the sell portfolio soon.
Sales of our campaign-based event positioned products are up year-over-year due to an increase in vehicle sales incentive and the Memorial Day holiday. And our dealer positions of prominent display product continues to perform well, more than doubling revenue expectations year-to-date. In the near term, we'll see additional new products hit the market, including our cross-device off-site ad targeting products, cars 360x and our deep linking offering, which allows users to connect directly to the vehicle detailed page on a dealer's website directly through Cars.com. This direct connection provides a seamless shopping experience for consumers and drives shoppers into our customers' environments even faster. 
We continue to improve our app experience for our highly engaged mobile audience. A few weeks ago, we launched price drop notifications, alerting shoppers of a price reduction on cars of interest bringing back repeat visitation.
And in the automotive industry, we know that consumer usage of third-party sites is undisputed. Shoppers trust the independent editorial opinions of sites like Cars.com to guide them through the decision-making process of what to buy and now where to buy it. We're harnessing the power of our independent credible voice through a variety of strategic initiatives.
First, every year, Cars.com editors evaluate cars by segment type using their own in-house expertise, outside experts and consumers looking to buy new cars in a series of multi-car comparisons known as challenges. In June, we hosted the midsized sedan challenge and awarded the Volkswagen Passat as the best-in-segment honors. The selection was supported by an integrated marketing and social media campaign that included cross promotion efforts by the winner and is in a licensing agreement that allows Volkswagen to promote the award on all of its advertising and in-dealer collateral.
In addition, we're expanding our presence across other media channels with a weekly segment called Driving Smart that will air Saturday mornings on more than 30 TEGNA Media stations. These segments are produced by Cars.com in our studio, and we use for our website video production and will feature our editors covering topics, such as car shopping 101 and other automotive news of interest to consumers. Our first segment aired last week.
We're thrilled with the DealerRater transaction, the tremendous growth coming in from auto manufacturers and major dealer groups, the potential on our product pipeline and the momentum we're beginning to gain with our affiliates and the ways that we're leveraging our unique editorial voice with consumers.
Thank you for your time. I'm now going to turn it over to Victoria."
20571,375878643,1012570,"TEGNA Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia has already mentioned, we're very pleased with our solid results this quarter, driven by the strong performances of our businesses across both the Media and Digital segments. Before I review our consol",1003,"Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia has already mentioned, we're very pleased with our solid results this quarter, driven by the strong performances of our businesses across both the Media and Digital segments. 
Before I review our consolidated financial results, as well as capital allocation during the quarter, I'd like to note that there were just a few operating special items, which totaled $11 million, primarily related to a voluntarily -- voluntary early retirement program within Media, which began last quarter. All together, these items unfavorably impacted GAAP EPS by about $0.03 per share. Beyond this, total nonoperating special items totaled $5 million, impacting EPS by about $0.02 per share, driven by the write-off of a small equity investment and costs related to M&A activity. As a reminder, although I'll be focusing on our non-GAAP performance results today, you can find all our reported data and comparatives in our press release.
Now let's briefly review the operating results for the quarter. With strong performances by both Media and Digital segments, we achieved earnings per share of $0.50, an increase of 67% over last year. Total company revenues of $812 million were up 7% year-over-year. On a pro forma basis, excluding the impact of PointRoll, which we sold at the end of last year, total revenues were up 9% and in line with our full year projections, driven by significant growth in the Media segment's retransmission and political advertising revenues, as well as continued growth in Cars.com and stronger CareerBuilder revenue within the Digital segment.
During the quarter, total company operating expenses of $575 million were higher by 3% over last year, mainly due to higher programming fees, expenses associated with revenue growth and our ongoing investments in growth initiatives within both the Media and Digital segments. These were offset in part by a reduction in corporate expenses and the absence of publishing-related unallocated costs as well as our continued efficiency efforts.
Now let's turn to a more detailed review of Media and Digital segment results. Media segment revenues of $459 million increased by 10% year-over-year, driven by significant growth in retransmission revenues as well as higher political advertising and digital revenue. Retransmission revenues boosted by agreements negotiated at the end of last year, as well as annual rate increases within existing agreements, were up 33% this quarter. 
As Dave mentioned, political campaign spending continues to track and we achieved revenues of over $10 million of advertising in the second quarter, despite the impact of the drawn-out nomination process, fewer contested primaries in our footprint in second quarter and delayed presidential campaign spending. Beyond this, Media segment digital advertising revenues were also up 12%, driven by Digital Marketing Services, which continued to gain traction across our television stations, driven by G/O Digital sales, extended reach networks and national digital revenue. As Dave mentioned, excluding a onetime Publishing segment revenue reclassification at the time of the spin last year, digital revenues would have increased by 17%.
Now focusing on third quarter expectations within Media. Based on current trends, we anticipate increases in retransmission revenue, political advertising, Olympic advertising and digital revenue to result in Media segment revenue growth of 20% to 25% for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. As you'd expect, revenue growth will in part be dependent on political spending in the second half within the presidential campaign as well as for contests in both the House and the Senate. 
During the second quarter, the Media segment operating expenses of $271 million were up 15% year-over-year, primarily due to increased programming costs and investments in our digital sales initiatives, including sales force transformation expansion to support newly launched product offerings.
Now on to the Digital segment. During the quarter, Digital segment revenues of $353 million increased by 7% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, reflecting continued growth in dealers, consumer use, as well as new product launches at Cars.com and higher revenue at CareerBuilder. 
Cars.com revenues sold directly were up 8%. Including the impact of affiliate revenue performance, revenues increased by 6% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing strength in market penetration within the direct sales market. This was bolstered by the continued success of new products, such as sell and trade, campaign-based event positions and dealer position enhanced. 
National advertising revenue was also strong, up over 9% due mainly to an increase in display advertising by auto manufacturers. CareerBuilder revenues were up 3% year-over-year, the first quarterly increase since early last year, as CareerBuilder continues its sales momentum with strong margin Software-as-a-Service solutions.
As Matt mentioned, the acquisition of Aurico and the higher resume database revenue also contributed to the growth this quarter. These were partially offset by headwinds in our job posting business.
Digital segment operating expenses of $288 million were up 5% due to an increase in expenses, primarily reflecting accelerating investments in sales force and growth initiatives within both Cars.com and CareerBuilder, partly offset by the absence of expenses at PointRoll. As a result of this strong operational execution across the segments, TEGNA overall achieved solid adjusted EBITDA of $288 million this quarter and our EBITDA margin was up 35%, up 200 basis points compared to last year. 
Capital investments of $24 million during the quarter reflect our ongoing commitment to reinvestment in business priorities and include digital development, media content, product integration and platform enhancement, including automated sales tools, order tracking and other critical product enhancements.
During the quarter, solid cash flow from operations was used to fund share repurchases of $76 million at an average price of $22.68 per share, and we made dividend payments of $31 million. During April, we also extinguished $193 million of 10% senior notes which reached their maturity. This resulted in a net reduction of over $14 million in annual interest expense, prospectively. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt was $4.3 billion and cash on the balance sheet was $102 million.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for her closing remarks."

We've also dedicated some of our sales support resources to help them in market, 4-legged calls to help them understand the products and how they can bring value to their end users. And I think the combination of that, as well as engaging with management to see the opportunities they have, they've started to earmark more resources towards pursuing Cars.com product sales in their market. It is a little bit of a mixed bag because we're doing this on a market-by-market basis. But we've made it through most of the affiliate markets, and those that we've been involved with, we've seen them term turn their performance around. So as guidance and the rest of the year, we maybe we feel like we need to keep the pressure up with them to help make sure that our products stay top of mind, but we do see modest improvement in their performance throughout the rest of the year. On the question regarding DealerRater, the deal will close later this summer, and we're not sharing details on the transaction. We do think it presents an enormous opportunity for us to diversify our revenues. As many dealers are already subscribing to Cars.com, we now have yet a new solution to offer them that leverages our vast sales network where DealerRater had a great product, but really lacked the sales infrastructure that we have. So I think the combination there has tremendous synergy for us to bring a new solution to market that helps dealers capitalize on word of mouth and social marketing."

And let me join Jeff in welcoming you to our second quarter earnings call. I'm going to provide some highlights on TEGNA's overall performance in each of our businesses and then I'm going to turn it over to our business leads: Dave Lougee, President of TEGNA Media; Alex Vetter, CEO of Cars.com; and Matt Ferguson, CEO of CareerBuilder for a closer look at each of their respective businesses. And after that, Victoria will go over some of the financial highlights for the quarter. So let's jump right in.
The end of June marked TEGNA's 1 year anniversary, and we are all proud of everything that we've accomplished to date. Over the last 4 quarters, we've grown both operationally and financially and have launched several successful initiatives and partnerships. More importantly, we remain on track overall toward achieving the goals we reviewed with you at our Investor Day last summer. 
The media and digital landscapes continue to evolve, and we've seen tremendous changes, even since this time last year. As always, our entire team has worked diligently to stay ahead of the trends and ensure that we remain as relevant as ever to our audiences and customers.
But one thing that hasn't changed here at Gannett is the set of key drivers for our business, which include: top-tier properties and their significant footprint, strong margins and steady cash flow, a talented team of experienced industry leaders and a shareholder-first mindset with regard to the use of capital.
So looking at our second quarter results. As you saw this morning, company-wide revenue increased 7% over last year and 9% on a pro forma basis, a result of positive top line growth across our segments. Our revenue growth substantially outpaced the low single-digit growth in operating expenses, and as a result, our profitability was up significantly.
Non-GAAP operating income increased 19%, adjusted EBITDA grew approximately 14% and non-GAAP earnings per share were up 67%. We also generated $79 million of free cash flow.
Now during the quarter, we continued our strategy of partnering with, and investing in, leading-edge companies that are as focused on the same kind of innovative audience engagement as we are. For example, last month, we announced a strategic investments in Kin Community, the premier home-focused content brand and creator community that inspires and informs young women. This new partnership will enable content sharing across TEGNA Media's properties and give us exposure to a new group of young viewers. 
On the flip side, building on our efforts to leverage the strong creativity we possess in-house, this quarter, we cleared our original show, T.D. Jakes to air this coming September in more than 50 markets reaching over 40% of the country.
Another example of how we are joining forces with innovative third parties is our announcement today that we have entered into an agreement subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions to acquire DealerRater. DealerRater is the industry's leading car dealer review site, so it is an outstanding fit for Cars.com as they grow their brand and their consumer connections. And Alex is going to discuss this further in his remarks. 
Now I'll provide more -- a few more specifics on each of our individual businesses, and I'll begin with the Media segment. There, as you saw, our revenue was up 10% year-over-year in line with our guidance. Top line growth was impacted by the timing of political spending as we noted on our first quarter earnings call. We noted then the potential for a lull in political advertising in the second quarter before spending related to the presidential election campaign picks up in earnest. This year, the primaries were especially dramatic and drawn out and didn't wrap up until mid-June. As a result, spending from presidential candidates is just now beginning to come in, but we are confident that spending will continue to ramp up in the back half of the year, typically where about 80% to 85% of all the political dollars we get occur especially during the 5 weeks or so between Labor Day and Election Day. As we all know, that's when candidates typically really feel the pressure to grab those voters. And when the real political dollars start flowing in, TEGNA is very well positioned in many of the key presidential swing states as well as contested Senate and gubernatorial races. 
We also saw substantial bumps in digital and retransmission revenues. The initiatives we are launching, including Hatch, continue to gain traction. And if you remember from last quarter, our Hatch initiative involves fully integrated marketing campaigns designed to give TEGNA access to companies' marketing spend beyond just advertising. As well, our content transformation continues to progress and Dave is going to give us more details on all of that in a moment.
So let's turn to the Digital segment. There, pro forma revenues were up 7% year-over-year. The key driver there was Cars.com, which continued to achieve meaningful revenue growth. Auto manufacturers and large dealer groups contributed significantly to the growth this quarter.
Cars.com is also seeing an uptick in its new product sales, particularly with the new sell and trade offering, and they continue to build their new product pipeline. And Alex is going to share more details on all of that in a few minutes.
Shifting to CareerBuilder. We were very pleased to see a return to growth in the second quarter with its HR Software-as-a-Service platform continuing to be the key story. With its small acquisition of Aurico last quarter, CareerBuilder continues to lead the pack with the best, most compelling offerings among its peers, providing solutions that are cleanly and powerfully integrated. There's obviously a lot going on at CareerBuilder and Matt's going to be able to speak to all of it in just a few moments. 
But first, let me hand it over to Dave Lougee for a deep dive into TEGNA Media."
20571,375878643,1012905,"TEGNA Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gracia. At the midway point in the year, we remain on track for a record year at TEGNA Media. Now let me first dive deeper on Gracia's comments on political. We are headed for another tremendous year in political spending. Two factors led to th",1129,"Thank you, Gracia. At the midway point in the year, we remain on track for a record year at TEGNA Media. Now let me first dive deeper on Gracia's comments on political. We are headed for another tremendous year in political spending. Two factors led to this temporary lull in the second quarter that Gracia referenced. The first is that we didn't have any significant primaries in our particular footprint in that quarter. The second, and more significant, the parties' candidates, as Gracia referenced, were decided much later than 4 years ago. So this year, the start of the much larger spending for the general election or main event, if you will, just got underway at the end of the quarter. Conversely, the Romney-Obama event 4 years ago was well underway in early second quarter. And as a reminder, we are, as Gracia said, positioned very, very well for that main event. We're in states that matter most, including Ohio, Florida, Virginia, North Carolina, Colorado, Michigan. And given the close polling, we know Hillary will have a growing war chest coming out of this week's convention.
I also want to address the so-called Trump factor. His funding will now accelerate following the convention last week. And major Republican donors who don't give to him are going to move their money and are moving their money to control over key Senate house and gubernatorial seats, and our footprint there is equally strong. We have contested Senate races in Ohio, Florida, Missouri, North Carolina and Arizona. And the Trump factor may widen the playing field further and open up in other races. For instance, they're now polling -- he and Hillary Clinton are now polling neck in neck in one poll in Georgia. 
The bottom line, spending for all races is now beginning and accelerating fast as expected. In addition to the presidential race, major buys for Senate, House and governors races and the very big statewide issue category are now being placed with that number growing by the day. Those races always begin in earnest in the third quarter.
Now turning to core advertising. Core advertising was down slightly for second quarter, and we were unfavorably affected by 2 factors: not having the final 4 game on CBS this year and a negative variance in the insurance category due to Obamacare spending last year. We finally cycled past that issue starting in this third quarter.
On the digital side. We continue to see strong growth in Q2 and sequential improvement over Q1, excluding a onetime revenue reclassification. And our G/O Digital Marketing Services continues to grow strong at 35% and is a home run with both new and existing clients.
The Rio Olympics begin next week, and we will have another year of record results. We are away outpacing the last -- well outpacing the last Summer Games in 2012 and already have more revenue on the books today than where we finished in 2012. And we're way ahead of the Sochi Winter games in 2014. As with all past Olympics, our NBC stations will be among the very highest rated. And using our scale, we have a centralized crew in Rio that will be coproducing with NBC Sports a nightly half hour program for all our NBC stations, giving us higher rated lead-in programming for primetime coverage as well as more inventory to sell. 
Now let me turn to the initiatives we've been talking about since Investor Day of last year, all aimed at closing the net retrans gap in 2017, the gap due to the original TEGNA NBC stations paying reverse compensation for the first time starting in 2017. As we said on our last call, those initiatives will contribute $30 million of EBITDA this year, and we remain on track to do just that and are rapidly ramping as projected giving us even more confidence in our ability to close that gap next year.
Hatch, our centralized client solutions group that Gracia referenced, is ramping nicely, and it's ramping off of an essentially fixed cost basis. Our central pricing initiative is also ramping nice. We have established a centralized pricing desk and are beginning to roll out our SaaS-based pricing software, which are both contributing to pricing and revenue share gains right now. They're putting dollars in our pocket by using data and analytics to make better and faster pricing decisions as political orders come in at the last minute with little visibility.
Now turning to our content transformation. It is wide-ranging and in full swing.
In the news area, we have a development pipeline of 20 pilot projects as well as a number of new proven practices that are being scaled across the division that will accelerate our growth in share we're viewing in our linear newscast as well as other platforms. For example, one of those proven practices we call social listening. Using software programs like CrowdTangle, our journalists are now using crowd-sourced data to make real-time content decisions on every platform. The result is less repetition and more relevance, all part of our culture of data-driven decision-making across the board. An example of one of those pilots is called Verify, which we are piloting across all of our Texas stations next month after a successful test run at the Republican convention last week. Verify lives at the intersection of Anthony Bourdain and local news, if you will, at a time when consumers are skeptical of what's fact and what's not, Verify will offer them a packaged transparent look at the truth. 
In the non-news arena, we have 6 different pilots now of new live local shows underway in 6 markets. And in the syndication space, as Gracia referenced, our T.D. Jakes show begins taping tomorrow. He premiers on September 12. The show is now cleared in 58 markets across 43% of the country, and shortly, we expect to announce a national distribution deal with another program outlet. Awareness of T.D. Jakes has sky rocketed in the aftermath of the tragic police shootings in Dallas. He was sought out by civic leaders and media outlets everywhere and was a healing voice for the city and the nation on both traditional outlets as well as social media.
The Justice Channel, a targeted content multi-cast channel, at which we have an ownership interest continues to grow nicely and is about to grow to 60% clearance of the country, of which we make up 30% of the total, or 50% of the 60%, if you will.
Innovation in content, sales and process on all platforms is now the cultural norm at our stations, and together, we are executing on the strategy we have laid out. 
With that, I want to turn it over to Matt Ferguson from CareerBuilder."
20571,375878643,1012905,"TEGNA Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dave. CareerBuilder had a strong second quarter returning to growth as we build solid momentum behind the sales of all of our human capital solutions.

CareerBuilder had a strong second quarter returning to growth as we build solid momentum behind the sales of all of our human capital solutions. Our pre-hire platform, which is the first and only of its kind, provides huge benefits to our clients in terms of reducing the cost and time it takes to hire someone. It also provides a competitive advantage for CareerBuilder. No one else comes close to delivering the scope of advertising software and services in one place. We have the most cutting-edge recruitment offering on the market, and employers are very excited about what we can do for them. 
In March of this year, CareerBuilder expanded our -- upon our platform by acquiring Aurico, a leader in background screening and drug testing. We're off to a great start with Aurico and are driving a lot of sales opportunities for them. In Q2 alone, Aurico's revenue was up 27% year-over-year and their invoicing was up 29%. With our sales, marketing and brand behind this business, we expect strong growth to continue at Aurico in the back half of the year and beyond. 
As CareerBuilder continues to evolve as a company, we're seeing a positive trajectory for our revenue. In the second quarter, CareerBuilder generated $181 million in revenue growing 3% year-over-year. This shows improvement over previous periods where our revenue was down 2% year-over-year in Q1 and down 5% year-over-year in Q4.
Contributing to this growth is the strong performance of our software solutions. Software invoicing sold by CareerBuilder in North America was up 10% year-over-year from December 2015 through June 2016. And monthly recurring revenue was up 12% in Q2 2016 compared to Q2 2015. 
In addition, our Source and Screen business is a good example of how we're reinventing our products. In 2015, we saw a sizable and anticipated revenue decline when we moved away from the transactional approach to this business. After transitioning to a platform-based offering, this business was up 47% from June 2015 to June 2016 and is trending the same way for July. 
As we look forward, it's important to note we recognize the job posting business will continue to experience pricing pressure at the unit level in 2016, and we have reflected that in our projection. Though the price per unit will be lower, there is a good opportunity for us to increase the job posting inventory on our site if we go after mainstream higher volume jobs.
Innovation is an everyday occurrence at CareerBuilder, and in the coming months, you'll see us rollout exciting new software solutions. We also continue to explore acquisitions that build on the success of our current offerings and create new revenue streams. We fully expect double-digit growth in our SaaS-based software solutions, resume database and employer services this year. I'll also reiterate, we anticipate mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2016. We are seeing some really good signs from some of the bigger deals that we have been working on from the Aurico pipeline that we expect to hit really as we get closer to Q4. In addition, we still expect to reach 10% growth by the end of 2017. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Alex Vetter, CEO of Cars."
20571,375878643,1012905,"TEGNA Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Matt. We're pleased that all of our retail channels are growing, resulting in nearly 8% increase in revenue compared to the second quarter of last year.

We're pleased that all of our retail channels are growing, resulting in nearly 8% increase in revenue compared to the second quarter of last year. This growth has been primarily driven by an increase in dealer market penetration in direct markets, new products and increased purchase of display advertising by auto manufacturers. Our strongest growth can be attributed to auto manufacturers and major dealer groups. Our major accounts team is up 9.1% and national revenues are up 15.3%, so combined, we're up more than 11%. 
As we've discussed in the last few earnings calls, we have been disappointed with our affiliate sales performance and have taken steps over the past several months, including additional training and support on product materials, to help them improve their trajectory. We're pleased that in the second quarter, they began to reflect some improvements in their trend, and we expect that to continue into the future.
In addition, some of our direct sales channels initiatives kicked off in the first quarter took longer to ramp this year. Both of these factors have contributed to a shortfall in the year-to-date overall growth rate, but we're expecting improved performance in the second half across all channels to be around 9%. This is a result of our ramped initiatives as well as even quicker product expansion through DealerRater, which we had originally been planned to have occurred through organic product development.
As you heard earlier today, we've entered into an agreement to acquire DealerRater, the industry's largest automotive consumer review website. We know through a leading automotive consumer experience management company that nearly 80% of car buyers and 70% of service customers cite review sites as the most helpful resource when selecting a dealership. The transaction is the natural extension of the Cars.com business and strategy and enhances our focus on dealers who provide great, local end-market experiences for shoppers.
With the completion of this acquisition later this summer, we will solidify our position as the leader in online automotive reviews and the preeminent authority for car shoppers and owners for deciding what to buy and now where to buy it and who to buy it from. A strong reputation and successful word-of-mouth referrals go hand-in-hand, and we are uniquely positioned now to help dealers leverage their reputation and connect with end-market shoppers through the power of social. 
On the product front, we're pleased to also welcome Tony Zolla, our new Chief Product Officer. He comes to Cars.com with 18 years' experience, building and leading high-performance organizations at some of the nation's top consumer brands. Most recently, he was the Senior Vice President of product and customer experience for the $2 billion retailer Redbox, and prior to that at Ticketmaster. 
We also have good news to share regarding our new products. Last quarter, we launched the next phase of our sell and trade product offering, which includes a new quick offer mobile app, which allows consumers to easily sell their cars and receive real-time offers from local dealers. Dealers buy into the program to access a new audience of consumers and build their used car inventories. We're off to a great start with our sell and trade portfolio of products this year, Q2 sales are up over Q1, and we expect further updates in the sell portfolio soon.
Sales of our campaign-based event positioned products are up year-over-year due to an increase in vehicle sales incentive and the Memorial Day holiday. And our dealer positions of prominent display product continues to perform well, more than doubling revenue expectations year-to-date. In the near term, we'll see additional new products hit the market, including our cross-device off-site ad targeting products, cars 360x and our deep linking offering, which allows users to connect directly to the vehicle detailed page on a dealer's website directly through Cars.com. This direct connection provides a seamless shopping experience for consumers and drives shoppers into our customers' environments even faster. 
We continue to improve our app experience for our highly engaged mobile audience. A few weeks ago, we launched price drop notifications, alerting shoppers of a price reduction on cars of interest bringing back repeat visitation.
And in the automotive industry, we know that consumer usage of third-party sites is undisputed. Shoppers trust the independent editorial opinions of sites like Cars.com to guide them through the decision-making process of what to buy and now where to buy it. We're harnessing the power of our independent credible voice through a variety of strategic initiatives.
First, every year, Cars.com editors evaluate cars by segment type using their own in-house expertise, outside experts and consumers looking to buy new cars in a series of multi-car comparisons known as challenges. In June, we hosted the midsized sedan challenge and awarded the Volkswagen Passat as the best-in-segment honors. The selection was supported by an integrated marketing and social media campaign that included cross promotion efforts by the winner and is in a licensing agreement that allows Volkswagen to promote the award on all of its advertising and in-dealer collateral.
In addition, we're expanding our presence across other media channels with a weekly segment called Driving Smart that will air Saturday mornings on more than 30 TEGNA Media stations. These segments are produced by Cars.com in our studio, and we use for our website video production and will feature our editors covering topics, such as car shopping 101 and other automotive news of interest to consumers. Our first segment aired last week.
We're thrilled with the DealerRater transaction, the tremendous growth coming in from auto manufacturers and major dealer groups, the potential on our product pipeline and the momentum we're beginning to gain with our affiliates and the ways that we're leveraging our unique editorial voice with consumers.
Thank you for your time. I'm now going to turn it over to Victoria."
20571,375878643,1012905,"TEGNA Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 26, 2016",2016-07-26,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia has already mentioned, we're very pleased with our solid results this quarter, driven by the strong performances of our businesses across both the Media and Digital segments. Before I review our consol",1003,"Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia has already mentioned, we're very pleased with our solid results this quarter, driven by the strong performances of our businesses across both the Media and Digital segments. 
Before I review our consolidated financial results, as well as capital allocation during the quarter, I'd like to note that there were just a few operating special items, which totaled $11 million, primarily related to a voluntarily -- voluntary early retirement program within Media, which began last quarter. All together, these items unfavorably impacted GAAP EPS by about $0.03 per share. Beyond this, total nonoperating special items totaled $5 million, impacting EPS by about $0.02 per share, driven by the write-off of a small equity investment and costs related to M&A activity. As a reminder, although I'll be focusing on our non-GAAP performance results today, you can find all our reported data and comparatives in our press release.
Now let's briefly review the operating results for the quarter. With strong performances by both Media and Digital segments, we achieved earnings per share of $0.50, an increase of 67% over last year. Total company revenues of $812 million were up 7% year-over-year. On a pro forma basis, excluding the impact of PointRoll, which we sold at the end of last year, total revenues were up 9% and in line with our full year projections, driven by significant growth in the Media segment's retransmission and political advertising revenues as well as continued growth in Cars.com and stronger CareerBuilder revenue within the Digital segment.
During the quarter, total company operating expenses of $575 million were higher by 3% over last year, mainly due to higher programming fees, expenses associated with revenue growth and our ongoing investments in growth initiatives within both the Media and Digital segments. These were offset in part by a reduction in corporate expenses and the absence of publishing-related unallocated costs as well as our continued efficiency efforts.
Now let's turn to a more detailed review of Media and Digital segment results. Media segment revenues of $459 million increased by 10% year-over-year, driven by significant growth in retransmission revenues as well as higher political advertising and digital revenue. Retransmission revenues boosted by agreements negotiated at the end of last year, as well as annual rate increases within existing agreements, were up 33% this quarter. 
As Dave mentioned, political campaign spending continues to track and we achieved revenues of over $10 million of advertising in the second quarter, despite the impact of the drawn-out nomination process, fewer contested primaries in our footprint in second quarter and delayed presidential campaign spending. Beyond this, Media segment digital advertising revenues were also up 12%, driven by Digital Marketing Services, which continued to gain traction across our television stations, driven by G/O Digital sales, extended reach networks and national digital revenue. As Dave mentioned, excluding a onetime Publishing segment revenue reclassification at the time of the spin last year, digital revenues would have increased by 17%.
Now focusing on third quarter expectations within Media. Based on current trends, we anticipate increases in retransmission revenue, political advertising, Olympic advertising and digital revenue to result in Media segment revenue growth of 20% to 25% for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. As you'd expect, revenue growth will in part be dependent on political spending in the second half within the presidential campaign as well as for contests in both the House and the Senate. 
During the second quarter, the Media segment operating expenses of $271 million were up 15% year-over-year, primarily due to increased programming costs and investments in our digital sales initiatives, including sales force transformation expansion to support newly launched product offerings.
Now on to the Digital segment. During the quarter, Digital segment revenues of $353 million increased by 7% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, reflecting continued growth in dealers, consumer use as well as new product launches at Cars.com and higher revenue at CareerBuilder. 
Cars.com revenues sold directly were up 8%. Including the impact of affiliate revenue performance, revenues increased by 6% year-over-year, reflecting ongoing strength in market penetration within the direct sales market. This was bolstered by the continued success of new products, such as sell and trade, campaign-based event positions and dealer position enhanced. 
National advertising revenue was also strong, up over 9% due mainly to an increase in display advertising by auto manufacturers. CareerBuilder revenues were up 3% year-over-year, the first quarterly increase since early last year, as CareerBuilder continues its sales momentum with strong margin Software-as-a-Service solutions.
As Matt mentioned, the acquisition of Aurico and the higher resume database revenue also contributed to the growth this quarter. These were partially offset by headwinds in our job posting business.
Digital segment operating expenses of $288 million were up 5% due to an increase in expenses, primarily reflecting accelerating investments in sales force and growth initiatives within both Cars.com and CareerBuilder, partly offset by the absence of expenses at PointRoll. As a result of this strong operational execution across the segments, TEGNA overall achieved solid adjusted EBITDA of $288 million this quarter and our EBITDA margin was up 35%, up 200 basis points compared to last year. 
Capital investments of $24 million during the quarter reflect our ongoing commitment to reinvestment in business priorities and include digital development, media content, product integration and platform enhancement, including automated sales tools, order tracking and other critical product enhancements.
During the quarter, solid cash flow from operations was used to fund share repurchases of $76 million at an average price of $22.68 per share, and we made dividend payments of $31 million. During April, we also extinguished $193 million of 10% senior notes which reached their maturity. This resulted in a net reduction of over $14 million in annual interest expense, prospectively. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt was $4.3 billion and cash on the balance sheet was $102 million.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for her closing remarks."

We've also dedicated some of our sales support resources to help them in market, 4-legged calls to help them understand the products and how they can bring value to their end users. And I think the combination of that, as well as engaging with management to see the opportunities they have, they've started to earmark more resources towards pursuing Cars.com product sales in their market. It is a little bit of a mixed bag because we're doing this on a market-by-market basis. But we've made it through most of the affiliate markets, and those that we've been involved with, we've seen them term turn their performance around. So as guidance and the rest of the year, we maybe we feel like we need to keep the pressure up with them to help make sure that our products stay top of mind, but we do see modest improvement in their performance throughout the rest of the year. On the question regarding DealerRater, the deal will close later this summer, and we're not sharing details on the transaction. We do think it presents an enormous opportunity for us to diversify our revenues. As many dealers are already subscribing to Cars.com, we now have yet a new solution to offer them that leverages our vast sales network where DealerRater had a great product, but really lacked the sales infrastructure that we have. So I think the combination there has tremendous synergy for us to bring a new solution to market that helps dealers capitalize on word of mouth and social marketing."

Now I'm going to provide some updates on the developments that we announced in September as well as some highlights on TEGNA's overall performance and each of our businesses during the quarter. Then I'm going to turn it over to our business heads: Dave Lougee's, President of TEGNA Media; and Alex Vetter, CEO of Cars.com, for a closer look at their respective businesses. And after that, Victoria will cover the financial highlights in a little bit more detail. 
Overall, we had a very productive quarter on multiple fronts, so let's just get right to it. As you know, in early September, we announced our plan to separate Cars.com from TEGNA, creating 2 strong industry-leading companies with the tools and resources they need to grow profitably in their targeted markets and to respond to the rapid changes taking place in the broadcast and digital sectors. Now as you may have seen, we filed our Form 10 on the day we announced the spin back in September. Last evening, we filed our first amendment to that Form 10. We remain on track to complete the spin-off in the first half of 2017. Alex and we are actively interviewing for key roles that will be integral to Cars.com as it begins trading as a publicly listed company. 
We are also making progress on the strategic review process for CareerBuilder, which is now underway. We've hired an investment banker, and we'll be reviewing a variety of alternatives. I have to say we are very pleased with the level of unsolicited interest we have received to date. 
Turning now to our performance during the quarter. As you saw, company-wide revenue increased 14%, driven by a strong performance at TEGNA Media and solid results within our Digital Segment. Our adjusted EBITDA was substantially higher, and our adjusted EBITDA margin improved compared to the third quarter last year. As well, non-GAAP EPS grew 76% year-over-year. 
TEGNA Media revenues rose substantially, as you saw, as our strong NBC footprint led to record Summer Olympic advertising revenue in the quarter. We continue to benefit from the strong boost trajectory in retransmission revenue we have seen over the past several years. And we also benefited from substantially higher political revenue, though not as much as we had hoped given our footprint and what the actual presidential footprint ended up being. 
As you're all aware, this year's presidential election has been atypical, to say the least. Now Dave's going to provide some additional color on the political spending landscape in his remarks. 
Turning to the rest of our growth drivers. We are focused on diversifying our revenue streams in the Media Segment, particularly in the digital space. We have launched an over-the-top video advertising business, Premion, and continue to effectively link digital content with digital sales. As we have previously discussed, there are several initiatives underway that center on enhancing core revenue, our digital marketing offerings and, of course, most importantly, our content, all of which we are confident will offset the anticipated gap in net retrans in 2017. And you'll get a little bit more detail on those initiatives a little bit later. 
Turning to TEGNA Digital. Revenues there also improved in the quarter, led by a strong direct revenue increase at Cars.com and another quarter of improving revenue growth at CareerBuilder. 
In August, we completed the acquisition of DealerRater, the leading car dealer review site. Already, we have made significant progress on our integration plans and are hitting the ground running in the fourth quarter. We expect DealerRater to contribute to Cars.com's revenue growth meaningfully as we move through 2017. As you are aware, digital offerings are the fastest-growing segment within the advertising ecosystem, and automotive continues to be one of the top categories. As industry trends continue to evolve and digital marketing budgets for dealer groups and auto manufacturers keep expanding, we expect to gain ground and capture a larger piece of the growing pie. We are taking steps to ensure that we are well positioned as we head into 2017 and beyond by implementing initiatives aimed at improving traffic and strengthening our leadership position in mobile. 
You'll hear more about specific growth initiatives underway at Cars.com shortly, but let me take a moment to reiterate some of the themes we covered at the time of the spin-off announcement. Cars.com is a strong, highly recognizable national brand with consumers and has a broad footprint in a highly attractive growing digital auto marketplace. It is the trusted source for millions of Americans in search of new and used cars as well as maintenance and repair services. Additionally, with an EBITDA margin in the high 30s, relatively low CapEx and strong reliable cash flows, it offers a unique mix of operational excellence and profitability, combined with growth dynamics rivaled by few others in the industry. We continue to be confident that Cars.com will thrive as an independent company and will benefit from even more flexibly to invest in further organic growth and to participate in the digital automotive M&A market. 
Moving on to CareerBuilder. We had another good quarter spurred by larger, longer contracts and new customer wins across all of its human capital solutions as well as its new acquisitions. CareerBuilder revenues were up 4% on a constant currency basis. At the center of this is CareerBuilder's pre-hire platform, which offers the most comprehensive and leading-edge combination of recruitment advertising, software and services on the market. There is nothing else like it, and it's making meaningful -- making a meaningful impact on businesses today. 
What's even more exciting is that CareerBuilder is now moving into post-hire solutions with the recent acquisition of Workterra, a leading innovator in the cloud-based benefits administration and talent management space. CareerBuilder is seeing strong organic growth in its software solutions, résumé database and managed services line. 
Software invoicing in North America was up double digits, and its Source and Screen business was up strong double digits year-over-year in the third quarter after transitioning into a platform-based offering and is forecasted to accelerate in the fourth quarter. 
As we have noted before, job postings continue to experience pricing pressure at the unit level, and we have reflected that in our thought process and projections. And we are off to an even stronger start to the fourth quarter at CareerBuilder. 
Now before I turn it over to Dave, let me remind you that due to the change in our fiscal year last year, in the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter this year will actually have 3 days less than last year's fourth quarter. Victoria will share with you the impact that we anticipate that, that will have. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Dave Lougee, who'll give you a deep dive on TEGNA Media. Dave?"
20571,404422828,1070057,"TEGNA Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gracia. As we've forecast, TEGNA Media will have a record year, and we had a record third quarter. We billed record Olympic revenue of $56 million. That's a 20% increase over the last summer games in 2012 and a 35% increase over the winter game",1327,"Thank you, Gracia. As we've forecast, TEGNA Media will have a record year, and we had a record third quarter. We billed record Olympic revenue of $56 million. That's a 20% increase over the last summer games in 2012 and a 35% increase over the winter games in 2014. We also -- TEGNA also claimed 4 of the top 5 highest-rated stations and 6 of the top 10 across the country. 
Now let's turn to the hot topic of political advertising. We billed $38 million in the third quarter, down from $55 million in 2012. There were 2 main factors for the decline, but they're both tied to one common cause: Donald Trump. Compared to 2012, there was a big reduction in overall presidential money raised. And as a result, a lot less money spent on presidential overall. The donors who'd backed Mitt Romney for all the well-publicized reasons weren't there for Mr. Trump. Neither his campaign nor his PACs were there. Additionally, Hillary Clinton and her PACs did not match President Obama's spending levels for either 2008 or 2012. And for us, TEGNA, Mr. Trump had another impact. What had been an unprecedented presidential footprint in 2012 got changed this year. For instance, he took both Colorado and Virginia out of play, 2 states where we have a big presence, 2 states that would have otherwise have been very -- seen very heavy spending like they had in the past. Hillary and her PACs went back up in Colorado and Virginia this week, but have otherwise sat out those markets from most -- almost all of the general election season. 
In third quarter, our billing for the Senate, House and governor's races were all up over 2012, but they couldn't make up for our delta on presidential. In 2012, presidential was 50% of our third quarter political spending. This year, it was 23%. And for the fourth quarter, now less than a week to go as we all know, we're now forecasting to finish with $88 million to $90 million in political dollars for the quarter, the same dynamics -- the same political dynamics in third quarter carried through the fourth, though the Trump factor also took the Colorado setting race out of play, which had been a big spent -- big spender for us in the past and assumed to be this year. And 2 other big market center races in our footprint also turned noncompetitive for the big national dollars, and that's Ohio and Florida, the Senate races. 
The one part of our footprint that doesn't vary really at all is the number of competitive U.S. House races we have. Since we're in the 1/3 of the country, we represent 1/3 of those house races, and it's notable that our fourth quarter billing for the House will exceed both 2012 and 2014, showing the continued unmatched importance of local broadcasters in reaching likely voters. 
Now let me also take a moment to address 2 other industry topics that have gotten some publicity lately. The first is the NFL, where there have been some year-to-year declines in national ratings. For us, there are some declines in prime-time ratings from last year. But notably, on a 2-year CAGR, our most important NFL franchise is flat. I'm talking about Sunday night football on our many NBC stations. So what are down some from last year's record numbers, they're still at near-historic levels, and that includes a Sunday night this year against one of the highly rated presidential debates. Our numbers also over-indexed against the National Sunday Night NFL ratings weekend, and weekend afternoon, NFL ratings have been less affected. And I should also point out, overall demand for NFL inventory remains up. 
The other topic I want to update you on is OTT distribution of our stations. While we're not going to comment on any individual distribution deal discussions, we can reiterate with confidence what we've said in the past, and that is that OTT distributors very much value the local national broadcast channels over all others because the consumers do. And given our scale, we have a key seat at the table in conversations with both the OTT distributors and the networks and amongst the OTT distributors, that includes both new entrants as well as traditional MVPDs. And while this new area is still sorting itself out, our value consumers firmly positions us for positive economics in this evolving space. 
Now let me update you on the work we've been doing this year to erase the onetime hit of new reverse compensation payments next year. As a reminder, we are currently paying reverse compensation payments on all of our network affiliates, except the group of NBC stations we owned before the purchase of Belo. Those stations begin paying reverse compensation to NBC on January 1 of this coming year. As we discussed at our Investor Day last year, we've been planning for some time to offset that onetime so-called retrans gap, and I'm pleased to report those initiatives are on track. First, we'll be addressing that gap on the retransmission top line. We have multiple deals up between now and the end of this year, allowing us to reset the subscriber rates on 42% of our subs. As indicated before, there's a continued gap between audience demand for our channels and the percentage of the overall retrans pie we receive. And as we've shown in past negotiations, we are able to get the strong rates our strong stations deserve. 
Separately, as we also reported on before, we have a number of core and adjacent initiatives well underway, and they are on track to slightly exceed the $30 million EBITDA contribution for this year that we had promised. And they are ramping nicely to provide the contribution we need for the full year to cover the gap next year. 
In terms of core revenue, we're seeing nice revenue share gains from several of the sales transformation initiatives I previously introduced. This quarter, we're seeing share gains resulting from our centralized pricing initiative. In addition, our focus on enterprise custom-client solutions versus transactional revenue has us on track to generate significant incremental revenue that will flow directly to our bottom line. The stations are utilizing our centralized ideation and customer solutions group in Dallas called Hatch. 
Our transformation initiatives are also seeing gains on the content side. We launched 3 new formats within the new genre, and all are showing strong signs of audience adoption. 2 out of the 3 are now the #1 shows in their time periods, and one in particular is seeing double-digit rating gains compared to the newscast in the same slot 1 year ago. 
Finally, we're very excited to talk about the new disruptive OTT ad service business that Gracia referenced and that we publicly announced this morning. It's called Premion, and it's our new branded, long-form OTT advertising business. It is now out of the gate, in the market, filling an unmet need in the local marketplace. Dollars are already flowing through the technology pipeline we've created. Premion connects more than 80 branded and well-known networks to TEGNA's 14,000 regional and local clients across all U.S. DMAs. That number 80 is this week's number and it's growing by the week. It includes OTT distributors and programmers like SlingTV, Sony, Crackle, Xumo and 2BTV [ph]. We are first mover in this space and seeing strong results from our initial launch markets. We're positioned nicely to capture value from the rapidly growing space of OTT on-demand viewing of long-form programming, and that's what this is focused on. We're leveraging our local sales forces and our local clients, and they're both working with a form of advertising they know the best, video. 
So in conclusion, we're finishing 2016 on a record note and are well positioned to deliver on our promises for 2017 and beyond. 
Let me turn it over to Alex Vetter from Cars.com."
20571,404422828,1070057,"TEGNA Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dave. We're pleased with more than 8% increase in our total revenue compared to the third quarter last year and are especially proud of the growth in our retail channels. Our retail revenues are up 11.5% year-over-year. Our largest revenue gain",1111,"Thank you, Dave. We're pleased with more than 8% increase in our total revenue compared to the third quarter last year and are especially proud of the growth in our retail channels. Our retail revenues are up 11.5% year-over-year. Our largest revenue gains were with auto manufacturers and major dealer change that generally have larger resources and tend to apply more sophisticated approach to measuring digital marketing effectiveness. They understand the influence of their marketing investments more broadly than just lead generation as well as the value of partnering with third-party sites like Cars.com to build their brands, direct traffic to their website and motivate consumers to visit their showrooms. As we have discussed, the local sales channel initiatives were slower to ramp in the first half of this year. And we're taking a leadership role in the industry by proving the value of automotive digital marketing beyond traditional lead metrics and demonstrating that consumer engagement with our dealers is happening in their showrooms. 
To help our customers look beyond traditional leads, we've been tracking the volume of shoppers using Cars.com from a mobile device on dealership lots as well as the behaviors of those shoppers for more than a year now. Using these findings, Cars.com launched Lot Insights, the ""first of its kind"" analytics that helps viewers better understand the activity behind the source of walk-in traffic. Our average dealers have nearly 20 people a month visiting their showrooms using Cars.com mobile platforms. And this only captures those users who allow us to track them with geolocation services turned on. Approximately half of all mobile users do not allow for us to track their geolocation, so our understanding of value, we believe, is conservative. As we embark to educate the industry about the evolution of leads and the decreasing importance of e-mails and phone calls in the shopping process, we expect our sales, rates and retention to improve once our values recognized more broadly within the industry. We're working to influence the industry to adopt new metrics that matter for today's consumers, namely the majority of those who have made the shift to mobile. 
On the whole, the industry is facing a that has been somewhat volatile in 2016. And although it's expected to contract slightly, this year and into '17, auto sales are expected to remain at all-time highs, and dealer profitability levels continue to be strong. We're confident in our advertising solutions promoting used vehicles and other critical areas of the dealership, including service, and these will be effective regardless of the climate. In times like these, we are extremely encouraged by the increased investment from auto manufacturers and Cars.com. These sophisticated marketers of U.S. is highly efficient marketing partner, critical to reaching shoppers with the intent to buy. 
While total wholesale revenues from our affiliate newspapers and broadcasters were essentially flat compared to the third quarter of 2015, we are encouraged by the increases in revenue from some of our partners. This increase is evidence that our individualized approach to working with these partners on their sales and marketing efforts is beginning to yield results. We are experiencing some challenge to our traffic numbers due in part to a comprehensive 2-year site modernization effort that negatively impacted our SEO results. However, I'm pleased to report that we have finished the replatforming initiative, which will now enable our teams to focus on optimizing our experience for a faster, more efficient technology, allowing us to speed our innovation without limitations from our past. 
Our efforts have resulted in a responsibly designed website that enabled us to take a leadership role in the mobile industry, providing consumers with a seamless experience across all devices, a first in the automotive third-party shopping category. To support our mobile-first strategy, we have made significant investments in our mobile platform that are also intended to boost traffic, showroom visits and leads, and these efforts are coming to fruition. As seen by the recent accolade from J.D. Power in its 2016 Automotive Mobile Website study, Cars.com was ranked highest in overall satisfaction amongst all third-party automotive sites. This is the second time Cars.com has earned the top spot, which examines the features and content of automotive manufacturing and third-party mobile websites and their usefulness in the vehicle shopping process. 
J.D. Power's ranking is evidence that our efforts and investments to move to responsive design platform has succeeded for consumers and ultimately advertisers. As I mentioned earlier, we can be faster in creating innovative consumer-focused features while quantifying the value of our service beyond traditional leads. Our success with consumers translates into improved results for advertisers. 
We've also taken a leadership position in app development, reaching more consumers on more devices, an important milestone that now more people are using their mobile devices to shop for cars and seek out service providers. Given that mobile users are more likely to be repeat visitors, we're seeing an uptick in traffic that matches our app investments. Our mobile app strategy is up over 8% year-over-year. As a way to improve the consumer experience, we have added consumer-focused features to our apps such as price drop alerts and on-the-lot VIN scanner, which allows shoppers to scan the VIN of any car in a dealer lot with their mobile device to get additional vehicle information. 
In addition, Urgency Indicators, which launched on the site in September, provide consumers with real-time data on the number of views, saves and contacts that have occurred on a given vehicle within the last 30 days. And another move designed to drive site traffic as well as walk-in traffic to dealership lots, we've increased our Q4 media spend to support our recently launched For Every Turn ad campaign. This increased spend will help raise awareness for consumers and help our advertisers garner more sales. 
Following the acquisition of DealerRater in August, we have moved swiftly through our integration plans and look forward to a national launch in early 2017. We're expecting to see improved performance across all our channels and now through the addition of our DealerRater product expansion, along with our mobile-first investments tied to changes in consumer shopping behavior. 
Finally, we're looking forward to becoming a pure-play online automotive company once we make the spin from TEGNA next year and become a stand-alone public entity. As an independent company, we will be able to focus more sharply on our key strategic priorities, which we expect to fuel continued growth. Our resources will be dedicated to opportunities specific to the evolving digital marketplace and further integration of our market-leading products and technology. 
Thank you. Now I turn it over to Victoria for further comments."

As Gracia has already mentioned, we're very pleased to report a solid quarter results, with double-digit growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA, driven by continued growth across the portfolio of businesses.",1129,"Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia has already mentioned, we're very pleased to report a solid quarter results, with double-digit growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA, driven by continued growth across the portfolio of businesses. 
Before I review our consolidated financial results as well as capital allocation during the quarter, I'd like to note that there were a few operating special item charges, including a small goodwill impairment and severance expenses, largely related to the finalization of an early retirement program within the Media Segment, which began earlier this year. Altogether, these totaled $18 million on a pretax basis, with an associated unfavorable EPS impact of $0.05 per share. Beyond these costs, nonoperating special items totaled $16 million, impacting EPS by about $0.05 per share as well, primarily driven by expenses related to our planned spin of Cars.com as well as costs related to several recent Digital Segment acquisitions. 
As a reminder, although I will be focusing on our non-GAAP performance results during the presentation today, you can find all of our reported data and prior period comparatives contained in our press release. Now let's briefly review the details of the operating results for the quarter. With solid performances by both Media and Digital segments, we achieved earnings per share of $0.65, an increase of 76% over last year. Total company revenues of $860 million were up 14% year-over-year, driven by revenue gains across all of our businesses. The sale of our PointRoll business last November had an unfavorable impact on year-over-year comparisons. During the quarter, total company operating expenses of $578 million were higher by a about 7% over last year, the majority of which was due to higher programming fees as well as expenses associated with solid revenue and our ongoing investments in growth initiatives within both the Media and Digital segments, again, partially offset by the absence of PointRoll expenses this quarter. 
As a result of the solid operational execution across the segments, TEGNA overall achieved strong adjusted EBITDA of $334 million this quarter, up 25% year-over-year, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 39%, up 340 basis points compared to last year. 
Now let's turn to more detailed review of the Media and Digital Segment results. Media Segment revenues of $502 million increased by almost 23.5% year-over-year, driven by a record $56 million in advertising related to Summer Olympics, substantially higher transmission revenues and higher political advertising spending as well as continued growth in Media and Digital revenue. Retransmission revenues boosted by agreements negotiated at the end of last year as well as annual rate increases within existing agreements continue to increase substantially, up fully [ph] 32% this quarter. Beyond this, Media Segment Digital advertising revenues continue to increase, up 12%, driven by Digital Marketing Services, which continued to gain traction across our television stations, driven by G/O Digital sales, extended-reach networks and national digital revenues. 
Now to focus on fourth quarter 2016 expectation for the Media Segment. Based on current trends and our expected range of political advertising revenue for the fourth quarter, we anticipate Media Segment revenue growth of 12% to 15% for the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter last year, driven by retransmission revenue growth of approximately 20% to 22%, slightly lower than this year's run rate due to lapping of agreements negotiated during the second half of last year and $88 million to $90 million of political advertising revenue. Please note, as we've mentioned during our previous calls and as Gracia already noted, we converted to a calendar year after the spin-off of our publishing assets in June of last year. As a result, the fourth quarter comparative results reflect 3 fewer days this year, which is about a $10 million impact to Media Segment revenues for the quarter. 
During the third quarter, Media Segment operating expenses of $279 million were up 13% year-over-year, primarily due to increased programming fees and investments in our strategic initiatives, including sales and content transformation projects. 
During the quarter, Digital Segment revenues of $359 million increased by 2% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis and adjusting for PointRoll, Digital Segment revenues were up by about 5% over last year, reflecting solid growth at Cars.com and higher revenue at CareerBuilder as well. 
During the quarter, Cars.com total revenues increased by 8%, reflecting increased market penetration in direct market, the recent DealerRater acquisition and strong national display advertising. Wholesale revenue was flat compared to last year, with mixed performance by affiliates. 
By contrast, Cars.com revenues sold through direct sales channels was up over 11%, reflecting the factors Alex mentioned earlier. CareerBuilder revenues were up 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. The growth was mainly due to higher resume database revenue, continued sales momentum of Software-as-a-Service solutions and recent acquisitions, partially offset by continued headwinds on our job posting business. 
For the Digital Segment, operating expenses of $284 million are up 2%, reflecting accelerating investments in growth initiatives and the acquisitions within both Cars.com and CareerBuilder, partially offset by the absence of expenses at PointRoll. 
In terms of capital expenditures, our CapEx during the quarter was $29 million, reflecting our ongoing commitment to reinvestment in business priorities and that includes digital development, media content, product integration and platform enhancements. These also include development of automated sales tools, workflow improvements and other critical product enhancements. Capital spending is very much in line with our full year projections. 
As we mentioned last month, ahead of announcing the Cars.com's spin-off, we temporarily suspended the share repurchase program, which we anticipate resuming following the conclusion of the spin. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt totaled [ph] $4.2 billion, reflecting the extinguishment of $193 million in 10% senior notes, which reached their maturity earlier this year, resulting in a net reduction of annual interest expense of about $14 million. 
Beyond this, just yesterday, we accelerated the redemption of the outstanding $70 million remaining of our 7.125% notes, which were due to mature in September of 2018. The early redemption result in a total net reduction of interest expense of approximately $5 million over the next 2 years. 
Also, during the quarter, we amended our revolving credit agreement to increase it by $103 million and borrowed $300 million under a new 4-year term loan due in 2020. The interest rate on the new term loan is the same interest rate as borrowings under the revolving credit agreement. We used the proceeds of the new term loan to repay a portion of the outstanding amount under our revolving credit facility. 
At the end of the quarter, cash on the balance sheet stood at $107 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was approximately $197 million. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for closing remarks."

But really, what we have modeled in and what we anticipated was that we would see a much steeper ramp in those revenues into the first quarter and beyond of 2017.

Now I'm going to provide some updates on the developments that we announced in September as well as some highlights on TEGNA's overall performance and each of our businesses during the quarter. Then I'm going to turn it over to our business heads: Dave Lougee's, President of TEGNA Media; and Alex Vetter, CEO of Cars.com, for a closer look at their respective businesses. And after that, Victoria will cover the financial highlights in a little bit more detail. 
Overall, we had a very productive quarter on multiple fronts, so let's just get right to it. As you know, in early September, we announced our plan to separate Cars.com from TEGNA, creating 2 strong industry-leading companies with the tools and resources they need to grow profitably in their targeted markets and to respond to the rapid changes taking place in the broadcast and digital sectors. Now as you may have seen, we filed our Form 10 on the day we announced the spin back in September. Last evening, we filed our first amendment to that Form 10. We remain on track to complete the spin-off in the first half of 2017. Alex and we are actively interviewing for key roles that will be integral to Cars.com as it begins trading as a publicly listed company. 
We are also making progress on the strategic review process for CareerBuilder, which is now underway. We've hired an investment banker, and we'll be reviewing a variety of alternatives. I have to say we are very pleased with the level of unsolicited interest we have received to date. 
Turning now to our performance during the quarter. As you saw, company-wide revenue increased 14%, driven by a strong performance at TEGNA Media and solid results within our Digital Segment. Our adjusted EBITDA was substantially higher, and our adjusted EBITDA margin improved compared to the third quarter last year. As well, non-GAAP EPS grew 76% year-over-year. 
TEGNA Media revenues rose substantially, as you saw, as our strong NBC footprint led to record Summer Olympic advertising revenue in the quarter. We continue to benefit from the strong boost trajectory in retransmission revenue we have seen over the past several years. And we also benefited from substantially higher political revenue, though not as much as we had hoped given our footprint and what the actual presidential footprint ended up being. 
As you're all aware, this year's presidential election has been atypical, to say the least. Now Dave's going to provide some additional color on the political spending landscape in his remarks. 
Turning to the rest of our growth drivers. We are focused on diversifying our revenue streams in the Media Segment, particularly in the digital space. We have launched an over-the-top video advertising business, Premion, and continue to effectively link digital content with digital sales. As we have previously discussed, there are several initiatives underway that center on enhancing core revenue, our digital marketing offerings and, of course, most importantly, our content, all of which we are confident will offset the anticipated gap in net retrans in 2017. And you'll get a little bit more detail on those initiatives a little bit later. 
Turning to TEGNA Digital. Revenues there also improved in the quarter, led by a strong direct revenue increase at Cars.com and another quarter of improving revenue growth at CareerBuilder. 
In August, we completed the acquisition of DealerRater, the leading car dealer review site. Already, we have made significant progress on our integration plans and are hitting the ground running in the fourth quarter. We expect DealerRater to contribute to Cars.com's revenue growth meaningfully as we move through 2017. As you are aware, digital offerings are the fastest-growing segment within the advertising ecosystem, and automotive continues to be one of the top categories. As industry trends continue to evolve and digital marketing budgets for dealer groups and auto manufacturers keep expanding, we expect to gain ground and capture a larger piece of the growing pie. We are taking steps to ensure that we are well positioned as we head into 2017 and beyond by implementing initiatives aimed at improving traffic and strengthening our leadership position in mobile. 
You'll hear more about specific growth initiatives underway at Cars.com shortly, but let me take a moment to reiterate some of the themes we covered at the time of the spin-off announcement. Cars.com is a strong, highly recognizable national brand with consumers and has a broad footprint in a highly attractive growing digital auto marketplace. It is the trusted source for millions of Americans in search of new and used cars as well as maintenance and repair services. Additionally, with an EBITDA margin in the high 30s, relatively low CapEx and strong reliable cash flows, it offers a unique mix of operational excellence and profitability, combined with growth dynamics rivaled by few others in the industry. We continue to be confident that Cars.com will thrive as an independent company and will benefit from even more flexibly to invest in further organic growth and to participate in the digital automotive M&A market. 
Moving on to CareerBuilder. We had another good quarter spurred by larger, longer contracts and new customer wins across all of its human capital solutions as well as its new acquisitions. CareerBuilder revenues were up 4% on a constant currency basis. At the center of this is CareerBuilder's pre-hire platform, which offers the most comprehensive and leading-edge combination of recruitment advertising, software and services on the market. There is nothing else like it, and it's making meaningful -- making a meaningful impact on businesses today. 
What's even more exciting is that CareerBuilder is now moving into post-hire solutions with the recent acquisition of Workterra, a leading innovator in the cloud-based benefits administration and talent management space. CareerBuilder is seeing strong organic growth in its software solutions, résumé database and managed services line. 
Software invoicing in North America was up double digits, and its Source and Screen business was up strong double digits year-over-year in the third quarter after transitioning into a platform-based offering and is forecasted to accelerate in the fourth quarter. 
As we have noted before, job postings continue to experience pricing pressure at the unit level, and we have reflected that in our thought process and projections. And we are off to an even stronger start to the fourth quarter at CareerBuilder. 
Now before I turn it over to Dave, let me remind you that due to the change in our fiscal year last year, in the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter this year will actually have 3 days less than last year's fourth quarter. Victoria will share with you the impact that we anticipate that, that will have. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Dave Lougee, who'll give you a deep dive on TEGNA Media. Dave?"
20571,404422828,1070306,"TEGNA Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gracia. As we've forecast, TEGNA Media will have a record year, and we had a record third quarter. We billed record Olympic revenue of $56 million. That's a 20% increase over the last summer games in 2012 and a 35% increase over the winter game",1326,"Thank you, Gracia. As we've forecast, TEGNA Media will have a record year, and we had a record third quarter. We billed record Olympic revenue of $56 million. That's a 20% increase over the last summer games in 2012 and a 35% increase over the winter games in 2014. We also -- TEGNA also claimed 4 of the top 5 highest-rated stations and 6 of the top 10 across the country. 
Now let's turn to the hot topic of political advertising. We billed $38 million in the third quarter, down from $55 million in 2012. There were 2 main factors for the decline, but they're both tied to one common cause: Donald Trump. Compared to 2012, there was a big reduction in overall presidential money raised. And as a result, a lot less money spent on presidential overall. The donors who'd backed Mitt Romney for all the well-publicized reasons weren't there for Mr. Trump. Neither his campaign nor his PACs were there. Additionally, Hillary Clinton and her PACs did not match President Obama's spending levels for either 2008 or 2012. And for us, TEGNA, Mr. Trump had another impact. What had been an unprecedented presidential footprint in 2012 got changed this year. For instance, he took both Colorado and Virginia out of play, 2 states where we have a big presence, 2 states that would have otherwise have been very -- seen very heavy spending like they had in the past. Hillary and her PACs went back up in Colorado and Virginia this week, but have otherwise sat out those markets from most -- almost all of the general election season. 
In third quarter, our billing for the Senate, House and governor's races were all up over 2012, but they couldn't make up for our delta on presidential. In 2012, presidential was 50% of our third quarter political spending. This year, it was 23%. And for the fourth quarter, now less than a week to go as we all know, we're now forecasting to finish with $88 million to $90 million in political dollars for the quarter, the same dynamics -- the same political dynamics in third quarter carried through the fourth, though the Trump factor also took the Colorado setting race out of play, which had been a big spent -- big spender for us in the past and assumed to be this year. And 2 other big market center races in our footprint also turned noncompetitive for the big national dollars, and that's Ohio and Florida, the Senate races. 
The one part of our footprint that doesn't vary really at all is the number of competitive U.S. House races we have. Since we're in the 1/3 of the country, we represent 1/3 of those house races, and it's notable that our fourth quarter billing for the House will exceed both 2012 and 2014, showing the continued unmatched importance of local broadcasters in reaching likely voters. 
Now let me also take a moment to address 2 other industry topics that have gotten some publicity lately. The first is the NFL, where there have been some year-to-year declines in national ratings. For us, there are some declines in prime-time ratings from last year. But notably, on a 2-year CAGR, our most important NFL franchise is flat. I'm talking about Sunday night football on our many NBC stations. So what are down some from last year's record numbers, they're still at near-historic levels, and that includes a Sunday night this year against one of the highly rated presidential debates. Our numbers also over-indexed against the National Sunday Night NFL ratings weekend, and weekend afternoon, NFL ratings have been less affected. And I should also point out, overall demand for NFL inventory remains up. 
The other topic I want to update you on is OTT distribution of our stations. While we're not going to comment on any individual distribution deal discussions, we can reiterate with confidence what we've said in the past, and that is that OTT distributors very much value the local national broadcast channels over all others because the consumers do. And given our scale, we have a key seat at the table in conversations with both the OTT distributors and the networks and amongst the OTT distributors, that includes both new entrants as well as traditional MVPDs. And while this new area is still sorting itself out, our value consumers firmly positions us for positive economics in this evolving space. 
Now let me update you on the work we've been doing this year to erase the onetime hit of new reverse compensation payments next year. As a reminder, we are currently paying reverse compensation payments on all of our network affiliates, except the group of NBC stations we owned before the purchase of Belo. Those stations begin paying reverse compensation to NBC on January 1 of this coming year. As we discussed at our Investor Day last year, we've been planning for some time to offset that onetime so-called retrans gap, and I'm pleased to report those initiatives are on track. First, we'll be addressing that gap on the retransmission top line. We have multiple deals up between now and the end of this year, allowing us to reset the subscriber rates on 42% of our subs. As indicated before, there's a continued gap between audience demand for our channels and the percentage of the overall retrans pie we receive. And as we've shown in past negotiations, we are able to get the strong rates our strong stations deserve. 
Separately, as we also reported on before, we have a number of core and adjacent initiatives well underway, and they are on track to slightly exceed the $30 million EBITDA contribution for this year that we had promised. And they are ramping nicely to provide the contribution we need for the full year to cover the gap next year. 
In terms of core revenue, we're seeing nice revenue share gains from several of the sales transformation initiatives I previously introduced. This quarter, we're seeing share gains resulting from our centralized pricing initiative. In addition, our focus on enterprise custom-client solutions versus transactional revenue has us on track to generate significant incremental revenue that will flow directly to our bottom line. The stations are utilizing our centralized ideation and customer solutions group in Dallas called Hatch. 
Our transformation initiatives are also seeing gains on the content side. We launched 3 new formats within the new genre, and all are showing strong signs of audience adoption. 2 out of the 3 are now the #1 shows in their time periods, and one in particular is seeing double-digit rating gains compared to the newscast in the same slot 1 year ago. 
Finally, we're very excited to talk about the new disruptive OTT ad service business that Gracia referenced and that we publicly announced this morning. It's called Premion, and it's our new branded, long-form OTT advertising business. It is now out of the gate, in the market, filling an unmet need in the local marketplace. Dollars are already flowing through the technology pipeline we've created. Premion connects more than 80 branded and well-known networks to TEGNA's 14,000 regional and local clients across all U.S. DMAs. That number 80 is this week's number and it's growing by the week. It includes OTT distributors and programmers like SlingTV, Sony, Crackle, Xumo and TubiTV. We are first mover in this space and seeing strong results from our initial launch markets. We're positioned nicely to capture value from the rapidly growing space of OTT on-demand viewing of long-form programming, and that's what this is focused on. We're leveraging our local sales forces and our local clients, and they're both working with a form of advertising they know the best, video. 
So in conclusion, we're finishing 2016 on a record note and are well positioned to deliver on our promises for 2017 and beyond. 
Let me turn it over to Alex Vetter from Cars.com."
20571,404422828,1070306,"TEGNA Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dave. We're pleased with more than 8% increase in our total revenue compared to the third quarter last year and are especially proud of the growth in our retail channels. Our retail revenues are up 11.5% year-over-year. Our largest revenue gain",1115,"Thank you, Dave. We're pleased with more than 8% increase in our total revenue compared to the third quarter last year and are especially proud of the growth in our retail channels. Our retail revenues are up 11.5% year-over-year. Our largest revenue gains were with auto manufacturers and major dealer change that generally have larger resources and tend to apply more sophisticated approach to measuring digital marketing effectiveness. They understand the influence of their marketing investments more broadly than just lead generation as well as the value of partnering with third-party sites like Cars.com to build their brands, direct traffic to their website and motivate consumers to visit their showrooms. As we have discussed, the local sales channel initiatives were slower to ramp in the first half of this year. And we're taking a leadership role in the industry by proving the value of automotive digital marketing beyond traditional lead metrics and demonstrating that consumer engagement with our dealers is happening in their showrooms. 
To help our customers look beyond traditional leads, we've been tracking the volume of shoppers using Cars.com from a mobile device on dealership lots as well as the behaviors of those shoppers for more than a year now. Using these findings, Cars.com launched Lot Insights, the ""first of its kind"" analytics that helps dealers better understand the activity behind the source of walk-in traffic. Our average dealers have nearly 20 people a month visiting their showrooms using Cars.com's mobile platforms. And this only captures those users who allow us to track them with geolocation services turned on. Approximately half of all mobile users do not allow for us to track their geolocation, so our understanding of value, we believe, is conservative. As we embark to educate the industry about the evolution of leads and the decreasing importance of e-mails and phone calls in the shopping process, we expect our sales, rates and retention to improve once our value's recognized more broadly within the industry. We're working to influence the industry to adopt new metrics that matter for today's consumers, namely the majority of those who have made the shift to mobile. 
On the whole, the industry is facing a [indiscernible] that has been somewhat volatile in 2016. And although it's expected to contract slightly, this year and into '17, auto sales are expected to remain at all-time highs, and dealer profitability levels continue to be strong. We're confident in our advertising solutions promoting used vehicles and other critical areas of the dealership, including service, and these will be effective regardless of the climate. In times like these, we are extremely encouraged by the increased investment from auto manufacturers and Cars.com. These sophisticated marketers of U.S. is highly efficient marketing partner, critical to reaching shoppers with the intent to buy. 
While total wholesale revenues from our affiliate newspapers and broadcasters were essentially flat compared to the third quarter of 2015, we are encouraged by the increases in revenue from some of our partners. This increase on that is evidence that our individualized approach to working with these partners on their sales and marketing efforts is beginning to yield results. We are experiencing some challenge to our traffic numbers due in part to a comprehensive 2-year site modernization effort that negatively impacted our SEO results. However, I'm pleased to report that we have finished the re-platforming initiative, which will now enable our teams to focus on optimizing our experience for a faster, more efficient technology, allowing us to speed our innovation without limitations from our past. 
Our efforts have resulted in a responsibly designed website that enabled us to take the leadership role in the mobile industry, but providing consumers with a seamless experience across all devices, a first in the automotive third-party shopping category. To support our mobile-first strategy, we have made significant investments on our mobile platform that are also intended to boost traffic, showroom visits and leads, and these efforts are coming to fruition. As seen by the recent accolade from J.D. Power in its 2016 Automotive Mobile Website study, Cars.com was ranked highest in overall satisfaction amongst all third-party automotive sites. This is the second time Cars.com has earned the top spot, which examines the features and content of automotive manufacturing and third-party mobile websites and their usefulness in the vehicle shopping process. 
J.D. Power's ranking is evidence that our efforts and investments to move to responsive design platform have succeeded for consumers and ultimately advertisers. As I mentioned earlier, we can be faster in creating innovative consumer-focused features while quantifying the value of our service beyond traditional leads. Our success with consumers translates into improved results for advertisers. 
We've also taken the leadership position in app development, reaching more consumers on more devices, an important milestone that now more people are using their mobile devices to shop for cars and seek out service providers. Given that mobile users are more likely to be repeat visitors, we're seeing an uptick in traffic that matches our app investments. Our mobile app strategy is up over 8% year-over-year. As a way to improve the consumer experience, we have added consumer-focused features to our apps such as price drop alerts and on-the-lot VIN scanner, which allows shoppers to scan the VIN of any car in a dealer lot with their mobile device to get additional vehicle information. 
In addition, urgency indicators, which launched on the site in September, provide consumers with real-time data on the number of views, saves and contacts that have occurred on a given vehicle within the last 30 days. And another move designed to drive site traffic as well as walk-in traffic to dealership lots, we've increased our Q4 media spend to support our recently launched For Every Turn ad campaign. This increased spend will help raise awareness for consumers and help our advertisers garner more sales. 
Following the acquisition of DealerRater in August, we have moved swiftly through our integration plans and look forward to a national launch in early 2017. We're expecting to see improved performance across all our channels and now through the addition of our DealerRater product expansion, along with our mobile-first investments tied to changes in consumer shopping behavior. 
Finally, we're looking forward to becoming a pure-play online automotive company once we make the spin from TEGNA next year and become a stand-alone public entity. As an independent company, we will be able to focus more sharply on our key strategic priorities, which we expect to fuel continued growth. Our resources will be dedicated to opportunities specific to the evolving digital marketplace and further innovation of our market-leading products and technology. 
Thank you. Now I turn it over to Victoria for further comments."
20571,404422828,1070306,"TEGNA Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia has already mentioned, we're very pleased to report a solid quarter results, with double-digit growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA, driven by continued growth across the portfolio of businesses.",1127,"Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia has already mentioned, we're very pleased to report a solid quarter results, with double-digit growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA, driven by continued growth across the portfolio of businesses. 
Before I review our consolidated financial results as well as capital allocation during the quarter, I'd like to note that there were a few operating special item charges, including a small goodwill impairment and severance expenses, largely related to the finalization of an early retirement program within the Media Segment, which began earlier this year. Altogether, these totaled $18 million on a pretax basis, with an associated unfavorable EPS impact of $0.05 per share. Beyond these costs, nonoperating special items totaled $16 million, impacting EPS by about $0.05 per share as well, primarily driven by expenses related to our planned spin of Cars.com as well as costs related to several recent Digital Segment acquisitions. 
As a reminder, although I will be focusing on our non-GAAP performance results during the presentation today, you can find all of our reported data and prior period comparatives contained in our press release. Now let's briefly review the details of the operating results for the quarter. With solid performances by both Media and Digital segments, we achieved earnings per share of $0.65, an increase of 76% over last year. Total company revenues of $860 million were up 14% year-over-year, driven by revenue gains across all of our businesses. The sale of our PointRoll business last November had an unfavorable impact on year-over-year comparisons. During the quarter, total company operating expenses of $578 million were higher by about 7% over last year, the majority of which was due to higher programming fees as well as expenses associated with solid revenue and our ongoing investments in growth initiatives within both the Media and Digital segments, again, partially offset by the absence of PointRoll expenses this quarter. 
As a result of the solid operational execution across the segments, TEGNA overall achieved strong adjusted EBITDA of $334 million this quarter, up 25% year-over-year, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 39%, up 340 basis points compared to last year. 
Now let's turn to a more detailed review of the Media and Digital Segment results. Media Segment revenues of $502 million increased by almost 23.5% year-over-year, driven by a record $56 million in advertising related to Summer Olympics, substantially higher transmission revenues and higher political advertising spending as well as continued growth in Media and Digital revenue. Retransmission revenues boosted by agreements negotiated at the end of last year as well as annual rate increases within existing agreements continue to increase substantially, up fully 32% this quarter. Beyond this, Media Segment Digital advertising revenues continue to increase, up 12%, driven by Digital Marketing Services, which continued to gain traction across our television stations, driven by G/O Digital sales, extended-reach networks and national digital revenues. 
Now to focus on fourth quarter 2016 expectation for the Media Segment. Based on current trends and our expected range of political advertising revenue for the fourth quarter, we anticipate Media Segment revenue growth of 12% to 15% for the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year, driven by retransmission revenue growth of approximately 20% to 22%, slightly lower than this year's run rate due to lapping of agreements negotiated during the second half of last year and $88 million to $90 million of political advertising revenue. Please note, as we've mentioned during our previous calls and as Gracia already noted, we converted to a calendar year after the spin-off of our publishing assets in June of last year. As a result, the fourth quarter comparative results reflect 3 fewer days this year, which is about a $10 million impact to Media Segment revenues for the quarter. 
During the third quarter, Media Segment operating expenses of $279 million were up 13% year-over-year, primarily due to increased programming fees and investments in our strategic initiatives, including sales and content transformation projects. 
During the quarter, Digital Segment revenues of $359 million increased by 2% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis and adjusting for PointRoll, Digital Segment revenues were up by about 5% over last year, reflecting solid growth at Cars.com and higher revenue at CareerBuilder as well. 
During the quarter, Cars.com total revenues increased by 8%, reflecting increased market penetration in direct market, the recent DealerRater acquisition and strong national display advertising. Wholesale revenue was flat compared to last year, with mixed performance by affiliates. 
By contrast, Cars.com revenues sold through direct sales channels was up over 11%, reflecting the factors Alex mentioned earlier. CareerBuilder revenues were up 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. The growth was mainly due to higher résumé database revenue, continued sales momentum of Software-as-a-Service solutions and recent acquisitions, partially offset by continued headwinds on our job-posting business. 
For the Digital Segment, operating expenses of $284 million are up 2%, reflecting accelerating investments in growth initiatives and the acquisitions within both Cars.com and CareerBuilder, partially offset by the absence of expenses at PointRoll. 
In terms of capital expenditures, our CapEx during the quarter was $29 million, reflecting our ongoing commitment to reinvestment in business priorities and that includes digital development, media content, product integration and platform enhancements. These also include development of automated sales tools, workflow improvements and other critical product enhancements. Capital spending is very much in line with our full year projections. 
As we mentioned last month, ahead of announcing the Cars.com's spin-off, we temporarily suspended the share repurchase program, which we anticipate resuming following the conclusion of the spin. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt totaled $4.2 billion, reflecting the extinguishment of $193 million in 10% senior notes, which reached their maturity earlier this year, resulting in a net reduction of annual interest expense of about $14 million. 
Beyond this, just yesterday, we accelerated the redemption of the outstanding $70 million remaining of our 7.125% notes, which were due to mature in September of 2018. The early redemption result in a total net reduction of interest expense of approximately $5 million over the next 2 years. 
Also, during the quarter, we amended our revolving credit agreement to increase it by $103 million and borrowed $300 million under a new 4-year term loan due in 2020. The interest rate on the new term loan is the same interest rate as borrowings under the revolving credit agreement. We used the proceeds of the new term loan to repay a portion of the outstanding amount under our revolving credit facility. 
At the end of the quarter, cash on the balance sheet stood at $107 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was approximately $197 million. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for closing remarks."

We continue to bring our normal discipline that we've always brought to expenses, finding new ways, new technologies and new skill sets, et cetera, to continue to be thoughtful around our cost structure, at the same time, making sure that we spend enough to move ahead of the initiatives, while we also obviously face the reverse retrans hurdle that Dave outlined for January 1.

Now I'm going to provide some updates on the developments that we announced in September as well as some highlights on TEGNA's overall performance and each of our businesses during the quarter. Then I'm going to turn it over to our business heads: Dave Lougee's, President of TEGNA Media; and Alex Vetter, CEO of Cars.com, for a closer look at their respective businesses. And after that, Victoria will cover the financial highlights in a little bit more detail. 
Overall, we had a very productive quarter on multiple fronts, so let's just get right to it. As you know, in early September, we announced our plan to separate Cars.com from TEGNA, creating 2 strong industry-leading companies with the tools and resources they need to grow profitably in their targeted markets and to respond to the rapid changes taking place in the broadcast and digital sectors. Now as you may have seen, we filed our Form 10 on the day we announced the spin back in September. Last evening, we filed our first amendment to that Form 10. We remain on track to complete the spin-off in the first half of 2017. Alex and we are actively interviewing for key roles that will be integral to Cars.com as it begins trading as a publicly listed company. 
We are also making progress on the strategic review process for CareerBuilder, which is now underway. We've hired an investment banker, and we'll be reviewing a variety of alternatives. I have to say we are very pleased with the level of unsolicited interest we have received to date. 
Turning now to our performance during the quarter. As you saw, company-wide revenue increased 14%, driven by a strong performance at TEGNA Media and solid results within our Digital Segment. Our adjusted EBITDA was substantially higher, and our adjusted EBITDA margin improved compared to the third quarter last year. As well, non-GAAP EPS grew 76% year-over-year. 
TEGNA Media revenues rose substantially, as you saw, as our strong NBC footprint led to record Summer Olympic advertising revenue in the quarter. We continue to benefit from the strong boost trajectory in retransmission revenue we have seen over the past several years. And we also benefited from substantially higher political revenue, though not as much as we had hoped given our footprint and what the actual presidential footprint ended up being. 
As you're all aware, this year's presidential election has been atypical, to say the least. Now Dave's going to provide some additional color on the political spending landscape in his remarks. 
Turning to the rest of our growth drivers. We are focused on diversifying our revenue streams in the Media Segment, particularly in the digital space. We have launched an over-the-top video advertising business, Premion, and continue to effectively link digital content with digital sales. As we have previously discussed, there are several initiatives underway that center on enhancing core revenue, our digital marketing offerings and, of course, most importantly, our content, all of which we are confident will offset the anticipated gap in net retrans in 2017. And you'll get a little bit more detail on those initiatives a little bit later. 
Turning to TEGNA Digital. Revenues there also improved in the quarter, led by a strong direct revenue increase at Cars.com and another quarter of improving revenue growth at CareerBuilder. 
In August, we completed the acquisition of DealerRater, the leading car dealer review site. Already, we have made significant progress on our integration plans and are hitting the ground running in the fourth quarter. We expect DealerRater to contribute to Cars.com's revenue growth meaningfully as we move through 2017. As you are aware, digital offerings are the fastest-growing segment within the advertising ecosystem, and automotive continues to be one of the top categories. As industry trends continue to evolve and digital marketing budgets for dealer groups and auto manufacturers keep expanding, we expect to gain ground and capture a larger piece of the growing pie. We are taking steps to ensure that we are well positioned as we head into 2017 and beyond by implementing initiatives aimed at improving traffic and strengthening our leadership position in mobile. 
You'll hear more about specific growth initiatives underway at Cars.com shortly, but let me take a moment to reiterate some of the themes we covered at the time of the spin-off announcement. Cars.com is a strong, highly recognizable national brand with consumers and has a broad footprint in a highly attractive growing digital auto marketplace. It is the trusted source for millions of Americans in search of new and used cars as well as maintenance and repair services. Additionally, with an EBITDA margin in the high 30s, relatively low CapEx and strong reliable cash flows, it offers a unique mix of operational excellence and profitability, combined with growth dynamics rivaled by few others in the industry. We continue to be confident that Cars.com will thrive as an independent company and will benefit from even more flexibly to invest in further organic growth and to participate in the digital automotive M&A market. 
Moving on to CareerBuilder. We had another good quarter spurred by larger, longer contracts and new customer wins across all of its human capital solutions as well as its new acquisitions. CareerBuilder revenues were up 4% on a constant currency basis. At the center of this is CareerBuilder's pre-hire platform, which offers the most comprehensive and leading-edge combination of recruitment advertising, software and services on the market. There is nothing else like it, and it's making meaningful -- making a meaningful impact on businesses today. 
What's even more exciting is that CareerBuilder is now moving into post-hire solutions with the recent acquisition of Workterra, a leading innovator in the cloud-based benefits administration and talent management space. CareerBuilder is seeing strong organic growth in its software solutions, résumé database and managed services line. 
Software invoicing in North America was up double digits, and its Source and Screen business was up strong double digits year-over-year in the third quarter after transitioning into a platform-based offering and is forecasted to accelerate in the fourth quarter. 
As we have noted before, job postings continue to experience pricing pressure at the unit level, and we have reflected that in our thought process and projections. And we are off to an even stronger start to the fourth quarter at CareerBuilder. 
Now before I turn it over to Dave, let me remind you that due to the change in our fiscal year last year, in the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter this year will actually have 3 days less than last year's fourth quarter. Victoria will share with you the impact that we anticipate that, that will have. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Dave Lougee, who'll give you a deep dive on TEGNA Media. Dave?"
20571,404422828,1070606,"TEGNA Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gracia. As we've forecast, TEGNA Media will have a record year, and we had a record third quarter. We billed record Olympic revenue of $56 million. That's a 20% increase over the last summer games in 2012 and a 35% increase over the winter game",1328,"Thank you, Gracia. As we've forecast, TEGNA Media will have a record year, and we had a record third quarter. We billed record Olympic revenue of $56 million. That's a 20% increase over the last summer games in 2012 and a 35% increase over the winter games in 2014. We also -- TEGNA also claimed 4 of the top 5 highest-rated stations and 6 of the top 10 across the country. 
Now let's turn to the hot topic of political advertising. We billed $38 million in the third quarter, down from $55 million in 2012. There were 2 main factors for the decline, but they're both tied to one common cause: Donald Trump. Compared to 2012, there was a big reduction in overall presidential money raised. And as a result, a lot less money spent on presidential overall. The donors who'd backed Mitt Romney for all the well-publicized reasons weren't there for Mr. Trump. Neither his campaign nor his PACs were there. Additionally, Hillary Clinton and her PACs did not match President Obama's spending levels for either 2008 or 2012. And for us, TEGNA, Mr. Trump had another impact. What had been an unprecedented presidential footprint in 2012 got changed this year. For instance, he took both Colorado and Virginia out of play, 2 states where we have a big presence, 2 states that would have otherwise have been very -- seen very heavy spending like they had in the past. Hillary and her PACs went back up in Colorado and Virginia this week, but have otherwise sat out those markets for most -- almost all of the general election season. 
In third quarter, our billing for the Senate, House and governor's races were all up over 2012, but they couldn't make up for our delta on presidential. In 2012, presidential was 50% of our third quarter political spending. This year, it was 23%. And for the fourth quarter, now with less than a week to go as we all know, we're now forecasting to finish with $88 million to $90 million in political dollars for the quarter, the same dynamics -- the same political dynamics in third quarter carried through the fourth, though the Trump factor also took the Colorado Senate race out of play, which had been a big spent -- big spender for us in the past and assumed to be this year. And 2 other big market Senate races in our footprint also turned noncompetitive for the big national dollars, and that's Ohio and Florida, the Senate races. 
The one part of our footprint that doesn't vary really at all is the number of competitive U.S. House races we have. Since we're in the 1/3 of the country, we represent 1/3 of those House races, and it's notable that our fourth quarter billing for the House will exceed both 2012 and 2014, showing the continued unmatched importance of local broadcasters in reaching likely voters. 
Now let me also take a moment to address 2 other industry topics that have gotten some publicity lately. The first is the NFL, where there have been some year-to-year declines in national ratings. For us, there are some declines in prime-time ratings from last year. But notably, on a 2-year CAGR, our most important NFL franchise is flat. I'm talking about Sunday night football on our many NBC stations. So while they're down some from last year's record numbers, they're still at near-historic levels, and that includes a Sunday night this year against one of the highly rated presidential debates. Our numbers also over-indexed against the National Sunday Night NFL ratings weekend, and weekend afternoon NFL ratings have been less affected. And I should also point out, overall demand for our NFL inventory remains up. 
The other topic I want to update you on is OTT distribution of our stations. While we're not going to comment on any individual distribution deal discussions, we can reiterate with confidence what we've said in the past, and that is that OTT distributors very much value the local national broadcast channels over all others because the consumers do. And given our scale, we have a key seat at the table in conversations with both the OTT distributors and the networks and amongst the OTT distributors that includes both new entrants as well as traditional MVPDs. And while this new area is still sorting itself out, our valued consumers firmly positions us for positive economics in this evolving space. 
Now let me update you on the work we've been doing this year to erase the onetime hit of new reverse compensation payments next year. As a reminder, we are currently paying reverse compensation payments on all of our network affiliates, except the group of NBC stations we owned before the purchase of Belo. Those stations begin paying reverse compensation to NBC on January 1 of this coming year. As we discussed at our Investor Day last year, we've been planning for some time to offset that onetime so-called retrans gap, and I'm pleased to report those initiatives are on track. First, we'll be addressing that gap on the retransmission top line. We have multiple deals up between now and the end of this year, allowing us to reset the subscriber rates on 42% of our subs. As indicated before, there's a continued gap between audience demand for our channels and the percentage of the overall retrans pie we receive. And as we've shown in past negotiations, we are able to get the strong rates our strong stations deserve. 
Separately, as we also reported on before, we have a number of core and adjacent initiatives well underway, and they are on track to slightly exceed the $30 million EBITDA contribution for this year that we had promised. And they are ramping nicely to provide the contribution we need for the full year to cover the gap next year. 
In terms of core revenue, we're seeing nice revenue share gains from several of the sales transformation initiatives I previously introduced. This quarter, we're seeing share gains resulting from our centralized pricing initiative. In addition, our focus on enterprise custom-client solutions versus transactional revenue has us on track to generate significant incremental revenue that will flow directly to our bottom line. The stations are utilizing our centralized ideation and customer solutions group in Dallas called Hatch. 
Our transformation initiatives are also seeing gains on the content side. We've launched 3 new formats within the new genre, and all are showing strong signs of audience adoption. 2 out of the 3 are now the #1 shows in their time periods, and one in particular is seeing double-digit rating gains compared to the newscast in the same slot 1 year ago. 
Finally, we're very excited to talk about the new disruptive OTT ad service business that Gracia referenced and that we publicly announced this morning. It's called Premion, and it's our new branded, long-form OTT advertising business. It is now out of the gate, in the market, filling an unmet need in the local marketplace. Dollars are already flowing through the technology pipeline we've created. Premion connects more than 80 branded and well-known networks to TEGNA's 14,000 regional and local clients across all U.S. DMAs. That number 80 is this week's number and it's growing by the week. It includes OTT distributors and programmers like SlingTV, Sony, Crackle, Xumo and TubiTV. We are first mover in this space and seeing strong results from our initial launch markets. We're positioned nicely to capture value from the rapidly growing space of OTT on-demand viewing of long-form programming, and that's what this is focused on. We're leveraging our local sales forces and our local clients, and they're both working with a form of advertising they know the best, video. 
So in conclusion, we're finishing 2016 on a record note and are well positioned to deliver on our promises for 2017 and beyond. 
Let me turn it over to Alex Vetter from Cars.com."
20571,404422828,1070606,"TEGNA Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dave. We're pleased with more than 8% increase in our total revenue compared to the third quarter last year and are especially proud of the growth in our retail channels. Our retail revenues are up 11.5% year-over-year. Our largest revenue gain",1111,"Thank you, Dave. We're pleased with more than 8% increase in our total revenue compared to the third quarter last year and are especially proud of the growth in our retail channels. Our retail revenues are up 11.5% year-over-year. Our largest revenue gains were with auto manufacturers and major dealer chains that generally have larger resources and tend to apply more sophisticated approach to measuring digital marketing effectiveness. They understand the influence of their marketing investments more broadly than just lead generation as well as the value of partnering with third-party sites like Cars.com to build their brands, direct traffic to their website and motivate consumers to visit their showrooms. As we have discussed, the local sales channel initiatives were slower to ramp in the first half of this year. And we're taking a leadership role in the industry by proving the value of automotive digital marketing beyond traditional lead metrics and demonstrating that consumer engagement with our dealers is happening in their showrooms. 
To help our customers look beyond traditional leads, we've been tracking the volume of shoppers using Cars.com from a mobile device on dealership lots as well as the behaviors of those shoppers for more than a year now. Using these findings, Cars.com launched Lot Insights, the first-of-kind analytics that helps dealers better understand the activity behind the source of walk-in traffic. Our average dealers have nearly 20 people a month visiting their showrooms using Cars.com's mobile platforms. And this only captures those users who allow us to track them with geolocation services turned on. Approximately half of all mobile users do not allow for us to track their geolocation, so our understanding of value, we believe, is conservative. As we embark to educate the industry about the evolution of leads and the decreasing importance of e-mails and phone calls in the shopping process, we expect our sales, rates and retention to improve once our value's recognized more broadly within the industry. We're working to influence the industry to adopt new metrics that matter for today's consumers, namely the majority of those who have made the shift to mobile. 
On the whole, the industry is facing a SAAR that has been somewhat volatile in 2016. And although it's expected to contract slightly, this year and into '17, auto sales are expected to remain at all-time highs, and dealer profitability levels continue to be strong. We're confident in our advertising solutions promoting used vehicles and other critical areas of the dealership, including service, and these will be effective regardless of the climate. In times like these, we are extremely encouraged by the increased investment from auto manufacturers in Cars.com. These sophisticated marketers of U.S. is highly efficient marketing partner, critical to reaching shoppers with the intent to buy. 
While total wholesale revenues from our affiliate newspapers and broadcasters were essentially flat compared to the third quarter of 2015, we are encouraged by the increases in revenue from some of our partners. This increased momentum is evidence that our individualized approach to working with these partners on their sales and marketing efforts is beginning to yield results. We are experiencing some challenge to our traffic numbers due in part to a comprehensive 2-year site modernization effort that negatively impacted our SEO results. However, I'm pleased to report that we have finished the re-platforming initiative, which will now enable our teams to focus on optimizing our experience for a faster, more efficient technology, allowing us to speed our innovation without limitations from our past. 
Our efforts have resulted in a responsibly designed website that enabled us to take the leadership role in the mobile industry by providing consumers with a seamless experience across all devices, a first in the automotive third-party shopping category. To support our mobile-first strategy, we have made significant investments on our mobile platform that are also intended to boost traffic, showroom visits and leads and these efforts are coming to fruition. As seen by the recent accolade from J.D. Power in its 2016 Automotive Mobile Website study, Cars.com was ranked highest in overall satisfaction amongst all third-party automotive sites. This is the second time Cars.com has earned the top spot, which examines the features and content of automotive manufacturing and third-party mobile websites and their usefulness in the vehicle shopping process. 
J.D. Power's ranking is evidence that our efforts and investments to move to responsive design platform have succeeded for consumers and ultimately advertisers. As I mentioned earlier, we can be faster in creating innovative consumer-focused features while quantifying the value of our service beyond traditional leads. Our success with consumers translates into improved results for advertisers. 
We've also taken the leadership position in app development, reaching more consumers on more devices, an important milestone that now more people are using their mobile devices to shop for cars and seek out service providers. Given that mobile users are more likely to be repeat visitors, we're seeing an uptick in traffic that matches our app investments. Our mobile app strategy is up over 8% year-over-year. As a way to improve the consumer experience, we have added consumer-focused features to our apps such as price drop alerts and on-the-lot VIN scanner, which allows shoppers to scan the VIN of any car in a dealer lot with their mobile device to get additional vehicle information. 
In addition, urgency indicators, which launched on the site in September, provide consumers with real-time data on the number of views, saves and contacts that have occurred on a given vehicle within the last 30 days. In another move designed to drive site traffic as well as walk-in traffic to dealership lots, we've increased our Q4 media spend to support our recently launched For Every Turn ad campaign. This increased spend will help raise awareness for consumers and help our advertisers garner more sales. 
Following the acquisition of DealerRater in August, we have moved swiftly through our integration plans and look forward to a national launch in early 2017. We're expecting to see improved performance across all our channels and now through the addition of our DealerRater product expansion, along with our mobile-first investments tied to changes in consumer shopping behavior. 
Finally, we're looking forward to becoming a pure-play online automotive company once we make the spin from TEGNA next year and become a stand-alone public entity. As an independent company, we will be able to focus more sharply on our key strategic priorities, which we expect to fuel continued growth. Our resources will be dedicated to opportunities specific to the evolving digital marketplace and further innovation of our market-leading products and technology. 
Thank you. Now I turn it over to Victoria for further comments."

As Gracia has already mentioned, we're very pleased to report a solid quarter results, with double-digit growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA, driven by continued growth across the portfolio of businesses.",1128,"Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia has already mentioned, we're very pleased to report a solid quarter results, with double-digit growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA, driven by continued growth across the portfolio of businesses. 
Before I review our consolidated financial results as well as capital allocation during the quarter, I'd like to note that there were a few operating special item charges, including a small goodwill impairment and severance expenses, largely related to the finalization of an early retirement program within the Media Segment, which began earlier this year. Altogether, these totaled $18 million on a pretax basis, with an associated unfavorable EPS impact of $0.05 per share. Beyond these costs, nonoperating special items totaled $16 million, impacting EPS by about $0.05 per share as well, primarily driven by expenses related to our planned spin of Cars.com as well as costs related to several recent Digital Segment acquisitions. 
As a reminder, although I will be focusing on our non-GAAP performance results during the presentation today, you can find all of our reported data and prior period comparatives contained in our press release. Now let's briefly review the details of the operating results for the quarter. With solid performances by both Media and Digital segments, we achieved earnings per share of $0.65, an increase of 76% over last year. Total company revenues of $860 million were up 14% year-over-year, driven by revenue gains across all of our businesses. The sale of our PointRoll business last November had an unfavorable impact on year-over-year comparisons. During the quarter, total company operating expenses of $578 million were higher by about 7% over last year, the majority of which was due to higher programming fees as well as expenses associated with solid revenue and our ongoing investments in growth initiatives within both the Media and Digital segments, again, partially offset by the absence of PointRoll expenses this quarter. 
As a result of the solid operational execution across the segments, TEGNA overall achieved strong adjusted EBITDA of $334 million this quarter, up 25% year-over-year, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 39%, up 340 basis points compared to last year. 
Now let's turn to a more detailed review of the Media and Digital Segment results. Media Segment revenues of $502 million increased by almost 23.5% year-over-year, driven by a record $56 million in advertising related to Summer Olympics, substantially higher transmission revenues and higher political advertising spending as well as continued growth in Media and Digital revenue. Retransmission revenues boosted by agreements negotiated at the end of last year as well as annual rate increases within existing agreements continue to increase substantially, up fully 32% this quarter. Beyond this, Media Segment Digital advertising revenues continue to increase, up 12%, driven by Digital Marketing Services, which continued to gain traction across our television stations, driven by G/O Digital sales, extended-reach networks and national digital revenues. 
Now to focus on fourth quarter 2016 expectation for the Media Segment. Based on current trends and our expected range of political advertising revenue for the fourth quarter, we anticipate Media Segment revenue growth of 12% to 15% for the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year, driven by retransmission revenue growth of approximately 20% to 22%, slightly lower than this year's run rate due to lapping of agreements negotiated during the second half of last year and $88 million to $90 million of political advertising revenue. Please note, as we've mentioned during our previous calls and as Gracia already noted, we converted to a calendar year after the spin-off of our publishing assets in June of last year. As a result, the fourth quarter comparative results reflect 3 fewer days this year, which is about a $10 million impact to Media Segment revenues for the quarter. 
During the third quarter, Media Segment operating expenses of $279 million were up 13% year-over-year, primarily due to increased programming fees and investments in our strategic initiatives, including sales and content transformation projects. 
During the quarter, Digital Segment revenues of $359 million increased by 2% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis and adjusting for PointRoll, Digital Segment revenues were up by about 5% over last year, reflecting solid growth at Cars.com and higher revenue at CareerBuilder as well. 
During the quarter, Cars.com total revenues increased by 8%, reflecting increased market penetration in direct market, the recent DealerRater acquisition and strong national display advertising. Wholesale revenue was flat compared to last year, with mixed performance by affiliates. 
By contrast, Cars.com revenues sold through direct sales channels was up over 11%, reflecting the factors Alex mentioned earlier. CareerBuilder revenues were up 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. The growth was mainly due to higher résumé database revenue, continued sales momentum of Software-as-a-Service solutions and recent acquisitions, partially offset by continued headwinds on our job-posting business. 
For the Digital Segment, operating expenses of $284 million were up 2%, reflecting accelerating investments in growth initiatives and the acquisitions within both Cars.com and CareerBuilder, partially offset by the absence of expenses at PointRoll. 
In terms of capital expenditures, our CapEx during the quarter was $29 million, reflecting our ongoing commitment to reinvestment in business priorities and that includes digital development, media content, product integration and platform enhancements. These also include development of automated sales tools, workflow improvements and other critical product enhancements. Capital spending is very much in line with our full year projections. 
As we mentioned last month, ahead of announcing the Cars.com's spin-off, we temporarily suspended the share repurchase program, which we anticipate resuming following the conclusion of the spin. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt stood at $4.2 billion, reflecting the extinguishment of $193 million in 10% senior notes, which reached their maturity earlier this year, resulting in a net reduction of annual interest expense of about $14 million. 
Beyond this, just yesterday, we accelerated the redemption of the outstanding $70 million remaining of our 7.125% notes, which were due to mature in September of 2018. The early redemption results in a total net reduction of interest expense of approximately $5 million over the next 2 years. 
Also, during the quarter, we amended our revolving credit agreement to increase it by $103 million and borrowed $300 million under a new 4-year term loan due in 2020. The interest rate on the new term loan is the same interest rate as borrowings under the revolving credit agreement. We used the proceeds of the new term loan to repay a portion of the outstanding amount under our revolving credit facility. 
At the end of the quarter, cash on the balance sheet stood at $107 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was approximately $197 million. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for closing remarks."

We continue to bring our normal discipline that we've always brought to expenses, finding new ways through new technologies and new skill sets, et cetera, to continue to be thoughtful around our cost structure, at the same time, making sure that we spend enough to move ahead of the initiatives, while we also obviously face the reverse retrans hurdle that Dave outlined for January 1. And that's why, I think, it's a combination of those 2 things that gives us great confidence, as Dave said, that we're going to be able to offset -- more than offset that net retrans gap next year.

Our experience has been it takes time for them to embrace new technology and understand the changes in consumer behavior. In almost every media category, consumer behavior moves first and advertising dollars tend to lag consumer behavior. When we look at the shift of our mobile business and the change in consumer behavior, we know it's going to take us some time to get the dealers to understand the evolution of the shopping journey. But we've been at it now for a year. I think we're getting very strong acceptance from the industry that mobile is changing the game. You see that in our manufacturer and major dealer account spending, both up in high double-digit growth rates year-over-year because they're faster to adjust their media attribution models. But we're going to continue to stay at it at the local level and we expect '17 to be a strong year."

Now I'm going to provide some updates on the developments that we announced in September as well as some highlights on TEGNA's overall performance and each of our businesses during the quarter. Then I'm going to turn it over to our business heads: Dave Lougee's, President of TEGNA Media; and Alex Vetter, CEO of Cars.com, for a closer look at their respective businesses. And after that, Victoria will cover the financial highlights in a little bit more detail. 
Overall, we had a very productive quarter on multiple fronts, so let's just get right to it. As you know, in early September, we announced our plan to separate Cars.com from TEGNA, creating 2 strong industry-leading companies with the tools and resources they need to grow profitably in their targeted markets and to respond to the rapid changes taking place in the broadcast and digital sectors. Now as you may have seen, we filed our Form 10 on the day we announced the spin back in September. Last evening, we filed our first amendment to that Form 10. We remain on track to complete the spin-off in the first half of 2017. Alex and we are actively interviewing for key roles that will be integral to Cars.com as it begins trading as a publicly listed company. 
We are also making progress on the strategic review process for CareerBuilder, which is now underway. We've hired an investment banker, and we'll be reviewing a variety of alternatives. I have to say we are very pleased with the level of unsolicited interest we have received to date. 
Turning now to our performance during the quarter. As you saw, company-wide revenue increased 14%, driven by a strong performance at TEGNA Media and solid results within our Digital Segment. Our adjusted EBITDA was substantially higher, and our adjusted EBITDA margin improved compared to the third quarter last year. As well, non-GAAP EPS grew 76% year-over-year. 
TEGNA Media revenues rose substantially, as you saw, as our strong NBC footprint led to record Summer Olympic advertising revenue in the quarter. We continue to benefit from the strong boost trajectory in retransmission revenue we have seen over the past several years. And we also benefited from substantially higher political revenue, though not as much as we had hoped given our footprint and what the actual presidential footprint ended up being. 
As you're all aware, this year's presidential election has been atypical, to say the least. Now Dave's going to provide some additional color on the political spending landscape in his remarks. 
Turning to the rest of our growth drivers. We are focused on diversifying our revenue streams in the Media Segment, particularly in the digital space. We have launched an over-the-top video advertising business, Premion, and continue to effectively link digital content with digital sales. As we have previously discussed, there are several initiatives underway that center on enhancing core revenue, our digital marketing offerings and, of course, most importantly, our content, all of which we are confident will offset the anticipated gap in net retrans in 2017. And you'll get a little bit more detail on those initiatives a little bit later. 
Turning to TEGNA Digital. Revenues there also improved in the quarter, led by a strong direct revenue increase at Cars.com and another quarter of improving revenue growth at CareerBuilder. 
In August, we completed the acquisition of DealerRater, the leading car dealer review site. Already, we have made significant progress on our integration plans and are hitting the ground running in the fourth quarter. We expect DealerRater to contribute to Cars.com's revenue growth meaningfully as we move through 2017. As you are aware, digital offerings are the fastest-growing segment within the advertising ecosystem, and automotive continues to be one of the top categories. As industry trends continue to evolve and digital marketing budgets for dealer groups and auto manufacturers keep expanding, we expect to gain ground and capture a larger piece of the growing pie. We are taking steps to ensure that we are well positioned as we head into 2017 and beyond by implementing initiatives aimed at improving traffic and strengthening our leadership position in mobile. 
You'll hear more about specific growth initiatives underway at Cars.com shortly, but let me take a moment to reiterate some of the themes we covered at the time of the spin-off announcement. Cars.com is a strong, highly recognizable national brand with consumers and has a broad footprint in a highly attractive growing digital auto marketplace. It is the trusted source for millions of Americans in search of new and used cars as well as maintenance and repair services. Additionally, with an EBITDA margin in the high 30s, relatively low CapEx and strong reliable cash flows, it offers a unique mix of operational excellence and profitability, combined with growth dynamics rivaled by few others in the industry. We continue to be confident that Cars.com will thrive as an independent company and will benefit from even more flexibly to invest in further organic growth and to participate in the digital automotive M&A market. 
Moving on to CareerBuilder. We had another good quarter spurred by larger, longer contracts and new customer wins across all of its human capital solutions as well as its new acquisitions. CareerBuilder revenues were up 4% on a constant currency basis. At the center of this is CareerBuilder's pre-hire platform, which offers the most comprehensive and leading-edge combination of recruitment advertising, software and services on the market. There is nothing else like it, and it's making meaningful -- making a meaningful impact on businesses today. 
What's even more exciting is that CareerBuilder is now moving into post-hire solutions with the recent acquisition of Workterra, a leading innovator in the cloud-based benefits administration and talent management space. CareerBuilder is seeing strong organic growth in its software solutions, résumé database and managed services line. 
Software invoicing in North America was up double digits, and its Source and Screen business was up strong double digits year-over-year in the third quarter after transitioning into a platform-based offering and is forecasted to accelerate in the fourth quarter. 
As we have noted before, job postings continue to experience pricing pressure at the unit level, and we have reflected that in our thought process and projections. And we are off to an even stronger start to the fourth quarter at CareerBuilder. 
Now before I turn it over to Dave, let me remind you that due to the change in our fiscal year last year, in the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter this year will actually have 3 days less than last year's fourth quarter. Victoria will share with you the impact that we anticipate that, that will have. 
Now I'd like to turn it over to Dave Lougee, who'll give you a deep dive on TEGNA Media. Dave?"
20571,404422828,1072598,"TEGNA Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gracia. As we've forecast, TEGNA Media will have a record year, and we had a record third quarter. We billed record Olympic revenue of $56 million. That's a 20% increase over the last summer games in 2012 and a 35% increase over the winter game",1328,"Thank you, Gracia. As we've forecast, TEGNA Media will have a record year, and we had a record third quarter. We billed record Olympic revenue of $56 million. That's a 20% increase over the last summer games in 2012 and a 35% increase over the winter games in 2014. We also -- TEGNA also claimed 4 of the top 5 highest-rated stations and 6 of the top 10 across the country. 
Now let's turn to the hot topic of political advertising. We billed $38 million in the third quarter, down from $55 million in 2012. There were 2 main factors for the decline, but they're both tied to one common cause: Donald Trump. Compared to 2012, there was a big reduction in overall presidential money raised. And as a result, a lot less money spent on presidential overall. The donors who'd backed Mitt Romney for all the well-publicized reasons weren't there for Mr. Trump. Neither his campaign nor his PACs were there. Additionally, Hillary Clinton and her PACs did not match President Obama's spending levels for either 2008 or 2012. And for us, TEGNA, Mr. Trump had another impact. What had been an unprecedented presidential footprint in 2012 got changed this year. For instance, he took both Colorado and Virginia out of play, 2 states where we have a big presence, 2 states that would have otherwise have been very -- seen very heavy spending like they had in the past. Hillary and her PACs went back up in Colorado and Virginia this week, but have otherwise sat out those markets for most -- almost all of the general election season. 
In third quarter, our billing for the Senate, House and governor's races were all up over 2012, but they couldn't make up for our delta on presidential. In 2012, presidential was 50% of our third quarter political spending. This year, it was 23%. And for the fourth quarter, now with less than a week to go as we all know, we're now forecasting to finish with $88 million to $90 million in political dollars for the quarter, the same dynamics -- the same political dynamics in third quarter carried through the fourth, though the Trump factor also took the Colorado Senate race out of play, which had been a big spent -- big spender for us in the past and assumed to be this year. And 2 other big market Senate races in our footprint also turned noncompetitive for the big national dollars, and that's Ohio and Florida, the Senate races. 
The one part of our footprint that doesn't vary really at all is the number of competitive U.S. House races we have. Since we're in the 1/3 of the country, we represent 1/3 of those House races, and it's notable that our fourth quarter billing for the House will exceed both 2012 and 2014, showing the continued unmatched importance of local broadcasters in reaching likely voters. 
Now let me also take a moment to address 2 other industry topics that have gotten some publicity lately. The first is the NFL, where there have been some year-to-year declines in national ratings. For us, there are some declines in prime-time ratings from last year. But notably, on a 2-year CAGR, our most important NFL franchise is flat. I'm talking about Sunday night football on our many NBC stations. So while they're down some from last year's record numbers, they're still at near-historic levels, and that includes a Sunday night this year against one of the highly rated presidential debates. Our numbers also over-indexed against the National Sunday Night NFL ratings weekend, and weekend afternoon NFL ratings have been less affected. And I should also point out, overall demand for our NFL inventory remains up. 
The other topic I want to update you on is OTT distribution of our stations. While we're not going to comment on any individual distribution deal discussions, we can reiterate with confidence what we've said in the past, and that is that OTT distributors very much value the local national broadcast channels over all others because the consumers do. And given our scale, we have a key seat at the table in conversations with both the OTT distributors and the networks and amongst the OTT distributors that includes both new entrants as well as traditional MVPDs. And while this new area is still sorting itself out, our valued consumers firmly positions us for positive economics in this evolving space. 
Now let me update you on the work we've been doing this year to erase the onetime hit of new reverse compensation payments next year. As a reminder, we are currently paying reverse compensation payments on all of our network affiliates, except the group of NBC stations we owned before the purchase of Belo. Those stations begin paying reverse compensation to NBC on January 1 of this coming year. As we discussed at our Investor Day last year, we've been planning for some time to offset that onetime so-called retrans gap, and I'm pleased to report those initiatives are on track. First, we'll be addressing that gap on the retransmission top line. We have multiple deals up between now and the end of this year, allowing us to reset the subscriber rates on 42% of our subs. As indicated before, there's a continued gap between audience demand for our channels and the percentage of the overall retrans pie we receive. And as we've shown in past negotiations, we are able to get the strong rates our strong stations deserve. 
Separately, as we also reported on before, we have a number of core and adjacent initiatives well underway, and they are on track to slightly exceed the $30 million EBITDA contribution for this year that we had promised. And they are ramping nicely to provide the contribution we need for the full year to cover the gap next year. 
In terms of core revenue, we're seeing nice revenue share gains from several of the sales transformation initiatives I previously introduced. This quarter, we're seeing share gains resulting from our centralized pricing initiative. In addition, our focus on enterprise custom-client solutions versus transactional revenue has us on track to generate significant incremental revenue that will flow directly to our bottom line. The stations are utilizing our centralized ideation and customer solutions group in Dallas called Hatch. 
Our transformation initiatives are also seeing gains on the content side. We've launched 3 new formats within the new genre, and all are showing strong signs of audience adoption. 2 out of the 3 are now the #1 shows in their time periods, and one in particular is seeing double-digit rating gains compared to the newscast in the same slot 1 year ago. 
Finally, we're very excited to talk about the new disruptive OTT ad service business that Gracia referenced and that we publicly announced this morning. It's called Premion, and it's our new branded, long-form OTT advertising business. It is now out of the gate, in the market, filling an unmet need in the local marketplace. Dollars are already flowing through the technology pipeline we've created. Premion connects more than 80 branded and well-known networks to TEGNA's 14,000 regional and local clients across all U.S. DMAs. That number 80 is this week's number and it's growing by the week. It includes OTT distributors and programmers like SlingTV, Sony, Crackle, Xumo and TubiTV. We are first mover in this space and seeing strong results from our initial launch markets. We're positioned nicely to capture value from the rapidly growing space of OTT on-demand viewing of long-form programming, and that's what this is focused on. We're leveraging our local sales forces and our local clients, and they're both working with a form of advertising they know the best, video. 
So in conclusion, we're finishing 2016 on a record note and are well positioned to deliver on our promises for 2017 and beyond. 
Let me turn it over to Alex Vetter from Cars.com."
20571,404422828,1072598,"TEGNA Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","TEGNA Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dave. We're pleased with more than 8% increase in our total revenue compared to the third quarter last year and are especially proud of the growth in our retail channels. Our retail revenues are up 11.5% year-over-year. Our largest revenue gain",1111,"Thank you, Dave. We're pleased with more than 8% increase in our total revenue compared to the third quarter last year and are especially proud of the growth in our retail channels. Our retail revenues are up 11.5% year-over-year. Our largest revenue gains were with auto manufacturers and major dealer chains that generally have larger resources and tend to apply more sophisticated approach to measuring digital marketing effectiveness. They understand the influence of their marketing investments more broadly than just lead generation as well as the value of partnering with third-party sites like Cars.com to build their brands, direct traffic to their website and motivate consumers to visit their showrooms. As we have discussed, the local sales channel initiatives were slower to ramp in the first half of this year. And we're taking a leadership role in the industry by proving the value of automotive digital marketing beyond traditional lead metrics and demonstrating that consumer engagement with our dealers is happening in their showrooms. 
To help our customers look beyond traditional leads, we've been tracking the volume of shoppers using Cars.com from a mobile device on dealership lots as well as the behaviors of those shoppers for more than a year now. Using these findings, Cars.com launched Lot Insights, the first-of-kind analytics that helps dealers better understand the activity behind the source of walk-in traffic. Our average dealers have nearly 20 people a month visiting their showrooms using Cars.com's mobile platforms. And this only captures those users who allow us to track them with geolocation services turned on. Approximately half of all mobile users do not allow for us to track their geolocation, so our understanding of value, we believe, is conservative. As we embark to educate the industry about the evolution of leads and the decreasing importance of e-mails and phone calls in the shopping process, we expect our sales, rates and retention to improve once our value's recognized more broadly within the industry. We're working to influence the industry to adopt new metrics that matter for today's consumers, namely the majority of those who have made the shift to mobile. 
On the whole, the industry is facing a SAAR that has been somewhat volatile in 2016. And although it's expected to contract slightly, this year and into '17, auto sales are expected to remain at all-time highs, and dealer profitability levels continue to be strong. We're confident in our advertising solutions promoting used vehicles and other critical areas of the dealership, including service, and these will be effective regardless of the climate. In times like these, we are extremely encouraged by the increased investment from auto manufacturers in Cars.com. These sophisticated marketers of U.S. is highly efficient marketing partner, critical to reaching shoppers with the intent to buy. 
While total wholesale revenues from our affiliate newspapers and broadcasters were essentially flat compared to the third quarter of 2015, we are encouraged by the increases in revenue from some of our partners. This increased momentum is evidence that our individualized approach to working with these partners on their sales and marketing efforts is beginning to yield results. We are experiencing some challenge to our traffic numbers due in part to a comprehensive 2-year site modernization effort that negatively impacted our SEO results. However, I'm pleased to report that we have finished the re-platforming initiative, which will now enable our teams to focus on optimizing our experience for a faster, more efficient technology, allowing us to speed our innovation without limitations from our past. 
Our efforts have resulted in a responsibly designed website that enabled us to take the leadership role in the mobile industry by providing consumers with a seamless experience across all devices, a first in the automotive third-party shopping category. To support our mobile-first strategy, we have made significant investments on our mobile platform that are also intended to boost traffic, showroom visits and leads and these efforts are coming to fruition. As seen by the recent accolade from J.D. Power in its 2016 Automotive Mobile Website study, Cars.com was ranked highest in overall satisfaction amongst all third-party automotive sites. This is the second time Cars.com has earned the top spot, which examines the features and content of automotive manufacturing and third-party mobile websites and their usefulness in the vehicle shopping process. 
J.D. Power's ranking is evidence that our efforts and investments to move to responsive design platform have succeeded for consumers and ultimately advertisers. As I mentioned earlier, we can be faster in creating innovative consumer-focused features while quantifying the value of our service beyond traditional leads. Our success with consumers translates into improved results for advertisers. 
We've also taken the leadership position in app development, reaching more consumers on more devices, an important milestone that now more people are using their mobile devices to shop for cars and seek out service providers. Given that mobile users are more likely to be repeat visitors, we're seeing an uptick in traffic that matches our app investments. Our mobile app strategy is up over 8% year-over-year. As a way to improve the consumer experience, we have added consumer-focused features to our apps such as price drop alerts and on-the-lot VIN scanner, which allows shoppers to scan the VIN of any car in a dealer lot with their mobile device to get additional vehicle information. 
In addition, urgency indicators, which launched on the site in September, provide consumers with real-time data on the number of views, saves and contacts that have occurred on a given vehicle within the last 30 days. In another move designed to drive site traffic as well as walk-in traffic to dealership lots, we've increased our Q4 media spend to support our recently launched For Every Turn ad campaign. This increased spend will help raise awareness for consumers and help our advertisers garner more sales. 
Following the acquisition of DealerRater in August, we have moved swiftly through our integration plans and look forward to a national launch in early 2017. We're expecting to see improved performance across all our channels and now through the addition of our DealerRater product expansion, along with our mobile-first investments tied to changes in consumer shopping behavior. 
Finally, we're looking forward to becoming a pure-play online automotive company once we make the spin from TEGNA next year and become a stand-alone public entity. As an independent company, we will be able to focus more sharply on our key strategic priorities, which we expect to fuel continued growth. Our resources will be dedicated to opportunities specific to the evolving digital marketplace and further innovation of our market-leading products and technology. 
Thank you. Now I turn it over to Victoria for further comments."

As Gracia has already mentioned, we're very pleased to report a solid quarter results, with double-digit growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA, driven by continued growth across the portfolio of businesses.",1128,"Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. As Gracia has already mentioned, we're very pleased to report a solid quarter results, with double-digit growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA, driven by continued growth across the portfolio of businesses. 
Before I review our consolidated financial results as well as capital allocation during the quarter, I'd like to note that there were a few operating special item charges, including a small goodwill impairment and severance expenses, largely related to the finalization of an early retirement program within the Media Segment, which began earlier this year. Altogether, these totaled $18 million on a pretax basis, with an associated unfavorable EPS impact of $0.05 per share. Beyond these costs, nonoperating special items totaled $16 million, impacting EPS by about $0.05 per share as well, primarily driven by expenses related to our planned spin of Cars.com as well as costs related to several recent Digital Segment acquisitions. 
As a reminder, although I will be focusing on our non-GAAP performance results during the presentation today, you can find all of our reported data and prior period comparatives contained in our press release. Now let's briefly review the details of the operating results for the quarter. With solid performances by both Media and Digital segments, we achieved earnings per share of $0.65, an increase of 76% over last year. Total company revenues of $860 million were up 14% year-over-year, driven by revenue gains across all of our businesses. The sale of our PointRoll business last November had an unfavorable impact on year-over-year comparisons. During the quarter, total company operating expenses of $578 million were higher by about 7% over last year, the majority of which was due to higher programming fees as well as expenses associated with solid revenue and our ongoing investments in growth initiatives within both the Media and Digital segments, again, partially offset by the absence of PointRoll expenses this quarter. 
As a result of the solid operational execution across the segments, TEGNA overall achieved strong adjusted EBITDA of $334 million this quarter, up 25% year-over-year, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 39%, up 340 basis points compared to last year. 
Now let's turn to a more detailed review of the Media and Digital Segment results. Media Segment revenues of $502 million increased by almost 23.5% year-over-year, driven by a record $56 million in advertising related to Summer Olympics, substantially higher transmission revenues and higher political advertising spending as well as continued growth in Media and Digital revenue. Retransmission revenues boosted by agreements negotiated at the end of last year as well as annual rate increases within existing agreements continue to increase substantially, up fully 32% this quarter. Beyond this, Media Segment Digital advertising revenues continue to increase, up 12%, driven by Digital Marketing Services, which continued to gain traction across our television stations, driven by G/O Digital sales, extended-reach networks and national digital revenues. 
Now to focus on fourth quarter 2016 expectation for the Media Segment. Based on current trends and our expected range of political advertising revenue for the fourth quarter, we anticipate Media Segment revenue growth of 12% to 15% for the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year, driven by retransmission revenue growth of approximately 20% to 22%, slightly lower than this year's run rate due to lapping of agreements negotiated during the second half of last year and $88 million to $90 million of political advertising revenue. Please note, as we've mentioned during our previous calls and as Gracia already noted, we converted to a calendar year after the spin-off of our publishing assets in June of last year. As a result, the fourth quarter comparative results reflect 3 fewer days this year, which is about a $10 million impact to Media Segment revenues for the quarter. 
During the third quarter, Media Segment operating expenses of $279 million were up 13% year-over-year, primarily due to increased programming fees and investments in our strategic initiatives, including sales and content transformation projects. 
During the quarter, Digital Segment revenues of $359 million increased by 2% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis and adjusting for PointRoll, Digital Segment revenues were up by about 5% over last year, reflecting solid growth at Cars.com and higher revenue at CareerBuilder as well. 
During the quarter, Cars.com total revenues increased by 8%, reflecting increased market penetration in direct market, the recent DealerRater acquisition and strong national display advertising. Wholesale revenue was flat compared to last year, with mixed performance by affiliates. 
By contrast, Cars.com revenues sold through direct sales channels was up over 11%, reflecting the factors Alex mentioned earlier. CareerBuilder revenues were up 4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. The growth was mainly due to higher résumé database revenue, continued sales momentum of Software-as-a-Service solutions and recent acquisitions, partially offset by continued headwinds on our job-posting business. 
For the Digital Segment, operating expenses of $284 million were up 2%, reflecting accelerating investments in growth initiatives and the acquisitions within both Cars.com and CareerBuilder, partially offset by the absence of expenses at PointRoll. 
In terms of capital expenditures, our CapEx during the quarter was $29 million, reflecting our ongoing commitment to reinvestment in business priorities and that includes digital development, media content, product integration and platform enhancements. These also include development of automated sales tools, workflow improvements and other critical product enhancements. Capital spending is very much in line with our full year projections. 
As we mentioned last month, ahead of announcing the Cars.com's spin-off, we temporarily suspended the share repurchase program, which we anticipate resuming following the conclusion of the spin. At the end of the quarter, our long-term debt stood at $4.2 billion, reflecting the extinguishment of $193 million in 10% senior notes, which reached their maturity earlier this year, resulting in a net reduction of annual interest expense of about $14 million. 
Beyond this, just yesterday, we accelerated the redemption of the outstanding $70 million remaining of our 7.125% notes, which were due to mature in September of 2018. The early redemption results in a total net reduction of interest expense of approximately $5 million over the next 2 years. 
Also, during the quarter, we amended our revolving credit agreement to increase it by $103 million and borrowed $300 million under a new 4-year term loan due in 2020. The interest rate on the new term loan is the same interest rate as borrowings under the revolving credit agreement. We used the proceeds of the new term loan to repay a portion of the outstanding amount under our revolving credit facility. 
At the end of the quarter, cash on the balance sheet stood at $107 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was approximately $197 million. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Gracia for closing remarks."

Some of the acquisitions that CareerBuilder has done most recently, particularly with Workterra, and that -- those numbers actually don't even include Workterra. That and some other things that they've done have moved them even more towards Software-as-a-Service. So we expect that, that evolution is going to pick up. And it will be a much more significant part of the pie in the next couple of years. As to timing, as with everything, we are proceeding as we always do very diligently. And as quickly as is prudent, making sure that we look at everything. At the end of the day, we would never rule out any alternative. We're here to create the maximum shareholder value, so we will be looking at a variety of things. But it is interesting, as I said in my remarks, that there has been an amazing amount of inbound interest with respect to the asset. And I think that's just a reflection of the great job that Matt and his team have done in really transitioning and transforming that business. And it's been a little painful for us over these last several quarters, but the really fantastic job they have been doing in transforming and transitioning that business away from the jobs board aspect of it, obviously, that continues to be a piece of the pie. But away from just being a pure-play jobs board to a really full pre-hire and now with the acquisition of Workterra, a post-hire platform.
