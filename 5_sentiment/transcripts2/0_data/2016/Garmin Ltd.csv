As announced earlier today, Garmin reported fourth quarter revenue of $781 million, representing a 3% decline year-over-year. While our revenue trends are impacted by the ongoing secular decline of the PND market, I'm pleased to report that the Aviation, Fitness, Marine and Outdoor segments as a group grew 11% year-over-year and contributed 66% of total revenues. This growth and diversification of our revenue base is a direct result of the investments we have made in our business over the past few years. Gross margin was 52.9%, ahead of our expectations, but down slightly year-over-year driven primarily by the competitive dynamics in our Fitness segment. 
Operating margin declined to 18.7% as we continue to invest in engineering and advertising. These factors offset by a lower than anticipated effective tax rate resulted in pro forma EPS of $0.74 in the quarter. 
Looking briefly at our full year performance. We reported revenue of $2.8 billion, a 2% decline year-over-year driven mainly by global sales that created significant revenue and margin headwinds. Despite these headwinds, the Aviation, Fitness, Marine and Outdoor segments grew 9% on a combined basis, contributing nearly $1.8 billion in revenue for the year or 63% of the total and generating 75% of our operating income. Gross and operating margins of 54.6% and 19.5%, respectively, were down compared to 2014 but exceeded our expectations in a difficult global economy. Unit deliveries increased 7% for the year to $16.2 million. 
Doug will discuss financial results in greater detail in a few minutes. But first, I'll provide a few comments on each business segments. Beginning with the Fitness segment. Revenue for the year grew 16%, driven by growth in activity trackers. Gross and operating margins were 55% and 20%, respectively. Gross margins was impacted by the competitive dynamics in the market, while operating margin was further impacted by ongoing investments in advertising and engineering. We believe these investments are strategically important in order to maximize the long-term opportunity in the Fitness market. In 2015, we introduced Garmin Elevate heart rate technology into our running and activity tracker product lines, and we made significant enhancements to Garmin Connect Mobile. These developments have strengthened our position in the market and positively impacted our results for the year. In 2016, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 10% in the Fitness segment. New product introductions play a key role in our growth assumptions. 
Looking at Outdoor. Revenue declined 1% year-over-year as economic and geopolitical issues impacted sales of our core product categories. This weakness was partially offset by strength in the outdoor wearable category. The Outdoor segment continued to generate strong growth in operating margins of 61% and 33%, respectively. This represents a slight decline compared to 2014 due to product mix and additional investments in engineering and advertising to support new product launches. In 2016, we expect revenue growth of approximately 10%, which includes anticipated contributions from PulsedLight and the pending acquisition of DeLorme. We anticipate that the wearable category will continue to be strong in 2016, driven by the new fenix 3 HR with wrist heart rate. In addition, we expect to benefit from new product introductions across other categories. 
Turning next to Aviation. We reported year-over-year revenue growth of 3%, which exceeded our expectations in the midst of an industry decline of 5% as reported by the General Aviation Manufacturers Association. Growth in operating margin remained strong at 74% and 28%, respectively. In the fourth quarter, the G3000-equipped HondaJet became the latest aircraft to receive FDA certification, bringing the total to 64 aircraft platform certified with a Garmin-integrated content. In 2016, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 5% in the Aviation segment. While industry dynamics remain a factor, market share gains and new platforms provide opportunities for growth. 
Looking next to the Marine segment. We reported year-over-year revenue growth of 15%, driven by strong sales of new products. Gross margin improved to 55%, while operating margin was down slightly to 10% due to litigation-related costs. However, operating income grew 9% for the year due to stronger revenue and gross margin. For 2016, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 10% in the Marine segment, driven by new product introductions. We believe our product lineup is very strong as we enter the marine season, and we look forward to another year of growth in 2016. 
Looking finally at the Auto segment. Revenues were down 15% for the full year as expected due to the ongoing decline of PND market. Gross and operating margins were 44% and 13%, respectively, and our global market share remains very strong. During the year, our presence at Honda expanded and now includes their Pilot, Accord, Civic and CR-V models. Additionally, our present in Mercedes recently expanded and now includes their C and E-Class models. Looking at 2016, we expect revenue to decline approximately 15%, driven primarily by ongoing declines in the PND market. We remain focused on disciplined execution in order to bring desired innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in the segment. 
Now I want to highlight one other matter regarding action cameras. As of 2016, we have reclassified our action camera product line from the Outdoor segment into the Auto segment. We believe this change will enhance the alignment of our engineering, marketing and sales resources. Going forward, segment results will be adjusted to reflect this change. 
So in summary, we see many opportunities ahead in 2016. However, the macroeconomic challenges we faced in 2015 remain part of the operating environment. With this in mind, we are projecting revenue of approximately $2.82 billion, which is flat year-over-year and steady gross margin of approximately 54.5%. We are projecting operating income of approximately $510 million with operating margins of approximately 18%. Factoring in an effective tax rate of approximately 20.5%, pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.25, which includes a $0.05 negative impact related to acquisition. 
So that concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details of our financial results. Doug?"
598655,321490926,934526,"Garmin Ltd., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2016",2016-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. Let's begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes.

Let's begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $781 million for the fourth quarter, representing a 3% decrease year-over-year. Gross margin was 52.9%, a 70 basis point decrease in the prior year, driven by the increased competitive pricing in the Fitness segment. Operating income was $146 million. Operating margin was 18.7%, a decrease of 320 basis points from the prior year. This as a result of both a decline in gross margin rate and operating expense growth of 5% or $12 million, driven by litigation-related costs, increased spending in advertising and research and development. The pro forma effective tax rate of 13% pro forma EPS was $0.74. 
Looking at full year results. We posted revenue of $2.82 billion for the year, representing a 2% decrease year-over-year. Gross margin was 54.6%, a 130 basis point decrease in the prior year. Operating income was $550 million compared to $691 million in 2014. Operating margin was 19.5%, a decrease of 460 basis points in the prior year, driven by both gross margin declines and increased operating expenses. Pro forma effective tax rate increased to approximately 20% for full year 2015 compared to approximately 17% in 2014. Pro forma EPS was $2.49, a 20% decrease year-over-year. We'll discuss gross margin, operating expenses, effective tax rate in more detail later. 
Next we look at the fourth quarter and full year revenue by segment. During the fourth quarter, we experienced growth in 4 of our 5 segments led by Fitness with 14% growth and Aviation with 12% growth. Collectively, these 4 segments were up 11% compared to the prior year quarter. For the full year 2015, we experienced growth in 3 of our 5 segments led by Fitness with 16% growth and Marine with 15% growth. 
We have fourth quarter revenue charts on this page. The Auto segment represent a 35% of our total fourth quarter 2015 revenue compared to 42% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Fitness grew to 29% of revenue in the current period compared to 25% in the prior year. As you can see from the charts, illustrated are our profitability mix by segment: Outdoor, Fitness, Marine and Aviation collectively delivered 75% of operating income in the fourth quarter 2015 compared to 68% in the fourth quarter 2014. 
Drilling down on year-over-year gross margin by segment. Both Aviation and Marine posted gross margin rate increases due to product mix. Fitness gross margin rate was lower due to competitive pricing dynamics and product mix. 
Looking at full year metrics. For the full year, the non-auto segments made up 62% total revenue compared to 57% in 2014. A similar shift occurred in operating income with 75% of our 2015 operating income collectively coming from Outdoor, Fitness, Marine and Aviation segments compared to 69% in 2014. 
Looking next at operating expenses. As previously mentioned, fourth quarter operating expenses increased by $12 million to 5%. This is a 250 basis point increase as a percent of sales. Research and development increased $4 million year-over-year or 90 basis points to 13.6% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation and increasing resources focused primarily on Aviation, Fitness, Outdoor and Marine where we see long-term growth opportunities. Our advertising expense increased $3 million from the prior year quarter and represented 7.3% of sales, a 50 basis point increase. Additional spending was primarily in the Fitness segment and near-term focus on market share growth in wearables. 
SG&A was up $5 million compared to prior quarter, increasing 100 basis points as a percent of sales to 13.4%. Increased spending in SG&A was driven primarily by litigation-related costs and IT expenses. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of about $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially due to the holiday quarter and was down year-over-year to $531 million. Our inventory balance increased year-over-year to $501 million as we grew our product offerings and continued to maintain an adequate supply of raw materials and safety stock. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we generated free cash flow of $131 million. Also, in the quarter, we paid dividends of $97 million and repurchased $23 million of company stock with $160 million remaining for purchase through December 2016. With our dividend, stock repurchase activity throughout 2015, we returned $590 [ph] million of cash to our shareholders. 
So as a previously mentioned, our effective tax rate decreased to 13% in the current quarter compared to a pro forma tax rate of 19% in the fourth quarter 2014. The lower tax rate was primarily a result of income mix by tax jurisdiction, which was positively impacted by the increase in actionable full year taxable income compared to previous projections and the resulting catch-up benefit for the first 3 quarters of 2015. Consistent with prior year, the fourth quarter tax rate includes a full year impact of the R&D tax credit. Our full year pro forma effective tax rate increased from 17% in 2014 to 20% in 2015, primarily due to income mix by tax jurisdiction. We expect our full year tax rate in 2016 to be approximately 20.5%. 
We announced this morning we plan to seek shareholder approval for a dividend of $2.04 per share payable in 4 installments of $0.51 per share per quarter beginning in the June 2016 calendar quarter. As Cliff mentioned, beginning in 2016, we will recast action camera sales and expenses from our Outdoor segment to our Auto segment. As such, we provide a supplemental schedule to help assist in updating your models. The schedule can be found within the Appendix in today's webcast. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Andrew, could you please open the line for Q&A."

And I think by segment, we were actually pleased with many of the results that we had in 2015 and the gains that we had in terms of market share and unit deliveries. In terms of the Americas, it was down, and I think the biggest impact there was the activity tracker and fitness markets, which were primarily driven out of the Americas in terms of its overall development during the year. And then in APAC, we've had strong success in terms of some of our segments there, particularly Outdoor, and also Auto sales, Auto OEM sales in the various markets in APAC and the Middle East. So in terms of our outlook to 2016, I think we would anticipate some improvement in the America side of things, especially as we see growth in some of our traditional markets. I think in Europe, we're continuing to plan for growth in terms of unit deliveries and overall improvements in margins and stabilization in currencies. In APAC, we continue to see an outlook for growth in terms of what's happening there as well. On the Automotive OEM question, I would say that, yes, we continue to make incremental progress. I would say that it's pleasing, but at the same time, we're not satisfied with it now. We continue to drive for more wins. As you know, this particular market and business is a long-lead business and so business develops very slowly.

We're pleased with what happened in Q4. I think we would attribute that to several factors. One is, there was a kind of a rush of deliveries that took place at the end of the year, which typically does happen, and we had newer platforms that, of course, were part of that mix allowing us to grow some of our revenues on the OEM side. And then we also ran successful promotions in Q4, which helped grow our overall sales from this side. So I think, generally, we feel good about the Aviation end of the year, but we do continue to see the headwind in terms of the overall market that we've been talking about for a while."

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported fourth quarter revenue of $781 million, representing a 3% decline year-over-year. While our revenue trends are impacted by the ongoing secular decline of the PND mark",1010,"Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin reported fourth quarter revenue of $781 million, representing a 3% decline year-over-year. While our revenue trends are impacted by the ongoing secular decline of the PND market, I'm pleased to report that the Aviation, Fitness, Marine and Outdoor segments, as a group, grew 11% year-over-year and contributed 66% of total revenues. This growth and diversification of our revenue base is a direct result of the investments we have made in our business over the past few years. Gross margin was 52.9%, ahead of our expectations, but down slightly year-over-year, driven primarily by the competitive dynamics in our Fitness segment. 
Operating margin declined to 18.7% as we continue to invest in engineering and advertising. These factors, offset by a lower-than-anticipated effective tax rate, resulted in pro forma EPS of $0.74 in the quarter. 
Looking briefly at our full year performance. We reported revenue of $2.8 billion, a 2% decline year-over-year driven mainly by global currency shifts that created significant revenue and margin headwinds. Despite these headwinds, the Aviation, Fitness, Marine and Outdoor segments grew 9% on a combined basis, contributing nearly $1.8 billion in revenue for the year or 63% of the total and generating 75% of our operating income. Gross and operating margins of 54.6% and 19.5%, respectively, were down compared to 2014 but exceeded our expectations in a difficult global economy. Unit deliveries increased 7% for the year to $16.2 million. 
Doug will discuss financial results in greater detail in a few minutes. But first, I'll provide a few comments on each business segment. 
Beginning with the Fitness segment. Revenue for the year grew 16%, driven by growth in activity trackers. Gross and operating margins were 55% and 20%, respectively. Gross margin was impacted by the competitive dynamics in the market while operating margin was further impacted by ongoing investments in advertising and engineering. We believe these investments are strategically important in order to maximize the long-term opportunity in the Fitness market. In 2015, we introduced Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology into our running and activity tracker product lines, and we made significant enhancements to Garmin Connect Mobile. These developments have strengthened our position in the market and positively impacted our results for the year. In 2016, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 10% in the Fitness segment. New product introductions play a key role in our growth assumptions. 
Looking at Outdoor. Revenue declined 1% year-over-year as economic and geopolitical issues impacted sales of our core product categories. This weakness was partially offset by strength in the outdoor wearable category. The Outdoor segment continued to generate strong gross and operating margins of 61% and 33%, respectively. This represents a slight decline compared to 2014 due to product mix and additional investments in engineering and advertising to support new product launches. In 2016, we expect revenue growth of approximately 10%, which includes anticipated contributions from PulsedLight and the pending acquisition of DeLorme. We anticipate that the wearable category will continue to be strong in 2016, driven by the new fenix 3 HR with wrist heart rate. In addition, we expect to benefit from new product introductions across other categories. 
Turning next to Aviation. We reported year-over-year revenue growth of 3%, which exceeded our expectations in the midst of an industry decline of 5% as reported by the General Aviation Manufacturers Association. Gross and operating margins remained strong at 74% and 28%, respectively. In the fourth quarter, the G3000-equipped HondaJet became the latest aircraft to receive FDA certification, bringing the total to 64 aircraft platform certified with a Garmin-integrated cockpit. In 2016, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 5% in the Aviation segment. While industry dynamics remain a factor, market share gains and new platforms provide opportunities for growth. 
Looking next at the Marine segment. We reported year-over-year revenue growth of 15%, driven by strong sales of new products. Gross margin improved to 55% while operating margin was down slightly to 10% due to litigation-related costs. However, operating income grew 9% for the year due to stronger revenue and gross margin. For 2016, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 10% in the Marine segment, driven by new product introductions. We believe our product lineup is very strong as we enter the marine season and we look forward to another year of growth in 2016. 
Looking finally at the Auto segment. Revenues were down 15% for the full year as expected due to the ongoing decline of PND market. Gross and operating margins were 44% and 13%, respectively, and our global market share remains very strong. During the year, our presence at Honda expanded and now includes their Pilot, Accord, Civic and CR-V models. Additionally, our presence at Mercedes is recently expanded and now includes their C and E-Class models. 
Looking at 2016, we expect revenue to decline approximately 15%, driven primarily by ongoing declines in the PND market. We remain focused on disciplined execution in order to bring desired innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in the segment. 
Now I want to highlight one other matter regarding action cameras. As of 2016, we have reclassified our action camera product line from the Outdoor segment into the Auto segment. We believe this change will enhance the alignment of our engineering, marketing and sales resources. Going forward, segment results will be adjusted to reflect this change. 
So in summary, we see many opportunities ahead in 2016. However, the macroeconomic challenges we faced in 2015 remain part of the operating environment. With this in mind, we are projecting revenue of approximately $2.82 billion, which is flat year-over-year, and steady gross margin of approximately 54.5%. We are projecting operating income of approximately $510 million with operating margins of approximately 18%. Factoring in an effective tax rate of approximately 20.5%. Pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.25, which includes a $0.05 negative impact related to acquisition. 
So that concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details of our financial results. Doug?"
598655,321490926,934660,"Garmin Ltd., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2016",2016-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. Let's begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $781 million for the fourth quarter, repres",968,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. Let's begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $781 million for the fourth quarter, representing a 3% decrease year-over-year. Gross margin was 52.9%, a 70-basis-point decrease in the prior year, driven by the increased competitive pricing in the Fitness segment. Operating income was $146 million. Operating margin was 18.7%, a decrease of 320 basis points from the prior year. This is a result of both a decline in the gross margin rate and operating expense growth of 5% or $12 million, driven by litigation-related costs, increased spending in advertising and research and development. The pro forma effective tax rate of 13%, pro forma EPS was $0.74. 
Looking at full year results. We posted revenue of $2.82 billion for the year, representing a 2% decrease year-over-year. Gross margin was 54.6%, a 130-basis-point decrease in the prior year. Operating income was $550 million compared to $691 million in 2014. Operating margin was 19.5%, a decrease of 460 basis points in the prior year, driven by both gross margin declines and increased operating expenses. Pro forma effective tax rate increased to approximately 20% for full year 2015 compared to approximately 17%, 2014. Pro forma EPS was $2.49, a 20% decrease year-over-year. We'll discuss gross margin, operating expenses, effective tax rate in more detail later. 
Next we'll look at fourth quarter and full year revenue by segment. During the fourth quarter, we experienced growth in 4 of our 5 segments led by Fitness with 14% growth and Aviation with 12% growth. Collectively, these 4 segments were up 11% compared to the prior year quarter. For the full year 2015, we experienced growth in 3 of our 5 segments led by Fitness with 16% growth and Marine with 15% growth. 
Looking at fourth quarter revenue charts on this page, the Auto segment represent a 35% of our total fourth quarter 2015 revenue compared to 42% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Fitness grew to 29% of revenue in the current period compared to 25% in the prior year. As you can see from the charts, we illustrate our profitability mix by segment: Outdoor, Fitness, Marine and Aviation collectively delivered 75% of operating income in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 68% in the fourth quarter, 2014. 
Drilling down on year-over-year gross margin by segment. Both Aviation and Marine posted gross margin rate increases due to product mix. Fitness gross margin rate was lower due to competitive pricing dynamics and product mix. 
Looking at full year metrics. For the full year, the non-auto segments made up 62% total revenue compared to 57% in 2014. A similar shift occurred in operating income with 75% of our 2015 operating income collectively coming from Outdoor, Fitness, Marine and Aviation segments compared to 69% in 2014. 
Looking next at operating expenses. As previously mentioned, fourth quarter operating expenses increased by $12 million or 5%. This is a 250-basis-point increase as a percent of sales. Research and development increased $4 million year-over-year or 90 basis points to 13.6% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation, increasing resources focused primarily on Aviation, Fitness, Outdoor and Marine, where we see long-term growth opportunities. Our advertising expense increased $3 million with the prior year quarter and represented 7.3% of sales, a 50-basis-point increase. Additional spending was primarily in the Fitness segment and near-term focus on market share growth in wearables. 
SG&A was up $5 million compared to prior quarter, increasing 100 basis points as a percent of sales to 13.4%. Increased spending in SG&A was driven primarily by litigation-related costs and IT expenses. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of about $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially due to the holiday quarter and was down year-over-year to $531 million. Our inventory balance increased year-over-year to $501 million as we grew our product offerings and continued to maintain an adequate supply of raw materials for safety stock. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we generated free cash flow of $131 million. Also, in the quarter, we paid dividends of $97 million and repurchased $23 million of company stock with $160 million remaining for purchase through December 2016. With our dividend and stock repurchase activity during 2015, we returned $509 million of cash to our shareholders. 
As I previously mentioned, our effective tax rate decreased to 13% in the current quarter compared to a pro forma tax rate of 19% in the fourth quarter of 2014. The lower tax rate was primarily a result of income mix by tax jurisdiction, which is positively impacted by the increase in actionable full year taxable income compared to previous projections and the resulting catch-up benefit for the first 3 quarters of 2015. Consistent with prior year, the fourth quarter tax rate includes a full year impact of the R&D tax credit. Our full year pro forma effective tax rate increased from 17% in 2014 to 20% in 2015, primarily due to income mix by tax jurisdiction. We expect our full year tax rate in 2016 to be approximately 20.5%. 
We announced this morning we plan to seek shareholder approval for a dividend of $2.04 per share payable in 4 installments of $0.51 per share per quarter beginning with the June 2016 calendar quarter. As Cliff mentioned, beginning in 2016, we will recast action camera sales and expenses from our Outdoor segment to our Auto segment. As such, we'll provide a supplemental schedule to help assist in updating your models. The elective schedule can be found within the Appendix of today's webcast.

So in terms of the geographic mix, you're correct that the America segment was weaker. And Europe, of course, was down. And then APAC was strong. I think the dynamics there in Europe, first of all, the currency trends probably impacted us the most. And I think by segment, we were actually pleased with many of the results that we had in 2015 and the gains that we had in terms of market share and unit deliveries. In terms of the Americas, it was down, and I think the biggest impact there was the activity tracker and fitness markets, which were primarily driven out of the Americas in terms of its overall development during the year. And then in APAC, we've had strong success in terms of some of our segments there, particularly Outdoor, and also Auto sales, Auto OEM sales in the various markets in APAC and the Middle East. So in terms of our outlook to 2016, I think we would anticipate some improvement in the America side of things, especially as we see growth in some of our traditional markets. I think in Europe, we're continuing to plan for growth in terms of unit deliveries and overall improvements in margins and stabilization in currencies. In APAC, we continue to see an outlook for growth in terms of what's happening there as well. On the Automotive OEM question, I would say that, yes, we continue to make incremental progress. I would say that it's pleasing, but at the same time, we're not satisfied with that. We continue to drive for more wins.

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported fourth quarter revenue of $781 million, representing a 3% decline year-over-year. While our revenue trends are impacted by the ongoing secular decline of the PND mark",1012,"Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin reported fourth quarter revenue of $781 million, representing a 3% decline year-over-year. While our revenue trends are impacted by the ongoing secular decline of the PND market, I'm pleased to report that the Aviation, Fitness, Marine and Outdoor segments, as a group, grew 11% year-over-year and contributed 66% of total revenues. This growth and diversification of our revenue base is a direct result of the investments we have made in our business over the past few years. Gross margin was 52.9%, ahead of our expectations but down slightly year-over-year, driven primarily by the competitive dynamics in our Fitness segment. 
Operating margin declined to 18.7% as we continued to invest in engineering and advertising. These factors, offset by a lower than anticipated effective tax rate, resulted in pro forma EPS of $0.74 in the quarter. 
Looking briefly at our full year performance. We reported revenue of $2.8 billion, a 2% decline year-over-year driven mainly by global currency shifts that created significant revenue and margin headwinds. Despite these headwinds, the Aviation, Fitness, Marine and Outdoor segments grew 9% on a combined basis, contributing nearly $1.8 billion in revenue for the year or 63% of the total and generating 75% of our operating income. Gross and operating margins of 54.6% and 19.5%, respectively, were down compared to 2014 but exceeded our expectations in a difficult global economy. Unit deliveries increased 7% for the year to 16.2 million. 
Doug will discuss financial results in greater detail in a few minutes. But first, I'll provide a few comments on each business segment. 
Beginning with the Fitness segment. Revenue for the year grew 16%, driven by growth in activity trackers. Gross and operating margins were 55% and 20%, respectively. Gross margin was impacted by the competitive dynamics in the market, while operating margin was further impacted by ongoing investments in advertising and engineering. We believe these investments are strategically important in order to maximize the long-term opportunity in the Fitness market. In 2015, we introduced Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology into our running and activity tracker product lines, and we made significant enhancements to Garmin Connect Mobile. These developments have strengthened our position in the market and positively impacted our results for the year. In 2016, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 10% in the Fitness segment. New product introductions play a key role in our growth assumptions. 
Looking at Outdoor. Revenue declined 1% year-over-year as economic and geopolitical issues impacted sales of our core product categories. This weakness was partially offset by strength in the outdoor wearable category. The Outdoor segment continued to generate strong gross and operating margins of 61% and 33%, respectively. This represents a slight decline compared to 2014, due to product mix and additional investments in engineering and advertising to support new product launches. In 2016, we expect revenue growth of approximately 10%, which includes anticipated contributions from PulsedLight and the pending acquisition of DeLorme. We anticipate that the wearable category will continue to be strong in 2016, driven by the new fenix 3 HR with wrist heart rate. In addition, we expect to benefit from new product introductions across other categories. 
Turning next to Aviation. We reported year-over-year revenue growth of 3%, which exceeded our expectations in the midst of an industry decline of 5% as reported by the General Aviation Manufacturers Association. Gross and operating margins remained strong at 74% and 28%, respectively. In the fourth quarter, the G3000-equipped HondaJet became the latest aircraft to receive FAA certification, bringing the total to 64 aircraft platforms certified with a Garmin-integrated cockpit. In 2016, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 5% in the Aviation segment. While industry dynamics remain a factor, market share gains and new platforms provide opportunities for growth. 
Looking next at the Marine segment. We reported year-over-year revenue growth of 15%, driven by strong sales of new products. Gross margin improved to 55%, while operating margin was down slightly to 10% due to litigation-related costs. However, operating income grew 9% for the year due to stronger revenue and gross margin. For 2016, we are targeting revenue growth of approximately 10% in the Marine segment, driven by new product introductions. We believe our product lineup is very strong as we enter the marine season, and we look forward to another year of growth in 2016. 
Looking finally at the Auto segment. Revenues were down 15% for the full year, as expected, due to the ongoing decline of the PND market. Gross and operating margins were 44% and 13%, respectively, and our global market share remains very strong. During the year, our presence at Honda expanded and now includes their Pilot, Accord, Civic and CR-V models. Additionally, our presence at Mercedes recently expanded and now includes their C and E-Class models. 
Looking at 2016, we expect revenue to decline approximately 15%, driven primarily by ongoing declines in the PND market. We remain focused on disciplined execution in order to bring desired innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in the segment. 
Now I want to highlight one other matter regarding action cameras. As of 2016, we have reclassified our action camera product line from the Outdoor segment into the Auto segment. We believe this change will enhance the alignment of our engineering, marketing and sales resources. Going forward, segment results will be adjusted to reflect this change. 
So in summary, we see many opportunities ahead in 2016. However, the macroeconomic challenges we faced in 2015 remain part of the operating environment. With this in mind, we are projecting revenue of approximately $2.82 billion, which is flat year-over-year, and steady gross margin of approximately 54.5%. We are projecting operating income of approximately $510 million with operating margins of approximately 18%. Factoring in an effective tax rate of approximately 20.5%, pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.25, which includes a $0.05 negative impact related to acquisition. 
So that concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details of our financial results. Doug?"
598655,321490926,934917,"Garmin Ltd., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2016",2016-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results, then move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We posted revenue of $781 million for the fourth quarter",981,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year financial results, then move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. 
We posted revenue of $781 million for the fourth quarter, representing a 3% decrease year-over-year. Gross margin was 52.9%, a 70-basis-point decrease from the prior year, driven by the increased competitive pricing in the Fitness segment. Operating income was $146 million. Operating margin was 18.7%, a decrease of 320 basis points from the prior year. This is a result of both a decline in the gross margin rate and operating expense growth of 5%, or $12 million, driven by litigation-related costs, increased spending in advertising and research and development. The pro forma effective tax rate of 13%, pro forma EPS was $0.74. 
Looking at full year results. We posted revenue of $2.82 billion for the year, representing a 2% decrease year-over-year. Gross margin was 54.6%, a 130 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $550 million compared to $691 million in 2014. Operating margin was 19.5%, a decrease of 460 basis points from the prior year, driven by both gross margin declines and increased operating expenses. Pro forma effective tax rate increased to approximately 20% for full year 2015 compared to approximately 17% in 2014. Pro forma EPS was $2.49, a 20% decrease year-over-year. We'll discuss gross margins, operating expenses and effective tax rate in more detail later. 
Next we'll look at fourth quarter and full year revenue by segment. In the fourth quarter, we experienced growth in 4 of our 5 segments, led by Fitness with 14% growth and Aviation with 12% growth. Collectively, these 4 segments were up 11% compared to the prior year quarter. For the full year 2015, we experienced growth in 3 of our 5 segments led by Fitness with 16% growth and Marine with 15% growth. 
Looking at fourth quarter revenue charts on this page, the Auto segment represented 35% of our total fourth quarter 2015 revenue compared to 42% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Fitness grew to 29% of revenue in the current period compared to 25% in the prior year. As you can see from the charts that illustrate our profitability mix by segment, Outdoor, Fitness, Marine and Aviation collectively delivered 75% of operating income in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to 68% in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Drilling down on year-over-year gross margin by segment. Both Aviation and Marine posted gross margin rate increases due to product mix. Fitness gross margin rate was lower due to competitive pricing dynamics and product mix. 
Looking at full year metrics. For the full year, the non-Auto segments made up 62% of total revenue compared to 57% in 2014. A similar shift occurred in operating income, with 75% of our 2015 operating income collectively coming from Outdoor, Fitness, Marine and Aviation segments, compared to 69% in 2014. 
Looking next at operating expenses. As previously mentioned, fourth quarter operating expenses increased by $12 million or 5%. This is a 250 basis point increase as a percent of sales. Research and development increased $4 million year-over-year, or 90 basis points, to 13.6% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation, with increasing resources focused primarily on Aviation, Fitness, Outdoor and Marine, where we see long-term growth opportunities. Our advertising expense increased $3 million over the prior year quarter and represented 7.3% of sales, a 50-basis-point increase. Additional spending was primarily in the Fitness segment with a near-term focus on market share growth in wearables. 
SG&A was up $5 million compared to the prior quarter, increasing 100 basis points as a percent of sales to 13.4%. Increased spending in SG&A was driven primarily by litigation-related costs and IT expenses. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of about $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable increased sequentially due to the holiday quarter and was down year-over-year to $531 million. Our inventory balance increased year-over-year to $501 million as we grew our product offerings and continued to maintain an adequate supply of raw materials for safety stock. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we generated free cash flow of $131 million. Also in the quarter, we paid dividends of $97 million and repurchased $23 million of company stock, with $160 million remaining for purchase through December 2016. With our dividend and stock repurchase activity during 2015, we returned $509 million of cash to our shareholders. 
As I previously mentioned, our effective tax rate decreased to 13% in the current quarter compared to a pro forma tax rate of 19% in the fourth quarter of 2014. The lower tax rate was primarily a result of income mix by tax jurisdiction, which was positively impacted by the increase in actionable full year taxable income compared to previous projections and the resulting catch-up benefit for the first 3 quarters of 2015. Consistent with prior year, the fourth quarter tax rate includes a full year impact of the R&D tax credit. Our full year pro forma effective tax rate increased from 17% in 2014 to 20% in 2015, primarily due to income mix by tax jurisdiction. We expect our full year tax rate for 2016 to be approximately 20.5%. 
We announced this morning that we plan to seek shareholder approval for a dividend of $2.04 per share payable in 4 installments of $0.51 per share per quarter beginning with the June 2016 calendar quarter. As Cliff mentioned, beginning in 2016, we will recast action camera sales and expenses from our Outdoor segment to our Auto segment. As such, we'll provide a supplemental schedule to help assist in updating your models. The supplemental schedule can be found within the Appendix of today's webcast.

So in terms of the geographic mix, you're correct that the Americas segment was weaker. And Europe, of course, was down. And then APAC was strong. I think the dynamics there, in Europe, first of all, the currency trends probably impacted us the most. And I think by segment, we were actually pleased with many of the results that we had in 2015 and the gains that we had in terms of market share and unit deliveries. In terms of the Americas, it was down, and I think the biggest impact there was the activity tracker and fitness markets, which were primarily driven out of the Americas, in terms of its overall development during the year. And then in APAC, we've had strong success in terms of some of our segments there, particularly Outdoor, and also Auto sales, Auto OEM sales in the various markets in APAC and the Middle East. So in terms of our outlook to 2016, I think we would anticipate some improvement in the Americas side of things, especially as we see growth in some of our traditional markets. I think in Europe, we're continuing to plan for growth in terms of unit deliveries and overall improvements in margins and stabilization in currencies. In APAC, we continue to see an outlook for growth in terms of what's happening there as well. On the Automotive OEM question, I would say that, yes, we continue to make incremental progress. I would say that it's pleasing, but at the same time, we're not satisfied with that. We continue to drive for more wins. As you know, that -- this particular market and business is a long-lead business, and so business develops very slowly.

We believe that our share is currently in the low- to mid-40% range. The market has expanded significantly in the past year, so in terms of overall unit deliveries, we are still in a growth mode. And we would expect to take some additional share and reclaim some share in the coming years. We feel our product lineup is much stronger than it was, with many more products coming out with wrist-based heart rate."

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported first quarter consolidated revenue of $624 million, up 7% year-over-year. Our Fitness, Outdoor, Marine and Aviation segments as a group grew 17% year-over-year and contributed 69% of total revenues. Each of these segments have an exciting growth story, which I will cover in a moment as a result of the strategic investments we have been making in recent years to grow and diversify our business. Gross margin was 54.5%, down year-over-year, driven primarily by product mix. Operating margin declined to 16.6% due to lower gross margin and an expense structure that was up slightly from the prior year. These factors, combined with a higher year-over-year effective tax rate, resulted in GAAP EPS and pro forma EPS in the quarter of $0.46 and $0.49, respectively. We are maintaining the guidance issued earlier in the year as our performance thus far is consistent with our expectations. 
Next, I'll provide a brief snapshot into the performance of each business segments. Beginning with the Fitness segment. Revenue grew 9% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong growth of products with Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology. Running and activity tracker category has experienced robust growth over the prior year, somewhat offset by declines in the multisport category. Growth in operating margins were 51% and 12%, respectively. Gross margin was impacted by product mix shift towards lower-margin activity trackers while operating margin was further impacted by ongoing investments in advertising and research and development. As we've mentioned previously, we believe these investments are strategically important in order to maximize the long-term opportunity in the fitness market. While the margin profile of our Fitness segment has changed in recent quarters, we believe the performance will stabilize as we complete critical product and market transitions. 
Our product lineup continues to grow, and I'm pleased to report that the vívoactive HR and the vívofit 3 are now shipping. I'm particularly excited about the vívoactive HR, which adds Garmin Elevated wrist heart rate technology to our multi-activity GPS-enabled smart tracker. The vívofit 3 has move IQ automatic activity detection while carrying forward the strength that our vívofit family is already known first, such as industry-leading 1-year battery life and an always-on display. With these additions, we have a strong lineup of products that offer something for every customer. To share this good news with the market, we have launched our spring Beat Yesterday advertising campaign across multiple media outlets. I encourage everyone to look for our Beat Yesterday creative material in train stations, airports, movie theaters and, of course, on television. 
Looking next at Outdoor. Revenues increased 33% year-over-year as we experienced strong demand for outdoor wearables and dog products. The Outdoor segment continued to generate strong growth in operating margins of 61% and 29%, respectively, and operating income grew 17% over the year-ago quarter. We've recently launched several golf products, which has brought new excitement to the market. Additionally, we have completed the acquisition of DeLorme and look forward to integrating their technology into a broad range of product categories. 
Looking next at Marine. Revenue was up 29% over the prior year, driven by strong sale of chartplotters and fishfinders. Gross margin declined slightly in the quarter to 53% due to product mix while operating margin improved to 12% as we successfully leverage recent investments in the segment. Operating income grew 125% over the prior year. 
In recent years, we've made significant investments in our Marine segment. As a result, our product line is extremely strong as we entered the 2016 marine season. Our recently launched GPSMap 8400/8600 are the largest plotters we've offered and have strong differentiators that stand out in a highly competitive market. 
Another area of focus has been on improving our cartography offerings. We recently added depth contours to thousands of lights in U.S. and Canada, which will broaden our appeal in the inland fishing markets. We also added an exciting feature to our chartplotters that we call Quickdraw Contours, which enables users to create their on depth contours for small fishing lakes not covered by our HD maps. 
Turning next to Aviation. Revenue grew 8% over the prior year as we experienced growth in both OEM and aftermarket product lines. Growth in operating margin remained strong at 74% and 29%, respectively, resulting in a 16% increase in operating income. During the quarter, we expanded our reach into organizations that own and operate large fleets. The air ambulance provider, AirEvac, chose [indiscernible] Avionics for their fleet Bell 206 and Bell 407 helicopters, and the United States Forest Service chose our G950 integrated cockpit system for their fleet of Sherpa aircraft that operate in the challenging role of fighting in wildfires. 
In recent years, we have mentioned the ADS-B opportunity, which is the transition to a more efficient next-generation air traffic management system. This mandated transition, which must be completed by the end of 2019, requires the installation of an ADS-B transponder in every aircraft operating in designated aerospace. Garmin has been an early mover in the ADS-B market, and we recently expanded our product offerings with the introduction of the DCX 335 and 345 family for the ADS-B transponders. These transponders feature an integrated dual-ring transceiver, offering best available traffic awareness at a value price. We will continue to invest in ADS-B solutions in order to make this transition simple, beneficial and cost-effective for a broad range of aircraft and customers. 
We continue to support our OEM partners in the development and certification of new aircraft and helicopter platforms. While industry dynamics remain a factor, market share gains and new platforms provide opportunities for future growth. 
So looking finally at the Auto segment. Revenues were down 11% for the quarter, primarily due to ongoing PND market contractions and headwinds caused by additional revenue deferrals associated with Auto OEM programs. Growth in operating margins were 44% and 9%, respectively. During the quarter, we began shipping our drive family of PND devices, bringing driver assistance and awareness features to the aftermarket. Additionally, we experienced strong growth in infotainment systems for the APAC region and also the Middle East. 
Finally, we delivered production software for the new 2017 Mercedes E-class model. We remain focused on disciplined execution in order to bring desired innovation into the market and to maximize profitability in this segment. 
So that concludes my remarks for the morning. Next, Doug will walk you through the additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

I'll review the first quarter results and move to comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We posted revenue of $624 million for the first quarter, representing a 7% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 54.5%, a 430 basis point decrease from prior year, driven by product mix. Operating expense grew 2% or $4 million, driven by increased spending in advertising and research and development. Operating income was $104 million. Operating margin was 16.6%, a decrease of 250 basis points from the prior year. This was of result of a decline in gross margin rate. Pro forma effective tax rate was 18.1% in the current quarter compared to 12.3% in prior year due to projected income mix by jurisdiction. We still anticipate a fully year tax rate of approximately 20.5%. The first quarter tax rate was positively impacted by at least almost $4 million of tax reserves. Our GAAP EPS was $0.46, and our pro forma EPS was $0.49. We'll discussed gross margin and operating expenses in more detail later. 
Next, let's look at first quarter revenue by segment. During the first quarter, we experienced growth in 4 of our 5 segments, led by robust double-digit growth in our Outdoor and Marine segments and a high single-digit growth in our Fitness and Aviation segments. Collectively, these 4 segments were up 17% compared to the prior year quarter. 
Looking at the first quarter revenue charts on this page. The Auto segment represented 31% of our total first quarter 2016 revenue compared to 38% in the first quarter of 2015. Outdoor grew to 16% of revenue in the current periods compared to 12% in the prior year. While marine grew from 11% to 13%, and Fitness grew from 22% to 23%. As you can see from the chart, it illustrates our profitability mix by segment. Outdoor, Fitness, Marine and Aviation collectively delivered 80% of operating income in the first quarter of 2016. Fitness operating income as percentage of the total operating income decreased from 31% to 16%; while Aviation increased from 24% to 29%; Outdoor increased from 21% to 27%; and Marine increased from 4% to 10%. 
Drilling down year-over-year gross margin by segment. Aviation posted a gross margin rate increase of Fitness, Outdoor, Auto and Marine posted gross margin declines due to shifts and product mix. Total corporate operating margin decreased from 19.1% in the first quarter 2015 to 16.6% in the current quarter due to gross margin pressure and increased advertising and R&D investments. These same factors contributed to the decrease in Fitness operating margin.
Looking next at operating expenses. As previously mentioned, first quarter operating expense increased by $4 million or 2%. However, percentage of sales, operating expense decreased from 39.7% in the first quarter 2015 to 37.8% in the current quarter. Research and development increased $2 million year-over-year, a decline of 80 basis points to 17.3% of sales. We continued to invest in innovation and increasing resources focused primarily on Aviation, Fitness and Outdoor. 
Our advertising expense increased $4 million for the prior quarter, representing a 5.2% of sales, a 40 basis point increase. Additional spending was focused on Fitness and investment in media. SG&A was down $3 million compared to prior quarter, decreasing 150 basis points as a percent of sales to 15.3%. The lower SG&A expense were driven primarily by decrease in year-over-year litigation-related costs. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with a cash and marketable securities over $2.3 billion. Accounts receivable decreased both sequentially and year-over-year to $408 million. Inventory balance increased year-over-year and sequentially to $518 [ph] million as we grew our product offerings to prepare for the seasonally strong second quarter. During the first quarter 2016, we generated free cash flow of $115 million compared to $64 million in the first quarter 2015. Also, during the quarter, we pay dividends of $97 million, repurchased about $20 million of company stock with $140 million remaining for purchase through December 2016. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Jonathan, could you please open the lines for Q&A?"

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported first quarter consolidated revenue of $624 million, up 7% year-over-year. Our fitness, outdoor, marine and aviation segments as a group grew 17% year-over-year and contributed 69% of total revenues. Each of these segments have an exciting growth story, which I will cover in a moment, as a result of the strategic investments we have been making in recent years to grow and diversify our business.
Gross margin was 54.5%, down year-over-year, driven primarily by product mix. Operating margin declined to 16.6% due to lower gross margin and an expense structure that was up slightly from the prior year. These factors, combined with a higher year-over-year effective tax rate, resulted in GAAP EPS and pro forma EPS in the quarter of $0.46 and $0.49, respectively. We are maintaining the guidance issued earlier in the year as our performance thus far is consistent with our expectations. 
Next, I'll provide a brief snapshot into the performance of each business segments. Beginning with the fitness segment. Revenue grew 9% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong growth of products with Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology. Running and activity tracker categories experienced robust growth over the prior year, somewhat offset by declines in the multisport category. Growth in operating margins were 51% and 12%, respectively. Gross margin was impacted by product mix shifting towards lower-margin activity trackers, while operating margin was further impacted by ongoing investments in advertising and research and development. As we've mentioned previously, we believe these investments are strategically important in order to maximize the long-term opportunity in the fitness market. While the margin profile of our fitness segment has changed in recent quarters, we believe the performance will stabilize as we complete critical product and market transitions. 
Our product lineup continues to grow, and I'm pleased to report that the vívoactive HR and the vívofit 3 are now shipping. I'm particularly excited about the vívoactive HR, which adds Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology to our multi-activity GPS-enabled smart tracker. The vívofit 3 adds Move IQ automatic activity detection while carrying forward the strength that our vívofit family is already known for, such as industry-leading 1-year battery life and an always-on display. With these additions, we have a strong lineup of products that offer something for every customer.
To share this good news with the market, we have launched our spring Beat Yesterday advertising campaign across multiple media outlets. I encourage everyone to look for our Beat Yesterday creative material in train stations, airports, movie theaters and, of course, on television. 
Looking next at outdoor. Revenue increased 33% year-over-year as we experienced strong demand for outdoor wearables and dog products. The outdoor segment continued to generate strong gross and operating margins of 61% and 29%, respectively. And operating income grew 17% over the year-ago quarter. 
We've recently launched several golf products, which have brought new excitement to the market. Additionally, we have completed the acquisition of DeLorme and look forward to integrating their technology into a broad range of product categories. 
Looking next at marine. Revenue was up 29% over the prior year, driven by strong sales of chartplotters and fishfinders. Gross margin declined slightly in the quarter to 53% due to product mix, while operating margin improved to 12% as we've successfully leveraged recent investments in the segment. Operating income grew 125% over the prior year. 
In recent years, we've made significant investments in our marine segment. As a result, our product line is extremely strong as we entered the 2016 marine season. Our recently launched GPSMap 8400 and 8600 are the largest plotters we've offered and have strong differentiators that stand out in a highly competitive market. 
Another area of focus has been on improving our cartography offerings. We recently added depth contours to thousands of lights in the U.S. and Canada, which will broaden our appeal in the inland fishing markets. We also added an exciting feature to our chartplotters that we call Quickdraw Contours, which enables users to create their own depth contours for small fishing lakes not covered by our HD maps. 
Turning next to aviation. Revenue grew 8% over the prior year as we experienced growth in both OEM and aftermarket product lines. Gross and operating margins remained strong at 74% and 29%, respectively, resulting in a 16% increase in operating income. During the quarter, we expanded our reach into organizations that own and operate large fleets. Air ambulance provider, AirEvac, chose Garmin avionics for their fleet of Bell 206 and Bell 407 helicopters. And the United States Forest Service chose our G950 integrated cockpit system for their fleet of Sherpa aircraft that operate in the challenging role of fighting wildfires. 
In recent years, we have mentioned the ADS-B opportunity, which is the transition to a more efficient, next-generation air traffic management system. This mandated transition, which must be completed by the end of 2019, requires the installation of an ADS-B transponder in every aircraft operating in designated airspace. Garmin has been an early mover in the ADS-B market, and we recently expanded our product offerings with the introduction of the GTX 335 and 345 family for the ADS-B transponders. These transponders feature an integrated dual-link transceiver, offering best available traffic awareness at a value price. We will continue to invest in ADS-B solutions in order to make this transition simple, beneficial and cost-effective for a broad range of aircraft and customers. 
We continue to support our OEM partners in the development and certification of new aircraft and helicopter platforms. While industry dynamics remain a factor, market share gains and new platforms provide opportunities for future growth. 
So looking finally at the auto segment. Revenues were down 11% for the quarter, primarily due to ongoing PND market contractions and headwinds caused by additional revenue deferrals associated with auto OEM programs. Gross and operating margins were 44% and 9%, respectively. During the quarter, we began shipping our Drive family of PND devices, bringing driver assistance and awareness features to the aftermarket. Additionally, we experienced strong growth in infotainment systems for the APAC region and also the Middle East. Finally, we delivered production software for the new 2017 Mercedes E-class model. We remain focused on disciplined execution in order to bring desired innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in this segment. 
So that concludes my remarks for the morning. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"
598655,330019646,964285,"Garmin Ltd., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our first quarter results, then move to comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement.We posted revenue of $624 million for the first quarter, representing a 7% increase year-",693,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our first quarter results, then move to comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement.
We posted revenue of $624 million for the first quarter, representing a 7% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 54.5%, a 430 basis point decrease from prior year, driven by product mix. Operating expense grew 2% or $4 million, driven by increased spending in advertising and research and development. Operating income was $104 million. 
Operating margin was 16.6%, a decrease of 250 basis points from the prior year. This is a result of the decline in the gross margin rate. Pro forma effective tax rate was 18.1% in the current quarter compared to 12.3% in the prior year due to projected income mix by jurisdiction. We still anticipate a full year tax rate of approximately 20.5%. The first quarter tax rate was positively impacted by at least almost $4 million of tax reserves. Our GAAP EPS was $0.46, and pro forma EPS was $0.49. We'll discuss gross margin and operating expenses in more detail later. 
Next is we look at first quarter revenue by segment. During the first quarter, we experienced growth in 4 of our 5 segments, led by robust double-digit growth in our outdoor and marine segments and high single-digit growth in our fitness and aviation segments. Collectively, these 4 segments were up 17% compared to the prior year quarter. 
Looking at the first quarter revenue charts on this page. The auto segment represented 31% of our total first quarter 2016 revenue compared to 38% in the first quarter of 2015. Outdoor grew to 16% of revenue in the current period compared to 12% in the prior year; while marine grew from 11% to 13%, and fitness grew from 22% to 23%. As you can see from the charts illustrate our profitability mix by segment. Outdoor, fitness, marine and aviation collectively delivered 80% for operating income in the first quarter of 2016. Fitness operating income as percentage of the total operating income decreased from 31% to 16%; while aviation increased from 24% to 29%; outdoor increased from 21% to 27%; and marine increased from 4% to 10%. 
Drilling down year-over-year gross margin by segment. Aviation posted a gross margin rate increase, while fitness, outdoor, auto and marine posted gross margin declines due to shifts in product mix. Total corporate operating margin decreased from 19.1% in the first quarter of 2015 to 16.6% in the current quarter due to gross margin pressure and increased advertising and R&D investments. These same factors contributed to the decrease in fitness operating margin.
Looking next at operating expenses. As previously mentioned, first quarter operating expense increased by $4 million or 2%. However, percentage of sales, operating expense decreased from 39.7% in the first quarter 2015 to 37.8% in the current quarter. Research and development increased $2 million year-over-year, a decline of 80 basis points to 17.3% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation and increasing resources focused primarily on aviation, fitness and outdoor. 
Our advertising expense increased $4 million for the prior year quarter, representing 5.2% of sales, a 40 basis point increase. Additional spending was focused on fitness and investments in media. SG&A was down $3 million compared to prior quarter, decreasing 150 basis points as a percent of sales to 15.3%. The lower SG&A expense were driven primarily by a decrease in year-over-year litigation-related costs. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities over [ph] $2.3 billion. Accounts receivable decreased both sequentially and year-over-year to $408 million. Inventory balance increased year-over-year and sequentially to $518 million [ph] as we grew our product offerings to prepare for a seasonally strong second quarter. During the first quarter of 2016, we generated free cash flow of $115 million compared to $64 million in the first quarter of 2015. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $97 million, repurchased about $20 million of company stock, with $140 million remaining for purchase through December 2016. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Jonathan, could you please open the line for Q&A?"

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported first quarter consolidated revenue of $624 million, up 7% year-over-year. Our fitness, outdoor, marine and aviation segments as a group grew 17% year-over-year and contributed 69% of total revenues. Each of these segments have an exciting growth story, which I will cover in a moment, as a result of the strategic investments we have been making in recent years to grow and diversify our business.
Gross margin was 54.5%, down year-over-year, driven primarily by product mix. Operating margin declined to 16.6% due to lower gross margin and an expense structure that was up slightly from the prior year. These factors, combined with a higher year-over-year effective tax rate, resulted in GAAP EPS and pro forma EPS in the quarter of $0.46 and $0.49, respectively. We are maintaining the guidance issued earlier in the year as our performance thus far is consistent with our expectations. 
Next, I'll provide a brief snapshot into the performance of each business segments. Beginning with the fitness segment. Revenue grew 9% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong growth of products with Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology. Running and activity tracker categories experienced robust growth over the prior year, somewhat offset by declines in the multisport category. Growth in operating margins were 51% and 12%, respectively. Gross margin was impacted by product mix shifting towards lower-margin activity trackers, while operating margin was further impacted by ongoing investments in advertising and research and development. As we've mentioned previously, we believe these investments are strategically important in order to maximize the long-term opportunity in the fitness market. While the margin profile of our fitness segment has changed in recent quarters, we believe the performance will stabilize as we complete critical product and market transitions. 
Our product lineup continues to grow, and I'm pleased to report that the vívoactive HR and the vívofit 3 are now shipping. I'm particularly excited about the vívoactive HR, which adds Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology to our multi-activity GPS-enabled smart tracker. The vívofit 3 adds Move IQ automatic activity detection while carrying forward the strength that our vívofit family is already known for, such as industry-leading 1-year battery life and an always-on display. With these additions, we have a strong lineup of products that offer something for every customer.
To share this good news with the market, we have launched our spring Beat Yesterday advertising campaign across multiple media outlets. I encourage everyone to look for our Beat Yesterday creative material in train stations, airports, movie theaters and, of course, on television. 
Looking next at outdoor. Revenue increased 33% year-over-year as we experienced strong demand for outdoor wearables and dog products. The outdoor segment continued to generate strong gross and operating margins of 61% and 29%, respectively. And operating income grew 17% over the year-ago quarter. 
We've recently launched several golf products, which have brought new excitement to the market. Additionally, we have completed the acquisition of DeLorme and look forward to integrating their technology into a broad range of product categories. 
Looking next at marine. Revenue was up 29% over the prior year, driven by strong sales of chartplotters and fishfinders. Gross margin declined slightly in the quarter to 53% due to product mix, while operating margin improved to 12% as we've successfully leveraged recent investments in the segment. Operating income grew 125% over the prior year. 
In recent years, we've made significant investments in our marine segment. As a result, our product line is extremely strong as we enter the 2016 marine season. Our recently launched GPSMap 8400 and 8600 are the largest plotters we've offered and have strong differentiators that stand out in a highly competitive market. 
Another area of focus has been on improving our cartography offerings. We recently added depth contours to thousands of lights in the U.S. and Canada, which will broaden our appeal in the inland fishing markets. We also added an exciting feature to our chartplotters that we call Quickdraw Contours, which enables users to create their own depth contours for small fishing lakes not covered by our HD maps. 
Turning next to aviation. Revenue grew 8% over the prior year as we experienced growth in both OEM and aftermarket product lines. Gross and operating margins remained strong at 74% and 29%, respectively, resulting in a 16% increase in operating income. During the quarter, we expanded our reach into organizations that own and operate large fleets. Air ambulance provider, AirEvac, chose Garmin avionics for their fleet of Bell 206 and Bell 407 helicopters. And the United States Forest Service chose our G950 integrated cockpit system for their fleet of Sherpa aircraft that operate in the challenging role of fighting wildfires. 
In recent years, we have mentioned the ADS-B opportunity, which is the transition to a more efficient, next-generation air traffic management system. This mandated transition, which must be completed by the end of 2019, requires the installation of an ADS-B transponder in every aircraft operating in designated airspace. Garmin has been an early mover in the ADS-B market, and we recently expanded our product offerings with the introduction of the GTX 335 and 345 family for the ADS-B transponders. These transponders feature an integrated dual-link transceiver, offering best available traffic awareness at a value price. We will continue to invest in ADS-B solutions in order to make this transition simple, beneficial and cost-effective for a broad range of aircraft and customers. 
We continue to support our OEM partners in the development and certification of new aircraft and helicopter platforms. While industry dynamics remain a factor, market share gains and new platforms provide opportunities for future growth. 
So looking finally at the auto segments. Revenues were down 11% for the quarter, primarily due to ongoing PND market contractions and headwinds caused by additional revenue deferrals associated with auto OEM programs. Gross and operating margins were 44% and 9%, respectively. During the quarter, we began shipping our Drive family of PND devices, bringing driver assistance and awareness features to the aftermarket. Additionally, we experienced strong growth in infotainment systems for the APAC region and also the Middle East. Finally, we delivered production software for the new 2017 Mercedes E-class model. We remain focused on disciplined execution in order to bring desired innovation to the market and to maximize profitability in this segment. 
So that concludes my remarks for the morning. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"
598655,330019646,964378,"Garmin Ltd., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our first quarter results, then move to comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement.We posted revenue of $624 million for the first quarter, representing a 7% increase year-",694,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our first quarter results, then move to comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement.
We posted revenue of $624 million for the first quarter, representing a 7% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 54.5%, a 430 basis point decrease from the prior year, driven by product mix. Operating expense grew 2% or $4 million, driven by increased spending in advertising and research and development. Operating income was $104 million. 
Operating margin was 16.6%, a decrease of 250 basis points from the prior year. This is a result of the decline in the gross margin rate. Pro forma effective tax rate was 18.1% in the current quarter compared to 12.3% in the prior year due to projected income mix by jurisdiction. We still anticipate a full year tax rate of approximately 20.5%. The first quarter tax rate was positively impacted by the release of almost $4 million of tax reserves. Our GAAP EPS was $0.46, and pro forma EPS was $0.49. We'll discuss gross margin and operating expenses in more detail later. 
Next as we look at first quarter revenue by segment. During the first quarter, we experienced growth in 4 of our 5 segments, led by robust double-digit growth in our outdoor and marine segments and high single-digit growth in our fitness and aviation segments. Collectively, these 4 segments were up 17% compared to the prior year quarter. 
Looking at the first quarter revenue charts on this page. The auto segment represented 31% of our total first quarter 2016 revenue compared to 38% in the first quarter of 2015. Outdoor grew to 16% of revenue in the current period compared to 12% in the prior year; while marine grew from 11% to 13%, and fitness grew from 22% to 23%. As you can see from the charts illustrate our profitability mix by segment. Outdoor, fitness, marine and aviation collectively delivered 82% for operating income in the first quarter of 2016. Fitness operating income as a percentage of the total operating income decreased from 31% to 16%; while aviation increased from 24% to 29%; outdoor increased from 21% to 27%; and marine increased from 4% to 10%. 
Drilling down year-over-year gross margin by segment. Aviation posted a gross margin rate increase, while fitness, outdoor, auto and marine posted gross margin declines due to shifts in product mix. Total corporate operating margin decreased from 19.1% in the first quarter of 2015 to 16.6% in the current quarter due to gross margin pressure and increased advertising and R&D investments. These same factors contributed to the decrease in fitness operating margin.
Looking next at operating expenses. As previously mentioned, first quarter operating expense increased by $4 million or 2%. However, percentage of sales, operating expense decreased from 39.7% in the first quarter 2015 to 37.8% in the current quarter. Research and development increased $2 million year-over-year, that declined 80 basis points to 17.3% of sales. We continue to invest in innovation and increasing resources focused primarily on aviation, fitness and outdoor. 
Our advertising expense increased $4 million for the prior year quarter, representing 5.2% of sales, a 40 basis point increase. Additional spending was focused on fitness and investments in media. SG&A was down $3 million compared to prior quarter, decreasing 150 basis points as a percent of sales to 15.3%. The lower SG&A expense were driven primarily by a decrease in year-over-year litigation-related costs. 
A few highlights on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities over $2.3 billion. Accounts receivable decreased both sequentially and year-over-year to $408 million. Inventory balance increased year-over-year and sequentially to $518 million [ph] as we grew our product offerings to prepare for a seasonally strong second quarter. During the first quarter of 2016, we generated free cash flow of $115 million compared to $64 million in the first quarter of 2015. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of $97 million, repurchased about $20 million of company stock, with $140 million remaining for purchase through December 2016. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Jonathan, could you please open the line for Q&A?"

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported second quarter results highlighted by both revenue and EPS growth. Consolidated revenue increased 5% year-over-year with fitness, outdoor, marine and aviation collectively growing 20% while contributing 70% of the total revenue in the quarter. Each of our business segments produced strong results, which I will highlight shortly. 
Gross margin expanded to 57% from 54.2% in the prior year as new products and margin improvement efforts made a clear impact on our business. Operating margin expanded to 24.7% from 21.5% in the prior year, and operating income grew 20% on a consolidated basis. These strong results generated $0.85 of GAAP EPS. Pro forma EPS came in at $0.87, an increase of 21% over the year-ago quarter. 
Wearable products were a major contributor to our strong second quarter performance. Over the past year, we have expanded our wearable product portfolio with the goal of offering a wearable device for a wide range of active lifestyles. As part of this effort, we've been pursuing 2 important objectives. First, we've been expanding the availability of Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology across our wearable product lines. Garmin Elevate is now available in multiple models of our running products, in our activity trackers and our fenix series of outdoor adventure watches. Customers have embraced Garmin Elevate, and the feedback we are receiving is very positive. 
The second important objective is to increase customer engagement by offering applications, widgets and watch spaces to our Connect IQ App Store. Momentum in the App Store continues to build as we now offer over 2,000 apps, watch spaces and widgets, and we have surpassed 13 million downloads from the store since its launch early last year. 
While I'm pleased with the progress we made so far, there is certainly much more to do. We remain focus on a strong product road map and building engagement through Connect IQ and our Garmin Connect community. 
Looking now at segment highlights. Our Fitness segment experienced robust revenue growth of 34% on a year-over-year basis, driven by growth within all product categories. Gross margin came in at 56%, and operating margin was 25%, an expansion of more than 400 basis points over the prior year. This generated operating income growth of 60% in the quarter. 
Recent new product launches include the Forerunner 735XT, a lightweight, multisport running watch; and the vivosmart HR+, which adds GPS capability to our smart activity tracker. As a result of these and many other recent product releases, we estimate that our share of the GPS-enabled smart wearable market in the United States has grown from approximately 43% a year ago to approximately 57% today according to market share data. During the quarter, we also introduced the vivomove, a fashionable analogue watch with activity tracking features and a 1-year battery life.
Looking next to Outdoor, which also experienced robust growth. Revenue increased 23% year-over-yea on strong demand for our outdoor wearables and a full quarter contribution of DeLorme sales. The Outdoor segment generated strong growth and operating margins of 64% and 36%, respectively, representing an expansion over the prior year. Operating income grew 31% over the year-ago quarter. 
One of the many benefits of our business model is the ability to share product platforms, technologies and components across multiple market segments. Recent examples include the Approach X40, a GPS-based activity tracker with Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology and a built-in database of over 40,000 golf courses providing distance to the front, middle and back of the green. We also introduced our next-generation Doug tracker, the Astro 430, which when compared to the Drive Track 70PND can track up to 20 dogs from a vehicle. The Astro 430 can also pair with fenix 3 wearable for convenient tracking and alerts at the wrist. 
Looking next to marine. Revenue increased 8% over a very strong quarter in the prior year. Gross margin increased 58% -- to 58% in the quarter, excuse me, while operating margin expanded to 26%. Operating income grew 19% in the quarter. Our new fishfinders have been well-received, and we have grown our share in the inland fishing market. Earlier in the year, we introduced Quickdraw Contours, which enables motor to create maps with all processing and storage taking place right on the device. We recently enhanced QuickDraw by offering a community feature called QuickDraw Community, which is a free, cloud-based, mapping platform for sharing user-generated HD mapping content. We believe QuickDraw community will positively impact customer engagement and will expand the availability of HD mapping content, particularly on smaller fishing life. 
Turning next to Aviation, revenue grew 6% over the prior year as we experienced growth in both OEM and ADS-B systems. Growth in operating margin remained strong at 74% and 28%, respectively, resulting in a 13% increase in operating income. During the quarter, the G3000 M600 received certification, and we are pleased to be the avionics provider for this aircraft. As we continue into the back half of 2016, we will focus on a number of additional certification, including the aftermarket G5000 system for the Beech Jet 400A and the Hawker 400XT. 
We announced several new products and product enhancements at the Oshkosh Air Show taking place this week. One such announcement is the Flight Stream 510, which is a multimode, wireless radio system built into a multimedia card, which also includes storage for a variety of flight databases. The Flight Stream 510 is important because it simplifies the task of updating flight databases by leveraging the connectivity of a smartphone or tablet. Flight Stream 510 also shares flight plans, traffic, weather and position information with smartphone and tablets running our Garmin pilot mobile app. Flight Stream 510 significantly enhances the ability to incorporate consumer devices in the cockpit. 
Looking finally at the Auto segment. Revenues were down 18% in the quarter, primarily due to the ongoing PND market contraction and headwinds caused by revenue deferrals associated with certain auto OEM programs. Gross margin came in at 46%, and operating margin expanded to 16%. We remain strategically focused on new opportunities in the auto OEM market. While we are typically thought of as a navigation and infotainment supplier, we're also leveraging our competencies in other technology such as cameras and driver assistance to extend our ability to serve the market. At the recent 2016 Beijing Auto Show, it showcased its model 3008, which includes a factory-installed digital video recorder designed and manufactured by Garmin. 
So in summary, we are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2016, and we believe we're well positioned for the remainder of the year. With this in mind, we are raising our projected revenue for the year to $2.9 billion, up approximately 3% over 2015. We're projecting gross margin of 55% and operating margin of 19% for the full year. Factoring in an effective tax rate of approximately 19.5%, pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.50. 
Looking at our outlook by segment. We have increased growth expectations for Fitness and Outdoor to 20% for the year. Aviation and Marine are unchanged, while the outlook for Auto has been reduced slightly based on current market trends. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through the additional details on our financial results."
598655,369809472,1013401,"Garmin Ltd., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our second quarter results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement. We posted revenue of roughly $812 million for the second quarter, representing a 5% increase",606,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our second quarter results and move to comments on the balance sheet, cash flow statement. 
We posted revenue of roughly $812 million for the second quarter, representing a 5% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 57%, a 280 basis point increase from the prior year, driven primarily by segment and product mix. Operating expense as a percent of sales was 32.3%, a 40 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $201 million, a 20% increase with the prior year. Operating margin was 24.7%, 320 basis point increase in the prior year. Effective tax rate was 21% in the current quarter. It was comparable to effective tax rate of 20.6% in the prior year quarter. Our GAAP EPS was $0.85, 18% growth over prior quarter; and pro forma EPS was $0.87, a 21% growth the prior year quarter. We'll discuss gross margin, operating expenses in more detail later.
Next, we look at second quarter revenue by segment. During the second quarter, we had growth in 4 of our 5 segments, led by robust double-digit growth in our Fitness and Outdoor segments and single-digit growth in our Marine and Aviation segments. Collectively, these 4 segments were up 20% compared to the prior year quarter. 
Looking next at second quarter revenue charts. Auto segment represented 30% of our total second quarter 2016 revenue compared to 39% in the second quarter 2015. Fitness grew to 26% of revenue in the current period compared to 21% in the prior year, while Outdoor grew from 14% to 17%. As you see from the chart, it illustrates our profit mix by segment. Outdoor, Fitness, Marine and Aviation collectively delivered 80% of operating income in the second quarter of 2016. Fitness operating income as a percentage of total operating income increased from 20% to 27%, and Outdoor increased from 22% to 24%. 
Looking at year-over-year gross margin by segment. All segments posted gross margin rate increase due to shifts in product mix. Total corporate operating margin increased from 21.5% to 24.7% with gross margin improvement. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Second quarter operating expense increased by about $10 million or 4%. Research and development increased $5 million year-over-year, was flat as a percent of sales. The continued innovation, increase in resources focused primarily on Aviation, Fitness and Outdoor. Our advertising expense decreased $1.5 million from the prior year quarter, representing 5.5% of sales, 50 basis point decrease. Additional advertising spend and Fitness was more than offset by decreases in Auto and Marine. SG&A was up $6 million compared to prior year quarter, increasing 170 basis points as a percent of sales to 12.8%. Increase in SG&A were driven primarily by expenses associated with the addition of the DeLorme business and compensation-related costs. 
Looking at highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of about $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable increased both sequentially and year-over-year to $510 million. Inventory balance decreased sequentially to $508 million. As we exit the seasonally strong second quarter, it remains high year-over-year due to new product offerings. For the second quarter of 2016, we generated free cash flow of $135 million, a $71 million increase for the second quarter of 2015. Also, during the quarter, we paid dividends of approximately $97 million, repurchased about $25 million of company stock, approximately $123 million remaining for purchase December 2016. As Cliff mentioned, we're updating our tax guidance and anticipate full year tax rate approximately 19.5%. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Jamie, could you open the lines for Q&A? Thanks."

As it relates to expenses, a couple of things to think about expense in the back half, the first of which is relating to acquisitions. DeLorme will have 2 full quarters of expenses late into the DeLorme acquisition as well as, in 2016, this is the year we have a 53rd week.

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported second quarter results, highlighted by both revenue and EPS growth. Consolidated revenue increased 5% year-over-year, with fitness, outdoor, marine and aviation collectively growing 20%, while contributing 70% of the total revenue in the quarter. Each of our business segments produced strong results, which I will highlight shortly. 
Gross margin expanded to 57% from 54.2% in the prior year as new products and margin improvement efforts made a clear impact on our business. Operating margin expanded to 24.7% from 21.5% in the prior year, and operating income grew 20% on a consolidated basis. These strong results generated $0.85 of GAAP EPS. Pro forma EPS came in at $0.87, an increase of 21% over the year-ago quarter.
Wearable products were a major contributor to our strong second quarter performance. Over the past year, we have expanded our wearable product portfolio with the goal of offering a wearable device for a wide range of active lifestyles. As part of this effort, we've been pursuing 2 important objectives. First, we've been expanding the availability of Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology across our wearable product lines. Garmin Elevate is now available in multiple models of our running products, in our activity trackers and our fenix series of outdoor adventure watches. Customers have embraced Garmin Elevate, and the feedback we are receiving is very positive. 
The second important objective is to increase customer engagement by offering applications, widgets and watch spaces to our Connect IQ app store. Momentum in the app store continues to build as we now offer over 2,000 apps, watch faces and widgets, and we have surpassed 13 million downloads from the store since its launch early last year. 
While I'm pleased with the progress we've made so far, there is certainly much more to do. We remained focus on a strong product road map and building engagement through Connect IQ and our Garmin Connect community. 
Looking now at segment highlights. Our Fitness segment experienced robust revenue growth of 34% on a year-over-year basis, driven by growth within all product categories. Gross margin came in at 56%, and operating margin was 25%, an expansion of more than 400 basis points over the prior year. This generated operating income growth of 60% in the quarter. 
Recent new product launches include the Forerunner 735XT, a lightweight, multisport running watch; and the vívosmart HR+, which adds GPS capability to our smart activity tracker. As a result of these and many other recent product releases, we estimate that our share of the GPS-enabled smart wearable market in the United States has grown from approximately 43% a year ago to approximately 57% today according to market share data. During the quarter, we also introduced the vívomove, a fashionable analogue watch with activity tracking features and a 1-year battery life. 
Looking next at Outdoor, which also experienced robust growth. Revenue increased 23% year-over-year on strong demand for our outdoor wearables and a full quarter contribution of DeLorme sales. The Outdoor segment generated strong growth and operating margins of 64% and 36%, respectively, representing an expansion over the prior year. Operating income grew 31% over the year-ago quarter. 
One of the many benefits of our business model is the ability to share product platforms, technologies and components across multiple market segments. Recent examples include the Approach X40, a GPS-based activity tracker with Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology and a built-in database of over 40,000 golf courses providing distance to the front, middle and back of the green. We also introduced our next-generation dog tracker, the Astro 430, which when compared to a DriveTrack 70 TND can track up to 20 dogs from a vehicle. The Astro 430 can also pair with the fenix 3 wearable for convenient tracking and alerts at the wrist. 
Looking next at marine. Revenue increased 8% over a very strong quarter in the prior year. Gross margin increased 58% -- to 58% in the quarter, excuse me, while operating margin expanded to 26%. Operating income grew 19% in the quarter. Our new fishfinders have been well-received, and we have grown our share in the inland fishing market. Earlier in the year, we introduced QuickDraw Contours, which enables builders to create maps of their lakes with all processing and storage taking place right on the device. We recently enhanced QuickDraw by offering a community feature called QuickDraw Community, which is a free, cloud-based, mapping platform for sharing user-generated HD mapping content. We believe QuickDraw community will positively impact customer engagement and will expand the availability of HD mapping content, particularly on smaller fishing lakes.
Turning next to Aviation, revenue grew 6% over the prior year as we experienced growth in both OEM and ADS-B systems. Growth in operating margin remained strong at 74% and 28%, respectively, resulting in a 13% increase in operating income. During the quarter, the G3000-equipped Piper M600 received Type Certification, and we are pleased to be the avionics provider for this aircraft. As we continue into the back half of 2016, we will focus on a number of additional certifications, including the aftermarket G5000 system for the Beechjet 400A and the Hawker 400XP. 
We announced several new products and product enhancements at the Oshkosh Air Show taking place this week. One such announcement is the Flight Stream 510, which is a multimode, wireless radio system built into a multimedia card, which also includes storage for a variety of flight databases. The Flight Stream 510 is important because it simplifies the task of updating flight databases by leveraging the connectivity of a smartphone or a tablet. Flight Stream 510 also shares flight plans, traffic, weather and position information with smartphones and tablets running our Garmin pilot and mobile app. Flight Stream 510 significantly enhances the ability to incorporate consumer devices in the cockpit.
Looking finally at the Auto segment. Revenues were down 18% in the quarter, primarily due to the ongoing PND market contraction and headwinds caused by revenue deferrals associated with certain auto OEM programs. Gross margin came in at 46%, and operating margin expanded to 16%. We remain strategically focused on new opportunities in the auto OEM market. While we are typically thought of as a navigation and infotainment supplier, we are also leveraging our competencies in other technologies such as cameras and driver assistance to extend our ability to serve the market. At the recent 2016 Beijing Auto Show, Peugeot showcased its model 3008, which includes a factory-installed digital video recorder designed and manufactured by Garmin. 
So in summary, we are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2016, and we believe we are well positioned for the remainder of the year. With this in mind, we are raising our projected revenue for the year to $2.9 billion, up approximately 3% over 2015. We are projecting gross margin of 55% and operating margin of 19% for the full year. Factoring in an effective tax rate of approximately 19.5%, pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.50. 
Looking at our outlook by segment. We have increased growth expectations for Fitness and Outdoor to 20% for the year. Aviation and Marine are unchanged, while the outlook for Auto has been reduced slightly based on current market trends. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results."

I'd like to begin by reviewing our second quarter results and move to comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement.

I'd like to begin by reviewing our second quarter results and move to comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. 
We posted revenue of $812 million for the second quarter, representing a 5% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 57%, a 280 basis point increase from the prior year, driven primarily by segment and product mix. Operating expense as a percent of sales was 32.3%, a 40 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $201 million, a 20% increase with the prior year. Operating margin was 24.7%, a 320 basis point increase in the prior year. The effective tax rate was 21% in the current quarter, which was comparable to the effective tax rate of 20.6% in the prior year quarter. Our GAAP EPS was $0.85, 18% growth for the prior quarter, our pro forma EPS was $0.87, a 21% growth the prior year quarter. We'll discuss gross margin, operating expenses in more detail later.
Next, we look at second quarter revenue by segment. During the second quarter, we had growth in 4 of our 5 segments, led by robust double-digit growth in our Fitness and Outdoor segments and single-digit growth in our Marine and Aviation segments. Collectively, these 4 segments were up 20% compared to the prior year quarter. 
Looking next at second quarter revenue charts. Auto segment represented 30% of our total second quarter 2016 revenue compared to 39% in the second quarter 2015. Fitness grew to 26% of revenue in the current period compared to 21% in the prior year, while Outdoor grew from 14% to 17%. As you see from the chart, it illustrates our profit mix by segment. Outdoor, Fitness, Marine and Aviation collectively delivered 80% of operating income in the second quarter of 2016. Fitness operating income as a percentage of total operating income increased from 20% to 27%, and Outdoor increased from 22% to 24%. 
Looking at year-over-year gross margin by segment. All segments posted gross margin rate increase due to shifts in product mix. Total corporate operating margin increased from 21.5% to 24.7% due to gross margin improvement. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Second quarter operating expense increased by about $10 million or 4%. Research and development increased $5 million year-over-year, was flat as a percent of sales. We continue to invest in innovation of increasing resources, focused primarily on Aviation, Fitness and Outdoor. Our advertising expense decreased $1.5 million from the prior year quarter, representing 5.5% of sales, 50 basis point decrease. Additional advertising spend and Fitness was more than offset by decreases in Auto and Marine. SG&A was up $6 million compared to prior year quarter, increasing 170 basis points as a percent of sales to 12.8%. Increase in SG&A were driven primarily by expenses associated with the addition of the DeLorme business and compensation-related costs.
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of about $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable increased both sequentially and year-over-year to $510 million. Inventory balance decreased sequentially to $508 million. As we exit the seasonally strong second quarter, it remains high year-over-year due to new product offerings. For the second quarter of 2016, we generated free cash flow of $135 million, a $71 million increase for the second quarter of 2015. Also, during the quarter, we paid dividends of approximately $97 million, repurchased about $25 million of company stock, approximately $123 million remaining for purchase December 2016. As Cliff mentioned, we're updating our tax guidance and anticipated full year tax rate of approximately 19.5%. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Jamie, could you open the lines for Q&A? Thanks."

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported second quarter results, highlighted by both revenue and EPS growth. Consolidated revenue increased 5% year-over-year, with fitness, outdoor, marine and aviation collectively growing 20%, while contributing 70% of the total revenue in the quarter. Each of our business segments produced strong results, which I will highlight shortly. 
Gross margin expanded to 57% from 54.2% in the prior year as new products and margin improvement efforts made a clear impact on our business. Operating margin expanded to 24.7% from 21.5% in the prior year, and operating income grew 20% on a consolidated basis. These strong results generated $0.85 of GAAP EPS. Pro forma EPS came in at $0.87, an increase of 21% over the year-ago quarter.
Wearable products were a major contributor to our strong second quarter performance. Over the past year, we have expanded our wearable product portfolio with the goal of offering a wearable device for a wide range of active lifestyles. As part of this effort, we've been pursuing 2 important objectives. First, we've been expanding the availability of Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology across our wearable product lines. Garmin Elevate is now available in multiple models of our running products, in our activity trackers and in our fenix series of outdoor adventure watches. Customers have embraced Garmin Elevate, and the feedback we are receiving is very positive. 
The second important objective is to increase customer engagement by offering applications, widgets and watch faces to our Connect IQ app store. Momentum in the app store continues to build as we now offer over 2,000 apps, watch faces and widgets, and we have surpassed 13 million downloads from the store since its launch early last year. 
While I'm pleased with the progress we've made so far, there is certainly much more to do. We remain focus on a strong product road map and building engagement through Connect IQ and our Garmin Connect community. 
Looking now at segment highlights. Our Fitness segment experienced robust revenue growth of 34% on a year-over-year basis, driven by growth within all product categories. Gross margin came in at 56%, and operating margin was 25%, an expansion of more than 400 basis points over the prior year. This generated operating income growth of 60% in the quarter. 
Recent new product launches include the Forerunner 735XT, a lightweight, multisport running watch; and the vívosmart HR+, which adds GPS capability to our smart activity tracker. As a result of these and many other recent product releases, we estimate that our share of the GPS-enabled smart wearable market in the United States has grown from approximately 43% a year ago to approximately 57% today, according to market share data. During the quarter, we also introduced the vívomove, a fashionable analogue watch with activity tracking features and a 1-year battery life. 
Looking next at Outdoor, which also experienced robust growth. Revenue increased 23% year-over-year on strong demand for our outdoor wearables and a full quarter contribution of DeLorme sales. The Outdoor segment generated strong gross and operating margins of 64% and 36%, respectively, representing an expansion over the prior year. Operating income grew 31% over the year-ago quarter. 
One of the many benefits of our business model is the ability to share product platforms, technologies and components across multiple market segments. Recent examples include the Approach X40, a GPS-based activity tracker with Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology and a built-in database of over 40,000 golf courses providing distance to the front, middle and back of the green. We also introduced our next-generation dog tracker, the Astro 430, which, when paired to a DriveTrack 70 TND, can track up to 20 dogs from a vehicle. The Astro 430 can also pair with the fenix 3 wearable for convenient tracking and alerts at the wrist. 
Looking next at marine. Revenue increased 8% over a very strong quarter in the prior year. Gross margin increased 58% -- to 58% in the quarter, excuse me, while operating margin expanded to 26%. Operating income grew 19% in the quarter. Our new fishfinders have been well-received, and we have grown our share in the inland fishing market. Earlier in the year, we introduced QuickDraw Contours, which enables builders to create maps of their lakes with all processing and storage taking place right on the device. We recently enhanced QuickDraw by offering a community feature called QuickDraw Community, which is a free, cloud-based mapping platform for sharing user-generated HD mapping content. We believe QuickDraw community will positively impact customer engagement and will expand the availability of HD mapping content, particularly on smaller fishing lakes.
Turning next to Aviation, revenue grew 6% over the prior year as we experienced growth in both OEM and ADS-B systems. Gross and operating margin remained strong at 74% and 28%, respectively, resulting in a 13% increase in operating income. During the quarter, the G3000-equipped Piper M600 received Type Certification, and we are pleased to be the avionics provider for this aircraft. As we continue into the back half of 2016, we will focus on a number of additional certifications, including the aftermarket G5000 system for the Beechjet 400A and the Hawker 400XP. 
We announced several new products and product enhancements at the Oshkosh Air Show taking place this week. One such announcement is the Flight Stream 510, which is a multimode, wireless radio system built into a multimedia card, which also includes storage for a variety of flight databases. The Flight Stream 510 is important because it simplifies the task of updating flight databases by leveraging the connectivity of a smartphone or a tablet. Flight Stream 510 also shares flight plans, traffic, weather and position information with smartphones and tablets running our Garmin pilot and mobile app. Flight Stream 510 significantly enhances the ability to incorporate consumer devices in the cockpit.
Looking finally at the Auto segment. Revenues were down 18% in the quarter, primarily due to the ongoing PND market contraction and headwinds caused by revenue deferrals associated with certain auto OEM programs. Gross margin came in at 46%, and operating margin expanded to 16%. We remain strategically focused on new opportunities in the auto OEM market. While we are typically thought of as a navigation and infotainment supplier, we are also leveraging our competencies in other technologies such as cameras and driver assistance to expand our ability to serve the market. At the recent 2016 Beijing Auto Show Peugeot showcased its model 3008, which includes a factory-installed digital video recorder designed and manufactured by Garmin. 
So in summary, we are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2016, and we believe we are well positioned for the remainder of the year. With this in mind, we are raising our projected revenue for the year to $2.9 billion, up approximately 3% over 2015. We are projecting gross margin of 55% and operating margin of 19% for the full year. Factoring in an effective tax rate of approximately 19.5%, pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.50. 
Looking at our outlook by segment. We have increased growth expectations for Fitness and Outdoor to 20% for the year, aviation and Marine are unchanged, while the outlook for Auto has been reduced slightly based on current market trends. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results."

I'd like to begin by reviewing our second quarter results and move to comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We posted revenue of $812 million for the second quarter, representing a 5% increase year",616,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by reviewing our second quarter results and move to comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. 
We posted revenue of $812 million for the second quarter, representing a 5% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 57%, a 280 basis point increase from the prior year, driven primarily by segment and product mix. Operating expense as a percent of sales was 32.3%, a 40 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $201 million, a 20% increase with the prior year. Operating margin was 24.7%, a 320 basis point increase in the prior year. The effective tax rate was 21% in the current quarter, which was comparable to the effective tax rate of 20.6% in the prior year quarter. Our GAAP EPS was $0.85, 18% growth over the prior quarter, our pro forma EPS was $0.87, a 21% growth over the prior year quarter. We'll discuss gross margin, operating expenses in more detail later.
Next, we look at second quarter revenue by segment. During the second quarter, we had growth in 4 of our 5 segments, led by robust double-digit growth in our Fitness and Outdoor segments and single-digit growth in our Marine and Aviation segments. Collectively, these 4 segments were up 20% compared to the prior year quarter. 
Looking next at second quarter revenue charts. Auto segment represented 30% of our total second quarter 2016 revenue, compared to 39% in the second quarter 2015. Fitness grew to 26% of revenue in the current period compared to 21% in the prior year, while Outdoor grew from 14% to 17%. As you see from the chart, it illustrates our profit mix by segment. Outdoor, Fitness, Marine and Aviation collectively delivered 80% of operating income in the second quarter of 2016. Fitness operating income, as a percentage of total operating income, increased from 20% to 27%, and Outdoor increased from 22% to 24%. 
Looking at year-over-year gross margin by segment. All segments posted gross margin rate increase due to shifts in product mix. Total corporate operating margin increased from 21.5% to 24.7% due to gross margin improvement. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Second quarter operating expense increased by about $10 million or 4%. Research and development increased $5 million year-over-year, was flat as a percent of sales. We continue to invest in innovation by increasing resources, focused primarily on Aviation, Fitness and Outdoor. Our advertising expense decreased $1.5 million from the prior year quarter, representing 5.5% of sales, 50 basis point decrease. Additional advertising spend in Fitness was more than offset by decreases in Auto and Marine. SG&A was up $6 million compared to prior year quarter, increasing 170 basis points as a percent of sales to 12.8%. Increase in SG&A were driven primarily by expenses associated with the addition of the DeLorme business and compensation-related costs.
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of about $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable increased both sequentially and year-over-year to $510 million. Inventory balance decreased sequentially to $508 million. As we exit the seasonally strong second quarter, it remains higher year-over-year due to new product offerings. During the second quarter of 2016, we generated free cash flow of $135 million, a $71 million increase over the second quarter of 2015. Also, during the quarter, we paid dividends of approximately $97 million, repurchased about $25 million of company stock, approximately $123 million remaining for purchase December 2016. As Cliff mentioned, we're updating our tax guidance, now anticipated full year tax rate of approximately 19.5%. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Jamie, could you open the lines for Q&A? Thanks."

As it relates to expenses, a couple of things to think about expense in the back half, the first of which is relating to acquisitions. DeLorme will have full 2 quarters of expenses late into the DeLorme acquisition, as well as, in 2016, this is the year we have a 53rd week.

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported second quarter results, highlighted by both revenue and EPS growth. Consolidated revenue increased 5% year-over-year, with fitness, outdoor, marine and aviation collectively growing 20%, while contributing 70% of the total revenue in the quarter. Each of our business segments produced strong results, which I will highlight shortly. 
Gross margin expanded to 57% from 54.2% in the prior year as new products and margin improvement efforts made a clear impact on our business. Operating margin expanded to 24.7% from 21.5% in the prior year, and operating income grew 20% on a consolidated basis. These strong results generated $0.85 of GAAP EPS. Pro forma EPS came in at $0.87, an increase of 21% over the year-ago quarter.
Wearable products were a major contributor to our strong second quarter performance. Over the past year, we have expanded our wearable product portfolio with the goal of offering a wearable device for a wide range of active lifestyles. As part of this effort, we've been pursuing 2 important objectives. First, we've been expanding the availability of Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology across our wearable product lines. Garmin Elevate is now available in multiple models of our running products, in our activity trackers and in our fenix series of outdoor adventure watches. Customers have embraced Garmin Elevate, and the feedback we are receiving is very positive. 
The second important objective is to increase customer engagement by offering applications, widgets and watch faces to our Connect IQ app store. Momentum in the app store continues to build as we now offer over 2,000 apps, watch faces and widgets, and we have surpassed 13 million downloads from the store since its launch early last year. 
While I'm pleased with the progress we've made so far, there is certainly much more to do. We remain focus on a strong product road map and building engagement through Connect IQ and our Garmin Connect community. 
Looking now at segment highlights. Our Fitness segment experienced robust revenue growth of 34% on a year-over-year basis, driven by growth within all product categories. Gross margin came in at 56%, and operating margin was 25%, an expansion of more than 400 basis points over the prior year. This generated operating income growth of 60% in the quarter. 
Recent new product launches include the Forerunner 735XT, a lightweight, multisport running watch; and the vívosmart HR+, which adds GPS capability to our smart activity tracker. As a result of these and many other recent product releases, we estimate that our share of the GPS-enabled smart wearable market in the United States has grown from approximately 43% a year ago to approximately 57% today, according to market share data. During the quarter, we also introduced the vívomove, a fashionable analogue watch with activity tracking features and a 1-year battery life. 
Looking next at Outdoor, which also experienced robust growth. Revenue increased 23% year-over-year on strong demand for our outdoor wearables and a full quarter contribution of DeLorme sales. The Outdoor segment generated strong gross and operating margins of 64% and 36%, respectively, representing an expansion over the prior year. Operating income grew 31% over the year-ago quarter. 
One of the many benefits of our business model is the ability to share product platforms, technologies and components across multiple market segments. Recent examples include the Approach X40, a GPS-based activity tracker with Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology and a built-in database of over 40,000 golf courses providing distance to the front, middle and back of the green. We also introduced our next-generation dog tracker, the Astro 430, which, when paired to a DriveTrack 70 TND, can track up to 20 dogs from a vehicle. The Astro 430 can also pair with the fenix 3 wearable for convenient tracking and alerts at the wrist. 
Looking next at marine. Revenue increased 8% over a very strong quarter in the prior year. Gross margin increased 58% -- to 58% in the quarter, excuse me, while operating margin expanded to 26%. Operating income grew 19% in the quarter. Our new fishfinders have been well-received, and we have grown our share in the inland fishing market. Earlier in the year, we introduced QuickDraw Contours, which enables builders to create maps of their lakes with all processing and storage taking place right on the device. We recently enhanced QuickDraw by offering a community feature called QuickDraw Community, which is a free, cloud-based mapping platform for sharing user-generated HD mapping content. We believe QuickDraw community will positively impact customer engagement and will expand the availability of HD mapping content, particularly on smaller fishing lakes.
Turning next to Aviation, revenue grew 6% over the prior year as we experienced growth in both OEM and ADS-B systems. Gross and operating margin remained strong at 74% and 28%, respectively, resulting in a 13% increase in operating income. During the quarter, the G3000-equipped Piper M600 received Type Certification, and we are pleased to be the avionics provider for this aircraft. As we continue into the back half of 2016, we will focus on a number of additional certifications, including the aftermarket G5000 system for the Beechjet 400A and the Hawker 400XP. 
We announced several new products and product enhancements at the Oshkosh Air Show taking place this week. One such announcement is the Flight Stream 510, which is a multimode, wireless radio system built into a multimedia card, which also includes storage for a variety of flight databases. The Flight Stream 510 is important because it simplifies the task of updating flight databases by leveraging the connectivity of a smartphone or a tablet. Flight Stream 510 also shares flight plans, traffic, weather and position information with smartphones and tablets running our Garmin pilot and mobile app. Flight Stream 510 significantly enhances the ability to incorporate consumer devices in the cockpit.
Looking finally at the Auto segment. Revenues were down 18% in the quarter, primarily due to the ongoing PND market contraction and headwinds caused by revenue deferrals associated with certain auto OEM programs. Gross margin came in at 46%, and operating margin expanded to 16%. We remain strategically focused on new opportunities in the auto OEM market. While we are typically thought of as a navigation and infotainment supplier, we are also leveraging our competencies in other technologies such as cameras and driver assistance to expand our ability to serve the market. At the recent 2016 Beijing Auto Show Peugeot showcased its model 3008, which includes a factory-installed digital video recorder designed and manufactured by Garmin. 
So in summary, we are pleased with our performance in the first half of 2016, and we believe we are well positioned for the remainder of the year. With this in mind, we are raising our projected revenue for the year to $2.9 billion, up approximately 3% over 2015. We are projecting gross margin of 55% and operating margin of 19% for the full year. Factoring in an effective tax rate of approximately 19.5%, pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.50. 
Looking at our outlook by segment. We have increased growth expectations for Fitness and Outdoor to 20% for the year, aviation and Marine are unchanged, while the outlook for Auto has been reduced slightly based on current market trends. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results."

I'd like to begin by reviewing our second quarter results and move to comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement.

I'd like to begin by reviewing our second quarter results and move to comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. 
We posted revenue of $812 million for the second quarter, representing a 5% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 57%, a 280 basis point increase from the prior year, driven primarily by segment and product mix. Operating expense as a percent of sales was 32.3%, a 40 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $201 million, a 20% increase with the prior year. Operating margin was 24.7%, a 320 basis point increase in the prior year. The effective tax rate was 21% in the current quarter, which was comparable to the effective tax rate of 20.6% in the prior year quarter. Our GAAP EPS was $0.85, 18% growth over the prior quarter, our pro forma EPS was $0.87, a 21% growth over the prior year quarter. We'll discuss gross margin, operating expenses in more detail later.
Next, we look at second quarter revenue by segment. During the second quarter, we had growth in 4 of our 5 segments, led by robust double-digit growth in our Fitness and Outdoor segments and single-digit growth in our Marine and Aviation segments. Collectively, these 4 segments were up 20% compared to the prior year quarter. 
Looking next at second quarter revenue charts. Auto segment represented 30% of our total second quarter 2016 revenue, compared to 39% in the second quarter 2015. Fitness grew to 26% of revenue in the current period compared to 21% in the prior year, while Outdoor grew from 14% to 17%. As you see from the chart, it illustrates our profit mix by segment. Outdoor, Fitness, Marine and Aviation collectively delivered 80% of operating income in the second quarter of 2016. Fitness operating income, as a percentage of total operating income, increased from 20% to 27%, and Outdoor increased from 22% to 24%. 
Looking at year-over-year gross margin by segment. All segments posted gross margin rate increase due to shifts in product mix. Total corporate operating margin increased from 21.5% to 24.7% due to gross margin improvement. 
Looking next at operating expenses. Second quarter operating expense increased by about $10 million or 4%. Research and development increased $5 million year-over-year, was flat as a percent of sales. We continue to invest in innovation by increasing resources, focused primarily on Aviation, Fitness and Outdoor. Our advertising expense decreased $1.5 million from the prior year quarter, representing 5.5% of sales, 50 basis point decrease. Additional advertising spend in Fitness was more than offset by decreases in Auto and Marine. SG&A was up $6 million compared to prior year quarter, increasing 170 basis points as a percent of sales to 12.8%. Increase in SG&A were driven primarily by expenses associated with the addition of the DeLorme business and compensation-related costs.
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of about $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable increased both sequentially and year-over-year to $510 million. Inventory balance decreased sequentially to $508 million. As we exit the seasonally strong second quarter, it remains higher year-over-year due to new product offerings. During the second quarter of 2016, we generated free cash flow of $135 million, a $71 million increase over the second quarter of 2015. Also, during the quarter, we paid dividends of approximately $97 million, repurchased about $25 million of company stock, approximately $123 million remaining for purchase December 2016. As Cliff mentioned, we're updating our tax guidance, now anticipated full year tax rate of approximately 19.5%. 
This concludes our formal remarks. Jamie, could you open the lines for Q&A? Thanks."

In terms of growth in margins, certainly, we've been on a deliberate effort to improve our margins across all of our business segments.

We think that's probably going to be Fitness gross margins full year probably in the low 50s. As it relates to expenses, a couple of things to think about expense in the back half, the first of which is relating to acquisitions. DeLorme will have full 2 quarters of expenses late into the DeLorme acquisition, as well as, in 2016, this is the year we have a 53rd week. So we have 1 extra week of expenses in 2016 compared to the previous years.

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported third quarter results highlighted by both revenue and EPS growth with 4 of our 5 business segments delivering double-digit sales growth and increased profitability. C",954,"Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin reported third quarter results highlighted by both revenue and EPS growth with 4 of our 5 business segments delivering double-digit sales growth and increased profitability. Consolidated revenue increased 6% year-over-year with fitness, outdoor, marine and aviation collectively growing 24%, while contributing 70% of total revenue and 84% of total operating income in the quarter. Each of our business segments produced strong results, which I will highlight shortly.
Gross margin expanded to 56.2% from 53.3% in the prior year as sales shifted towards products with higher margin profiles. Operating margin expanded to 22.1% from 18.5% in the prior year, and operating income grew 27% on a consolidated basis. These strong results generated $0.66 of GAAP EPS. Pro forma EPS came in at $0.75, an increase of 47% over the prior year.
Wearable products were a major contributor to our strong third quarter performance, and we continue to expand into new product categories with the launch of vivofit junior and the fenix Chronos. 
Net sale highlights segment-specific results and initiatives. 
Starting with fitness, revenue increased 32% year-over-year, led by strong demand for our wearables. Gross margin came in at 55% and operating margin was 24%, an expansion of more than 500 basis points over the prior year.  Operating income grew 68% in the quarter. 
During the quarter, we expanded our market with the launch of vívofit Jr. This activity tracker is designed specifically for kids with colorful one-piece band that fits comfortably on a child's risk. Vívofit Jr. shares many of the unique differentiators of our vívofit line, such as an Always on Display, fully waterproof design and 1-year battery life, while adding a compelling parent control mobile app that helps motivate kids to stay active. 
We also launched the 435, bringing Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology to our entry-level running product line. The 435 features GPS, multiple activity profiles, smart alerts and the new high resolution display that's perfect for both indoor and outdoor use. 
In the corporate health market, we've recently announced partnership with Cerner, a Health Information Technology company. Through this partnership, Garmin will provide devices to capture powerful health and wellness data that can be integrated into Cerner's wellness and population health solutions. 
Looking at the Outdoor. Revenue increased 28% year-over-year on strong demand for our outdoor wearables and contributions from our recently acquired DeLorme subsidiary. The Outdoor segment generated strong growth in operating margins of 63% and 35%, respectively, and operating income grew 32% over the year-ago quarter. 
We recently launched the Fenix Chronos, our first operating in the luxury watch category. The Fenix Chronos line is crafted from premium jewelers great materials and is designed to look spectacular in business, social or personal setting without sacrificing the rugged multisport capabilities associated with our brand. We continue to invest in our traditional outdoor product lines as evidenced by the recent launch of the Rino 700 series, which features a 3-inch multitouch display and Bluetooth connectivity for realtime weather and precision reporting.
Looking next at Marine. Revenue increased 12% year-over-year, driven by growth in multiple product lines and led by strong demand for our fish liners. Gross margin increased to 57% in the quarter, while operating margin expanded to 15%. Operating income grew 80% in the quarter. 
For the second consecutive year, we were recognized by the National Marine Electronics Association as Manufacturer of The Year. This award, along with 7 product of excellence awards, confirms our dedication to designing, manufacturing and selling industry-leading products for the marine market. In addition, at the International Boat Builders Exhibition, we received an innovation award for our recently launched Phantom solid-state radar.
Turning next to Aviation. Revenue grew 14% over the prior year as we experienced growth in both OEM and aftermarket product categories. Growth in operating margins remain strong at 75% and 28%, respectively, resulting in a 28% increase in operating income. 
During the quarter, we received certification of the G5000 equipment Beechjet 400A and began deliveries of this system to installers. We announced earlier this week that we were developing a G5000 integrated flight deck upgrade for the citation excel and the XLS. This upgrade will feature 3-high resolution displays, a modern fully digital flight control system and enhanced safety features. We expect to  receive certification in this system in late 2018. 
Looking finally at the Auto segments. Revenue were down 21% in the quarter, primarily due to the ongoing market contraction and headwinds caused by revenue deferrals associated with certain auto OEM programs. 
Gross margin came in at 44% and operating margin was consistent year-over-year at 12%. While the PND market continues to decline, our global market share remains strong.
During the quarter, we launch our latest action camera in the VIRB Ultra 30. This new action camera at net 30 frames per second. The VIRB Ultra 30 also includes first smart market features, such as voice control, color LCD with touch screen, one touch live streaming and our G metric sensors. 
Finally, with 3 quarters of the year behind us, we are raising our projected revenue for the year to 2.95 billion, up approximately 5% over 2015. We are projecting gross margin of approximately 55% and operating income of approximately 580 million for the year. 
Factoring in an effective tax rate of approximately 18.5%, pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.65. 
Looking at our guidance by segment. We have increased year-over-year growth expectations by roughly 200 to 400 basis points for all segments, except auto, where we are holding our guidance of down 17% for the year. 
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results and move to comments from the balanced sheet and cash flow statement. We posted revenue of $722 million for our third quarter, representing 6% increase year-over-y",633,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results and move to comments from the balanced sheet and cash flow statement. 
We posted revenue of $722 million for our third quarter, representing 6% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 56.2%, a 290 [ph] basis points increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percent, digital sales was 34.1%, a 70-basis-point decrease from the prior year. 
Operating income was $160 million, a 28% increase over the prior year.  Operating margin was 22.1%, a 360-basis-point-increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.66, a 6% growth over the prior quarter. Our pro forma EPS was $0.75, a 47% growth over the prior quarter. We'll discuss gross margin, operating expenses in more detail later.
Next, we will look at third quarter revenue by segment. For the third quarter, we achieved double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments, led by robust growth in our Fitness and Outdoor segments and solid growth in Marine and Aviation segments. Collectively, these 4 segments were up 24% compared to the prior-year quarter.
Looking next to third quarter revenue charts. Our auto segment represented 30% of our total third quarter 2016 revenue compared to 40% in the third quarter of 2015. Fitness grew to 26% of revenue in the current period compared to 21% in the prior year, while Outdoor grew to 19% from 16%. As you can see from the chart illustrated our profit next by segment. Outdoor, fitness, marine and aviation collectively delivered 84% of operating income at third quarter 2016. 
Fitness operating income as a percentage of total operating income increased from 21% to 28%, and outdoor increased from 29% to 31%. 
Looking at year-over-year gross margin by segment. All segments posted gross margin rate increase as sales shifted toward products with higher margin profiles. Total corporate operating margin increased from 18.5% to 22.1%, primarily due to gross margin improvement.
Looking next at operating expenses. Third quarter operating expense increased by approximately $9 million or 4%. Research and development increased $10 million year-over-year, but was flat as a percent of sales. We continue to invest in innovation by increasing resources, focused, primarily on aviation, fitness and outdoor. 
Our advertising expense decreased $4 million from the prior quarter, representing 4.6% of sales, a 90-basis-point decrease. The decrease in advertising was primarily in auto. We expect our fourth quarter advertising spend to increase both sequentially and year-over-year to support our wearable products. 
SG&A was up $3 million compared to prior quarter, however, decreased 40 basis points and a percent of sales to 13.4%. The increase in SG&A, which were driven primarily by expenses associated with the addition of the DeLorme business.
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities over $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially as a result of seasonally lower sales in the third quarter, but increased year-over-year to $461 million from stronger sales. Inventory balance increased sequentially to $535 million compared for the fourth quarter remains higher year-over-year due to new product offerings. 
For the third quarter of 2016, we generated free cash flow of 199's million, a 75's million increase for the third quarter of 2015. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of approximately $96 million, repurchased approximately 20's million of company stock. We have roughly $103 million remaining in share repurchase program as authorized through December 31, 2016. We expect to repurchase as business market conditions warrant. Effective tax rate was 16.5% in the current quarter compared to 27.6% in the prior quarter.  The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily due to projected income mix by jurisdiction compared to prior year. This concludes our formal remarks. Ester, could you please open the lines for Q&A?"

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported third quarter results highlighted by both revenue and EPS growth with 4 of our 5 business segments delivering double-digit sales growth and increased profitability. C",953,"Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin reported third quarter results highlighted by both revenue and EPS growth with 4 of our 5 business segments delivering double-digit sales growth and increased profitability. Consolidated revenue increased 6% year-over-year with fitness, outdoor, marine and aviation collectively growing 24%, while contributing 70% of total revenue and 84% of total operating income in the quarter. Each of our business segments produced strong results, which I will highlight shortly.
Gross margin expanded to 56.2% from 53.3% in the prior year as sales shifted towards products with higher margin profiles. Operating margin expanded to 22.1% from 18.5% in the prior year, and operating income grew 27% on a consolidated basis. These strong results generated $0.66 of GAAP EPS. Pro forma EPS came in at $0.75, an increase of 47% over the prior year.
Wearable products were a major contributor to our strong third quarter performance, and we continue to expand into new product categories with the launch of Vivofit Jr. and the Fenix Chronos. 
Next, I'll highlight segment-specific results and initiatives. 
Starting with fitness, revenue increased 32% year-over-year, led by strong demand for our wearables. Gross margin came in at 55% and operating margin was 24%, an expansion of more than 500 basis points over the prior year. Operating income grew 68% in the quarter.
During the quarter, we expanded our market with the launch of the Vivofit Jr. This activity tracker is designed, specifically, for kids with colorful one-piece band that fits comfortably on a child's wrist. Vivofit Jr. shares many of the unique differentiators of our Vivofit line, such as an always-on-display, fully waterproof design and 1-year battery life, while adding a compelling parent control mobile app that helps motivate kids to stay active.
We also launched the 435, bringing Garmin Elevate wrist heart rate technology to our entry-level running product line. The 435 features GPS, multiple activity profiles, smart alerts and a new high resolution display that is perfect for both indoor and outdoor use. In the corporate health market, we've recently announced partnership with Cerner, a Health Information Technology company. Through this partnership, Garmin will provide devices that capture powerful health and wellness data that could be integrated into Cerner's Wellness and Population Health Solutions.
Looking next at Outdoor. Revenue increased 28% year-over-year on strong demand for our outdoor wearables and contributions from our recently acquired DeLorme subsidiary. The Outdoor segment generated strong growth in operating margins of 63% and 35%, respectively, and operating income grew 32% over the year-ago quarter. 
We recently launched the Fenix Chronos, our first operating in the luxury watch category. The Fenix Chronos line is crafted from premium jewelers grade materials, and is designed to look spectacular in business, social or personal setting without sacrificing the rugged multisport capabilities associated with our brand. We continue to invest in our traditional outdoor product lines as evidenced by the recent launch of the Rino 700 series, which features a 3-inch multitouch display and Bluetooth connectivity for realtime weather and position reporting.
Looking next at Marine. Revenue increased 12% year-over-year, driven by growth in multiple product lines and led by strong demand for our fishfinders. Gross margin increased to 57% in the quarter, while operating margin expanded to 15%. Operating income grew 80% in the quarter.
For the second consecutive year, we were recognized by the National Marine Electronics Association as Manufacturer of The Year. This award, along with 7 products of excellence awards, confirms our dedication to designing, manufacturing and selling industry-leading products for the marine market. In addition, at the International Boat Builders Exhibition, we received an innovation award for our recently launched Phantom solid-state radar.
Turning next to Aviation. Revenue grew 14% over the prior year, as we experienced growth in both OEM and aftermarket product categories. Growth in operating margins remained strong at 75% and 28%, respectively, resulting in a 28% increase in operating income. During the quarter, we received certification of the G5000 equipped Beechjet 400A, and we began deliveries of this system to installers. We announced earlier this week that we were developing a G5000 integrated flight deck upgrade for the citation excel and the XLS. This upgrade will feature 3-high resolution displays, a modern fully digital flight control system and enhanced safety features. We expect to receive certification of this system in late 2018.
Looking finally at the Auto segments. Revenues were down 21% in the quarter, primarily due to the ongoing PND market contraction and headwinds caused by revenue deferrals associated with certain auto OEM programs. Gross margin came in at 44% and operating margin was consistent year-over-year at 12%. While the PND market continues to decline, our global market share remains strong.
During the quarter, we launched our latest action camera, the VIRB Ultra 30. This new action camera [Audio Gap] at 30 frames per second. The VIRB Ultra 30 also includes first-to-market features, such as voice control, color LCD with touch screen, one touch live streaming and our G metric sensors. 
Finally, with 3 quarters of the year behind us, we are raising our projected revenue for the year to $2.95 billion, up approximately 5% over 2015. We are projecting gross margin of approximately 55% and operating income of approximately $580 million for the year.  Factoring in an effective tax rate of approximately 18.5%, pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.65.
Looking at our guidance by segment, we have increased year-over-year growth expectations by roughly 200 to 400 basis points for all segments, except Auto, where we are holding our guidance of down 17% for the year.
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"
598655,403419388,1061844,"Garmin Ltd., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results and move to comments from the balanced sheet and cash flow statement. We posted revenue of $722 million for the third quarter, representing a 6% increase year-over",641,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results and move to comments from the balanced sheet and cash flow statement. 
We posted revenue of $722 million for the third quarter, representing a 6% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 56.2%, a 290 basis points increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percent each of sales was 34.1%, a 70 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $160 million, a 28% increase over the prior year.  Operating margin was 22.1%, a 360 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.66, a 6% growth the prior quarter. Our pro forma EPS was $0.75, a 47% growth the prior quarter. We'll discuss gross margin, operating expenses in more detail later.
Next, we will look at third quarter revenue by segment. For the third quarter, we achieved double-digit growth in 4 of our 5 segments, led by robust growth in our Fitness and Outdoor segments and solid growth in Marine and Aviation segments. Collectively, these 4 segments were up 24% compared to the prior-year quarter.
Looking next at the third quarter revenue charts. Auto segment represented 30% of our total third quarter 2016 revenue compared to 40% in the third quarter of 2015. Fitness grew to 26% of revenue in the current period compared to 21% in the prior year, while Outdoor grew to 19% from 16%. As you see from the chart, it illustrates our profit mix by segment. Outdoor, Fitness, Marine and Aviation collectively delivered 84% of operating income in third quarter of 2016.
Fitness operating income as a percentage of total operating income increased from 21% to 28%, and Outdoor increased from 29% to 31%. 
Looking at year-over-year gross margin by segment. All segments posted a gross margin rate increase as sales shifted toward products with higher margin profiles. Total corporate operating margin increased from 18.5% to 22.1%, primarily due to gross margin improvement.
Looking next at operating expenses. Third quarter operating expense increased by approximately $9 million or 4%. Research and development increased $10 million year-over-year, but was flat as a percent of sales. We continue to invest in innovation by increasing resources focused primarily on Aviation, Fitness and Outdoor 
Our advertising expense decreased $4 million from the prior quarter, representing 4.6% of sales, a 90 basis point decrease. The decrease in advertising was primarily in Auto. We expect our fourth quarter advertising spend to increase both sequentially and year-over-year to support our wearable products. 
SG&A was up $3 million compared to prior quarter; however, decreased 40 basis points as a percent of sales to 13.4%. The increase in SG&A was driven primarily by expenses associated with the addition of the DeLorme business.
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities over $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially as a result of seasonally lower sales in the third quarter, but increased year-over-year to $461 million from stronger sales. Inventory balance increased sequentially to $535 million, compared for the fourth quarter, remains higher year-over-year due to new product offerings.
For the third quarter of 2016, we generated free cash flow of $199 million, a $75 million increase for the third quarter of 2015. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of approximately $96 million, repurchased approximately $20 million of company stock. We have roughly $103 million remaining in share purchase program as authorized through December 31, 2016. We expect to repurchase as business and market conditions warrant. Effective tax rate was 16.5% in the current quarter compared to 27.6% in the prior quarter. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily due to projected income mix by jurisdiction compared to prior year. This concludes our formal remarks. Esther, could you please open the lines for Q&A?"

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported third quarter results, highlighted by both revenue and EPS growth, with 4 of our 5 business segments delivering double-digit sales growth and increased profitability.",952,"Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin reported third quarter results, highlighted by both revenue and EPS growth, with 4 of our 5 business segments delivering double-digit sales growth and increased profitability. Consolidated revenue increased 6% year-over-year with fitness, outdoor, marine and aviation collectively growing 24%, while contributing 70% of total revenue and 84% of total operating income in the quarter. Each of our business segments produced strong results, which I will highlight shortly.
Gross margin expanded to 56.2% from 53.3% in the prior year, as sales shifted towards products with higher margin profiles. Operating margin expanded to 22.1% from 18.5% in the prior year, and operating income grew 27% on a consolidated basis. These strong results generated $0.66 of GAAP EPS. Pro forma EPS came in at $0.75, an increase of 47% over the prior year.
Wearable products were a major contributor to our strong third quarter performance, and we continue to expand into new product categories with the launch of the vivofit Jr. and the fenix Chronos. 
Next, I'll highlight segment-specific results and initiatives. 
Starting with fitness, revenue increased 32% year-over-year, led by strong demand for our wearables. Gross margin came in at 55% and operating margin was 24%, an expansion of more than 500 basis points over the prior year. Operating income grew 68% in the quarter.
During the quarter, we expanded our market with the launch of the vivofit Jr. This activity tracker is designed specifically for kids with colorful one-piece band that fits comfortably on a child's wrist. vivofit Jr. shares many of the unique differentiators of our vivofit line, such as an always-on-display, fully waterproof design and 1-year battery life, while adding a compelling parent-controlled mobile app that helps motivate kids to stay active.
We also launched the Forerunner 35, bringing Garmin Elevate wrist heart-rate technology to our entry-level running product line. The Forerunner 35 features GPS, multiple activity profiles, smart alerts and a new high resolution display that is perfect for both indoor and outdoor use. 
In the corporate health market, we recently announced partnership with Cerner, a Health Information Technology company. Through this partnership, Garmin will provide devices that capture powerful health and wellness data that could be integrated into Cerner's Wellness and Population Health Solutions.
Looking next at Outdoor, revenue increased 28% year-over-year on strong demand for our outdoor wearables and contributions from our recently acquired DeLorme subsidiary. The Outdoor segment generated strong growth and operating margins of 63% and 35%, respectively, and operating income grew 32% over the year-ago quarter. 
We recently launched the fenix Chronos, our first operating in the luxury watch category. The fenix Chronos line is crafted from premium jewelers-grade materials, and is designed to look spectacular in business, social or personal setting without sacrificing the rugged multisport capabilities associated with our brand. We continue to invest in our traditional outdoor product lines, as evidenced by the recent launch of the Rino 700 series, which features a 3-inch multitouch display and Bluetooth connectivity for realtime weather and position reporting.
Looking next at Marine. Revenue increased 12% year-over-year, driven by growth in multiple product lines and led by strong demand for our fishfinders. Gross margin increased to 57% in the quarter, while operating margin expanded to 15%. Operating income grew 80% in the quarter.
For the second consecutive year, we were recognized by the National Marine Electronics Association as Manufacturer of The Year. This award, along with 7 Product of Excellence awards, confirms our dedication to designing, manufacturing and selling industry-leading products for the marine market. In addition, at the International Boat Builders Exhibition, we received an innovation award for our recently launched Fantom solid-state radar.
Turning next to Aviation, revenue grew 14% over the prior year, as we experienced growth in both OEM and aftermarket product categories. Gross and operating margins remained strong at 75% and 28%, respectively, resulting in a 28% increase in operating income. During the quarter, we received certification of the G5000-equipped Beechjet 400A, and we began deliveries of this system to installers. We announced earlier this week that we were developing a G5000 integrated flight deck upgrade for the Citation Excel and the XLS. This upgrade will feature 3-high resolution displays, a modern fully digital flight control system and enhanced safety features. We expect to receive certification of this system in late 2018.
Looking finally at the Auto segments, revenues were down 21% in the quarter, primarily due to the ongoing PND market contraction and headwinds caused by revenue deferrals associated with certain auto OEM programs. Gross margin came in at 44% and operating margin was consistent year-over-year at 12%. While the PND market continues to decline, our global market share remains strong.
During the quarter, we launched our latest action camera, the VIRB Ultra 30. This new action camera [Audio Gap] at 30 frames per second. The VIRB Ultra 30 also includes first-to-market features, such as voice control, color LCD with touch screen, one touch live streaming and our G metric sensors. 
Finally, with 3 quarters of the year behind us, we are raising our projected revenue for the year to $2.95 billion, up approximately 5% over 2015. We are projecting gross margin of approximately 55% and operating income of approximately $580 million for the year.  Factoring in an effective tax rate of approximately 18.5%, pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.65.
Looking at our guidance by segment, we have increased year-over-year growth expectations by roughly 200 to 400 basis points for all segments, except Auto, where we are holding our guidance of down 17% for the year.
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"

In the third quarter, we achieved double-digit growth in 4 out of 5 segments, led by robust growth in our Fitness and Outdoor segments and solid growth in Marine and Aviation segments. Collectively, these 4 segments were up 24% compared to the prior-year quarter.
Looking next at third quarter revenue charts. The Auto segment represented 30% of total third quarter 2016 revenue compared to 40% in the third quarter of 2015. Fitness grew to 26% of revenue in the current period compared to 21% the prior year, while Outdoor grew to 19% from 16%. As you see in the chart, it illustrates our profit mix by segment. Outdoor, Fitness, Marine and Aviation collectively delivered 84% of operating income in third quarter of 2016.
Fitness operating income as a percentage of total operating income increased from 21% to 28%, and Outdoor increased from 29% to 31%. 
Looking at year-over-year gross margin by segment. All segments posted a gross margin rate increase as sales shifted toward products with higher margin profiles. Total corporate operating margin increased from 18.5% to 22.1%, primarily due to gross margin improvement.
Looking next at operating expenses. Third quarter operating expense increased by approximately $9 million or 4%. Research and development increased $10 million year-over-year, but was flat as a percent of sales. We continue to invest in innovation by increasing resources focused primarily on Aviation, Fitness and Outdoor 
Our advertising expense decreased $4 million from the prior quarter, representing 4.6% of sales, a 90 basis point decrease. The decrease in advertising was primarily in Auto. We expect our fourth quarter advertising spend to increase both sequentially and year-over-year to support our wearable products. 
SG&A was up $3 million compared to the prior quarter, however decreased 40 basis points as a percent of sales to 13.4%. The increase in SG&A was driven primarily by expenses associated with the addition of the DeLorme business.
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities over $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially as a result of seasonally lower sales in the third quarter, but increased year-over-year to $461 million from stronger sales. Inventory balance increased sequentially to $535 million, to prepare [ph] for the fourth quarter, remains higher year-over-year due to new product offerings.
In the third quarter of 2016, we generated free cash flow of $199 million, a $75 million increase from the third quarter of 2015. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of approximately $96 million, repurchased approximately $20 million of company stock. We have roughly $103 million remaining in share purchase program as authorized through December 31, 2016. We expect to repurchase as business and market conditions warrant. Effective tax rate was 16.5% in the current quarter compared to 27.6% in the prior quarter. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily due to projected income mix by jurisdiction compared to prior year. This concludes our formal remarks. Esther, could you please open the lines for Q&A?"

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported third quarter results, highlighted by both revenue and EPS growth, with 4 of our 5 business segments delivering double-digit sales growth and increased profitability.",952,"Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin reported third quarter results, highlighted by both revenue and EPS growth, with 4 of our 5 business segments delivering double-digit sales growth and increased profitability. Consolidated revenue increased 6% year-over-year with fitness, outdoor, marine and aviation collectively growing 24%, while contributing 70% of total revenue and 84% of total operating income in the quarter. Each of our business segments produced strong results, which I will highlight shortly.
Gross margin expanded to 56.2% from 53.3% in the prior year, as sales shifted towards products with higher margin profiles. Operating margin expanded to 22.1% from 18.5% in the prior year, and operating income grew 27% on a consolidated basis. These strong results generated $0.66 of GAAP EPS. Pro forma EPS came in at $0.75, an increase of 47% over the prior year.
Wearable products were a major contributor to our strong third quarter performance, and we continue to expand into new product categories with the launch of the vivofit Jr. and the fenix Chronos. 
Next, I'll highlight segment-specific results and initiatives. 
Starting with fitness, revenue increased 32% year-over-year, led by strong demand for our wearables. Gross margin came in at 55% and operating margin was 24%, an expansion of more than 500 basis points over the prior year. Operating income grew 68% in the quarter.
During the quarter, we expanded our market with the launch of the vivofit Jr. This activity tracker is designed specifically for kids with colorful one-piece band that fits comfortably on a child's wrist. vivofit Jr. shares many of the unique differentiators of our vivofit line, such as an always-on-display, fully waterproof design and 1-year battery life, while adding a compelling parent-controlled mobile app that helps motivate kids to stay active.
We also launched the Forerunner 35, bringing Garmin Elevate wrist heart-rate technology to our entry-level running product line. The Forerunner 35 features GPS, multiple activity profiles, smart alerts and a new high resolution display that is perfect for both indoor and outdoor use. 
In the corporate health market, we recently announced partnership with Cerner, a Health Information Technology company. Through this partnership, Garmin will provide devices that capture powerful health and wellness data that could be integrated into Cerner's Wellness and Population Health Solutions.
Looking next at Outdoor, revenue increased 28% year-over-year on strong demand for our outdoor wearables and contributions from our recently acquired DeLorme subsidiary. The Outdoor segment generated strong growth and operating margins of 63% and 35%, respectively, and operating income grew 32% over the year-ago quarter. 
We recently launched the fenix Chronos, our first operating in the luxury watch category. The fenix Chronos line is crafted from premium jewelers-grade materials, and is designed to look spectacular in business, social or personal setting without sacrificing the rugged multisport capabilities associated with our brand. We continue to invest in our traditional outdoor product lines, as evidenced by the recent launch of the Rino 700 series, which features a 3-inch multitouch display and Bluetooth connectivity for realtime weather and position reporting.
Looking next at Marine. Revenue increased 12% year-over-year, driven by growth in multiple product lines and led by strong demand for our fishfinders. Gross margin increased to 57% in the quarter, while operating margin expanded to 15%. Operating income grew 80% in the quarter.
For the second consecutive year, we were recognized by the National Marine Electronics Association as Manufacturer of The Year. This award, along with 7 Product of Excellence awards, confirms our dedication to designing, manufacturing and selling industry-leading products for the marine market. In addition, at the International Boat Builders Exhibition, we received an innovation award for our recently launched Fantom solid-state radar.
Turning next to Aviation, revenue grew 14% over the prior year, as we experienced growth in both OEM and aftermarket product categories. Gross and operating margins remained strong at 75% and 28%, respectively, resulting in a 28% increase in operating income. During the quarter, we received certification of the G5000-equipped Beechjet 400A, and we began deliveries of this system to installers. We announced earlier this week that we were developing a G5000 integrated flight deck upgrade for the Citation Excel and the XLS. This upgrade will feature 3-high resolution displays, a modern fully digital flight control system and enhanced safety features. We expect to receive certification of this system in late 2018.
Looking finally at the Auto segments, revenues were down 21% in the quarter, primarily due to the ongoing PND market contraction and headwinds caused by revenue deferrals associated with certain auto OEM programs. Gross margin came in at 44% and operating margin was consistent year-over-year at 12%. While the PND market continues to decline, our global market share remains strong.
During the quarter, we launched our latest action camera, the VIRB Ultra 30. This new action camera [Audio Gap] at 30 frames per second. The VIRB Ultra 30 also includes first-to-market features, such as voice control, color LCD with touch screen, one touch live streaming and our G metric sensors. 
Finally, with 3 quarters of the year behind us, we are raising our projected revenue for the year to $2.95 billion, up approximately 5% over 2015. We are projecting gross margin of approximately 55% and operating income of approximately $580 million for the year.  Factoring in an effective tax rate of approximately 18.5%, pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.65.
Looking at our guidance by segment, we have increased year-over-year growth expectations by roughly 200 to 400 basis points for all segments, except Auto, where we are holding our guidance of down 17% for the year.
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"
598655,403419388,1062046,"Garmin Ltd., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results and move to comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We posted revenue of $722 million for the third quarter, representing a 6% increase year-over-ye",641,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results and move to comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. 
We posted revenue of $722 million for the third quarter, representing a 6% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 56.2%, a 290 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percent of sales was 34.1%, a 70 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $160 million, a 28% increase over the prior year.  Operating margin was 22.1%, a 360 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.66, a 6% growth the prior quarter. Our pro forma EPS was $0.75, a 47% growth the prior quarter. We'll discuss gross margin, operating expenses in more detail later.
Next, we will look at third quarter revenue by segment. In the third quarter, we achieved double-digit growth in 4 out of 5 segments, led by robust growth in our Fitness and Outdoor segments and solid growth in Marine and Aviation segments. Collectively, these 4 segments were up 24% compared to the prior-year quarter.
Looking next at third quarter revenue charts. The Auto segment represented 30% of total third quarter 2016 revenue compared to 40% in the third quarter of 2015. Fitness grew to 26% of revenue in the current period compared to 21% the prior year, while Outdoor grew to 19% from 16%. As you see in the chart, it illustrates our profit mix by segment. Outdoor, Fitness, Marine and Aviation collectively delivered 84% of operating income in third quarter of 2016.
Fitness operating income as a percentage of total operating income increased from 21% to 28%, and Outdoor increased from 29% to 31%. 
Looking at year-over-year gross margin by segment. All segments posted a gross margin rate increase as sales shifted toward products with higher margin profiles. Total corporate operating margin increased from 18.5% to 22.1%, primarily due to gross margin improvement.
Looking next at operating expenses. Third quarter operating expense increased by approximately $9 million or 4%. Research and development increased $10 million year-over-year, but was flat as a percent of sales. We continue to invest in innovation by increasing resources focused primarily on Aviation, Fitness and Outdoor 
Our advertising expense decreased $4 million from the prior quarter, representing 4.6% of sales, a 90 basis point decrease. The decrease in advertising was primarily in Auto. We expect our fourth quarter advertising spend to increase both sequentially and year-over-year to support our wearable products. 
SG&A was up $3 million compared to the prior quarter, however decreased 40 basis points as a percent of sales to 13.4%. The increase in SG&A was driven primarily by expenses associated with the addition of the DeLorme business.
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities over $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially as a result of seasonally lower sales in the third quarter, but increased year-over-year to $461 million from stronger sales. Inventory balance increased sequentially to $535 million, to prepare [ph] for the fourth quarter, remains higher year-over-year due to new product offerings.
In the third quarter of 2016, we generated free cash flow of $199 million, a $75 million increase from the third quarter of 2015. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of approximately $96 million, repurchased approximately $20 million of company stock. We have roughly $103 million remaining in share purchase program as authorized through December 31, 2016. We expect to repurchase as business and market conditions warrant. Effective tax rate was 16.5% in the current quarter compared to 27.6% in the prior quarter. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily due to projected income mix by jurisdiction compared to prior year. This concludes our formal remarks. Esther, could you please open the lines for Q&A?"

As announced earlier today, Garmin reported third quarter results, highlighted by both revenue and EPS growth, with 4 of our 5 business segments delivering double-digit sales growth and increased profitability.",952,"Thank you, Teri, and good morning, everyone. As announced earlier today, Garmin reported third quarter results, highlighted by both revenue and EPS growth, with 4 of our 5 business segments delivering double-digit sales growth and increased profitability. Consolidated revenue increased 6% year-over-year with fitness, outdoor, marine and aviation collectively growing 24%, while contributing 70% of total revenue and 84% of total operating income in the quarter. Each of our business segments produced strong results, which I will highlight shortly.
Gross margin expanded to 56.2% from 53.3% in the prior year, as sales shifted towards products with higher margin profiles. Operating margin expanded to 22.1% from 18.5% in the prior year, and operating income grew 27% on a consolidated basis. These strong results generated $0.66 of GAAP EPS. Pro forma EPS came in at $0.75, an increase of 47% over the prior year.
Wearable products were a major contributor to our strong third quarter performance, and we continue to expand into new product categories with the launch of the vivofit Jr. and the fenix Chronos. 
Next, I'll highlight segment-specific results and initiatives. 
Starting with fitness, revenue increased 32% year-over-year, led by strong demand for our wearables. Gross margin came in at 55% and operating margin was 24%, an expansion of more than 500 basis points over the prior year. Operating income grew 68% in the quarter.
During the quarter, we expanded our market with the launch of the vivofit Jr. This activity tracker is designed specifically for kids with colorful one-piece band that fits comfortably on a child's wrist. vivofit Jr. shares many of the unique differentiators of our vivofit line, such as an always-on-display, fully waterproof design and 1-year battery life, while adding a compelling parent-controlled mobile app that helps motivate kids to stay active.
We also launched the Forerunner 35, bringing Garmin Elevate wrist heart-rate technology to our entry-level running product line. The Forerunner 35 features GPS, multiple activity profiles, smart alerts and a new high resolution display that is perfect for both indoor and outdoor use. 
In the corporate health market, we recently announced partnership with Cerner, a Health Information Technology company. Through this partnership, Garmin will provide devices that capture powerful health and wellness data that could be integrated into Cerner's Wellness and Population Health Solutions.
Looking next at Outdoor, revenue increased 28% year-over-year on strong demand for our outdoor wearables and contributions from our recently acquired DeLorme subsidiary. The Outdoor segment generated strong growth and operating margins of 63% and 35%, respectively, and operating income grew 32% over the year-ago quarter. 
We recently launched the fenix Chronos, our first operating in the luxury watch category. The fenix Chronos line is crafted from premium jewelers-grade materials, and is designed to look spectacular in business, social or personal setting without sacrificing the rugged multisport capabilities associated with our brand. We continue to invest in our traditional outdoor product lines, as evidenced by the recent launch of the Rino 700 series, which features a 3-inch multitouch display and Bluetooth connectivity for realtime weather and position reporting.
Looking next at Marine. Revenue increased 12% year-over-year, driven by growth in multiple product lines and led by strong demand for our fishfinders. Gross margin increased to 57% in the quarter, while operating margin expanded to 15%. Operating income grew 80% in the quarter.
For the second consecutive year, we were recognized by the National Marine Electronics Association as Manufacturer of The Year. This award, along with 7 Product of Excellence awards, confirms our dedication to designing, manufacturing and selling industry-leading products for the marine market. In addition, at the International Boat Builders Exhibition, we received an innovation award for our recently launched Fantom solid-state radar.
Turning next to Aviation, revenue grew 14% over the prior year, as we experienced growth in both OEM and aftermarket product categories. Gross and operating margins remained strong at 75% and 28%, respectively, resulting in a 28% increase in operating income. During the quarter, we received certification of the G5000-equipped Beechjet 400A, and we began deliveries of this system to installers. We announced earlier this week that we were developing a G5000 integrated flight deck upgrade for the Citation Excel and the XLS. This upgrade will feature 3-high resolution displays, a modern fully digital flight control system and enhanced safety features. We expect to receive certification of this system in late 2018.
Looking finally at the Auto segments, revenues were down 21% in the quarter, primarily due to the ongoing PND market contraction and headwinds caused by revenue deferrals associated with certain auto OEM programs. Gross margin came in at 44% and operating margin was consistent year-over-year at 12%. While the PND market continues to decline, our global market share remains strong.
During the quarter, we launched our latest action camera, the VIRB Ultra 30. This new action camera [Audio Gap] at 30 frames per second. The VIRB Ultra 30 also includes first-to-market features, such as voice control, color LCD with touch screen, one touch live streaming and our G metric sensors. 
Finally, with 3 quarters of the year behind us, we are raising our projected revenue for the year to $2.95 billion, up approximately 5% over 2015. We are projecting gross margin of approximately 55% and operating income of approximately $580 million for the year.  Factoring in an effective tax rate of approximately 18.5%, pro forma earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.65.
Looking at our guidance by segment, we have increased year-over-year growth expectations by roughly 200 to 400 basis points for all segments, except Auto, where we are holding our guidance of down 17% for the year.
That concludes my remarks. Next, Doug will walk you through additional details on our financial results. Doug?"
598655,403419388,1062429,"Garmin Ltd., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Garmin Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results and move to comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We posted revenue of $722 million for the third quarter, representing a 6% increase year-over-ye",641,"Thanks, Cliff. Good morning, everyone. Let's begin by reviewing our third quarter results and move to comments on the balance sheet and cash flow statement. 
We posted revenue of $722 million for the third quarter, representing a 6% increase year-over-year. Gross margin was 56.2%, a 290 basis point increase from the prior year. Operating expense as a percent of sales was 34.1%, a 70 basis point decrease from the prior year. Operating income was $160 million, a 28% increase over the prior year.  Operating margin was 22.1%, a 360 basis point increase from the prior year. Our GAAP EPS was $0.66, a 6% growth the prior quarter. Our pro forma EPS was $0.75, a 47% growth the prior quarter. We'll discuss gross margin, operating expenses in more detail later.
Next, we will look at third quarter revenue by segment. In the third quarter, we achieved double-digit growth in 4 out of 5 segments, led by robust growth in our Fitness and Outdoor segments and solid growth in Marine and Aviation segments. Collectively, these 4 segments were up 24% compared to the prior-year quarter.
Looking next at third quarter revenue charts. The Auto segment represented 30% of total third quarter 2016 revenue compared to 40% in the third quarter of 2015. Fitness grew to 26% of revenue in the current period compared to 21% the prior year, while Outdoor grew to 19% from 16%. As you see in the chart, it illustrates our profit mix by segment. Outdoor, Fitness, Marine and Aviation collectively delivered 84% of operating income in third quarter of 2016.
Fitness operating income as a percentage of total operating income increased from 21% to 28%, and Outdoor increased from 29% to 31%. 
Looking at year-over-year gross margin by segment. All segments posted a gross margin rate increase as sales shifted toward products with higher margin profiles. Total corporate operating margin increased from 18.5% to 22.1%, primarily due to gross margin improvement.
Looking next at operating expenses. Third quarter operating expense increased by approximately $9 million or 4%. Research and development increased $10 million year-over-year, but was flat as a percent of sales. We continue to invest in innovation by increasing resources focused primarily on Aviation, Fitness and Outdoor 
Our advertising expense decreased $4 million from the prior quarter, representing 4.6% of sales, a 90 basis point decrease. The decrease in advertising was primarily in Auto. We expect our fourth quarter advertising spend to increase both sequentially and year-over-year to support our wearable products. 
SG&A was up $3 million compared to the prior quarter, however decreased 40 basis points as a percent of sales to 13.4%. The increase in SG&A was driven primarily by expenses associated with the addition of the DeLorme business.
A few highlights on the balance sheet, cash flow statement and taxes. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities over $2.4 billion. Accounts receivable decreased sequentially as a result of seasonally lower sales in the third quarter, but increased year-over-year to $461 million from stronger sales. Inventory balance increased sequentially to $535 million, to prepare [ph] for the fourth quarter, remains higher year-over-year due to new product offerings.
In the third quarter of 2016, we generated free cash flow of $199 million, a $75 million increase from the third quarter of 2015. Also during the quarter, we paid dividends of approximately $96 million, repurchased approximately $20 million of company stock. We have roughly $103 million remaining in share purchase program as authorized through December 31, 2016. We expect to repurchase as business and market conditions warrant. Effective tax rate was 16.5% in the current quarter compared to 27.6% in the prior quarter. The decrease in effective tax rate was primarily due to projected income mix by jurisdiction compared to prior year. This concludes our formal remarks. Esther, could you please open the lines for Q&A?"
