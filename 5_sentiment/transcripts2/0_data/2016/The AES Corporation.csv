Today, I would like to start this call with a brief review of 2015, then I'll provide an update on the trends we're seeing across our portfolio, our action plans and the net impact of all of these factors on our",1903,"Thanks, Ahmed, and good morning, everyone. Today, I would like to start this call with a brief review of 2015, then I'll provide an update on the trends we're seeing across our portfolio, our action plans and the net impact of all of these factors on our 2016 guidance and long-term expectations. 
As you are all aware, we faced significant macroeconomic headwinds in 2015, including an average devaluation of nearly 30% at our non-U.S. dollar denominated businesses. We also faced a decline of more than 5% in demand at our distribution businesses in Brazil, which is now in a deep recession. Both of these challenges are persisting in 2016, and we are taking actions to mitigate their impact on our financial results. 
Nonetheless, we continue to execute well on our long-term strategy to create sustainable shareholder value, simplifying our geographic footprint, improving our balance sheet and debt profile, fine-tuning our financial exposure by bringing in partners of the business and project level and profitably expanding our local platform. As a result of our consistent actions, in 2015, we were able to generate free cash flow of $1.24 billion, up 39% compared to 2014 and $66 million above the mid-point of our guidance range. This was reflected in the $531 million of parent free cash flow we generated, which was $8 million higher than 2014. 
And we increased our quarterly dividend for the third consecutive year to $0.11 per share, up 10% versus the previous year. Unfortunately, we were unable to overcome all of the $0.11 impact from macroeconomic headwinds we faced and our resulting adjusted earnings per share was $1.22, down from $1.30 in 2014. This was within our revised guidance range of $0.03 below the low end of the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year.
Regarding capital allocation. We continue to return most of our discretionary cash to shareholder. Last year, we directed 62% of our discretionary cash toward share repurchases and dividends. Specifically, $481 million to share buybacks and $276 million to dividends. We also used $345 million or 28% of our discretionary cash to strengthen our balance sheet by prepaying and refinancing corporate debt. Our proactive steps over the past several years have put us in a strong liquidity position. Over the next 3 years, we only have $180 million of parent debt maturities and we've already made 85% of our capital contributions towards our 5.6 gigawatts of projects currently under construction.
To secure our earnings and cash flow growth over the next couple of years, in 2015, we brought online 1.5 gigawatts of new projects and continue to make good progress on the remaining 5.6 gigawatts of construction projects. About 90% of these projects are U.S. dollar denominated and either regulated or have long-term PPAs. Finally, we advanced a few profitable platform expansion projects in California, Panama and the Philippines. Now turning to Slide 4 and our forecast for 2016.
Over the last 2 years, currencies had devalued by as much as 40% to 55% and key commodities, such as oil and gas, had declined by 45% to 60%. The 2016 guidance we provided on our last call incorporated the impact from the macroeconomic factors I previously mentioned as of October 15. Unfortunately, these negative trends have continued. And based on our sensitivities to commodities and foreign currencies, we see an additional impact of $100 million on proportional free cash flow and $0.10 on adjusted diluted share this year. Tom will provide additional color on the main drivers and their effects in a few minutes. 
Taking all of this into account, we expect to achieve at least 10% average annual growth in our free cash flow and 12% to 16% average annual growth in adjusted earnings per share through 2018, although off a lower 2016 base. Our expectations for this growth is based on 3 factors: Continued performance improvement, projects currently under construction and capital allocation decisions. 
First, turning to Slide 5. Let us talk about continued performance improvement. As you may recall, since 2011, we have successfully implemented a cost-cutting program, which resulted in a 25% decrease in global overhead, equivalent to a run rate of $200 million of savings per year. Last quarter, we launched a new efficiency and revenue enhancement program to deliver an additional $150 million in savings per year by 2018. This new initiative includes further overhead cost reductions, procurement savings and operational efficiencies improvements. We have already launched the programs that will allow us to realize $50 million in savings in 2016, and we are confident that we will realize $150 million in annual run rate by 2018.
Turning to Slide 6. Second, although we had to record a majority of our discretionary cash to share buybacks, debt repayments and dividends over the past 4 years, we have also been prudently investing in platform expansion projects together with financial partners. These growth projects are key to positioning AES for sustainable growth over the medium term, as well as maintaining our competitive edge. We are only investing in projects where we have an existing business, where we see attractive risk-adjusted returns and where we can attract financial partners. Partnerships both reduce risk and enhance returns as they provide an additional market read on our projects and often pay AES a promoter management fee. In fact, since 2011, we have raised more than $2.5 billion by incorporating financial partners on our construction projects and operating businesses. And as I said earlier, and as you can see on Slide 7, in 2015 alone, we brought online 6 projects for a total of nearly 1.5 gigawatts, and they were completed on time and on budget. 
Turning to Slide 8. We currently have an additional 5.6 gigawatts under construction, the majority of which are expected to come online through 2018 with an average return on equity of approximately 15%. The total cost of these projects is $7 billion, and AES has already contributed 85% of its $1.2 billion in required equity contributions. 
A major milestone will be the completion of 1.6 gigawatts of environmental upgrades at our existing thermal generation plants at Indianapolis Power & Light. About 80% of our current construction pipeline is in the U.S. and Chile, where we are expanding our stable and U.S. dollar denominated asset base at IPL in AEC Gener. Now on to Slide 9. 
Over the past several years, we have experienced many of the disadvantages of having an international portfolio. However, one of the advantages is that having proved our presence from 28 to 17 countries, most of the remaining emerging markets we are in continue to experience robust growth in energy demand, supporting the need for our product. In Panama, Vietnam and India, demand growth over the next 3 years is expected to be in the 6% to 10% range, while in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and the Philippines, growth is in the 3% to 5% range.
One notable exception is Brazil, where demand for electricity dropped 5% in 2015 and we are not forecasting a recovery in levels of demand until 2018. Now let me touch on a few advanced development projects that will drive our growth beyond 2018. 
Turning to Slide 10, in the Philippines, where as I just mentioned, demand growth is expected to remain at around 5%. We plan to break ground in the first half of 2016 on a 300-megawatt expansion of our 630-megawatt Masinloc facility. The $750 million project will be funded with a combination of partner equity, local debt capacity and free cash flow from the business in the Philippines.
Now turning to Slide 11. In Panama, along with our local partner, Grupo Motel, we won a competitive bid for a 350-megawatt gas-fired combined cycle generation plant with a 10-year U.S. dollar PPA. Using this bid is an anchor, we plan to build 180,000 cubic meter LNG regasification and storage facility, very similar to the one we built and have successfully operated for 13 years in the Dominican Republic. The facility will be strategically located near the entrance of the Panama Canal, allowing it to serve as a shift fuel bunkering hub, as well as meeting unmet local and regional demand for natural gas. With the completion of the assisted facility through existing terminal on the Dominican Republic, we will be the largest LNG uptake in the Caribbean and Central America. We expect to break ground this year and complete the project in 2018.
As you can see on Slide 12, we've also achieved important milestones on the retiring of our Southland facility, where we were awarded a 20-year PPA by Southern California Edison for nearly 1.4 gigawatts of combined cycle natural gas generation and energy storage. We are making good progress on permitting and licensing and expect to break ground in 2017 with commissioning beginning in 2020.
Finally, turning to Slide 13. We continue to maintain our leadership of lithium ion based battery energy storage. We currently have 106 megawatts in operation in 4 countries. We have another 60 megawatts under construction and a further 228 megawatts in advanced stage development in the U.S, Latin America and Asia, including 100 megawatts under contract in California. In addition to the nearly 400 megawatts that we have built or may build and our own business platform, we have reached important milestone towards third-party sales of our proprietary award-winning advanced NCM energy storage product. You recently signed an alliance agreement with the Mitsubishi Corporation to sell advance in Asia and Australia and a similar agreement with Eaton for select countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. As part of our drive to maintain the cost competitiveness of our product, we also signed an agreement with LG to supply batteries for our pipeline on energy storage projects.
In our current financial guidance, we do not include any material income from third-party sales of our Advancion product. We believe this is prudent since our alliance based business model is in initial phase. Nonetheless, we believe that the global market for energy storage solutions is expanding rapidly and will be quite large within 5 years as utilities respond to greater renewable penetration. 
AES' businesses in attractive markets around the world and our long-term relationships with local regulators and customers provide us with a unique advantage in opening the door for energy storage. We will keep you informed as our alliances progress. 
Turning to Slide 14. The third driver of our growth in per share, cash flow and earnings is our capital allocation strategy. 4 years ago, we identified specific actions to improve total shareholder return, reduce risk and simplify our portfolio. Since then, we have used 81% of our discretionary cash for share repurchases, dividends and debt prepayments. Since 2011, we have reduced our share count by 15% and our parent debt by 23%. We have completed timely exits from 11 countries and netted $3 billion in asset sale proceeds, including more than $500 million in 2015. As you can see on Slide 15, since 2012, we returned $2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, including $757 million or 12% of our current market cap in 2015. While I have discussed our growth opportunities in some detail, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders and reducing corporate leverage.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Tom to provide more color on our 2015 results and 2016 guidance."
35312,323361483,939113,"The AES Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2016",2016-02-24,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will review our full year results, including proportional free cash flow, adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pretax contribution or PTC, by strategic business units or SBU. They will",1738,"Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will review our full year results, including proportional free cash flow, adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pretax contribution or PTC, by strategic business units or SBU. They will cover our 2015 allocation, our '16 guidance and longer-term expectations, as well as our 2016 capital allocation.
Turning to Slide 17. Full year adjusted EPS of $1.22 was $0.08 lower than 2014. At a high level, we are impacted by the $0.11 impact from the roughly 30% average devaluation in foreign currencies, primarily the Brazilian real and Colombian peso; lower operating results in Brazil due to lower demand and a general economic slowdown, as well as lower commodity prices, particularly in the Dominican Republic. These negative drivers were partially offset by the reduction in share count of 6% or 40 million shares, lower parent interest expense and slightly lower tax rate, as well as improved hydrology in Panama and the benefit of new businesses, including Mong Duong in Vietnam. 
Turning to Slide 18. Overall, we generated $1.2 billion of proportional free cash flow, an increase of $350 million from last in the operating margin was down. As expected in the Dominican Republic, or DR, we sell our outstanding receivables. And in Chile, we recovered delayed VAT payments for the construction of Cochrane and my pro. We previously expected to be in the low end of our range if the PPA amendment in connection of receivables at Maritza in Bulgaria did not close. Although there's been delay until 2016, we came in above the mid-point of our range as a result of improved collections and working capital improvements across our portfolio, some of which came late in 2015 rather than our prior expectation collected 2016. 
We also earned $1.15 billion in adjusted PTC during the year, a decrease of $171 million. Now I'll cover our SBUs in more detail over the next 6 slides beginning on Slide 19. In the U.S, our results reflect lower generation across our wind portfolio, lower contributions from IPL due to wholesale margins and partial sell down, as well as some DPL where greater portion of energy were sold in the wholesale versus the retail market. Proportional free cash flow also reflects higher collections, lower inventory and a one-time contract termination payment at DPL in 2014. 
In Andes, our results reflect higher margins as a result of improved availability in Chile and higher energy prices at Sebor in Colombia, partially offset by the 27% devaluation of the Colombian peso. Proportional free cash flow also benefited from increased VAT refunds.
PTC also reflects of the gain on the restructuring at Guacola in Chile. In Brazil, our results reflect lower margins due to lower demand and 29% devaluation in the Brazilian real. Proportional free cash flow also reflects higher interest expense, partially offset by the timing of energy purchases, lower tax payments and lower CapEx to SOL. PTC also includes the net unfavorable reversal of liabilities in Eletropaulo and so. Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results lower margins as a result of lower LNG sales demand and flow services revenue and availability in DR, partially offset by improved technology in Panama. Proportional free cash flow had a very strong increase in the collection of outstanding receivables in the DR, as well as favorable timing of collections in Puerto Rico and Panama.
In Europe, our results reflect lower margins due to 16% devaluation of the euro, the 20% devaluation of the cap [indiscernible] and the sales of our businesses in Nigeria and our wind business in UK. Proportional free cash flow, however, was up due to higher collections in Bulgaria and Jordan.
Lower PTC also reflects the reversal of a liability in Kazakhstan that was favorable in 2014. Finally, in Asia, our results benefited from higher margins as a result of the start of operations at Mong Duong in Vietnam, as well as improved availability at Masinloc in the Philippines. Proportional free cash flow was negatively impacted by higher tax payments from the timing of collections and fuel payments at Masinloc. 
Now to Slide 25 and our parent capital allocation for 2015. Sources on the left-hand side reflect the total available discretionary cash, roughly $1.6 billion, which is about $140 million higher than our expectation. This is largely a result of the approximately 4% sell down of Gener in the fourth quarter. You may remember from our last call, we expect an additional asset sales proceeds of approximately $150 million in our 2016 capital allocation plan. We were able to close this in '15 and now own approximately 67% of Gener, down from 71%. 
Despite our total asset sale proceeds from 2015 to $537 million, parent free cash flow came in just above the mid-point of our range of $531 million. Turning to uses on the right-hand side, we allocated 91% of our discretionary cash toward debt pay down and return to shareholders. Specifically, we used $345 million to refinance and prepay over $800 million of upon debt. This included reducing our overall debt by $240 million and the issuance of $575 million, or 5.5% 10-year notes, which further extended our maturities and lower interest expense. In addition to dividend, we've invested $481 million in our shares. This brings total cash returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends to $757 million for 2015. Since our last call, we announced our $400 million authorization. We bought back $136 million, including $79 million in '16
Turning to Slide 26 on our '16 guidance and 17, '18 expectations. As Andres mentioned, our prior guidance was based on currency and commodity forward curve as of October 15. Bring those curves forward to January 31 resulted in incremental impact of $0.10 on EPS or roughly $100 million. Our hedging activities have mitigated this impact by $0.03. Additionally, since then, economic conditions in Brazil have also deteriorated by about $0.02. We've incorporated these impacts into our revised guidance.
Our 2016 proportional free cash flow guidance is now $125 million lower with revised mid-point of $1.175 billion. This reflects the $100 million in macro impacts I just discussed, as well as the fact that our 15 proportional free cash flow benefited from the accelerated collections in the fourth quarter. 
Regarding parent free cash flow, we now expect 2016 to be $50 million lower, the mid-point of $575 million. Although this is below our previous expectation, it still represents roughly 10% growth protein to 2015. In 2017 and '18, we're still projecting at least 10% annual growth and cash flow throughout the lower 2016 base. Our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance is now  $0.95 to $1.05 or $0.10 below our prior guidance with the mid-point of $1. In 2017 and '18, we're maintaining our 12% to 16% growth rate without the lower 2016 base. However, we do expect to be in the higher end of that range. 
Before turning to capital allocation. I will provide updates on a couple of our business beginning on Slide 27. Regarding Maritza in Bulgaria, recent energy sector reforms have now been enacted, resulting in improvement in the financial position of our off-taker in U.K.. We saw evidence of this in 2015 as collections were 24% higher than 2014. We've also seen progress recently in the financing process, in any case, parent to raise the funds necessary to settle our receivables. That said, our guidance includes only a modest portion of the outstanding receivables we expect to collect.
Also this week, DPL filed its electric security plan, which included a request for a reliability writer. Our plan tracks the criteria set out by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, which are designed to improve rates stability for customers, ensure continued reliability and promote fuel diversity in Ohio oh, while also ensuring the continued economic liability that DPL's plants based on a targeted 10.7% return on equity. We expect resolution of this filing later this year with the outcome effective at the beginning of 2017.
We remain on track to have our generation and wires businesses separated by that time. Turning now to 2016 parent capital allocation on Slide 29. Sources on the left-hand side reflect $1.1 billion of total available discretionary cash. This is roughly $50 million less best than our prior expectation reflecting lower parent free cash flow. Our discretionary of cash could increase to raise additional funds from asset sales.
Turning to uses on the right-hand side of the slide. With 10% growth in our dividend and share repurchases year-to-date, we're returning at least 1/3 of this cash to shareholders. Regarding debt reduction, improving our credit profile continues to be a priority. From a fixed income perspective, we benefit from lower financing cost and [indiscernible] excess to capital. Equally important from an equity perspective, we think that continuing to strengthen our credit will help us get better recognition and valuation for our growing cash flows and dividend. Accordingly, we're targeting $200 million of debt reduction this year, over half of which we've already done. 
As an aside, we also continue to have good access to financial markets across our businesses, which is still open for attractive projects and favorable terms, as we've seen recently with our extensible projects and refinancings. As an example, just a couple of weeks ago, we closed the 15-year non-recourse financing for our Masinloc expansion project in the Philippines, an all-in cost of less than 5%. We $330 million for investments in our projects under construction, as well as our expansion projects at Southland, in California and Panama. We will also be injecting $75 million into Sul in Brazil in support of debt restructuring, which will strengthen Sul's capital structure by paying down a portion of the $330 million in debt currently outstanding. 
The equity injection will also facilitate agreements to extend debt maturities to 2020 and '21. We believe there's meaningful value in the business, above our equity contribution, and following this debt restructuring, which we expect to close shortly, we will be assessing all strategic alternatives to Sul. After considering these investments in our subs, our current dividend and debt repayment were left with roughly $170 million of discretion a cash to be allocated. As in year's past, much of this cash is weighted towards the latter part of the year. We'll continue to invest this cash consistent with our capital allocation framework.
With that, I'll now pass it back to Andres."

So we're repositioning this portfolio to be more contracted, more dollar-based and in countries with strong markets."

I think '16 is going to be bad. We don't expect a recovery in energy demand until about 2018. This is true. But I think you have to remember that we only own 16% of Eletropaulo. At today's market valuation, that's about $60 million of equity positions, relatively small. It's a publicly listed company, so we're not going to comment on it. But I would say that we've been consistent in our strategy of, let's say, focusing our position in Brazil. And for example, when there was sort of a asset prices were high, there was a lot of pressure on us from -- to lever up Tietê and buy assets, we never did because we never thought that those were good investments. So looking at the good, big picture for Brazil, we have 2,600 megawatts of Hydro. They're very well contracted over the next couple of years and much higher than today's spot prices. I think in the future, it's going to be hard to get that kind of Hydro assets at a reasonable price. So Brazil again is in tough times. It's going to take some time to work its way out of it. But on the other hand, I think we have to take a longer-term perspective of AES' presence in Brazil, not referring to any specific asset."

We've always said that. I think maybe 1 year ago, YieldCo were in fashion, a lot of people are seen, why don't you do it with you YieldCo. We will not do that for the fundamental point of view, that's how we look at things do specially and fundamentally that partnerships made more sense. That they were cheaper. They didn't create obligations for other investments, anything that strategy has played out. So certainly, we have an open mind. And from time to time, we look at the this.

Yes, no, I think overall, our credit improvement comments are consistent with what we've said. And there's obviously, when we say credit ratio, credit statistics improvement, there's 2 way to get there, the numerator and the denominator. We think part of that improvement will be in the numerator, i.e. parent free cash flow goes up, which is the distributions from sobs is obviously numerator that we look at the most for health parent credit. So we do expect growth as we talk about the 10% or more growth in parent free cash flow was driven by subsidiary distributions. So it's more the reducing debt and interest cost is a smaller part of the story, but it is part of the story. So I think just going back to what I said, Julien, I think will be 200 this year and as you see now, if I do 100 each of the next 2 years, and that's consistent, I think, with what we said over the last 6 to 12 months, which is about 100 to 200 a year. It's pretty also pretty consistent with what we did last year. If you look at the debt we paid down, some it was attributable to asset sales proceeds. But about 150, 175 was attributable to, in our minds, just paying down debt and trying to continue to advance our credit story. And once again, we think that we can get investment-grade types stacks over, let's call it a 4 to 5-year period on a gradual step. I think we're -- the facts from the pathway is pretty consistent. I think it's more of a focus, let's say, certainly, senior management also the Board level because we certainly pay out a pretty healthy dividend. We've got 10% growth, and we really want to get shareholders to be comfortable in the stability and growth trajectory. And we think improving our credit will be part of that picture. Just the other things quickly to touch on. Yes, Tietê still does have about $500 million of debt capacity. Like all of our Brazilian utilities, they've got a deficit EBITDA coverage in a very modest step. So above [ph] $500 million would be available under their overall debt dux. Might be a little cautious about that number today because Brazil is a challenging place, but they certainly do you have debt capacity as we look to grow in Tietê, it would be with that debt capacity. We do have other -- and mean in general rather subs. We do look to optimize our businesses. Gener is BBB- right now. I think that, given the construction program, we don't see a lot of incremental capacity from Gener do at certainly, past, yes, there is. But we do look at debt capacity around the business as one place is in the Masinloc, where we're increasing the plant, the facility sites by 50% basically to 300-megawatt increment. That is being done through a financing the joint credit of existing Masinloc with new Masinloc that very much minimizes the equity the same-store we did with the DR. We did the DR, $260 million project basically put no equity and because of the new project was stable to the old one. So we leveraged the available debt capacity in that fashion."

We've also, fortunately, I, had done a good job. The teams done a good job in terms of contracting Tietê over the next couple of years.

If that does occur that would -- and given that everything else happens as we expect, we'd would be at the upper end of the range."

So for the rest, I think most places, yes, it definitely is a market in then in the place like Argentina, receive greater investor interest because the -- a lot of the moves that the government has taken are seeing very favorably. I personally was down in Argentina and I continued one of the most impressive executive teams I've seen anywhere any time. So they've already started to liberalize tariffs and rationalize prices. But if you get to Brazil itself, I think that these assets are definitely salable. I think it depends on the asset. There's still appetite. There's still local groups who have the capacity to buy this. There's still a lot of place of consolidation in the sector. And you have foreign investors. You have Italians, Spanish investors, who are -- or in French, who are looking -- on the lookout for assets. So I would say vindaloo that Brazil again is the market that's not growing and at the same time, I think for quality assets, they're definitely buyers. The price may not be what it was 2 years ago for sure because that's reflected in market valuations."

Today, I would like to start this call with a brief review of 2015, then I'll provide an update on the trends we're seeing across our portfolio, our action plans and the net impact of all of these factors on our",1896,"Thanks, Ahmed, and good morning, everyone. Today, I would like to start this call with a brief review of 2015, then I'll provide an update on the trends we're seeing across our portfolio, our action plans and the net impact of all of these factors on our 2016 guidance and long-term expectations. 
As you are all aware, we faced significant macroeconomic headwinds in 2015, including an average devaluation of nearly 30% at our non-U.S. dollar-denominated businesses. We also faced a decline of more than 5% in demand at our distribution businesses in Brazil, which is now in a deep recession. Both of these challenges are persisting in 2016. And we're taking actions to mitigate their impact on our financial results. Nonetheless, we continue to execute well on our long-term strategy to create sustainable shareholder value, simplifying our geographic footprint, improving our balance sheet and debt profile, fine-tuning our financial exposure by bringing in partners at the business and project level and profitably expanding our local platform. 
As a result of our consistent actions, in 2015, we were able to generate free cash flow of $1.24 billion, up 39% compared to 2014 and $66 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. This was reflected in the $531 million of parent free cash flow we generated, which is $8 million higher than 2014. And we increased our quarterly dividend for the third consecutive year to $0.11 per share, up 10% versus the previous year. Unfortunately, we were unable to overcome all of the $0.11 impact from macroeconomic headwinds we faced. And our resulting adjusted earnings per share was $1.22, down from $1.30 in 2014. This was within our revised guidance range of $0.03 below the low end of the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year.
Regarding capital allocation. We continued to return most of our discretionary cash to shareholder. Last year, we directed 62% of our discretionary cash toward share repurchases and dividends, specifically $481 million to share buybacks and $276 million to dividends. We also used $345 million or 28% of our discretionary cash to strengthen our balance sheet by prepaying and refinancing corporate debt. Our proactive steps over the past several years have put us in a strong liquidity position. Over the next 3 years, we only have $180 million of parent debt maturities. And we have already made 85% of our capital contributions towards our 5.6 gigawatts of projects currently under construction. To secure our earnings and cash flow growth over the next couple of years, in 2015, we brought online 1.5 gigawatts of new projects and continued to make good progress on the remaining 5.6 gigawatts of construction projects. About 90% of these projects are U.S. dollar-denominated and either regulated or have long-term PPAs. Finally, we advanced a few profitable platform expansion projects in California, Panama and the Philippines. 
Now turning to Slide 4 and our forecast for 2016. Over the last 2 years, currencies had devalued by as much as 40% to 55% and key commodities, such as oil and gas, had declined by 45% to 60%. The 2016 guidance we provided on our last call incorporated the impact from the macroeconomic factors I previously mentioned as of October 15. Unfortunately, these negative trends have continued. And based on our sensitivities to commodities and foreign currencies, we see an additional impact of $100 million on proportional free cash flow and $0.10 on adjusted earnings per share this year. Tom will provide additional color on the main drivers and their effects in a few minutes. Taking all of this into account, we expect to achieve at least 10% average annual growth in our free cash flow and 12% to 16% average annual growth in adjusted earnings per share through 2018, although off a lower 2016 base. Our expectations for this growth is based on 3 factors: continued performance improvement, projects currently under construction and capital allocation decisions. 
First, turning to Slide 5. Let us talk about continued performance improvement. As you may recall, since 2011, we have successfully implemented a cost-cutting program, which resulted in a 25% decrease in global overhead, equivalent to a run rate of $200 million of savings per year. Last quarter, we launched a new efficiency and revenue enhancement program to deliver an additional $150 million in savings per year by 2018. This new initiative includes further overhead cost reductions, procurement savings and operational efficiencies and improvements. We have already launched the programs that will allow us to realize $50 million in savings in 2016. And we are confident that we will realize $150 million in annual run rate by 2018.
Turning to Slide 6. Second, although we had directed a majority of our discretionary cash to share buybacks, debt prepayments and dividends over the past 4 years, we have also been prudently investing in platform expansion projects together with financial partners. These growth projects are key to positioning AES for sustainable growth over the medium term as well as maintaining our competitive edge. We are only investing in projects where we have an existing business, where we see attractive risk-adjusted returns and where we can attract financial partners. Partnerships both reduce risk and enhance returns as they provide an additional market read on our projects and often pay AES a promote or management fee. In fact, since 2011, we have raised more than $2.5 billion by incorporating financial partners on our construction projects and operating businesses. And as I said earlier, and as you can see on Slide 7, in 2015 alone, we brought online 6 projects for a total of nearly 1.5 gigawatts. And they were completed on time and on budget. 
Turning to Slide 8. We currently have an additional 5.6 gigawatts under construction, the majority of which are expected to come online through 2018 with an average return on equity of approximately 15%. The total cost of these projects is $7 billion and AES has already contributed 85% of its $1.2 billion in required equity contributions. A major milestone will be the completion of 1.6 gigawatts of environmental upgrades at our existing thermal generation plants at Indianapolis Power & Light. About 80% of our current construction pipeline is in the U.S. and Chile, where we are expanding our stable and U.S. dollar-denominated asset base at IPL and AES Gener. 
Now on to Slide 9. Over the past several years, we have experienced many of the disadvantages of having an international portfolio. However, one of the advantages is that having pruned our presence from 28 to 17 countries, most of the remaining emerging markets we are in continue to experience robust growth in energy demand, supporting the need for our product. In Panama, Vietnam and India, demand growth over the next 3 years is expected to be in the 6% to 10% range while in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and the Philippines, growth is in the 3% to 5% range. One notable exception is Brazil, where demand for electricity dropped 5% in 2015 and we're not forecasting a recovery in levels of demand until 2018. Now let me touch on a few advanced development projects that will drive our growth beyond 2018. 
Turning to Slide 10. In the Philippines, where as I just mentioned demand growth is expected to remain at around 5%, we plan to break ground in the first half of 2016 on a 300-megawatt expansion of our 630-megawatt Masinloc facility. The $750 million project will be funded with a combination of partner equity, local debt capacity and free cash flow from the business in the Philippines.
Now turning to Slide 11. In Panama, along with our local partner, Grupo Motta, we won a competitive bid for a 350-megawatt gas-fired combined-cycle generation plant with a 10-year U.S. dollar PPA. Using this bid as an anchor, we plan to build 180,000 cubic meter LNG regasification and storage facility, very similar to the one we built and have successfully operated for 13 years in the Dominican Republic. The facility will be strategically located near the entrance of the Panama Canal, allowing it to serve as a ship fuel bunkering hub as well as meeting unmet local and regional demand for natural gas. With the completion of a sister facility through our existing terminal on the Dominican Republic, we will be the largest LNG offtaker in the Caribbean and Central America. We expect to break ground this year and complete the project in 2018. As you can see on Slide 12, we've also achieved important milestones on the repowering of our Southland facility, where we were awarded a 20-year PPA by Southern California Edison for nearly 1.4 gigawatts of combined-cycle natural gas generation and energy storage. We're making good progress on permitting and licensing and expect to break ground in 2017 with commissioning beginning in 2020.
Finally, turning to Slide 13. We continue to maintain our leadership of lithium ion-based battery energy storage. We currently have 106 megawatts in operation in 4 countries. We have another 60 megawatts under construction and a further 228 megawatts in advanced-stage development in the U.S., Latin America and Asia, including 100 megawatts under contract in California. In addition to the nearly 400 megawatts that we have built or may build and our own business platform, we have reached important milestones towards third-party sales of our proprietary award-winning Advancion energy storage product. We recently signed an alliance agreement with the Mitsubishi Corporation to sell Advancion in Asia and Australia and a similar agreement with Eaton for select countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. As part of our drive to maintain the cost competitiveness of our product, we also signed an agreement with LG to supply batteries for our pipeline of energy storage projects.
In our current financial guidance, we do not include any material income from third-party sales of our Advancion product. We believe this is prudent since our alliance-based business model is in the initial phases. Nonetheless, we believe that the global market for energy storage solutions is expanding rapidly and will be quite large within 5 years as utilities respond to greater renewable penetration. AES's businesses in attractive markets around the world and our long-term relationships with local regulators and customers provide us with a unique advantage in opening the door to energy storage. We will keep you informed as our alliances progress. 
Turning to Slide 14. The third driver of our growth in per share, cash flow and earnings is our capital allocation strategy. 4 years ago, we identified specific actions to improve total shareholder return, reduce risk and simplify our portfolio. Since then, we have used 81% of our discretionary cash toward share repurchases, dividends and debt prepayments. Since 2011, we have reduced our share count by 15% and our parent debt by 23%. We have completed timely exits from 11 countries and netted $3 billion in asset sale proceeds, including more than $500 million in 2015. As you can see on Slide 15, since 2012, we returned $2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, including $757 million or 12% of our current market cap in 2015. While I have discussed our growth opportunities in some detail, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders and reducing corporate leverage.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Tom to provide more color on our 2015 results and 2016 guidance."

Then I'll cov",1753,"Thanks, Andrés. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review our full year results, including proportional free cash flow, adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business units or SBU. Then I'll cover our 2015 capital allocation, our '16 guidance and longer-term expectations as well as our 2016 capital allocation.
Turning to Slide 17. Full year adjusted EPS of $1.22 was $0.08 lower than 2014. At a high level, we were impacted by the $0.11 impact from the roughly 30% average devaluation in foreign currencies, primarily the Brazilian real and Colombian peso; lower operating results in Brazil due to lower demand and a general economic slowdown; as well as lower commodity prices, particularly in the Dominican Republic. These negative drivers were partially offset by a reduction in share count of 6% or 40 million shares, lower parent interest expense and a slightly lower tax rate as well as improved hydrology in Panama and the benefit of new businesses, including Mong Duong in Vietnam. 
Turning to Slide 18. Overall, we generated $1.2 billion of proportional free cash flow, an increase of $350 million from last year, even though operating margin was down. As expected in the Dominican Republic, or DR, we settled our outstanding receivables. And in Chile, we recovered delayed VAT payments for the construction of Cochrane and Alto Maipo. We previously expected to be in the low end of our range if the PPA amendment in collection of receivables at Maritza in Bulgaria did not close. Although it has been delayed until 2016, we came in above the midpoint of our range as a result of improved collections and working capital improvements across our portfolio, some of which came late in 2015 rather than our prior expectation of collecting in 2016. We also earned $1.15 billion in adjusted PTC during the year, a decrease of $171 million. 
Now I'll cover our SBUs in more detail over the next 6 slides, beginning on Slide 19. In the U.S., our results reflect lower generation across our wind portfolio, lower contributions from IPL due to wholesale margins and a partial sell-down as well as from DPL, where a greater portion of energy was sold into the wholesale versus the retail market. Proportional free cash flow also reflects higher collections, lower inventory and a one-time contract termination payment at DPL in 2014. 
In Andes, our results reflect higher margins as a result of improved availability in Chile and higher energy prices at Chivor in Colombia, partially offset by the 27% devaluation of the Colombian peso. Proportional free cash flow also benefited from increased VAT refunds. PTC also reflects of the gain on the restructuring at Guacolda in Chile. 
In Brazil, our results reflect lower margins due to lower demand and a 29% devaluation in the Brazilian real. Proportional free cash flow also reflects higher interest expense, partially offset by the timing of energy purchases, lower tax payments and lower CapEx at Sul. PTC also includes the net unfavorable reversal of liabilities at Eletropaulo and Sul. 
In Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect lower margins as a result of lower LNG sales demand, ancillary service revenue and availability in the DR, partially offset by improved hydrology in Panama. Proportional free cash flow had a very strong increase in the collection of outstanding receivables in the DR as well as favorable timing of collections in Puerto Rico and Panama.  
In Europe, our results reflect lower margins due to the 16% devaluation of the euro, the 20% devaluation of the Kazakhstan tenge and the sales of our businesses in Nigeria and our wind business in U.K. Proportional free cash flow, however, was up due to higher collections in Bulgaria and Jordan. Lower PTC also reflects the reversal of a liability in Kazakhstan that was favorable in 2014. 
Finally, in Asia, our results benefited from higher margins as a result of the start of operations at Mong Duong in Vietnam as well as improved availability at Masinloc in the Philippines. Proportional free cash flow was negatively impacted by higher tax payments and the timing of collections and fuel payments at Masinloc. 
Now to Slide 25 and our parent capital allocation for 2015. Sources on the left-hand side reflect total available discretionary cash, roughly $1.6 billion, which is about $140 million higher than our expectation. This is largely a result of the approximate 4% sell-down of Gener in the fourth quarter. You may remember from our last call that we expected additional asset sale proceeds of approximately $150 million in our 2016 capital allocation plan. We were able to close this in '15 and now own approximately 67% of Gener, down from 71%. This brought our total asset sale proceeds for 2015 to $537 million. Parent free cash flow came in just above the midpoint of our range of $531 million. 
Turning to uses on the right-hand side. We allocated 91% of our discretionary cash toward debt pay-down and return to shareholders. Specifically, we used $345 million to refinance and prepay over $800 million of high coupon debt. This included reducing our overall debt by $240 million and the issuance of $575 million of 5.5% 10-year notes, which further extended our maturities and lowered interest expense. In addition to the dividend, we've invested $481 million in our shares. This brings total cash returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends to $757 million for 2015. Since our last call when we announced our $400 million authorization, we bought back $136 million, including $79 million in '16.
Turning to Slide 26 and our '16 guidance and 17, '18 expectations. As Andrés mentioned, our prior guidance was based on currency and commodity forward curves as of October 15. Bringing those curves forward to January 31 resulted in incremental impact of $0.10 on EPS or roughly $100 million. Our hedging activities have mitigated this impact by $0.03. Additionally since then, economic conditions in Brazil have also deteriorated by about $0.02. We've incorporated these impacts into our revised guidance. Our 2016 proportional free cash flow guidance is now $125 million lower with a revised midpoint of $1.175 billion. This reflects the $100 million in macro impacts I just discussed as well as the fact that our '15 proportional free cash flow benefited from the accelerated collections in the fourth quarter. 
Regarding parent free cash flow, we now expect 2016 to be $50 million lower with the midpoint of $575 million. Although this is below our previous expectation, it still represents roughly 10% growth relative to 2015. In 2017 and '18, we're still projecting at least 10% annual growth in cash flow but off the lower 2016 base. Our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance is now $0.95 to $1.05 or $0.10 below our prior guidance with the midpoint of $1. In 2017 and '18, we're maintaining our 12% to 16% growth rate but off the lower 2016 base. However, we do expect to be in the higher end of that range. 
Before turning to capital allocation, I want to provide updates on a couple of our businesses, beginning on Slide 27. Regarding Maritza in Bulgaria, recent energy sector reforms have now been enacted, resulting in an improvement in the financial position of our offtaker, NEK. We saw evidence of this in 2015 as collections were 24% higher than 2014. We've also seen progress recently in the financing process of NEK's parent to raise the funds necessary to settle our receivables. That said, our guidance includes only a modest portion of the outstanding receivables we expect to collect.
Also this week, DPL filed its Electric Security Plan, which included a request for a reliability rider. Our plan tracks the criteria set out by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, which are designed to improve rate stability for customers, ensure continued reliability and promote fuel diversity in Ohio while also ensuring the continued economic viability of DPL's plants based on a targeted 10.7% return on equity. We expect resolution of this filing later this year with the outcome effective at the beginning of 2017. We remain on track to have our generation and wires businesses separated by that time. 
Turning now to 2016 parent capital allocation on Slide 29. Sources on the left-hand side reflect $1.1 billion of total available discretionary cash. This is roughly $50 million less than our prior expectation reflecting lower parent free cash flow. Our discretionary cash could increase if we raise additional funds from asset sales.
Turning to uses on the right-hand side of the slide. With 10% growth in our dividend and share repurchases year-to-date, we're returning at least 1/3 of this cash to shareholders. Regarding debt reduction, improving our credit profile continues to be a priority. From a fixed income perspective, we benefit from lower financing costs and ensuring an access to capital. Equally important from an equity perspective, we think that continuing to strengthen our credit will help us get better recognition and valuation for our growing cash flows and dividend. Accordingly, we're targeting $200 million of debt reduction this year, over half of which we've already done. 
As an aside, we also continue to have good access to financial markets across our businesses, which is still open for attractive projects at favorable terms as we've seen recently with our advanced development projects and refinancings. As an example, just a couple of weeks ago, we closed a 15-year nonrecourse financing for our Masinloc expansion project in the Philippines, an all-in cost of less than 5%. We've earmarked $330 million for investments in our projects under construction as well as our expansion projects at Southland in California and in Panama. 
We will also be injecting $75 million into Sul in Brazil in support of debt restructuring, which will strengthen Sul's capital structure by paying down a portion of the $330 million in debt currently outstanding. The equity injection will also facilitate agreements to extend debt maturities to 2020 and '21. We believe there's meaningful value in the business above our equity contribution. And following this debt restructuring, which we expect to close shortly, we will be assessing all strategic alternatives for Sul. 
After considering these investments in our subs, our current dividend and debt prepayment, we're left with roughly $170 million of discretionary cash to be allocated.

Now I agree that the prospectus for Brazil for '15 was a terrible year, I think '16 is going to be bad. We don't expect a recovery in energy demand until about 2018. This is true. But I think you have to remember that we only own 16% of Eletropaulo. At today's market valuation, that's about $60 million of equity position, it's relatively small. It's a publicly listed company, so we're not going to comment on it. But I would say that we've been consistent in our strategy of, let's say, focusing our position in Brazil. And for example, when there was sort of a -- asset prices were high, there was a lot of pressure on us from -- to lever up Tietê and buy assets. We never did because we never thought that those were good investments. So looking at the big picture for Brazil, we have 2,600 megawatts of hydro. They're very well contracted over the next couple of years and much higher than today's spot prices. I think in the future, it's going to be hard to get that kind of hydro assets at a reasonable price. So Brazil again is in tough times. It's going to take some time to work its way out of it. But on the other hand, I think we have to take a longer-term perspective of AES's presence in Brazil, not referring to any specific asset."

What we are doing, I think, in many cases is capturing a lot of that value through our partnerships and using that money to reposition this portfolio. So we will look at all alternatives. We've always said that. I think maybe 1 year ago, YieldCos were in fashion, a lot of people were saying, ""Why don't you do a YieldCo?"" We really thought that from a fundamental point of view, and that's how we always look at things, dispassionately and fundamentally, that partnerships made more sense. They were cheaper. They didn't create obligations for new investments. And we think that strategy has paid off. So certainly, we have an open mind. And from time to time, we look at this. But it has to be something that really fundamentally unlocks value and is not something perhaps that's -- I don't know if the word would be in style or -- of the people. But we're always open to look at all alternatives. I think we've been very dispassionate in terms of our sale decisions. And we always look at things again from a fundamental point of view, whether that's investing new money. If we put new money, for example, into Sul, it's because we think that there's significant equity value there. So we do not have sort of emotional attachments to specific businesses."

Yes, no, I think our overall credit improvement comments are consistent with what we've said. And obviously when we say credit ratio or credit statistic improvement, there's 2 way to get there, the numerator and the denominator. We think more of the improvement will be in the numerator, i.e., parent free cash flow goes up, which is the distribution from subs is obviously a numerator that we look at the most for health of the parent credit. So we do expect growth. As we talked about, the 10% or more of growth in parent free cash flow is driven by subsidiary distributions. So it's more reducing debt and interest cost is a smaller part of the story, but it is part of the story. So I think just going back to what I said to Julien, I think we'll do $200 million this year. I think as we see it now, we'll probably do $100 million each of the next 2 years. And that's consistent, I think, with what we said over the last 6 to 12 months, which is about $100 million to $200 million a year. It's also pretty consistent with what we did last year. If you look at the debt we paid down, some it was attributable to asset sale proceeds. But about $150 million, $175 million was attributable to, in our minds, just paying down debt and trying to continue to advance our credit story. And once again, we think that we can get investment-grade-type stats over, let's call it, a 4- to 5-year period on a gradual step. I think the facts from the pathway is pretty consistent. I think it's more of a focus, let's say, certainly senior management, also at the board level, because we certainly are paying out a pretty healthy dividend. It's got 10% growth. And we really want to get shareholders to be comfortable in the stability and growth trajectory. And we think improving our credit will be part of that picture. Just the other things quickly to touch on, yes, Tietê still does have about $500 million of debt capacity. Like all our Brazilian utilities, they've got a debt-to-EBITDA coverage in a very modest debt, so about $500 million would be available under their overall debt docs [ph]. It might be a little cautious about that number today just because Brazil is a challenging place. But they certainly do have debt capacity. And as we look to grow in Tietê, it would be with that debt capacity. We do have other -- I mean, in general around our subs, we do look to optimize our businesses. Gener is BBB, BBB- right now. I think given the construction program, we don't see a lot of incremental capacity from Gener, though certainly past Alto Maipo, yes, there is. But we do look at debt capacity. Around the business, one place is in Masinloc, where we're increasing the plant, the facility site by 50% basically with the 300-megawatt increment. That is being done through a financing, that joint credit of existing Masinloc with new Masinloc that very much minimizes the amount of equity that we have to put in, the same story we did in the DR. We did in DR a $260 million project, basically putting no equity in because the new project was stapled to the old one. So we leveraged the available debt capacity in that fashion."

And at the subs, 95% of the debt in the functional currency of that business. And at the parent, 90% is fixed. So this is consistent with what we've been doing. I mean, we have been repositioning this debt to put ourselves in a strong position. When you, for example, had a tightening of credit over the last couple of years in global market, it's not affecting us. So this is consistent with that philosophy. It's just that as these new projects come online, we can give more guidance in terms of the strengthening of our credit into the next couple of years."

We have changed our contracting structure. There's a lot of water this year in South and Southeast of Brazil so that specter of rationing is gone, also with the drop in demand. We've also fortunately, I think, had done, I think, a good job. The team has done a good job in terms of contracting Tietê over the next couple of years.

I personally was down in Argentina and I can it's one of the most impressive executive teams I've seen anywhere anytime. So they've already started to liberalize tariffs and rationalize prices. But if you get to Brazil itself, I think that these assets are definitely sellable. I think it depends on the asset. There's still appetite. There's still local groups who have the capacity to buy this. There's still a lot of plays of consolidation in the sector. And you have foreign investors. You have Italians, Spanish investors, who are on the lookout -- and French, who are looking -- on the lookout for assets.

Today, I would like to start this call with a brief review of 2015, then I'll provide an update on the trends we're seeing across our portfolio, our action plans and the net impact of all of these factors on our",1896,"Thanks, Ahmed, and good morning, everyone. Today, I would like to start this call with a brief review of 2015, then I'll provide an update on the trends we're seeing across our portfolio, our action plans and the net impact of all of these factors on our 2016 guidance and long-term expectations. 
As you are all aware, we faced significant macroeconomic headwinds in 2015, including an average devaluation of nearly 30% at our non-U.S. dollar-denominated businesses. We also faced a decline of more than 5% in demand at our distribution businesses in Brazil, which is now in a deep recession. Both of these challenges are persisting in 2016, and we're taking actions to mitigate their impact on our financial results. Nonetheless, we continue to execute well on our long-term strategy to create sustainable shareholder value, simplifying our geographic footprint, improving our balance sheet and debt profile, fine-tuning our financial exposure by bringing in partners at the business and project level and profitably expanding our local platform. 
As a result of our consistent actions, in 2015, we were able to generate free cash flow of $1.24 billion, up 39% compared to 2014 and $66 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. This was reflected in the $531 million of parent free cash flow we generated, which is $8 million higher than 2014. And we increased our quarterly dividend for the third consecutive year to $0.11 per share, up 10% versus the previous year. Unfortunately, we were unable to overcome all of the $0.11 impact from macroeconomic headwinds we faced. And our resulting adjusted earnings per share was $1.22, down from $1.30 in 2014. This was within our revised guidance range of $0.03 below the low end of the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year.
Regarding capital allocation. We continued to return most of our discretionary cash to shareholder. Last year, we directed 62% of our discretionary cash toward share repurchases and dividends, specifically $481 million to share buybacks and $276 million to dividends. We also used $345 million or 28% of our discretionary cash to strengthen our balance sheet by prepaying and refinancing corporate debt. Our proactive steps over the past several years have put us in a strong liquidity position. Over the next 3 years, we only have $180 million of parent debt maturities, and we have already made 85% of our capital contributions towards our 5.6 gigawatts of projects currently under construction. To secure our earnings and cash flow growth over the next couple of years, in 2015, we brought online 1.5 gigawatts of new projects and continued to make good progress on the remaining 5.6 gigawatts of construction projects. About 90% of these projects are U.S. dollar-denominated and either regulated or have long-term PPAs. Finally, we advanced a few profitable platform expansion projects in California, Panama and the Philippines. 
Now turning to Slide 4 and our forecast for 2016. Over the last 2 years, currencies had devalued by as much as 40% to 55% and key commodities such as oil and gas had declined by 45% to 60%. The 2016 guidance we provided on our last call incorporated the impact from the macroeconomic factors I previously mentioned as of October 15. Unfortunately, these negative trends have continued. And based on our sensitivities to commodities and foreign currencies, we see an additional impact of $100 million on proportional free cash flow and $0.10 on adjusted earnings per share this year. Tom will provide additional color on the main drivers and their effects in a few minutes. Taking all of this into account, we expect to achieve at least 10% average annual growth in our free cash flow and 12% to 16% average annual growth in adjusted earnings per share through 2018, although off a lower 2016 base. Our expectations for this growth is based on 3 factors: continued performance improvement, projects currently under construction and capital allocation decisions. 
First, turning to Slide 5. Let us talk about continued performance improvement. As you may recall, since 2011, we have successfully implemented a cost-cutting program, which resulted in a 25% decrease in global overhead, equivalent to a run rate of $200 million of savings per year. Last quarter, we launched a new efficiency and revenue enhancement program to deliver an additional $150 million in savings per year by 2018. This new initiative includes further overhead cost reductions, procurement savings and operational efficiencies and improvements. We have already launched the programs that will allow us to realize $50 million in savings in 2016. And we are confident that we will realize $150 million in annual run rate by 2018.
Turning to Slide 6. Second, although we have directed the majority of our discretionary cash to share buybacks, debt prepayments and dividends over the past 4 years, we have also been prudently investing in platform expansion projects together with financial partners. These growth projects are key to positioning AES for sustainable growth over the medium term as well as maintaining our competitive edge. We are only investing in projects where we have an existing business, where we see attractive risk-adjusted returns and where we can attract financial partners. Partnerships both reduce risk and enhance returns as they provide an additional market read on our projects and often pay AES a promote or management fee. In fact, since 2011, we have raised more than $2.5 billion by incorporating financial partners on our construction projects and operating businesses. And as I said earlier, and as you can see on Slide 7, in 2015 alone, we brought online 6 projects for a total of nearly 1.5 gigawatts. And they were completed on time and on budget. 
Turning to Slide 8. We currently have an additional 5.6 gigawatts under construction, the majority of which are expected to come online through 2018 with an average return on equity of approximately 15%. The total cost of these projects is $7 billion and AES has already contributed 85% of its $1.2 billion in required equity contributions. A major milestone will be the completion of 1.6 gigawatts of environmental upgrades at our existing thermal generation plants at Indianapolis Power & Light. About 80% of our current construction pipeline is in the U.S. and Chile, where we are expanding our stable and U.S. dollar-denominated asset base at IPL and AES Gener. 
Now on to Slide 9. Over the past several years, we have experienced many of the disadvantages of having an international portfolio. However, one of the advantages is that having pruned our presence from 28 to 17 countries, most of the remaining emerging markets we are in continue to experience robust growth in energy demand, supporting the need for our product. In Panama, Vietnam and India, demand growth over the next 3 years is expected to be in the 6% to 10% range, while in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and the Philippines, growth is in the 3% to 5% range. One notable exception is Brazil, where demand for electricity dropped 5% in 2015 and we're not forecasting a recovery in levels of demand until 2018. Now let me touch on a few advanced development projects that will drive our growth beyond 2018. 
Turning to Slide 10. In the Philippines, where as I just mentioned, demand growth is expected to remain at around 5%. We plan to break ground in the first half of 2016 on a 300-megawatt expansion of our 630-megawatt Masinloc facility. The $750 million project will be funded with a combination of partner equity, local debt capacity and free cash flow from the business in the Philippines.
Now turning to Slide 11. In Panama, along with our local partner, Grupo Motta, we won a competitive bid for a 350-megawatt gas-fired combined-cycle generation plant with a 10-year U.S. dollar PPA. Using this bid as an anchor, we plan to build 180,000 cubic meter LNG regasification and storage facility, very similar to the one we built and have successfully operated for 13 years in the Dominican Republic. The facility will be strategically located near the entrance of the Panama Canal, allowing it to serve as a ship fuel bunkering hub as well as meeting unmet local and regional demand for natural gas. With the completion of a sister facility through our existing terminal on the Dominican Republic, we will be the largest LNG offtaker in the Caribbean and Central America. We expect to break ground this year and complete the project in 2018. As you can see on Slide 12, we've also achieved important milestones on the repowering of our Southland facility, where we were awarded a 20-year PPA by Southern California Edison for nearly 1.4 gigawatts of combined-cycle natural gas generation and energy storage. We're making good progress on permitting and licensing and expect to break ground in 2017 with commissioning beginning in 2020.
Finally, turning to Slide 13. We continue to maintain our leadership of lithium ion-based battery energy storage. We currently have 106 megawatts in operation in 4 countries. We have another 60 megawatts under construction and a further 228 megawatts in advanced-stage development in the U.S., Latin America and Asia, including 100 megawatts under contract in California. In addition to the nearly 400 megawatts that we have built or may build and our own business platform, we have reached important milestones towards third-party sales of our proprietary award-winning Advancion energy storage product. We recently signed an alliance agreement with the Mitsubishi Corporation to sell Advancion in Asia and Australia and a similar agreement with Eaton for select countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. As part of our drive to maintain the cost competitiveness of our product, we also signed an agreement with LG to supply batteries for our pipeline of energy storage projects.
In our current financial guidance, we do not include any material income from third-party sales of our Advancion product. We believe this is prudent since our alliance-based business model is in its initial phases. Nonetheless, we believe that the global market for energy storage solutions is expanding rapidly and will be quite large within 5 years as utilities respond to greater renewable penetration. AES's businesses in attractive markets around the world and our long-term relationships with local regulators and customers provide us with a unique advantage in opening the door to energy storage. We will keep you informed as our alliances progress. 
Turning to Slide 14. The third driver of our growth in per share, cash flow and earnings is our capital allocation strategy. Four years ago, we identified specific actions to improve total shareholder return, reduce risk and simplify our portfolio. Since then, we have used 81% of our discretionary cash toward share repurchases, dividends and debt prepayments. Since 2011, we have reduced our share count by 15% and our parent debt by 23%. We have completed timely exits from 11 countries and netted $3 billion in asset sale proceeds, including more than $500 million in 2015. As you can see on Slide 15, since 2012, we returned $2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, including $757 million or 12% of our current market cap in 2015. While I have discussed our growth opportunities in some detail, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders and reducing corporate leverage.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Tom to provide more color on our 2015 results and 2016 guidance."

Then I'll cover our 2015 capital allocation, our '16 guidance and longer-term expectations as well as our 2016 capital allocation.
Turning to Slide 17. Full year adjusted EPS of $1.22 was $0.08 lower than 2014. At a high level, we were impacted by the $0.11 impact from the roughly 30% average devaluation in foreign currencies, primarily the Brazilian real and Colombian peso; lower operating results in Brazil due to lower demand and a general economic slowdown; as well as lower commodity prices, particularly in the Dominican Republic. These negative drivers were partially offset by a reduction in share count of 6% or 40 million shares, lower parent interest expense and a slightly lower tax rate as well as improved hydrology in Panama and the benefit of new businesses, including Mong Duong in Vietnam. 
Turning to Slide 18. Overall, we generated $1.2 billion of proportional free cash flow, an increase of $350 million from last year, even though operating margin was down. As expected, in the Dominican Republic or DR, we settled our outstanding receivables. And in Chile, we recovered delayed VAT payments for the construction of Cochrane and Alto Maipo. We previously expected to be in the low end of our range if the PPA amendment in collection of receivables at Maritza in Bulgaria did not close. Although it has been delayed until 2016, we came in above the midpoint of our range as a result of improved collections and working capital improvements across our portfolio, some of which came late in 2015 rather than our prior expectation of collecting in 2016. We also earned $1.15 billion in adjusted PTC during the year, a decrease of $171 million. 
Now I'll cover our SBUs in more detail over the next 6 slides, beginning on Slide 19. In the U.S., our results reflect lower generation across our wind portfolio, lower contributions from IPL due to wholesale margins and a partial sell-down, as well as from DPL, where a greater portion of energy was sold into the wholesale versus the retail market. Proportional free cash flow also reflects higher collections, lower inventory and a one-time contract termination payment at DPL in 2014. 
In Andes, our results reflect higher margins as a result of improved availability in Chile and higher energy prices at Chivor in Colombia, partially offset by the 27% devaluation of the Colombian peso. Proportional free cash flow also benefited from increased VAT refunds. PTC also reflects the gain on the restructuring at Guacolda in Chile. 
In Brazil, our results reflect lower margins due to lower demand and a 29% devaluation in the Brazilian real. Proportional free cash flow also reflects higher interest expense, partially offset by the timing of energy purchases, lower tax payments and lower CapEx at Sul. PTC also includes the net unfavorable reversal of liabilities at Eletropaulo and Sul. 
In Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect lower margins as a result of lower LNG sales demand, ancillary service revenue and availability in the DR, partially offset by improved hydrology in Panama. Proportional free cash flow had a very strong increase in the collection of outstanding receivables in the DR as well as favorable timing of collections in Puerto Rico and Panama.  
In Europe, our results reflect lower margins due to the 16% devaluation of the euro, the 20% devaluation of the Kazakhstan tenge and the sales of our businesses in Nigeria and our wind business in U.K. Proportional free cash flow, however, was up due to higher collections in Bulgaria and Jordan. Lower PTC also reflects the reversal of a liability in Kazakhstan that was favorable in 2014. 
Finally, in Asia, our results benefited from higher margins as a result of the start of operations at Mong Duong in Vietnam as well as improved availability at Masinloc in the Philippines. Proportional free cash flow was negatively impacted by higher tax payments and the timing of collections and fuel payments at Masinloc. 
Now to Slide 25 and our parent capital allocation for 2015. Sources on the left-hand side reflect total available discretionary cash, roughly $1.6 billion, which is about $140 million higher than our expectation. This is largely a result of the approximate 4% sell-down of Gener in the fourth quarter. You may remember from our last call that we expected additional asset sale proceeds of approximately $150 million in our 2016 capital allocation plan. We were able to close this in '15 and now own approximately 67% of Gener, down from 71%. This brought our total asset sale proceeds for 2015 to $537 million. Parent free cash flow came in just above the midpoint of our range of $531 million. 
Turning to uses on the right-hand side. We allocated 91% of our discretionary cash toward debt pay-down and return to shareholders. Specifically, we used $345 million to refinance and prepay over $800 million of high coupon debt. This included reducing our overall debt by $240 million and the issuance of $575 million of 5.5% 10-year notes, which further extended our maturities and lowered interest expense. In addition to the dividend, we've invested $481 million in our shares. This brings total cash returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends to $757 million for 2015. Since our last call when we announced our $400 million authorization, we bought back $136 million, including $79 million in '16.
Turning to Slide 26 and our '16 guidance and '17, '18 expectations. As Andrés mentioned, our prior guidance was based on currency and commodity forward curves as of October 15. Bringing those curves forward to January 31 resulted in incremental impact of $0.10 on EPS or roughly $100 million. Our hedging activities have mitigated this impact by $0.03. Additionally since then, economic conditions in Brazil have also deteriorated by about $0.02. We've incorporated these impacts into our revised guidance. Our 2016 proportional free cash flow guidance is now $125 million lower with a revised midpoint of $1.175 billion. This reflects the $100 million in macro impacts I just discussed as well as the fact that our '15 proportional free cash flow benefited from the accelerated collections in the fourth quarter. 
Regarding parent free cash flow, we now expect 2016 to be $50 million lower with the midpoint of $575 million. Although this is below our previous expectation, it still represents roughly 10% growth relative to 2015. In 2017 and '18, we're still projecting at least 10% annual growth in cash flow but off the lower 2016 base. Our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance is now $0.95 to $1.05 or $0.10 below our prior guidance with the midpoint of $1. In 2017 and '18, we're maintaining our 12% to 16% growth rate but off the lower 2016 base. However, we do expect to be in the higher end of that range. 
Before turning to capital allocation, I want to provide updates on a couple of our businesses, beginning on Slide 27. Regarding Maritza in Bulgaria, recent energy sector reforms have now been enacted, resulting in an improvement in the financial position of our offtaker, NEK. We saw evidence of this in 2015 as collections were 24% higher than 2014. We've also seen progress recently in the financing process of NEK's parent to raise the funds necessary to settle our receivables. That said, our guidance includes only a modest portion of the outstanding receivables we expect to collect.
Also this week, DPL filed its Electric Security Plan, which included a request for a reliability rider. Our plan tracks the criteria set out by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, which are designed to improve rate stability for customers, ensure continued reliability and promote fuel diversity in Ohio while also ensuring the continued economic viability of DPL's plants based on a targeted 10.7% return on equity. We expect resolution of this filing later this year with the outcome effective at the beginning of 2017. We remain on track to have our generation and wires businesses separated by that time. 
Turning now to 2016 parent capital allocation on Slide 29. Sources on the left-hand side reflect $1.1 billion of total available discretionary cash. This is roughly $50 million less than our prior expectation reflecting lower parent free cash flow. Our discretionary cash could increase if we raise additional funds from asset sales.
Turning to uses on the right-hand side of the slide. With 10% growth in our dividend and share repurchases year-to-date, we're returning at least 1/3 of this cash to shareholders. Regarding debt reduction, improving our credit profile continues to be a priority. From a fixed income perspective, we benefit from lower financing costs and ensuring an access to capital. Equally important, from an equity perspective, we think that continuing to strengthen our credit will help us get better recognition and valuation for our growing cash flows and dividend. Accordingly, we're targeting $200 million of debt reduction this year, over half of which we've already done. 
As an aside, we also continue to have good access to financial markets across our businesses, which is still open for attractive projects at favorable terms as we've seen recently with our advanced development projects and refinancings. As an example, just a couple of weeks ago, we closed a 15-year nonrecourse financing for our Masinloc expansion project in the Philippines, an all-in cost of less than 5%. We've earmarked $330 million for investments in our projects under construction as well as our expansion projects at Southland in California and in Panama. 
We will also be injecting $75 million into Sul in Brazil in support of debt restructuring, which will strengthen Sul's capital structure by paying down a portion of the $330 million in debt currently outstanding. The equity injection will also facilitate agreements to extend debt maturities to 2020 and '21. We believe there's meaningful value in the business above our equity contribution. And following this debt restructuring, which we expect to close shortly, we will be assessing all strategic alternatives for Sul. 
After considering these investments in our subs, our current dividend and debt prepayment, we're left with roughly $170 million of discretionary cash to be allocated. As in years past, much of this cash is weighted towards the latter part of the year. We'll continue to invest this cash consistent with our capital allocation framework.
With that, I'll now pass it back to Andrés."

Now I agree that the prospectus for Brazil for '15 was a terrible year, I think '16 is going to be bad. We don't expect a recovery in energy demand until about 2018. This is true. But I think you have to remember that we only own 16% of Eletropaulo. At today's market valuation, that's about $60 million of equity position, it's relatively small. It's a publicly listed company, so we're not going to comment on it. But I would say that we've been consistent in our strategy of, let's say, focusing our position in Brazil. And for example, when there was a sort of a -- asset prices were high, there was a lot of pressure on us from -- to lever up Tietê and buy assets. We never did because we never thought that those were good investments. So looking at the big picture for Brazil, we have 2,600 megawatts of hydro. They're very well contracted over the next couple of years and much higher than today's spot prices. I think in the future, it's going to be hard to get that kind of hydro assets at a reasonable price. So Brazil again is in tough times. It's going to take some time to work its way out of it. But on the other hand, I think we have to take a longer-term perspective of AES's presence in Brazil, not referring to any specific asset."

What we are doing, I think, in many cases is capturing a lot of that value through our partnerships and using that money to reposition this portfolio. So we will look at all alternatives. We've always said that. I think maybe a year ago, YieldCos were in fashion, a lot of people were saying, ""Why don't you do a YieldCo?"" We really thought that from a fundamental point of view, and that's how we always look at things, dispassionately and fundamentally, that partnerships made more sense. They were cheaper. They didn't create obligations for new investments. And we think that strategy has paid off. So certainly, we have an open mind. And from time to time, we look at this. But it has to be something that really fundamentally unlocks value and is not something perhaps that's -- I don't know if the word would be in style or -- of the people. But we're always open to look at all alternatives. I think we've been very dispassionate in terms of our sale decisions. And we always look at things again from a fundamental point of view, whether that's investing new money. If we put new money, for example, into Sul, it's because we think that there's significant equity value there. So we do not have sort of emotional attachments to specific businesses."

Yes, no, I think our overall credit improvement comments are consistent with what we've said. And obviously when we say credit ratio or credit statistic improvement, there's 2 ways to get there, the numerator and the denominator. We think more of the improvement will be in the numerator, i.e., parent free cash flow goes up, which is, the distributions from subs is obviously a numerator that we look at the most for health of the parent credit. So we do expect growth. As we talked about, the 10% or more of growth in parent free cash flow is driven by subsidiary distributions. So it's more the reducing debt and interest cost is a smaller part of the story, but it is part of the story. So I think just going back to what I said to Julien, I think we'll do $200 million this year. I think as we see it now, we'll probably do $100 million each of the next 2 years. And that's consistent, I think, with what we said over the last 6 to 12 months, which is about $100 million to $200 million a year. It's also pretty consistent with what we did last year. If you look at the debt we paid down, some it was attributable to asset sale proceeds. But about $150 million, $175 million was attributable to, in our minds, just paying down debt and trying to continue to advance our credit story. And once again, we think that we can get investment-grade-type stats over, let's call it, a 4- to 5-year period on a gradual step. I think the facts in the pathway is pretty consistent. I think it's more of a focus, let's say, certainly senior management, also at the board level, because we certainly are paying out a pretty healthy dividend. It's got 10% growth. And we really want to get shareholders to be comfortable in the stability and growth trajectory. And we think improving our credit will be part of that picture. Just the other things quickly to touch on, yes, Tietê still does have about $500 million of debt capacity. Like all our Brazilian utilities, they've got a debt-to-EBITDA coverage in a very modest debt, so about $500 million would be available under their overall debt docs [ph]. It might be a little cautious about that number today just because Brazil is a challenging place. But they certainly do have debt capacity. And as we look to grow in Tietê, it would be with that debt capacity. We do have other -- I mean, in general around our subs, we do look to optimize our businesses. Gener is BBB, BBB- right now. I think given the construction program, we don't see a lot of incremental capacity from Gener, though I'll -- certainly past Alto Maipo, yes, there is. But we do look at debt capacity around the businesses, one place is in Masinloc, where we're increasing the plant, the facility size by 50% basically with the 300-megawatt increment. That is being done through a financing, that joint credit of existing Masinloc with new Masinloc that very much minimizes the amount of equity that we have to put in, the same story we did in the DR. We did in DR a $260 million project, basically putting no equity in because the new project was stapled to the old one. So we leveraged the available debt capacity in that fashion."

At the parent side, we only have $180 million of maturities at the parent. And that's in 2018. So we have no maturities at the parent this year or next. And at the subs, 95% of the debt's in the functional currency of that business. And at the parent, 90% is fixed. So this is consistent with what we've been doing. I mean, we have been repositioning this debt to put ourselves in a strong position. When you, for example, had a tightening of credit over the last couple of years in global market, it's not affecting us. So this is consistent with that philosophy. It's just that as these new projects come online, we can give more guidance in terms of the strengthening of our credit into the next couple of years."

We've also fortunately, I think, had done, I think, a good job. The team's done a good job in terms of contracting Tietê over the next couple of years.

Even in a place like Argentina, we're seeing greater investor interest because a lot of the moves that the government has taken are seen very favorably. I personally was down in Argentina and I can say it's one of the most impressive executive teams I've seen anywhere anytime. So they've already started to liberalize tariffs and rationalize prices. But if you get to Brazil itself, I think that these assets are definitely sellable. I think it depends on the asset. There's still appetite. There's still local groups who have the capacity to buy this. There's still a lot of plays of consolidation in the sector. And you have foreign investors. You have Italians, Spanish investors, who are on the lookout -- and French, who are looking -- on the lookout for assets. So I would say that even though Brazil again is the market that's not growing and at the same time, I think for quality assets, there are definitely buyers.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter financial review call. Today, I will discuss our first quarter results and provide updates on our progress on our strategic objectives, macro conditions in our markets and our construction and development program. 
Since our last call in late February, we have achieved a number of key objectives for 2016. We received payment of all outstanding receivables in Bulgaria. We are on track to achieve our 3-year $150 million cost reduction and revenue enhancement goals. We saw improvements in our credit ratings and outlook from the rating agencies. Our $7.5 billion construction program is advancing on schedule and will be the major contributor to our cash and earnings growth over the next 3 years. 
We continue to leverage our existing business platforms by advancing projects with long-term contracts denominated in U.S. dollars. During the first quarter, we achieved significant milestones on 3 new projects, which will contribute to our growth after 2018. I will discuss these achievements in more detail in a moment. But first, I'd like to summarize our financial results on Slide 4. 
In the first quarter, we generated proportional free cash flow of $253 million in line with last year. The recent collection of $350 million in Bulgaria will be reflected in our second quarter cash flow. Our first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.13, which is considerably lower than the $0.25 we earned last year. Our first quarter operating performance was impacted by adverse movements in FX, lower power prices in the U.S. and the expiration of the power purchase agreement at Tietê in Brazil. 
Our earnings performance was also driven by a tax rate of 50% for the first quarter, which is really a timing issue. We continue to expect a 31% to 33% tax rate for the full year. 
In terms of our outlook for the full year, we are reaffirming our guidance on all financial metrics. Nonetheless, we expect our first half adjusted EPS to be relatively weak due to the continuing impact from the factors I just mentioned and schedule major maintenance in the second quarter. Now I'll turn to our strategic accomplishments since our last call. 
As you can see on Slide 5, we have successfully resolved the outstanding receivables issue at Maritza in Bulgaria. Maritza's sole customer, the National Electricity Company or NEK, have fallen significantly behind on its payments. In April, we received full payment of the outstanding receivables of $350 million. This is a direct result of the steps taken by the Government of Bulgaria to strengthen the financial position of NEK and the long-term sustainability of the energy sector. By meeting all of its contractual obligations, Bulgaria is sending a very positive signal to all foreign investors. Currently, Maritza's providing clinically needed power to the Bulgarian electric grid, and we have been collecting in a timely manner since December 2015. Turning now to Slide 6 and our cost savings and revenue enhancement initiative. 
Our goal is to achieve a run rate of $150 million per year in bottom line improvements. We are on track to achieve our $50 million goal for 2016 and the additional $100 million through 2018. These bottom line benefits are largely driven by global procurement efforts, moving back-office functions the lower-cost service centers in Argentina and Bulgaria, and continued improvement in the performance of our plans. Now turning to Slide 7. 
I'll discuss macro conditions in our markets. First, the impact from hydrology in Latin America should be negligible this year. While cumulative rainfall remains below-average in Panama, it is generally improved in the rest of Latin America. Regarding Panama, spot prices have fallen significantly as a result of the barge base powerplant we commissioned there last year, which reduced the effects of low rainfall on our contracted Hydro plants. 
Second, economic conditions in our markets are generally in line with prior expectations, except for Brazil, which is experiencing a deepening recession. At our distribution businesses in Brazil, we are now seeing a second consecutive year of 5% decline in demand. While in the U.S, demand is essentially flat, in most of our other markets, we'll continue to see energy demand growth in the range of 4% to 10%. Moving on to Slide 8. 
We are focusing our investment efforts on platform expansion projects with long-term contracts and U.S. dollar denominated revenues. We see a significant opportunity to take a leading role in the distribution and storage of LNG in Central America and the Caribbean. Turning to Slide 9. 
Let us review our major new projects. During the quarter, we started construction on the 335-megawatt Masinloc expansion to take advantage of robust growth in the Philippines and our existing infrastructure. The new unit, Masinloc 2, will be one of the most competitive thermal plants in the country, employing highly efficient and flexible supercritical technology. The $740 million project will be funded by a combination of non-recourse financing, partner equity and cash generated at the Masinloc 1 facility. Moving on to slide 10. 
I am pleased to report that we have achieved a number of milestones on our Colon project in Panama. This project encompasses both a 380-megawatt combined cycle plant, or CCGT, and an adjacent LNG regasification terminal and storage facility. The CCGT is contracted under 10-year U.S. dollar denominated PPA. The LNG facility will have 180,000 cubic meter tank, which is sufficient to handle 80 terra BTU annually. 
Our CCGT will use about 1/4 of a's tanks capacity, leaving substantial unused capacity to meet the needs of additional power plants or downstream customers. The Colon project seeks to replicate the success of our LNG facilities in the Dominican Republic, which provides gas to our adjacent powerplant, another power plant via pipeline and to numerous downstream customers in the transportation and industrial sectors. The Colon Project is strategically located near the entrance of the Panama Canal and will be able offer bunkling to the maritime industry as it starts use natural gases of fuel. There are many commercial synergies between the LNG terminals in the Dominican Republic and Panama. And with both facilities in service, we will become the largest provider of LNG regasification and storage services in Central America and the Caribbean. 
All of the Colon Project's permits are in place and have selected the EPC contractor. Project financing for approximately 60% of the project cost is well underway. AES' equity is expected to be around $200 million, which we will fund over the construction period. The project is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016 with completion of the powerplant in 2018 and the LNG facility in 2019. 
As we can see on Slide 11, the repowering of Southland in California is another example of a large project that will contribute to our growth beyond 2018. As a reminder, we were awarded a 20-year PPA by Southern California Edison for 1,384-megawatt of capacity, which includes 100 megawatts of energy storage and 1,284 megawatts of combined cycle gas capacity. Since our last call, we have signed turbine supply agreements and EPC contracts to build the CCGT. We are making good progress on the remaining regulatory approvals and expect to break ground in 2017 with completion in 2020. We anticipate funding the $2 billion total project cost with a combination of non-recourse debt and $500 million in equity from AES and a possible financial partner. Turning to Slide 12. 
We remain optimistic on the future battery base energy storage and our leadership position in this market. We currently have 116 megawatts of energy storage projects in operation across 4 countries and expect to install another 50 megawatts this year. Additionally, we have another 228 megawatts in advanced stage development, including the 100 megawatts under contract in California. By 2017, we expect to be operating in 7 countries, adding India, the Philippines and the Dominican Republic to the 4 countries where we already operate, the U.S, the U.K, the Netherlands and Chile. 
We see growth in our energy storage business through 2 paths. AES' own projects, such as the previously discussed 100 megawatts with the PPA with Southern California Edison and sales of our Advancion energy storage solution by AES in our channel partners. These sales were target utilities and other large energy storage customers. 
First, regarding long-term contracts. We see significant potential in many of our markets, including the U.S, the U.K, the Philippines and Mexico. We continue to work with local regulators to facilitate the development of market structures that enable new investments in battery base energy storage. 
Second, over the past 8 years, we have learned a tremendous amount about how to integrate the various components to create a proprietary battery based energy storage solution, which we have named Advancion. Tp promote Advancion sales in many more markets, we have executed general partner agreement with Mitsubishi for sales in Asia and with Eaton for sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. We are in discussions with other potential partners to sell Advancion in additional markets. 
Although battery based energy storage is still early on in its product cycle, we believe that Advancion presents an interesting opportunity for upside in our cash and earnings forecast. Turning now to our projects under construction on Slide 13. 
Our ongoing construction program is the most significant driver of our growth over the next few years. We expect to commission 6 gigawatts of new capacity from projects currently under construction through the first half of 2019. As a reminder, total capital expenditure for these projects is $7.5 billion. However, by using financial partners, AES' equity commitment is reduced to $1.3 billion. AES' equity commitment all but $160 million has already been funded. 
As you can see on Slide 13, roughly 74% of our investments are in the Americas, and of this, a majority is in the U.S. and Chile. We expect an average return on equity from these projects of approximately 15%. About 3 gigawatts representing half of the capacity currently under construction are 90% complete and are on track to come online, on time and on budget this year. 
In 2017, we plan to commission an additional 670 megawatts of capacity in the U.S. and 112 megawatts in the Dominican Republic. We have completed about 70% of the work on these 2 projects, and we also expect them to come online, on time and on budget. 
The remaining 3 major projects now under construction, Masinloc 2, PBGC 2 and Alto Maipo all projected to come online in late 2018 and early 2019. This construction program will drive visible and attractive growth in both free cash flow and earnings. 
As you can see on Slide 14, we expect at least 10% annual growth in proportional free cash flow through 2018, which will support our 10% annual growth in dividends, continued deleveraging of the parent and subsidiaries, and investments in attractive platform expansions. Turning now to Slide 15. 
We also see robust growth in earnings through 2018. From 2016 to 2018, we expect an attractive growth rate of 12% to 16% in our adjusted EPS. Approximately 5% of this annual growth rate is driven by cost reductions and revenue enhancements. Another 8% to 10% of expected growth is driven by the 2.4 gigawatts of construction projects coming online in 2017 and 2018. 
Based on our strong market position and attractive high-growth markets, we're optimistic about our ability to drive growth beyond 2018. The 3 projects I just discussed, Masinloc 2, Colon and Southland will come fully online after 2018. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss our first quarter results, capital allocations and full year guidance in more detail."

Today, I will review our first quarter results, including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business units or SBU. And I'll cover our 2016 capital alloc",1582,"Thanks, Andres. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will review our first quarter results, including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business units or SBU. And I'll cover our 2016 capital allocation, as well as our 2016 guidance. Turning to Slide 17. 
First quarter adjusted EPS of $0.13 was $0.12 lower than 2015. Much of this decline was driven by factors incorporated into our full year guidance with certain exceptions, primarily the decline in power markets in the U.S., as well as lower demand in Brazil. Specifically, our results reflect the $0.04 impact from a significantly higher quarterly tax rate of 50% in 2016 versus 33% in '15. This was mostly driven by the timing of certain tax expenses, the largest of which was of the enactment of income tax reforms in Chile. 
We do expect the rate to recover during the year to a full year tax rate of 31% to 33%. Next, the $0.04 impact from the valuation of foreign currencies, as expected, primarily Latin America and Europe. And also, $0.05 lower contributions from our SBUs mainly due to anticipated drivers, such as the expiration of Tietê's PPA with Eletropaulo. 
In addition to the drivers included in our expectations, we also saw some softness in power markets and mild weather in the U.S. That being said, we've seen some recovery in prices in the last month, which will contribute to our stronger second half of the or helps give us comfort in our full year outlook. Now to Slide 18. 
Our overall results were primarily driven by lower margins in our Brazil, Europe and U.S. SBUs due to the factors I just mentioned. We generated $253 million in proportional free cash flow, a modest decrease of $12 million from last year, reflecting lower margins mostly offset by higher collections at our Brazil utilities and lower working capital requirements in Vietnam. 
We also warrant $172 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of $80 million. Now I'll cover our SBUs in more detail over the next 6 slides beginning on Slide 19. 
In the U.S., our results reflect lower margins at DPL due to lower wholesale prices and lower contributions from regulated customers, lower contributions from IPL due to mild weather and a partial sell down and the sale of our Media Mountain Wind project. Proportional free cash flow also reflects unfavorable working capital changes at IPL. 
In Andes, our results reflect the 40% devaluation of the Argentine peso, 24% deval of the Columbia peso and lower volumes at Chivor in Colombia. Proportional free cash flow was also impacted by higher tax payments in Chile. PTC also reflects lower equity and earnings at Guacolda in Chile. 
In Brazil, our results reflect lower margins to the expiration of Tietê's PPA with Electropaulo in 2015, lower demand at Sul and Eletropaulo and the 26% evaluation of the Brazilian real. Proportional free cash flow also reflects higher collections in Sul and Eletropaulo, as well as the favorable timing of energy purchases at Tietê. 
Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect modestly lower margins. Proportional free cash flow largely reflects higher-than-normal collections in the Dominican Republic in 2015. 
In Europe, our results reflect lower margins due to the 48% devaluation of the physics and tenge and lower dark spread that occurred in the UK. Proportional free cash flow also effects the timing the timing of payments to the fuel supplier in Bulgaria and the unfavorable timing of working capital and tax payments in the U.K. 
Finally, in Asia, our results benefited from higher margins and lower buildup of working capital as a result of the start of operations at Mong Duong in Vietnam in April of 2015. Turning to Slide 25. I'll now provide an update in all regulatory filing at DPL in Ohio. 
As you may recall, in February, DPL filed into electric security plan. Since that time, there've been challenges to regulation in Ohio. This of the potential for similar arguments to impact the structure of other utilities proposals pending before the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. Consequently, when we filed our plan, we included an alternative to proposal that provide an option for the PUCO to approve a nonbypassable charge structured in the same way as one approved in our existing ESP. 
We believe that this alternative falls under the PUCO's severity and also achieve the policy goals set up by the commission. We continue to believe this alternative provides a viable path forward for DPL and Ohio, and the commission is seeking for a reasonable resolution for the matter before the end of this year. Turning now to our 2016 parent capital allocation on Slide 26. 
Sources on the left-hand side continue to reflect $1.1 billion of total available discretionary cash, which includes $575 million in parent free cash flow and announced asset sales. We remain confident in our 2016 parent free cash flow range of $525 million to $625 million, which are the foundation of our discretionary cash available for dividend growth and value creation. Turning to the uses on the right-hand side of the slide, consistent with our capital allocation plan that we've shown during our last call, with 10% growth in our dividend and share repurchases year-to-date, we're returning at least 1/3 of this cash to shareholders. Going forward, we see our dividend as the primary means to distribute cash to shareholders. 
Stock repurchases should be less material as in proceeds with additional asset sales and partnerships. Regarding debt reduction, we're making good progress on our $200 million target for the year on our longer-term goal of parent credit improvement. In fact, year-to-date, we've prepaid $125 million of parent debt. Taking advantage of weak market conditions early in the quarter, we were able to buy this debt at a 7% discount. 
We're also seeing positive momentum on the ratings front. In March, Moody's changed our parent credit outlook from stable to positive. And in April, S&P upgraded our rating from BB- minus to BB. These actions reflect our continued efforts to derisk our portfolio and improve our credit metrics. 
We think the continuing to strengthen our credit will help us get better recognition and valuation for our growing cash flow and dividend. This positive quite a trend, along with an overall market improvement, has allowed us to continue to be opportunistic regarding refinancing and extending maturities. To that end, last 3, we extended an $800 million parent revolver maturity from 2018 to 2021. Also last week, on the non-recourse side, our business in the Dominican Republic was able to replace a short-term financing with a new $370 million, 10-year bond at more favorable terms. 
We've also earmarked $330 million for investments in our subsidiaries, but 13, of which is through our Colon project in Panama and in Southpoint in California coming online after 2018. 
Finally, after considering these investments in our subs, our current dividend and debt prepayment were left with roughly $150 million of discretionary cash, which we'll invest consistent with our capital allocation framework. As the year's past, much of this cash is weighted towards the latter part of the year. Now to slide 27. 
We are reaffirming our guidance in 2017, '18 expectations for all metrics based on foreign currency and commodity forward curves as of April 30. We continue to generate strong proportional free cash flow, which we relatively evenly distributed in the first and second half of the year. And with the settlement of all outstanding receivables at Maritza, we expect our first half proportional free cash flow to be well ahead of last year's. 
Regarding adjusted EPS, consistent with the first quarter, we also expect the second quarter to be lower than normal. In fact, we're forecasting that 70% to 75% of our 2016 adjusted EPS we recorded in the second half of 2016 versus about 60% in past years. There are a few reasons that our results were stronger in the second half than first half. 
First, we expect a lower tax rate the next 3 quarters. In any given year, there are certain items that influence quarterly rate, but tend to normalize on a full year basis. As I mentioned earlier, in the first quarter, we recognize a higher than usual tax expense, which we combined with relatively low first quarter earnings, had an outsized impact on our tax rate for the quarter. This tax expense was anticipated in our guidance. And accordingly, we continue to expect a 31% to 33% tax rate in 2016. 
Second, a higher concentration of scheduled maintenance in the first half of the year will position us for stronger performance in the second half. For example, San Nicolas, plants in Argentina, plant major maintenance the entire second quarter as part of its regular maintenance cycle that occurs about every 8 years. A few of our other plants have similar circumstances. 
Third, forward curves for FX and commodities reflect some improvement over the balance of the year, which will provide a benefit in the second half. Fourth, this year's $50 million in cost reductions is more heavily weighted towards the second half. And lastly, we expect to benefit from a couple of items that we are working on to partially offset lower demand in Brazil and our power prices in the U.S.  We are in a better position to discuss these later in the year. 
With that, I'll now turn it back over to Andres."

To summarize our views on this call, we continue to generate strong proportional free cash flow, which will be evenly distributed between the first and second half of the year. Although we expect our first half adjusted EPS to be relatively weak, many of the negative drivers will reverse in the second half and therefore, we are reaffirming our guidance for all financial metrics. 
In terms of our strategic priorities, in the first few months of this year, we've made significant progress, including resolving the outstanding receivables issue in Bulgaria; receiving positive actions from the rating agencies resulting from our actions to derisk the portfolio and delever the parent; reaffirming our double-digit growth through 2018 in both cash flow and earnings, driven by our largely funded construction program and $150 million in cost savings and revenue enhancements; and achieving significant milestones on 3 new projects in our development pipeline to drive growth beyond 2018. 
I am optimistic about the future of AES. We are delivering strong and growing free cash flow, which we will continue to use to maximize risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. The 6 gigawatts we currently have under construction is the largest driver of our expected growth of at least 10% in free cash flow through 2018. Beyond 2018, we are well-positioned to capture new opportunities due to our strong business platforms in attractive and growing markets and our leadership position in deploying new technologies.

So that would be next year when we sort of move out an additional year. What we wanted to do was give you color that our growth will continue post-2018. In fact, that we have a good pipeline through 2020 that we recently added to. So that was really the point of this call. Now talking about the facility in Panama. Colon facility. So it has 2 parts. As you said, one's a 380-megawatt combined cycle of gas plant and 10-year PPA with a credit worthy offtaker in dollars. The second is a tank. And the tank, we are using about 1/4 of the capacity for this plant. This leaves about 3/4. So it's really a question of tolling. We're not going to be taking commodity risk on this. So this could be tolling fuel for other power plants. We did this in the Dominican Republic. We are using it. We built a pipeline to the -- our own actually BPP facility and converted from diesel to natural gas, and were also selling it in there to the transportation and industrial sectors. So what we would have in Panama is first to meet domestic demand. There are power plants nearby. There are other power plants that revealed that we think require natural gas. So that's first use. Transportation and industrial use will be second, following the model we had in the Dominican Republic. And third, which is very interesting is the ship bunkering. We would not be doing the bunkering. We will actually have somebody else do that, but they would use our storage and recap regas capacity. So the way to think about this is you'll basically bringing large efficient LNG tankers. You a load them in Panama and the Dominican Republic, and then you have various means of delivering gas to various types of customers or actually, LNG as well. So we did not plan to take any commodity risk per se on these transactions. We've been providing a service, regasification service, a bunkering service and a hub service. And between the 2, this gives us a very attractive position to be able to service people who want services in Panama and the Dominican Republic."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter financial review call. Today, I will discuss our first quarter results and provide updates on our progress on our strategic objectives, macro conditions in our markets and our construction and development program. 
Since our last call in late February, we have achieved a number of key objectives for 2016. We received payment of all outstanding receivables in Bulgaria. We are on track to achieve our 3-year $150 million cost-reduction and revenue-enhancement goals. We saw improvements in our credit ratings and outlook from the rating agencies. Our $7.5 billion construction program is advancing on schedule and will be the major contributor to our cash and earnings growth over the next 3 years. 
We continue to leverage our existing business platforms by advancing projects with long-term contracts denominated in U.S. dollars. During the first quarter, we achieved significant milestones on 3 new projects, which will contribute to our growth after 2018. I will discuss these achievements in more detail in a moment. But first, I'd like to summarize our financial results on Slide 4. 
In the first quarter, we generated proportional free cash flow of $253 million, in line with last year. The recent collection of $350 million in Bulgaria will be reflected in our second quarter cash flow. Our first quarter adjusted EPS was $1 -- was $0.13, which is considerably lower than the $0.25 we earned last year. Our first quarter operating performance was impacted by adverse movements in FX, lower power prices in the U.S. and the expiration of the power purchase agreement at Tietê in Brazil. Our earnings performance was also driven by a tax rate of 50% for the first quarter, which is really a timing issue. We continue to expect a 31% to 33% tax rate for the full year. 
In terms of our outlook for the full year, we are reaffirming our guidance on all financial metrics. Nonetheless, we expect our first half adjusted EPS to be relatively weak due to the continuing impact from the factors I just mentioned and schedule major maintenance in the second quarter. Now I'll turn to our strategic accomplishments since our last call. 
As you can see on Slide 5, we have successfully resolved the outstanding receivables issue at Maritza in Bulgaria. Maritza's sole customer, the National Electricity Company, or NEK, had fallen significantly behind on its payments. In April, we received full payment of the outstanding receivables of $350 million. This is a direct result of the steps taken by the government of Bulgaria to strengthen the financial position of NEK and the long-term sustainability of the energy sector. By meeting all of its contractual obligations, Bulgaria is sending a very positive signal to all foreign investors. Currently, Maritza's providing clinically needed power to the Bulgarian electric grid, and we have been collecting in a timely manner since December 2015. 
Turning now to Slide 6 and our cost savings and revenue enhancement initiative. Our goal is to achieve a run rate of $150 million per year in bottom line improvement. We are on track to achieve our $50 million goal for 2016 and the additional $100 million through 2018. These bottom line benefits are largely driven by global procurement efforts, moving back-office functions to lower-cost service centers in Argentina and Bulgaria and continued improvements in the performance of our plans. 
Now turning to Slide 7. I'll discuss macro conditions in our markets. First, the impact from hydrology in Latin America should be negligible this year. While cumulative rainfall remains below average in Panama, it is generally improved in the rest of Latin America. Regarding Panama, spot prices have fallen significantly as a result of the barge base power plant we commissioned there last year, which reduced the effects of low rainfall on our contracted hydro plants. 
Second, economic conditions in our markets are generally in line with prior expectations, except for Brazil, which is experiencing a deepening recession. At our distribution businesses in Brazil, we are now seeing a second consecutive year of 5% decline in demand. While in the U.S., demand is essentially flat. In most of our other markets, we continue to see energy demand growth in the range of 4% to 10%. 
Moving on to Slide 8. We are focusing our investment efforts on platform expansion projects with long-term contracts and U.S. dollar-denominated revenues. We see a significant opportunity to take a leading role in the distribution and storage of LNG in Central America and the Caribbean. 
Turning to Slide 9. Let us review our major new projects. During the quarter, we started construction on the 335-megawatt Masinloc expansion to take advantage of robust growth in the Philippines and our existing infrastructure. The new unit, Masinloc 2, will be one of the most competitive thermal plants in the country, employing highly efficient and flexible supercritical technology. The $740 million project will be funded by a combination of nonrecourse financing, partner equity and cash generated at the Masinloc 1 facility. 
Moving on to slide 10. I am pleased to report that we have achieved a number of milestones on our Colon project in Panama. This project encompasses both a 380-megawatt combined cycle plant, or CCGT, and an adjacent LNG regasification terminal and storage facility. The CCGT is contracted under a 10-year U.S. dollar-denominated PPA. The LNG facility will have 180,000 cubic meter tank, which is sufficient to handle 80 terra BTU annually. Our CCGT will use about 1/4 of the tank's capacity, leaving substantial unused capacity to meet the needs of additional power plants or downstream customers. The Colon project seeks to replicate the success of our LNG facilities in the Dominican Republic, which provide gas to our adjacent power plant, another power plant via pipeline and to numerous downstream customers in the transportation and industrial sectors. The Colon project is strategically located near the entrance of the Panama Canal and will be able offer bunkering to the maritime industry as it starts to use natural gases of fuel. There are many commercial synergies between the LNG terminals in the Dominican Republic and Panama. And with both facilities in service, we will become the largest provider of LNG regasification and storage services in Central America and the Caribbean. 
All of the Colon project's permits are in place, and we have selected the EPC contractor. Project financing for approximately 60% of the project cost is well underway. AES' equity is expected to be around $200 million, which we will fund over the construction period. The project is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016 with completion of the power plant in 2018 and the LNG facility in 2019. 
As we can see on Slide 11, the repowering of Southland in California is another example of a large project that will contribute to our growth beyond 2018. As a reminder, we were awarded a 20-year PPA by Southern California Edison for 1,384 megawatts of capacity, which includes 100 megawatts of energy storage and 1,284 megawatts of combined cycle gas capacity. Since our last call, we have signed turbine supply agreements and EPC contracts to build the CCGT. We're making good progress on the remaining regulatory approvals and expect to break ground in 2017 with completion in 2020. We anticipate funding the $2 billion total project cost with a combination of nonrecourse debt and $500 million in equity from AES and a possible financial partner. 
Turning to Slide 12. We remain optimistic on the future battery base energy storage and our leadership position in this market. We currently have 116 megawatts of energy storage projects in operation across 4 countries and expect to install another 50 megawatts this year. Additionally, we have another 228 megawatts in advanced stage development, including the 100 megawatts under contract in California. By 2017, we expect to be operating in 7 countries, adding India, the Philippines and the Dominican Republic to the 4 countries where we already operate, the U.S., the U.K, the Netherlands and Chile. 
We see growth in our energy storage business through 2 paths. AES' own projects, such as the previously discussed 100 megawatts with the PPA with Southern California Edison and sales of our Advancion energy storage solution by AES and our channel partners. These sales will target utilities and other large energy storage customers. 
First, regarding long-term contracts. We see significant potential in many of our markets, including the U.S., the U.K., the Philippines and Mexico. We continue to work with local regulators to facilitate the development of market structures that enable new investments in battery-based energy storage. 
Second, over the past 8 years, we have learned a tremendous amount about how to integrate the various components to create a proprietary battery-based energy storage solution, which we have named Advancion. To promote Advancion sales in many more markets, we have executed channel partner agreements with Mitsubishi for sales in Asia and with Eaton for sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. We are in discussions with other potential partners to sell Advancion in additional markets. 
Although battery-based energy storage is still early on in its product cycle, we believe that Advancion presents an interesting opportunity for upside in our cash and earnings forecast. 
Turning now to our projects under construction on Slide 13. Our ongoing construction program is the most significant driver of our growth over the next few years. We expect to commission 6 gigawatts of new capacity from projects currently under construction through the first half of 2019. As a reminder, total capital expenditure for these projects is $7.5 billion. However, by using financial partners, AES' equity commitment is reduced to $1.3 billion. Of AES' equity commitment, all but $160 million has already been funded. 
As you can see on Slide 13, roughly 74% of our investments are in the Americas, and of this, a majority is in the U.S. and Chile. We expect an average return on equity from these projects of approximately 15%. About 3 gigawatts, representing half of the capacity currently under construction, are 90% complete and are on track to come online, on time and on budget this year. 
In 2017, we plan to commission an additional 670 megawatts of capacity in the U.S. and 112 megawatts in the Dominican Republic. We have completed about 70% of the work on these 2 projects, and we also expect them to come online, on time and on budget. 
The remaining 3 major projects now under construction, Masinloc 2, OPGC II and Alto Maipo, all projected to come online in late 2018 and early 2019. This construction program will drive visible and attractive growth in both free cash flow and earnings. 
As you can see on Slide 14, we expect at least 10% annual growth in proportional free cash flow through 2018, which will support our 10% annual growth in dividends, continued deleveraging of the parent and subsidiaries and investments in attractive platform expansions. 
Turning now to Slide 15. We also see robust growth in earnings through 2018. From 2016 to 2018, we expect an attractive growth rate of 12% to 16% in our adjusted EPS. Approximately 5% of this annual growth rate is driven by cost reductions and revenue enhancements. Another 8% to 10% of expected growth is driven by the 2.4 gigawatts of construction projects coming online in 2017 and 2018. 
Based on our strong market position and attractive high-growth markets, we're optimistic about our ability to drive growth beyond 2018. The 3 projects I just discussed, Masinloc 2, Colon and Southland, will come fully online after 2018. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss our first quarter results, capital allocation and full year guidance in more detail."

Today, I will review our first quarter results, including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit or SBU. And I'll cover our 2016 capital alloc",1580,"Thanks, Andrés. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will review our first quarter results, including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit or SBU. And I'll cover our 2016 capital allocation as well as our 2016 guidance. 
Turning to Slide 17. First quarter adjusted EPS of $0.13 was $0.12 lower than 2015. Much of this decline was driven by factors incorporated into our full year guidance with certain exceptions, primarily the decline in power markets in the U.S. as well as lower demand in Brazil. Specifically, our results reflect the $0.04 impact from a significantly higher quarterly tax rate of 50% in 2016 versus 33% in '15. This was mostly driven by the timing of certain tax expenses, the largest of which was the enactment of income tax reforms in Chile. We do expect the rate to recover during the year to a full year tax rate of 31% to 33%. 
Next, the $0.04 impact from the valuation of foreign currencies as expected, primarily in Latin America and Europe. And also $0.05 lower contributions from our SBUs, mainly due to anticipated drivers such as the expiration of Tietê's PPA with Eletropaulo. 
In addition to the drivers included in our expectations, we also saw some softness in power markets and mild weather in the U.S. That being said, we've seen some recovery in prices in the last month, which will contribute to our stronger second half of the year and helps give us comfort in our full year outlook. 
Now to Slide 18. Our overall results were primarily driven by lower margins in our Brazil, Europe and U.S. SBUs due to the factors I just mentioned. We generated $253 million in proportional free cash flow, a modest decrease of $12 million from last year, reflecting lower margins, mostly offset by higher collections at our Brazil utilities and lower working capital requirements in Vietnam. We also warrant $172 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of $80 million. 
Now I'll cover our SBUs in more detail over the next 6 slides beginning on Slide 19. In the U.S., our results reflect lower margins at DPL due to lower wholesale prices and lower contributions from regulated customers, lower contributions from IPL due to mild weather and a partial sell down and the sale of Armenia Mountain wind project. Proportional free cash flow also reflects unfavorable working capital changes at IPL. 
In Andes, our results reflect the 40% devaluation of the Argentine peso, 24% deval of the Columbia peso and lower volumes at Chivor in Colombia. Proportional free cash flow was also impacted by higher tax payments in Chile. PTC also reflects lower equity and earnings at Guacolda in Chile. 
In Brazil, our results reflect lower margins to the expiration of Tietê's PPA with Eletropaulo in 2015, lower demand at Sul and Eletropaulo and the 26% evaluation of the Brazilian real. Proportional free cash flow also reflects higher collections at Sul and Eletropaulo as well as the favorable timing of energy purchases at Tietê. 
Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect modestly lower margins. Proportional free cash flow largely reflects higher-than-normal collections in the Dominican Republic in 2015. 
In Europe, our results reflect lower margins due to the 48% devaluation of the Kazakhstan tenge and lower dark spreads at Kilroot in the U.K. Proportional free cash flow also effects the timing of payments to the fuel supplier Maritza in Bulgaria and the unfavorable timing of working capital and tax payments in the U.K. 
Finally, in Asia, our results benefited from higher margins and lower buildup of working capital as a result of the start of operations at Mong Duong in Vietnam in April of 2015. 
Turning to Slide 25. I'll now provide an update on our regulatory filing at DPL in Ohio. As you may recall, in February, DPL filed its Electric Security Plan. Since that time, there have been challenges to regulation in Ohio. We saw the potential for similar arguments to impact the structure of other utilities' proposals pending before the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. Consequently, when we filed our plan, we included an alternative proposal that provided an option for the PUCO to approve a non-bypassable charge structured in the same way as the one approved in our existing ESP. We believe that this alternative falls under the PUCO's authority and also achieve the policy goals set up by the commission. We continue to believe this alternative provides a viable path forward for DPL and Ohio, and the commission is seeking for a reasonable resolution for the matter before the end of this year. 
Turning now to our 2016 parent capital allocation on Slide 26. Sources on the left-hand slide continue to reflect $1.1 billion of total available discretionary cash, which includes $575 million in parent free cash flow and announced asset sales. We remain confident in our 2016 parent free cash flow range of $525 million to $625 million, which are the foundation of our discretionary cash available for dividend growth and value creation. 
Turning to the uses on the right-hand side of the slide, consistent with our capital allocation plan that we've showed during our last call, with 10% growth in our dividend and share repurchases year-to-date, we're returning at least 1/3 of this cash to shareholders. Going forward, we see our dividend as the primary means to distribute cash to shareholders. 
Stock repurchases should be less material, absent proceeds from additional asset sales and partnerships. 
Regarding debt reduction, we're making good progress on our $200 million target for the year in our longer-term goal of parent credit improvement. In fact, year-to-date, we've prepaid $125 million of parent debt. Taking advantage of weak market conditions early in the quarter, we were able to buy this debt at a 7% discount. 
We're also seeing positive momentum on the ratings front. In March, Moody's changed our parent credit outlook from stable to positive. And in April, S&P upgraded our rating from BB- to BB. These actions reflect our continued efforts to derisk our portfolio and improve our credit metrics. 
We think the continuing to strengthen our credit will help us get better recognition and valuation for our growing cash flow and dividend. This positive credit trend, along with an overall market improvement, has allowed us to continue to be opportunistic regarding refinancing and extending maturities. To that end, last week, we extended an $800 million parent revolver maturity from 2018 to 2021. Also last week, on the nonrecourse side, our business in the Dominican Republic was able to replace a short-term financing with a new $370 million, 10-year bond at more favorable terms. 
We've also earmarked $330 million for investments in our subsidiaries, but 1/3 of which is through our Colon project in Panama and at Southland in California coming online after 2018. 
Finally, after considering these investments in our subs, our current dividend and debt prepayment were left with roughly $150 million of discretionary cash, which we'll invest consistent with our capital allocation framework. As the year's past, much of this cash is weighted towards the latter part of the year. 
Now to slide 27. We are reaffirming our guidance in 2017, '18 expectations for all metrics based on foreign currency and commodity forward curves as of April 30. We continue to generate strong proportional free cash flow, which we relatively evenly distributed in the first and second half of the year. And with the settlement of all outstanding receivables at Maritza, we expect our first half proportional free cash flow to be well ahead of last year's. 
Regarding adjusted EPS, consistent with the first quarter, we also expect the second quarter to be lower than normal. In fact, we're forecasting that 70% to 75% of our 2016 adjusted EPS we recorded in the second half of 2016 versus about 60% in past years. 
There are a few reasons that our results to be stronger in the second half than first half. First, we expect a lower tax rate in the next 3 quarters. In any given year, there are certain items that influence the quarterly rate, but tend to normalize on a full year basis. As I mentioned earlier, in the first quarter, we recognize a higher-than-usual tax expense, which we combine with relatively low first quarter earnings, had an outsized impact on our tax rate for the quarter. This tax expense was anticipated in our guidance. And accordingly, we continue to expect a 31% to 33% tax rate in 2016. 
Second, the higher concentration of scheduled maintenance in the first half of the year will position us for stronger performance in the second half. For example, San Nicolas plant in Argentina, [indiscernible] planned major maintenance of the entire second quarter as part of its regular maintenance cycle that occurs about every 8 years. A few of our other plants have similar circumstances. 
Third, forward curves for FX and commodities reflect some improvement over the balance of the year, which will provide a benefit in the second half. Fourth, this year's $50 million in cost reductions is more heavily weighted towards the second half. And lastly, we expect to benefit from a couple of items that we're working on to partially offset lower demand in Brazil and lower power prices in the U.S.  We'll be in a better position to discuss these later in the year. 
With that, I'll now turn it back over to Andrés."

To summarize our views on this call, we continue to generate strong proportional free cash flow, which will be evenly distributed between the first and second half of the year. Although we expect our first half adjusted EPS to be relatively weak, many of the negative drivers will reverse in the second half, and therefore, we are reaffirming our guidance for all financial metrics. 
In terms of our strategic priorities, in the first few months of this year, we've made significant progress, including resolving the outstanding receivables issue in Bulgaria; receiving positive actions from the rating agencies resulting from our actions to derisk the portfolio and delever the parent; reaffirming our double-digit growth through 2018 in both cash flow and earnings, driven by our largely funded construction program and $150 million in cost savings and revenue enhancements; and achieving significant milestones on 3 new projects in our development pipeline to drive growth beyond 2018. 
I am optimistic about the future of AES. We are delivering strong and growing free cash flow, which we will continue to use to maximize risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. The 6 gigawatts we currently have under construction is the largest driver of our expected growth of at least 10% in free cash flow through 2018. Beyond 2018, we are well positioned to capture new opportunities due to our strong business platforms in attractive and growing markets and our leadership position in deploying new technologies. 
Now I'd like to open up the call for questions."

So that would be next year when we sort of move out an additional year. What we wanted to do was give you color that our growth will continue post-2018. In fact, that we have a good pipeline through 2020 that we recently added to. So that was really the point of this call. Now talking about the facility in Panama, colon facility, so it has 2 parts. As you said, one's a 380-megawatt combined cycle gas plant on a 10-year PPA with a credit worthy off-taker in dollars. The second is a tank. And the tank, we are using about 1/4 of the capacity for this plant. This leaves about 3/4. So it's really a question of tolling. We're not going to be taking commodity risk on this. So this could be tolling fuel for other power plants. We did this in the Dominican Republic. We're using it. We built a pipeline to the -- our own actually DPP facility and converted from diesel to natural gas, and we're also selling it there to the transportation and industrial sectors. So what we would have in Panama is, first, to meet domestic demand. There are power plants nearby. There are other power plants that will be built that we think require natural gas. So that's first use. Transportation and industrial use will be second, following the model we had in the Dominican Republic. And third, which is very interesting is the ship bunkering. We would not be doing the bunkering. We will actually have somebody else to do that, but they would use our storage and regas capacity. So the way to think about this is you'll basically bringing large efficient LNG tankers. You unload them in Panama and the Dominican Republic, and then you have various means of delivering gas to various types of customers or actually, LNG as well. So we do not plan to take any commodity risk per se on these transactions. We've been providing a service, regasification service, a bunkering service and a hub service. And between the two, this gives us a very attractive position to be able to service people who want services in Panama and the Dominican Republic."

We spun off the telco from Eletropaulo, sold that for $1 billion. So we feel that we'll continue to manage Brazil sort of holistically and look at one of the fundamental exposures we have there."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter financial review call. Today, I will discuss our first quarter results and provide updates on our progress on our strategic objectives, macro conditions in our markets and our construction and development program. 
Since our last call in late February, we have achieved a number of key objectives for 2016. We received payment of all outstanding receivables in Bulgaria. We are on track to achieve our 3-year $150 million cost-reduction and revenue-enhancement goals. We saw improvements in our credit ratings and outlook from the rating agencies. Our $7.5 billion construction program is advancing on schedule and will be the major contributor to our cash and earnings growth over the next 3 years. 
We continue to leverage our existing business platforms by advancing projects with long-term contracts denominated in U.S. dollars. During the first quarter, we achieved significant milestones on 3 new projects, which will contribute to our growth after 2018. I will discuss these achievements in more detail in a moment. But first, I'd like to summarize our financial results on Slide 4. 
In the first quarter, we generated proportional free cash flow of $253 million, in line with last year. The recent collection of $350 million in Bulgaria will be reflected in our second quarter cash flow. Our first quarter adjusted EPS was $1 -- was $0.13, which is considerably lower than the $0.25 we earned last year. Our first quarter operating performance was impacted by adverse movements in FX, lower power prices in the U.S. and the expiration of the power purchase agreement at Tietê in Brazil. Our earnings performance was also driven by a tax rate of 50% for the first quarter, which is really a timing issue. We continue to expect a 31% to 33% tax rate for the full year. 
In terms of our outlook for the full year, we are reaffirming our guidance on all financial metrics. Nonetheless, we expect our first half adjusted EPS to be relatively weak due to the continuing impact from the factors I just mentioned and schedule major maintenance in the second quarter. Now I'll turn to our strategic accomplishments since our last call. 
As you can see on Slide 5, we have successfully resolved the outstanding receivables issue at Maritza in Bulgaria. Maritza's sole customer, the National Electricity Company, or NEK, had fallen significantly behind on its payments. In April, we received full payment of the outstanding receivables of $350 million. This is a direct result of the steps taken by the government of Bulgaria to strengthen the financial position of NEK and the long-term sustainability of the energy sector. By meeting all of its contractual obligations, Bulgaria is sending a very positive signal to all foreign investors. Currently, Maritza's providing critically needed power to the Bulgarian electric grid, and we have been collecting in a timely manner since December 2015. 
Turning now to Slide 6 and our cost savings and revenue enhancement initiative. Our goal is to achieve a run rate of $150 million per year in bottom line improvement. We are on track to achieve our $50 million goal for 2016 and the additional $100 million through 2018. These bottom line benefits are largely driven by global procurement efforts, moving back-office functions to lower-cost service centers in Argentina and Bulgaria and continued improvements in the performance of our plans. 
Now turning to Slide 7. I'll discuss macro conditions in our markets. First, the impact from hydrology in Latin America should be negligible this year. While cumulative rainfall remains below average in Panama, it is generally improved in the rest of Latin America. Regarding Panama, spot prices have fallen significantly as a result of the barge base power plant we commissioned there last year, which reduced the effects of low rainfall on our contracted hydro plants. 
Second, economic conditions in our markets are generally in line with prior expectations, except for Brazil, which is experiencing a deepening recession. At our distribution businesses in Brazil, we are now seeing a second consecutive year of 5% decline in demand. While in the U.S., demand is essentially flat. In most of our other markets, we continue to see energy demand growth in the range of 4% to 10%. 
Moving on to Slide 8. We are focusing our investment efforts on platform expansion projects with long-term contracts and U.S. dollar-denominated revenues. We see a significant opportunity to take a leading role in the distribution and storage of LNG in Central America and the Caribbean. 
Turning to Slide 9. Let us review our major new projects. During the quarter, we started construction on the 335-megawatt Masinloc expansion to take advantage of robust growth in the Philippines and our existing infrastructure. The new unit, Masinloc 2, will be one of the most competitive thermal plants in the country, employing highly efficient and flexible supercritical technology. The $740 million project will be funded by a combination of nonrecourse financing, partner equity and cash generated at the Masinloc 1 facility. 
Moving on to Slide 10. I am pleased to report that we have achieved a number of milestones on our Colon project in Panama. This project encompasses both a 380-megawatt combined cycle plant, or CCGT, and an adjacent LNG regasification terminal and storage facility. The CCGT is contracted under a 10-year U.S. dollar-denominated PPA. The LNG facility will have 180,000 cubic meter tank, which is sufficient to handle 80 terra BTU annually. Our CCGT will use about 1/4 of the tank's capacity, leaving substantial unused capacity to meet the needs of additional power plants or downstream customers. The Colon project seeks to replicate the success of our LNG facilities in the Dominican Republic, which provide gas to our adjacent power plant, another power plant via pipeline and to numerous downstream customers in the transportation and industrial sectors. The Colon project is strategically located near the entrance of the Panama Canal and will be able to offer bunkering to the maritime industry as it starts to use natural gas as a fuel. There are many commercial synergies between the LNG terminals in the Dominican Republic and Panama. And with both facilities in service, we will become the largest provider of LNG regasification and storage services in Central America and the Caribbean. 
All of the Colon project's permits are in place, and we have selected the EPC contractor. Project financing for approximately 60% of the project cost is well underway. AES's equity is expected to be around $200 million, which we will fund over the construction period. The project is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016 with completion of the power plant in 2018 and the LNG facility in 2019. 
As we can see on Slide 11, the repowering of Southland in California is another example of a large project that will contribute to our growth beyond 2018. As a reminder, we were awarded a 20-year PPA by Southern California Edison for 1,384 megawatts of capacity, which includes 100 megawatts of energy storage and 1,284 megawatts of combined cycle gas capacity. Since our last call, we have signed turbine supply agreements and EPC contracts to build the CCGT. We're making good progress on the remaining regulatory approvals and expect to break ground in 2017 with completion in 2020. We anticipate funding the $2 billion total project cost with a combination of nonrecourse debt and $500 million in equity from AES and a possible financial partner. 
Turning to Slide 12. We remain optimistic on the future battery base energy storage and our leadership position in this market. We currently have 116 megawatts of energy storage projects in operation across 4 countries and expect to install another 50 megawatts this year. Additionally, we have another 228 megawatts in advanced stage development, including the 100 megawatts under contract in California. By 2017, we expect to be operating in 7 countries, adding India, the Philippines and the Dominican Republic to the 4 countries where we already operate, the U.S., the U.K., the Netherlands and Chile. 
We see growth in our energy storage business through 2 paths. AES' own projects, such as the previously discussed 100 megawatts with the PPA with Southern California Edison and sales of our Advancion energy storage solution by AES and our channel partners. These sales will target utilities and other large energy storage customers. 
First, regarding long-term contracts. We see significant potential in many of our markets, including the U.S., the U.K., the Philippines and Mexico. We continue to work with local regulators to facilitate the development of market structures that enable new investments in battery-based energy storage. 
Second, over the past 8 years, we have learned a tremendous amount about how to integrate the various components to create a proprietary battery-based energy storage solution, which we have named Advancion. To promote Advancion sales in many more markets, we have executed channel partner agreements with Mitsubishi for sales in Asia and with Eaton for sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. We are in discussions with other potential partners to sell Advancion in additional markets. 
Although battery-based energy storage is still early on in its product cycle, we believe that Advancion presents an interesting opportunity for upside in our cash and earnings forecast. 
Turning now to our projects under construction on Slide 13. Our ongoing construction program is the most significant driver of our growth over the next few years. We expect to commission 6 gigawatts of new capacity from projects currently under construction through the first half of 2019. As a reminder, total capital expenditure for these projects is $7.5 billion. However, by using financial partners, AES's equity commitment is reduced to $1.3 billion. Of AES's equity commitment, all but $160 million has already been funded. 
As you can see on Slide 13, roughly 74% of our investments are in the Americas, and of this, a majority is in the U.S. and Chile. We expect an average return on equity from these projects of approximately 15%. About 3 gigawatts, representing half of the capacity currently under construction, are 90% complete and are on track to come online, on time and on budget this year. 
In 2017, we plan to commission an additional 670 megawatts of capacity in the U.S. and 112 megawatts in the Dominican Republic. We have completed about 70% of the work on these 2 projects, and we also expect them to come online, on time and on budget. 
The remaining 3 major projects now under construction, Masinloc 2, OPGC II and Alto Maipo, all projected to come online in late 2018 and early 2019. This construction program will drive visible and attractive growth in both free cash flow and earnings. 
As you can see on Slide 14, we expect at least 10% annual growth in proportional free cash flow through 2018, which will support our 10% annual growth in dividends, continued deleveraging of the parent and subsidiaries and investments in attractive platform expansions. 
Turning now to Slide 15. We also see robust growth in earnings through 2018. From 2016 to 2018, we expect an attractive growth rate of 12% to 16% in our adjusted EPS. Approximately 5% of this annual growth rate is driven by cost reductions and revenue enhancements. Another 8% to 10% of expected growth is driven by the 2.4 gigawatts of construction projects coming online in 2017 and 2018. 
Based on our strong market position in attractive high-growth markets, we're optimistic about our ability to drive growth beyond 2018. The 3 projects I just discussed, Masinloc 2, Colon and Southland, will come fully online after 2018. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss our first quarter results, capital allocation and full year guidance in more detail."

Today, I will review our first quarter results, including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit or SBU. And I'll cover our 2016 capital allocation as well as our 2016 guidance. 
Turning to Slide 17. First quarter adjusted EPS of $0.13 was $0.12 lower than 2015. Much of this decline was driven by factors incorporated into our full year guidance with certain exceptions, primarily the decline in power markets in the U.S. as well as lower demand in Brazil. Specifically, our results reflect the $0.04 impact from a significantly higher quarterly tax rate of 50% in 2016 versus 33% in '15. This was mostly driven by the timing of certain tax expenses, the largest of which was the enactment of income tax reforms in Chile. We do expect the rate to recover during the year to a full year tax rate of 31% to 33%. 
Next, the $0.04 impact from the valuation of foreign currencies as expected, primarily in Latin America and Europe. And also $0.05 lower contributions from our SBUs, mainly due to anticipated drivers such as the expiration of Tietê's PPA with Eletropaulo. 
In addition to the drivers included in our expectations, we also saw some softness in power markets and mild weather in the U.S. That being said, we've seen some recovery in prices in the last month, which will contribute to our stronger second half of the year and helps give us comfort in our full year outlook. 
Now to Slide 18. Our overall results were primarily driven by lower margins in our Brazil, Europe and U.S. SBUs due to the factors I just mentioned. We generated $253 million in proportional free cash flow, a modest decrease of $12 million from last year, reflecting lower margins, mostly offset by higher collections at our Brazil utilities and lower working capital requirements in Vietnam. We also earned $172 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of $80 million. 
Now I'll cover our SBUs in more detail over the next 6 slides beginning on Slide 19. In the U.S., our results reflect lower margins at DPL due to lower wholesale prices and lower contributions from regulated customers, lower contributions from IPL due to mild weather and a partial sell down and the sale of Armenia Mountain wind project. Proportional free cash flow also reflects unfavorable working capital changes at IPL. 
In Andes, our results reflect the 40% devaluation of the Argentine peso, 24% deval of the Columbia peso and lower volumes at Chivor in Colombia. Proportional free cash flow was also impacted by higher tax payments in Chile. PTC also reflects lower equity and earnings at Guacolda in Chile. 
In Brazil, our results reflect lower margins to the expiration of Tietê's PPA with Eletropaulo in 2015, lower demand at Sul and Eletropaulo and the 26% devaluation of the Brazilian real. Proportional free cash flow also reflects higher collections at Sul and Eletropaulo as well as the favorable timing of energy purchases at Tietê. 
Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect modestly lower margins. Proportional free cash flow largely reflects higher-than-normal collections in the Dominican Republic in 2015. 
In Europe, our results reflect lower margins due to the 48% devaluation of the Kazakhstan tenge and lower dark spreads at Kilroot in the U.K. Proportional free cash flow also reflects the timing of payments to the fuel supplier at Maritza in Bulgaria and the unfavorable timing of working capital and tax payments in the U.K. 
Finally, in Asia, our results benefited from higher margins and lower buildup of working capital as a result of the start of operations at Mong Duong in Vietnam in April of 2015. 
Turning to Slide 25. I'll now provide an update on our regulatory filing at DPL in Ohio. As you may recall, in February, DPL filed its Electric Security Plan. Since that time, there have been challenges to regulation in Ohio. We saw the potential for similar arguments to impact the structure of other utilities' proposals pending before the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. Consequently, when we filed our plan, we included an alternative proposal that provided an option for the PUCO to approve a non-bypassable charge structured in the same way as the one approved in our existing ESP. We believe that this alternative falls under the PUCO's authority and also achieves the policy goals set up by the commission. We continue to believe this alternative provides a viable path forward for DPL and Ohio, and the commission is seeking for a reasonable resolution for the matter before the end of this year. 
Turning now to our 2016 parent capital allocation on Slide 26. Sources on the left-hand side continue to reflect $1.1 billion of total available discretionary cash, which includes $575 million in parent free cash flow and announced asset sales. We remain confident in our 2016 parent free cash flow range of $525 million to $625 million, which are the foundation of our discretionary cash available for dividend growth and value creation. 
Turning to the uses on the right-hand side of the slide, consistent with our capital allocation plan that we've showed during our last call, with 10% growth in our dividend and share repurchases year-to-date, we're returning at least 1/3 of this cash to shareholders. Going forward, we see our dividend as the primary means to distribute cash to shareholders. 
Stock repurchases should be less material, absent proceeds from additional asset sales and partnerships. 
Regarding debt reduction, we're making good progress on our $200 million target for the year in our longer-term goal of parent credit improvement. In fact, year-to-date, we've prepaid $125 million of parent debt. Taking advantage of weak market conditions early in the quarter, we were able to buy this debt at a 7% discount. 
We're also seeing positive momentum on the ratings front. In March, Moody's changed our parent credit outlook from stable to positive. And in April, S&P upgraded our rating from BB- to BB. These actions reflect our continued efforts to derisk our portfolio and improve our credit metrics. 
We think the continuing to strengthen our credit will help us get better recognition and valuation for our growing cash flow and dividend. This positive credit trend, along with an overall market improvement, has allowed us to continue to be opportunistic regarding refinancing and extending maturities. To that end, last week, we extended an $800 million parent revolver maturity from 2018 to 2021. Also last week, on the nonrecourse side, our business in the Dominican Republic was able to replace a short-term financing with a new $370 million, 10-year bond at more favorable terms. 
We've also earmarked $330 million for investments in our subsidiaries, but 1/3 of which is through our Colon project in Panama and at Southland in California coming online after 2018. 
Finally, after considering these investments in our subs, our current dividend and debt prepayment were left with roughly $150 million of discretionary cash, which we'll invest consistent with our capital allocation framework. As the year's past, much of this cash is weighted towards the latter part of the year. 
Now to slide 27. We are reaffirming our guidance in 2017, '18 expectations for all metrics based on foreign currency and commodity forward curves as of April 30. We continue to generate strong proportional free cash flow, which we relatively evenly distributed in the first and second half of the year. And with the settlement of all outstanding receivables at Maritza, we expect our first half proportional free cash flow to be well ahead of last year's. 
Regarding adjusted EPS, consistent with the first quarter, we also expect the second quarter to be lower than normal. In fact, we're forecasting that 70% to 75% of our 2016 adjusted EPS will be recorded in the second half of 2016 versus about 60% in past years. 
There are a few reasons that our results will be stronger in the second half than first half. First, we expect a lower tax rate in the next 3 quarters. In any given year, there are certain items that influence the quarterly rate, but tend to normalize on a full year basis. As I mentioned earlier, in the first quarter, we recognized a higher-than-usual tax expense, which when combine with relatively low first quarter earnings, had an outsized impact on our tax rate for the quarter. This tax expense was anticipated in our guidance. And accordingly, we continue to expect a 31% to 33% tax rate in 2016. 
Second, the higher concentration of scheduled maintenance in the first half of the year will position us for stronger performance in the second half. For example, San Nicolas plant in Argentina, will undergo planned major maintenance for the entire second quarter as part of its regular maintenance cycle that occurs about every 8 years. A few of our other plants have similar circumstances. 
Third, forward curves for FX and commodities reflect some improvement over the balance of the year, which will provide a benefit in the second half. Fourth, this year's $50 million in cost reductions is more heavily weighted towards the second half. And lastly, we expect to benefit from a couple of items that we're working on to partially offset lower demand in Brazil and lower power prices in the U.S.  We'll be in a better position to discuss these later in the year. 
With that, I'll now turn it back over to Andrés."

To summarize our views on this call, we continue to generate strong proportional free cash flow, which will be evenly distributed between the first and second half of the year. Although we expect our first half adjusted EPS to be relatively weak, many of the negative drivers will reverse in the second half, and therefore, we are reaffirming our guidance for all financial metrics. 
In terms of our strategic priorities, in the first few months of this year, we've made significant progress, including resolving the outstanding receivables issue in Bulgaria; receiving positive actions from the rating agencies resulting from our actions to derisk the portfolio and delever the parent; reaffirming our double-digit growth through 2018 in both cash flow and earnings, driven by our largely funded construction program and $150 million in cost savings and revenue enhancements; and achieving significant milestones on 3 new projects in our development pipeline to drive growth beyond 2018. 
I am optimistic about the future of AES. We are delivering strong and growing free cash flow, which we will continue to use to maximize risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. The 6 gigawatts we currently have under construction is the largest driver of our expected growth of at least 10% in free cash flow through 2018. Beyond 2018, we are well positioned to capture new opportunities due to our strong business platforms in attractive and growing markets and our leadership position in deploying new technologies.

You have clearly, at least in Panama, one particular power plant where you have a 10-year contract. So I guess I understand that.

So that would be next year when we sort of move out an additional year. What we wanted to do was give you color that our growth will continue post-2018. In fact, that we have a good pipeline through 2020 that we recently added to. So that was really the point of this call. Now talking about the facility in Panama, Colon facility, so it has 2 parts. As you said, one's a 380-megawatt combined cycle gas plant on a 10-year PPA with a creditworthy off-taker in dollars. The second is a tank. And the tank, we are using about 1/4 of the capacity for this plant. This leaves about 3/4. So it's really a question of tolling. We're not going to be taking commodity risk on this. So this could be tolling fuel for other power plants. We did this in the Dominican Republic. We're using it. We built a pipeline to the -- our own actually DPP facility and converted from diesel to natural gas, and we're also selling it there to the transportation and industrial sectors. So what we would have in Panama is, first, to meet domestic demand. There are power plants nearby. There are other power plants that will be built that we think will require natural gas. So that's first use. Transportation and industrial use will be second, following the model we had in the Dominican Republic. And third, which is very interesting, is the ship bunkering. We would not be doing the bunkering. We will actually have somebody else to do that, but they would use our storage and regas capacity. So the way to think about this is you basically bring in large efficient LNG tankers. You unload them in Panama and the Dominican Republic, and then you have various means of delivering gas to various types of customers or actually, LNG as well. So we do not plan to take any commodity risk per se on these transactions. We'd be providing a service, regasification service, a bunkering service and a hub service. And between the two, this gives us a very attractive position to be able to service people who want services in Panama and the Dominican Republic."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter financial review call. Today, I will discuss our first quarter results and provide updates on our progress on our strategic objectives, macro conditions in our markets and our construction and development program. 
Since our last call in late February, we have achieved a number of key objectives for 2016. We received payment of all outstanding receivables in Bulgaria. We are on track to achieve our 3-year $150 million cost-reduction and revenue-enhancement goals. We saw improvements in our credit ratings and outlook from the rating agencies. Our $7.5 billion construction program is advancing on schedule and will be the major contributor to our cash and earnings growth over the next 3 years. 
We continue to leverage our existing business platforms by advancing projects with long-term contracts denominated in U.S. dollars. During the first quarter, we achieved significant milestones on 3 new projects, which will contribute to our growth after 2018. I will discuss these achievements in more detail in a moment. But first, I'd like to summarize our financial results on Slide 4. 
In the first quarter, we generated proportional free cash flow of $253 million, in line with last year. The recent collection of $350 million in Bulgaria will be reflected in our second quarter cash flow. Our first quarter adjusted EPS was $1 -- was $0.13, which is considerably lower than the $0.25 we earned last year. Our first quarter operating performance was impacted by adverse movements in FX, lower power prices in the U.S. and the expiration of the power purchase agreement at Tietê in Brazil. Our earnings performance was also driven by a tax rate of 50% for the first quarter, which is really a timing issue. We continue to expect a 31% to 33% tax rate for the full year. 
In terms of our outlook for the full year, we are reaffirming our guidance on all financial metrics. Nonetheless, we expect our first half adjusted EPS to be relatively weak due to the continuing impact from the factors I just mentioned and schedule major maintenance in the second quarter. Now I'll turn to our strategic accomplishments since our last call. 
As you can see on Slide 5, we have successfully resolved the outstanding receivables issue at Maritza in Bulgaria. Maritza's sole customer, the National Electricity Company, or NEK, had fallen significantly behind on its payments. In April, we received full payment of the outstanding receivables of $350 million. This is a direct result of the steps taken by the government of Bulgaria to strengthen the financial position of NEK and the long-term sustainability of the energy sector. By meeting all of its contractual obligations, Bulgaria is sending a very positive signal to all foreign investors. Currently, Maritza's providing critically needed power to the Bulgarian electric grid, and we have been collecting in a timely manner since December 2015. 
Turning now to Slide 6 and our cost savings and revenue enhancement initiative. Our goal is to achieve a run rate of $150 million per year in bottom line improvement. We are on track to achieve our $50 million goal for 2016 and the additional $100 million through 2018. These bottom line benefits are largely driven by global procurement efforts, moving back-office functions to lower-cost service centers in Argentina and Bulgaria and continued improvements in the performance of our plans. 
Now turning to Slide 7. I'll discuss macro conditions in our markets. First, the impact from hydrology in Latin America should be negligible this year. While cumulative rainfall remains below average in Panama, it is generally improved in the rest of Latin America. Regarding Panama, spot prices have fallen significantly as a result of the barge base power plant we commissioned there last year, which reduced the effects of low rainfall on our contracted hydro plants. 
Second, economic conditions in our markets are generally in line with prior expectations, except for Brazil, which is experiencing a deepening recession. At our distribution businesses in Brazil, we are now seeing a second consecutive year of 5% decline in demand. While in the U.S., demand is essentially flat. In most of our other markets, we continue to see energy demand growth in the range of 4% to 10%. 
Moving on to Slide 8. We are focusing our investment efforts on platform expansion projects with long-term contracts and U.S. dollar-denominated revenues. We see a significant opportunity to take a leading role in the distribution and storage of LNG in Central America and the Caribbean. 
Turning to Slide 9. Let us review our major new projects. During the quarter, we started construction on the 335-megawatt Masinloc expansion to take advantage of robust growth in the Philippines and our existing infrastructure. The new unit, Masinloc 2, will be one of the most competitive thermal plants in the country, employing highly efficient and flexible supercritical technology. The $740 million project will be funded by a combination of nonrecourse financing, partner equity and cash generated at the Masinloc 1 facility. 
Moving on to Slide 10. I am pleased to report that we have achieved a number of milestones on our Colon project in Panama. This project encompasses both a 380-megawatt combined cycle plant, or CCGT, and an adjacent LNG regasification terminal and storage facility. The CCGT is contracted under a 10-year U.S. dollar-denominated PPA. The LNG facility will have 180,000 cubic meter tank, which is sufficient to handle 80 terra BTU annually. Our CCGT will use about 1/4 of the tank's capacity, leaving substantial unused capacity to meet the needs of additional power plants or downstream customers. The Colon project seeks to replicate the success of our LNG facilities in the Dominican Republic, which provide gas to our adjacent power plant, another power plant via pipeline and to numerous downstream customers in the transportation and industrial sectors. The Colon project is strategically located near the entrance of the Panama Canal and will be able to offer bunkering to the maritime industry as it starts to use natural gas as a fuel. There are many commercial synergies between the LNG terminals in the Dominican Republic and Panama. And with both facilities in service, we will become the largest provider of LNG regasification and storage services in Central America and the Caribbean. 
All of the Colon project's permits are in place, and we have selected the EPC contractor. Project financing for approximately 60% of the project cost is well underway. AES's equity is expected to be around $200 million, which we will fund over the construction period. The project is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016 with completion of the power plant in 2018 and the LNG facility in 2019. 
As we can see on Slide 11, the repowering of Southland in California is another example of a large project that will contribute to our growth beyond 2018. As a reminder, we were awarded a 20-year PPA by Southern California Edison for 1,384 megawatts of capacity, which includes 100 megawatts of energy storage and 1,284 megawatts of combined cycle gas capacity. Since our last call, we have signed turbine supply agreements and EPC contracts to build the CCGT. We're making good progress on the remaining regulatory approvals and expect to break ground in 2017 with completion in 2020. We anticipate funding the $2 billion total project cost with a combination of nonrecourse debt and $500 million in equity from AES and a possible financial partner. 
Turning to Slide 12. We remain optimistic on the future battery base energy storage and our leadership position in this market. We currently have 116 megawatts of energy storage projects in operation across 4 countries and expect to install another 50 megawatts this year. Additionally, we have another 228 megawatts in advanced stage development, including the 100 megawatts under contract in California. By 2017, we expect to be operating in 7 countries, adding India, the Philippines and the Dominican Republic to the 4 countries where we already operate, the U.S., the U.K., the Netherlands and Chile. 
We see growth in our energy storage business through 2 paths. AES' own projects, such as the previously discussed 100 megawatts with the PPA with Southern California Edison and sales of our Advancion energy storage solution by AES and our channel partners. These sales will target utilities and other large energy storage customers. 
First, regarding long-term contracts. We see significant potential in many of our markets, including the U.S., the U.K., the Philippines and Mexico. We continue to work with local regulators to facilitate the development of market structures that enable new investments in battery-based energy storage. 
Second, over the past 8 years, we have learned a tremendous amount about how to integrate the various components to create a proprietary battery-based energy storage solution, which we have named Advancion. To promote Advancion sales in many more markets, we have executed channel partner agreements with Mitsubishi for sales in Asia and with Eaton for sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. We are in discussions with other potential partners to sell Advancion in additional markets. 
Although battery-based energy storage is still early on in its product cycle, we believe that Advancion presents an interesting opportunity for upside in our cash and earnings forecast. 
Turning now to our projects under construction on Slide 13. Our ongoing construction program is the most significant driver of our growth over the next few years. We expect to commission 6 gigawatts of new capacity from projects currently under construction through the first half of 2019. As a reminder, total capital expenditure for these projects is $7.5 billion. However, by using financial partners, AES's equity commitment is reduced to $1.3 billion. Of AES's equity commitment, all but $160 million has already been funded. 
As you can see on Slide 13, roughly 74% of our investments are in the Americas, and of this, a majority is in the U.S. and Chile. We expect an average return on equity from these projects of approximately 15%. About 3 gigawatts, representing half of the capacity currently under construction, are 90% complete and are on track to come online, on time and on budget this year. 
In 2017, we plan to commission an additional 670 megawatts of capacity in the U.S. and 112 megawatts in the Dominican Republic. We have completed about 70% of the work on these 2 projects, and we also expect them to come online, on time and on budget. 
The remaining 3 major projects now under construction, Masinloc 2, OPGC II and Alto Maipo, all projected to come online in late 2018 and early 2019. This construction program will drive visible and attractive growth in both free cash flow and earnings. 
As you can see on Slide 14, we expect at least 10% annual growth in proportional free cash flow through 2018, which will support our 10% annual growth in dividends, continued deleveraging of the parent and subsidiaries and investments in attractive platform expansions. 
Turning now to Slide 15. We also see robust growth in earnings through 2018. From 2016 to 2018, we expect an attractive growth rate of 12% to 16% in our adjusted EPS. Approximately 5% of this annual growth rate is driven by cost reductions and revenue enhancements. Another 8% to 10% of expected growth is driven by the 2.4 gigawatts of construction projects coming online in 2017 and 2018. 
Based on our strong market position in attractive high-growth markets, we're optimistic about our ability to drive growth beyond 2018. The 3 projects I just discussed, Masinloc 2, Colon and Southland, will come fully online after 2018. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss our first quarter results, capital allocation and full year guidance in more detail."
35312,330438570,980595,"The AES Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 09, 2016",2016-05-09,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Andrés. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will review our first quarter results, including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit or SBU. And I'll cover our 2016 capital alloc",1583,"Thanks, Andrés. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will review our first quarter results, including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit or SBU. And I'll cover our 2016 capital allocation as well as our 2016 guidance. 
Turning to Slide 17. First quarter adjusted EPS of $0.13 was $0.12 lower than 2015. Much of this decline was driven by factors incorporated into our full year guidance with certain exceptions, primarily the decline in power markets in the U.S. as well as lower demand in Brazil. Specifically, our results reflect the $0.04 impact from a significantly higher quarterly tax rate of 50% in 2016 versus 33% in '15. This was mostly driven by the timing of certain tax expenses, the largest of which was the enactment of income tax reforms in Chile. We do expect the rate to recover during the year to a full year tax rate of 31% to 33%. 
Next, the $0.04 impact from the valuation of foreign currencies as expected, primarily in Latin America and Europe. And also $0.05 lower contributions from our SBUs, mainly due to anticipated drivers such as the expiration of Tietê's PPA with Eletropaulo. 
In addition to the drivers included in our expectations, we also saw some softness in power markets and mild weather in the U.S. That being said, we've seen some recovery in prices in the last month, which will contribute to our stronger second half of the year and helps give us comfort in our full year outlook. 
Now to Slide 18. Our overall results were primarily driven by lower margins in our Brazil, Europe and U.S. SBUs due to the factors I just mentioned. We generated $253 million in proportional free cash flow, a modest decrease of $12 million from last year, reflecting lower margins, mostly offset by higher collections at our Brazil utilities and lower working capital requirements in Vietnam. We also earned $172 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of $80 million. 
Now I'll cover our SBUs in more detail over the next 6 slides beginning on Slide 19. In the U.S., our results reflect lower margins at DPL due to lower wholesale prices and lower contributions from regulated customers, lower contributions from IPL due to mild weather and a partial sell down and the sale of Armenia Mountain wind project. Proportional free cash flow also reflects unfavorable working capital changes at IPL. 
In Andes, our results reflect the 40% devaluation of the Argentine peso, 24% deval of the Columbia peso and lower volumes at Chivor in Colombia. Proportional free cash flow was also impacted by higher tax payments in Chile. PTC also reflects lower equity and earnings at Guacolda in Chile. 
In Brazil, our results reflect lower margins to the expiration of Tietê's PPA with Eletropaulo in 2015, lower demand at Sul and Eletropaulo and the 26% devaluation of the Brazilian real. Proportional free cash flow also reflects higher collections at Sul and Eletropaulo as well as the favorable timing of energy purchases at Tietê. 
Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect modestly lower margins. Proportional free cash flow largely reflects higher-than-normal collections in the Dominican Republic in 2015. 
In Europe, our results reflect lower margins due to the 48% devaluation of the Kazakhstan tenge and lower dark spreads at Kilroot in the U.K. Proportional free cash flow also reflects the timing of payments to the fuel supplier at Maritza in Bulgaria and the unfavorable timing of working capital and tax payments in the U.K. 
Finally, in Asia, our results benefited from higher margins and lower buildup of working capital as a result of the start of operations at Mong Duong in Vietnam in April of 2015. 
Turning to Slide 25. I'll now provide an update on our regulatory filing at DPL in Ohio. As you may recall, in February, DPL filed its Electric Security Plan. Since that time, there have been challenges to regulation in Ohio. We saw the potential for similar arguments to impact the structure of other utilities' proposals pending before the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. Consequently, when we filed our plan, we included an alternative proposal that provided an option for the PUCO to approve a non-bypassable charge structured in the same way as the one approved in our existing ESP. We believe that this alternative falls under the PUCO's authority and also achieves the policy goals set up by the commission. We continue to believe this alternative provides a viable path forward for DPL and Ohio, and the commission is seeking for a reasonable resolution for the matter before the end of this year. 
Turning now to our 2016 parent capital allocation on Slide 26. Sources on the left-hand side continue to reflect $1.1 billion of total available discretionary cash, which includes $575 million in parent free cash flow and announced asset sales. We remain confident in our 2016 parent free cash flow range of $525 million to $625 million, which are the foundation of our discretionary cash available for dividend growth and value creation. 
Turning to the uses on the right-hand side of the slide, consistent with our capital allocation plan that we've showed during our last call, with 10% growth in our dividend and share repurchases year-to-date, we're returning at least 1/3 of this cash to shareholders. Going forward, we see our dividend as the primary means to distribute cash to shareholders. 
Stock repurchases should be less material, absent proceeds from additional asset sales and partnerships. 
Regarding debt reduction, we're making good progress on our $200 million target for the year in our longer-term goal of parent credit improvement. In fact, year-to-date, we've prepaid $125 million of parent debt. Taking advantage of weak market conditions early in the quarter, we were able to buy this debt at a 7% discount. 
We're also seeing positive momentum on the ratings front. In March, Moody's changed our parent credit outlook from stable to positive. And in April, S&P upgraded our rating from BB- to BB. These actions reflect our continued efforts to derisk our portfolio and improve our credit metrics. 
We think the continuing to strengthen our credit will help us get better recognition and valuation for our growing cash flow and dividend. This positive credit trend, along with an overall market improvement, has allowed us to continue to be opportunistic regarding refinancing and extending maturities. To that end, last week, we extended an $800 million parent revolver maturity from 2018 to 2021. Also last week, on the nonrecourse side, our business in the Dominican Republic was able to replace a short-term financing with a new $370 million, 10-year bond at more favorable terms. 
We've also earmarked $330 million for investments in our subsidiaries, but 1/3 of which is through our Colon project in Panama and at Southland in California coming online after 2018. 
Finally, after considering these investments in our subs, our current dividend and debt prepayment were left with roughly $150 million of discretionary cash, which we'll invest consistent with our capital allocation framework. As the year's past, much of this cash is weighted towards the latter part of the year. 
Now to slide 27. We are reaffirming our guidance in 2017, '18 expectations for all metrics based on foreign currency and commodity forward curves as of April 30. We continue to generate strong proportional free cash flow, which we relatively evenly distributed in the first and second half of the year. And with the settlement of all outstanding receivables at Maritza, we expect our first half proportional free cash flow to be well ahead of last year's. 
Regarding adjusted EPS, consistent with the first quarter, we also expect the second quarter to be lower than normal. In fact, we're forecasting that 70% to 75% of our 2016 adjusted EPS will be recorded in the second half of 2016 versus about 60% in past years. 
There are a few reasons that our results will be stronger in the second half than first half. First, we expect a lower tax rate in the next 3 quarters. In any given year, there are certain items that influence the quarterly rate, but tend to normalize on a full year basis. As I mentioned earlier, in the first quarter, we recognized a higher-than-usual tax expense, which when combine with relatively low first quarter earnings, had an outsized impact on our tax rate for the quarter. This tax expense was anticipated in our guidance. And accordingly, we continue to expect a 31% to 33% tax rate in 2016. 
Second, the higher concentration of scheduled maintenance in the first half of the year will position us for stronger performance in the second half. For example, San Nicolas plant in Argentina, will undergo planned major maintenance for the entire second quarter as part of its regular maintenance cycle that occurs about every 8 years. A few of our other plants have similar circumstances. 
Third, forward curves for FX and commodities reflect some improvement over the balance of the year, which will provide a benefit in the second half. Fourth, this year's $50 million in cost reductions is more heavily weighted towards the second half. And lastly, we expect to benefit from a couple of items that we're working on to partially offset lower demand in Brazil and lower power prices in the U.S.  We'll be in a better position to discuss these later in the year. 
With that, I'll now turn it back over to Andrés."

To summarize our views on this call, we continue to generate strong proportional free cash flow, which will be evenly distributed between the first and second half of the year. Although we expect our first half adjusted EPS to be relatively weak, many of the negative drivers will reverse in the second half, and therefore, we are reaffirming our guidance for all financial metrics. 
In terms of our strategic priorities, in the first few months of this year, we've made significant progress, including resolving the outstanding receivables issue in Bulgaria; receiving positive actions from the rating agencies resulting from our actions to derisk the portfolio and delever the parent; reaffirming our double-digit growth through 2018 in both cash flow and earnings, driven by our largely funded construction program and $150 million in cost savings and revenue enhancements; and achieving significant milestones on 3 new projects in our development pipeline to drive growth beyond 2018. 
I am optimistic about the future of AES. We are delivering strong and growing free cash flow, which we will continue to use to maximize risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. The 6 gigawatts we currently have under construction is the largest driver of our expected growth of at least 10% in free cash flow through 2018. Beyond 2018, we are well positioned to capture new opportunities due to our strong business platforms in attractive and growing markets and our leadership position in deploying new technologies.

You have clearly, at least in Panama, one particular power plant where you have a 10-year contract. So I guess I understand that. But then how do you guys think about the risk and the structure of the actual importing of the LNG and the regas there and the selling of that to third parties?"

So that would be next year when we sort of move out an additional year. What we wanted to do was give you color that our growth will continue post-2018. In fact, that we have a good pipeline through 2020 that we recently added to. So that was really the point of this call. Now talking about the facility in Panama, Colon facility, so it has 2 parts. As you said, one's a 380-megawatt combined cycle gas plant on a 10-year PPA with a creditworthy off-taker in dollars. The second is a tank. And the tank, we are using about 1/4 of the capacity for this plant. This leaves about 3/4. So it's really a question of tolling. We're not going to be taking commodity risk on this. So this could be tolling fuel for other power plants. We did this in the Dominican Republic. We're using it. We built a pipeline to the -- our own actually DPP facility and converted from diesel to natural gas, and we're also selling it there to the transportation and industrial sectors. So what we would have in Panama is, first, to meet domestic demand. There are power plants nearby. There are other power plants that will be built that we think will require natural gas. So that's first use. Transportation and industrial use will be second, following the model we had in the Dominican Republic. And third, which is very interesting, is the ship bunkering. We would not be doing the bunkering. We will actually have somebody else to do that, but they would use our storage and regas capacity. So the way to think about this is you basically bring in large efficient LNG tankers. You unload them in Panama and the Dominican Republic, and then you have various means of delivering gas to various types of customers or actually, LNG as well. So we do not plan to take any commodity risk per se on these transactions. We'd be providing a service, regasification service, a bunkering service and a hub service. And between the two, this gives us a very attractive position to be able to service people who want services in Panama and the Dominican Republic."

But what I think we feel very confident saying is we're not going to sort of run out of growth projects in 2018. We already have significant projects that will come online 2019 and 2020, and we continue to work on ways to accelerate that rate of growth. And part of it is our use of partnerships and our sell-down of assets to continue to churn capital into higher-growth, higher-return projects."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter financial review call. Today, I will discuss our first quarter results and provide updates on our progress on our strategic objectives, macro conditions in our markets and our construction and development program. 
Since our last call in late February, we have achieved a number of key objectives for 2016. We received payment of all outstanding receivables in Bulgaria. We are on track to achieve our 3-year $150 million cost-reduction and revenue-enhancement goals. We saw improvements in our credit ratings and outlook from the rating agencies. Our $7.5 billion construction program is advancing on schedule and will be the major contributor to our cash and earnings growth over the next 3 years. 
We continue to leverage our existing business platforms by advancing projects with long-term contracts denominated in U.S. dollars. During the first quarter, we achieved significant milestones on 3 new projects, which will contribute to our growth after 2018. I will discuss these achievements in more detail in a moment. But first, I'd like to summarize our financial results on Slide 4. 
In the first quarter, we generated proportional free cash flow of $253 million, in line with last year. The recent collection of $350 million in Bulgaria will be reflected in our second quarter cash flow. Our first quarter adjusted EPS was $1 -- was $0.13, which is considerably lower than the $0.25 we earned last year. Our first quarter operating performance was impacted by adverse movements in FX, lower power prices in the U.S. and the expiration of the power purchase agreement at Tietê in Brazil. Our earnings performance was also driven by a tax rate of 50% for the first quarter, which is really a timing issue. We continue to expect a 31% to 33% tax rate for the full year. 
In terms of our outlook for the full year, we are reaffirming our guidance on all financial metrics. Nonetheless, we expect our first half adjusted EPS to be relatively weak due to the continuing impact from the factors I just mentioned and schedule major maintenance in the second quarter. Now I'll turn to our strategic accomplishments since our last call. 
As you can see on Slide 5, we have successfully resolved the outstanding receivables issue at Maritza in Bulgaria. Maritza's sole customer, the National Electricity Company, or NEK, had fallen significantly behind on its payments. In April, we received full payment of the outstanding receivables of $350 million. This is a direct result of the steps taken by the government of Bulgaria to strengthen the financial position of NEK and the long-term sustainability of the energy sector. By meeting all of its contractual obligations, Bulgaria is sending a very positive signal to all foreign investors. Currently, Maritza's providing critically needed power to the Bulgarian electric grid, and we have been collecting in a timely manner since December 2015. 
Turning now to Slide 6 and our cost savings and revenue enhancement initiative. Our goal is to achieve a run rate of $150 million per year in bottom line improvement. We are on track to achieve our $50 million goal for 2016 and the additional $100 million through 2018. These bottom line benefits are largely driven by global procurement efforts, moving back-office functions to lower-cost service centers in Argentina and Bulgaria and continued improvements in the performance of our plans. 
Now turning to Slide 7. I'll discuss macro conditions in our markets. First, the impact from hydrology in Latin America should be negligible this year. While cumulative rainfall remains below average in Panama, it is generally improved in the rest of Latin America. Regarding Panama, spot prices have fallen significantly as a result of the barge base power plant we commissioned there last year, which reduced the effects of low rainfall on our contracted hydro plants. 
Second, economic conditions in our markets are generally in line with prior expectations, except for Brazil, which is experiencing a deepening recession. At our distribution businesses in Brazil, we are now seeing a second consecutive year of 5% decline in demand. While in the U.S., demand is essentially flat. In most of our other markets, we continue to see energy demand growth in the range of 4% to 10%. 
Moving on to Slide 8. We are focusing our investment efforts on platform expansion projects with long-term contracts and U.S. dollar-denominated revenues. We see a significant opportunity to take a leading role in the distribution and storage of LNG in Central America and the Caribbean. 
Turning to Slide 9. Let us review our major new projects. During the quarter, we started construction on the 335-megawatt Masinloc expansion to take advantage of robust growth in the Philippines and our existing infrastructure. The new unit, Masinloc 2, will be one of the most competitive thermal plants in the country, employing highly efficient and flexible supercritical technology. The $740 million project will be funded by a combination of nonrecourse financing, partner equity and cash generated at the Masinloc 1 facility. 
Moving on to Slide 10. I am pleased to report that we have achieved a number of milestones on our Colon project in Panama. This project encompasses both a 380-megawatt combined cycle plant, or CCGT, and an adjacent LNG regasification terminal and storage facility. The CCGT is contracted under a 10-year U.S. dollar-denominated PPA. The LNG facility will have 180,000 cubic meter tank, which is sufficient to handle 80 terra BTU annually. Our CCGT will use about 1/4 of the tank's capacity, leaving substantial unused capacity to meet the needs of additional power plants or downstream customers. The Colon project seeks to replicate the success of our LNG facilities in the Dominican Republic, which provide gas to our adjacent power plant, another power plant via pipeline and to numerous downstream customers in the transportation and industrial sectors. The Colon project is strategically located near the entrance of the Panama Canal and will be able to offer bunkering to the maritime industry as it starts to use natural gas as a fuel. There are many commercial synergies between the LNG terminals in the Dominican Republic and Panama. And with both facilities in service, we will become the largest provider of LNG regasification and storage services in Central America and the Caribbean. 
All of the Colon project's permits are in place, and we have selected the EPC contractor. Project financing for approximately 60% of the project cost is well underway. AES's equity is expected to be around $200 million, which we will fund over the construction period. The project is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016 with completion of the power plant in 2018 and the LNG facility in 2019. 
As we can see on Slide 11, the repowering of Southland in California is another example of a large project that will contribute to our growth beyond 2018. As a reminder, we were awarded a 20-year PPA by Southern California Edison for 1,384 megawatts of capacity, which includes 100 megawatts of energy storage and 1,284 megawatts of combined cycle gas capacity. Since our last call, we have signed turbine supply agreements and EPC contracts to build the CCGT. We're making good progress on the remaining regulatory approvals and expect to break ground in 2017 with completion in 2020. We anticipate funding the $2 billion total project cost with a combination of nonrecourse debt and $500 million in equity from AES and a possible financial partner. 
Turning to Slide 12. We remain optimistic on the future battery base energy storage and our leadership position in this market. We currently have 116 megawatts of energy storage projects in operation across 4 countries and expect to install another 50 megawatts this year. Additionally, we have another 228 megawatts in advanced stage development, including the 100 megawatts under contract in California. By 2017, we expect to be operating in 7 countries, adding India, the Philippines and the Dominican Republic to the 4 countries where we already operate, the U.S., the U.K., the Netherlands and Chile. 
We see growth in our energy storage business through 2 paths. AES' own projects, such as the previously discussed 100 megawatts with the PPA with Southern California Edison and sales of our Advancion energy storage solution by AES and our channel partners. These sales will target utilities and other large energy storage customers. 
First, regarding long-term contracts. We see significant potential in many of our markets, including the U.S., the U.K., the Philippines and Mexico. We continue to work with local regulators to facilitate the development of market structures that enable new investments in battery-based energy storage. 
Second, over the past 8 years, we have learned a tremendous amount about how to integrate the various components to create a proprietary battery-based energy storage solution, which we have named Advancion. To promote Advancion sales in many more markets, we have executed channel partner agreements with Mitsubishi for sales in Asia and with Eaton for sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. We are in discussions with other potential partners to sell Advancion in additional markets. 
Although battery-based energy storage is still early on in its product cycle, we believe that Advancion presents an interesting opportunity for upside in our cash and earnings forecast. 
Turning now to our projects under construction on Slide 13. Our ongoing construction program is the most significant driver of our growth over the next few years. We expect to commission 6 gigawatts of new capacity from projects currently under construction through the first half of 2019. As a reminder, total capital expenditure for these projects is $7.5 billion. However, by using financial partners, AES's equity commitment is reduced to $1.3 billion. Of AES's equity commitment, all but $160 million has already been funded. 
As you can see on Slide 13, roughly 74% of our investments are in the Americas, and of this, a majority is in the U.S. and Chile. We expect an average return on equity from these projects of approximately 15%. About 3 gigawatts, representing half of the capacity currently under construction, are 90% complete and are on track to come online, on time and on budget this year. 
In 2017, we plan to commission an additional 670 megawatts of capacity in the U.S. and 112 megawatts in the Dominican Republic. We have completed about 70% of the work on these 2 projects, and we also expect them to come online, on time and on budget. 
The remaining 3 major projects now under construction, Masinloc 2, OPGC II and Alto Maipo, all projected to come online in late 2018 and early 2019. This construction program will drive visible and attractive growth in both free cash flow and earnings. 
As you can see on Slide 14, we expect at least 10% annual growth in proportional free cash flow through 2018, which will support our 10% annual growth in dividends, continued deleveraging of the parent and subsidiaries and investments in attractive platform expansions. 
Turning now to Slide 15. We also see robust growth in earnings through 2018. From 2016 to 2018, we expect an attractive growth rate of 12% to 16% in our adjusted EPS. Approximately 5% of this annual growth rate is driven by cost reductions and revenue enhancements. Another 8% to 10% of expected growth is driven by the 2.4 gigawatts of construction projects coming online in 2017 and 2018. 
Based on our strong market position in attractive high-growth markets, we're optimistic about our ability to drive growth beyond 2018. The 3 projects I just discussed, Masinloc 2, Colon and Southland, will come fully online after 2018. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss our first quarter results, capital allocation and full year guidance in more detail."

Today, I will review our first quarter results, including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit or SBU. And I'll cover our 2016 capital allocation as well as our 2016 guidance. 
Turning to Slide 17. First quarter adjusted EPS of $0.13 was $0.12 lower than 2015. Much of this decline was driven by factors incorporated into our full year guidance with certain exceptions, primarily the decline in power markets in the U.S. as well as lower demand in Brazil. Specifically, our results reflect the $0.04 impact from a significantly higher quarterly tax rate of 50% in 2016 versus 33% in '15. This was mostly driven by the timing of certain tax expenses, the largest of which was the enactment of income tax reforms in Chile. We do expect the rate to recover during the year to a full year tax rate of 31% to 33%. 
Next, the $0.04 impact from the valuation of foreign currencies as expected, primarily in Latin America and Europe. And also $0.05 lower contributions from our SBUs, mainly due to anticipated drivers such as the expiration of Tietê's PPA with Eletropaulo. 
In addition to the drivers included in our expectations, we also saw some softness in power markets and mild weather in the U.S. That being said, we've seen some recovery in prices in the last month, which will contribute to our stronger second half of the year and helps give us comfort in our full year outlook. 
Now to Slide 18. Our overall results were primarily driven by lower margins in our Brazil, Europe and U.S. SBUs due to the factors I just mentioned. We generated $253 million in proportional free cash flow, a modest decrease of $12 million from last year, reflecting lower margins, mostly offset by higher collections at our Brazil utilities and lower working capital requirements in Vietnam. We also earned $172 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of $80 million. 
Now I'll cover our SBUs in more detail over the next 6 slides beginning on Slide 19. In the U.S., our results reflect lower margins at DPL due to lower wholesale prices and lower contributions from regulated customers, lower contributions from IPL due to mild weather and a partial sell down and the sale of Armenia Mountain wind project. Proportional free cash flow also reflects unfavorable working capital changes at IPL. 
In Andes, our results reflect the 40% devaluation of the Argentine peso, 24% deval of the Columbia peso and lower volumes at Chivor in Colombia. Proportional free cash flow was also impacted by higher tax payments in Chile. PTC also reflects lower equity and earnings at Guacolda in Chile. 
In Brazil, our results reflect lower margins to the expiration of Tietê's PPA with Eletropaulo in 2015, lower demand at Sul and Eletropaulo and the 26% devaluation of the Brazilian real. Proportional free cash flow also reflects higher collections at Sul and Eletropaulo as well as the favorable timing of energy purchases at Tietê. 
Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect modestly lower margins. Proportional free cash flow largely reflects higher-than-normal collections in the Dominican Republic in 2015. 
In Europe, our results reflect lower margins due to the 48% devaluation of the Kazakhstan tenge and lower dark spreads at Kilroot in the U.K. Proportional free cash flow also reflects the timing of payments to the fuel supplier at Maritza in Bulgaria and the unfavorable timing of working capital and tax payments in the U.K. 
Finally, in Asia, our results benefited from higher margins and lower buildup of working capital as a result of the start of operations at Mong Duong in Vietnam in April of 2015. 
Turning to Slide 25. I'll now provide an update on our regulatory filing at DPL in Ohio. As you may recall, in February, DPL filed its Electric Security Plan. Since that time, there have been challenges to regulation in Ohio. We saw the potential for similar arguments to impact the structure of other utilities' proposals pending before the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. Consequently, when we filed our plan, we included an alternative proposal that provided an option for the PUCO to approve a non-bypassable charge structured in the same way as the one approved in our existing ESP. We believe that this alternative falls under the PUCO's authority and also achieves the policy goals set up by the commission. We continue to believe this alternative provides a viable path forward for DPL and Ohio, and the commission is seeking for a reasonable resolution for the matter before the end of this year. 
Turning now to our 2016 parent capital allocation on Slide 26. Sources on the left-hand side continue to reflect $1.1 billion of total available discretionary cash, which includes $575 million in parent free cash flow and announced asset sales. We remain confident in our 2016 parent free cash flow range of $525 million to $625 million, which are the foundation of our discretionary cash available for dividend growth and value creation. 
Turning to the uses on the right-hand side of the slide, consistent with our capital allocation plan that we've showed during our last call, with 10% growth in our dividend and share repurchases year-to-date, we're returning at least 1/3 of this cash to shareholders. Going forward, we see our dividend as the primary means to distribute cash to shareholders. 
Stock repurchases should be less material, absent proceeds from additional asset sales and partnerships. 
Regarding debt reduction, we're making good progress on our $200 million target for the year in our longer-term goal of parent credit improvement. In fact, year-to-date, we've prepaid $125 million of parent debt. Taking advantage of weak market conditions early in the quarter, we were able to buy this debt at a 7% discount. 
We're also seeing positive momentum on the ratings front. In March, Moody's changed our parent credit outlook from stable to positive. And in April, S&P upgraded our rating from BB- to BB. These actions reflect our continued efforts to derisk our portfolio and improve our credit metrics. 
We think the continuing to strengthen our credit will help us get better recognition and valuation for our growing cash flow and dividend. This positive credit trend, along with an overall market improvement, has allowed us to continue to be opportunistic regarding refinancing and extending maturities. To that end, last week, we extended an $800 million parent revolver maturity from 2018 to 2021. Also last week, on the nonrecourse side, our business in the Dominican Republic was able to replace a short-term financing with a new $370 million, 10-year bond at more favorable terms. 
We've also earmarked $330 million for investments in our subsidiaries, but 1/3 of which is through our Colon project in Panama and at Southland in California coming online after 2018. 
Finally, after considering these investments in our subs, our current dividend and debt prepayment were left with roughly $150 million of discretionary cash, which we'll invest consistent with our capital allocation framework. As the year's past, much of this cash is weighted towards the latter part of the year. 
Now to slide 27. We are reaffirming our guidance in 2017, '18 expectations for all metrics based on foreign currency and commodity forward curves as of April 30. We continue to generate strong proportional free cash flow, which we relatively evenly distributed in the first and second half of the year. And with the settlement of all outstanding receivables at Maritza, we expect our first half proportional free cash flow to be well ahead of last year's. 
Regarding adjusted EPS, consistent with the first quarter, we also expect the second quarter to be lower than normal. In fact, we're forecasting that 70% to 75% of our 2016 adjusted EPS will be recorded in the second half of 2016 versus about 60% in past years. 
There are a few reasons that our results will be stronger in the second half than first half. First, we expect a lower tax rate in the next 3 quarters. In any given year, there are certain items that influence the quarterly rate, but tend to normalize on a full year basis. As I mentioned earlier, in the first quarter, we recognized a higher-than-usual tax expense, which when combine with relatively low first quarter earnings, had an outsized impact on our tax rate for the quarter. This tax expense was anticipated in our guidance. And accordingly, we continue to expect a 31% to 33% tax rate in 2016. 
Second, the higher concentration of scheduled maintenance in the first half of the year will position us for stronger performance in the second half. For example, San Nicolas plant in Argentina, will undergo planned major maintenance for the entire second quarter as part of its regular maintenance cycle that occurs about every 8 years. A few of our other plants have similar circumstances. 
Third, forward curves for FX and commodities reflect some improvement over the balance of the year, which will provide a benefit in the second half. Fourth, this year's $50 million in cost reductions is more heavily weighted towards the second half. And lastly, we expect to benefit from a couple of items that we're working on to partially offset lower demand in Brazil and lower power prices in the U.S.  We'll be in a better position to discuss these later in the year. 
With that, I'll now turn it back over to Andrés."

To summarize our views on this call, we continue to generate strong proportional free cash flow, which will be evenly distributed between the first and second half of the year. Although we expect our first half adjusted EPS to be relatively weak, many of the negative drivers will reverse in the second half, and therefore, we are reaffirming our guidance for all financial metrics. 
In terms of our strategic priorities, in the first few months of this year, we've made significant progress, including resolving the outstanding receivables issue in Bulgaria; receiving positive actions from the rating agencies resulting from our actions to derisk the portfolio and delever the parent; reaffirming our double-digit growth through 2018 in both cash flow and earnings, driven by our largely funded construction program and $150 million in cost savings and revenue enhancements; and achieving significant milestones on 3 new projects in our development pipeline to drive growth beyond 2018. 
I am optimistic about the future of AES. We are delivering strong and growing free cash flow, which we will continue to use to maximize risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. The 6 gigawatts we currently have under construction is the largest driver of our expected growth of at least 10% in free cash flow through 2018. Beyond 2018, we are well positioned to capture new opportunities due to our strong business platforms in attractive and growing markets and our leadership position in deploying new technologies. 
Now I'd like to open up the call for questions."

I'm wondering, one, when we would potentially get more color on earnings that year, in cash flow that year, in kind of terms of your overall growth rate and what that would mean specifically. And then I also wanted to understand within, I guess, that question, the contracting structure of some of your success here on the LNG side. You have clearly, at least in Panama, one particular power plant where you have a 10-year contract. So I guess I understand that. But then how do you guys think about the risk and the structure of the actual importing of the LNG and the regas there and the selling of that to third parties?"

So that would be next year when we sort of move out an additional year. What we wanted to do was give you color that our growth will continue post-2018. In fact, that we have a good pipeline through 2020 that we recently added to. So that was really the point of this call. Now talking about the facility in Panama, Colon facility, so it has 2 parts. As you said, one's a 380-megawatt combined cycle gas plant on a 10-year PPA with a creditworthy off-taker in dollars. The second is a tank. And the tank, we are using about 1/4 of the capacity for this plant. This leaves about 3/4. So it's really a question of tolling. We're not going to be taking commodity risk on this. So this could be tolling fuel for other power plants. We did this in the Dominican Republic. We're using it. We built a pipeline to the -- our own actually DPP facility and converted from diesel to natural gas, and we're also selling it there to the transportation and industrial sectors. So what we would have in Panama is, first, to meet domestic demand. There are power plants nearby. There are other power plants that will be built that we think will require natural gas. So that's first use. Transportation and industrial use will be second, following the model we had in the Dominican Republic. And third, which is very interesting, is the ship bunkering. We would not be doing the bunkering. We will actually have somebody else to do that, but they would use our storage and regas capacity. So the way to think about this is you basically bring in large efficient LNG tankers. You unload them in Panama and the Dominican Republic, and then you have various means of delivering gas to various types of customers or actually, LNG as well. So we do not plan to take any commodity risk per se on these transactions. We'd be providing a service, regasification service, a bunkering service and a hub service. And between the two, this gives us a very attractive position to be able to service people who want services in Panama and the Dominican Republic."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2016 financial review call. Today, I will discuss our year-to-date performance, provide an update on market conditions and our progress on our strategic and financial objectives. Tom will then discuss our second quarter results and capital allocation in more detail.
Before turning to results, I would like to highlight the most significant milestone that we have achieved so far on our key objectives for 2016. To continue derisking our portfolio, we announced or closed asset sales with proceeds of more than $500 million, well above our target range of $200 million to $300 million. We brought online 1/3 of our capacity under construction, or 2.4 gigawatts, on time and on budget. We prepaid $300 million in parent debt, exceeding our full year target of $200 million, to accelerate our credit improvement. We are on track to achieve our 3-year $150 million cost reduction and revenue enhancement goals. In Bulgaria, we received payments of all outstanding receivables and continue to collect timely payment of invoices, and we continue to make progress to resolve DP&L's pending rate case and are encouraged with recent regulatory developments in Ohio. I will discuss these achievements in more detail in a moment but first, I'd like to summarize our financial results on Slide 4. 
Year-to-date, we generated proportional free cash flow of $670 million, representing 57% of our full year guidance and reflecting the collection of outstanding receivables in Bulgaria during the second quarter. Our year-to-date adjusted EPS was $0.32, representing 32% of our full year guidance, consistent with our comments on our last call. These results keep us on track to achieve our full year financial guidance, which Tom will cover in detail.
Now I'll provide an update on macroeconomic conditions in our markets on Slide 5. First in Brazil. Although we have seen a modest improvement in energy demand since our last call, we're still projecting negative growth for the year. In the U.S, demand is essentially flat. But in most of our other markets, we continue to see robust growth in energy demand in the range of 4% to 10%. Second, while we have seen significant volatility in foreign exchange and commodity prices over the last couple of years, we're generally seeing markets stabilize. As a result, foreign exchange and commodity forward curves are largely in line with our expectations as of our last call. The one exception is that as a result of Brexit, the British pound has depreciated by roughly 10%. However, we are largely hedged in the near term and more importantly, our exposure to the pound is only about 3% of our pretax contribution.
Turning to Slide 6 and our portfolio optimization activities. In Brazil, we are seeing significant consolidation of the regulated utility sector at attractive valuations. We capitalize on this trend with the announced sale of our 100% ownership interest in Sul, our most material utility business in Brazil from an investment point of view, for approximately $470 million in equity proceeds to AES. We are currently seeking regulatory approval for the transaction and expect to close before the end of the year. Including the proceeds from the sale of Sul, we have announced or closed a total of 400 -- $540 million in asset sales this year. Since September 2011 we have announced or closed asset sales with $3.8 billion in proceeds. The cornerstone of our strategy in Brazil is to grow Tietê by pursuing contracted wind and solar generation now that we are seeing the opportunity for reasonable inflation-adjusted returns. These investments will help diversify Tietê generation mix while also allowing us to take advantage of the $300 million to $500 million in untapped debt capacity at Tietê.
Turning now to our platform expansion opportunities on Slide 7. Our ongoing construction program is the most significant driver of our growth over the next few years. We are focusing on our investment efforts on platform expansion projects with long-term U.S.-dollar-denominated contracts. One such opportunity is using our DR and future Panamian assets to play a leading role in expanding the use of LNG throughout Central America and the Caribbean. Regarding our construction projects, I'm happy to report that thus far this year, we have commissioned 2.4 gigawatts on time and on budget. The majority of this capacity is at Indianapolis Power & Light, our regulated utility in Indiana where we will be earning predictable regulated returns on these investments. Later this year, we expect to complete our 552-megawatt Cochran plant in Chile, also on time and on budget. We have another 3.9 gigawatts of new capacity currently under construction and expect it to come online through 2019. To deliver sustainable growth beyond 2019, we continue to advance our development pipeline. To that end, we recently received approval for the 1.4 gigawatts Southland repowering project from the California Utility Commission, and we are on track to receive final environmental permits early in 2017 and expect to break ground that summer.
Turning on to Slide 8. Our 30.9 [ph] gigawatt currently under construction represent total capital expenditures of $7.8 billion. However, through a combination of nonrecourse financing and equity partners, AES' equity commitment is limited to $1.3 billion. Of this, all but $250 million has already been funded. Roughly 74% of our investments are in the Americas. And of this, a majority is in the U.S. and Chile. We expect average return on equity from these projects of approximately 15%. The majority of our construction projects are conventional power plants such as the 670-megawatt Eagle Valley combined cycle gas-powered plant at IDL. Additionally, as we've discussed in the past, we're also building the 530-megawatt run of the river hydro project in Chile. This projects are most complex as we're excavating 67 kilometers of underground tunnels, 1/3 of which are already complete. The project is roughly 6 months behind its original schedule, and we expect to complete the project in 2019.
Turning to Slide 9 in our Colon project in Panama. We made significant progress since our last call. As a reminder, the $1 billion Colon project will contribute to our growth beyond 2018 and includes a 380-megawatt [ph] combined cycle gas plant and a 180,000 cubic meter LNG regasification and storage facility. The power plant is contracted under 10-year U.S. dollar-denominated power purchase agreement, and our partner is a Grupo Motta, one of the largest financial commercial groups in the country. We recently achieved 2 important milestones at Colon: closing the financing of $535 million with a consortium of banks and initiating construction. The Colon project seems to replicate the success of our our Andres LNG facility in the Dominican Republic. Andres provides gas to our adjacent power plant to another power plant by a gas pipeline and to numerous downstream customers in the transportation and industrial sector. Last month, Andres also delivered its first international shipment of LNG to Barbados. This is a great example of our facility's ability to serve as a regional gas hub by breaking large bulk shipments to serve smaller markets. There are many commercial and operational synergies between our LNG terminals in the Dominican Republic and Panama. And with both facilities in operation, we will become the largest provider of LNG regasification and storages services in Central America and the Caribbean.
Turning to Slide 10. We remain optimistic on the future battery-based energy storage because we believe it will play a critical role in an increasingly renewable-based generation mix. As you may know, with our proprietary advancing system, we are the world leader in battery-based energy storage with 136 [ph] megawatts in operation across 4 countries, 30 megawatts under construction and 228 megawatts in advanced development, including 100 megawatts under long-term contract. We aim to create valid view in the energy storage space through 2 primary business models. First by developing and operating AES-owned projects such as the 20-megawatt Harding Street battery array we recently commissioned at IPL. As I just mentioned, we currently have 166 megawatts in operation or construction and another 228 megawatts in advance stage development. Second, by marketing and selling our Advancion energy storage solution to other utilities, commercial and industrial customers directly or through our sales channels partners, these sales require no investment capital and help Advancion capture economies of scale. Thus far this year, we have sold 40 megawatts of advance systems to third parties, representing approximately $70 million of gross revenue. Our second quarter results do not include these sales, but margins on our initial sales will be modest as we amortize start-up costs.
Although battery-based energy storage is still in its early adoption cycle, and we have not included any material amount in our projection, we believe that aAdvancion represents an interesting opportunity for upside.
Turning to Slide 11. As a result of all the actions we are taking, we expect at least 10% annual growth in proportional free cash flow through 2018, which will support our 10% annual growth in dividend, continued deleveraging of the parent subsidiaries and investment in attractive platform expansions. 
As you can see in Slide 12, we also see robust growth in earnings for 2018. From 2016 to 2018, we expect an attractive growth rate of 12% to 16% in our adjusted EPS. Approximately 5% of this annual growth is driven by cost reductions and revenue enhancements. Another 8% to 10% of expected growth is driven by the construction projects coming online in 2017 and 2018.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss our second quarter results, capital allocation and full year guidance in more detail."
35312,371681177,1026698,"The AES Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Andrés. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review our results, including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit or SBU. And I'll cover our 2016 capital allocation as well as",1657,"Thanks, Andrés. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review our results, including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit or SBU. And I'll cover our 2016 capital allocation as well as our guidance and expectations.
Turning to Slide 14. Second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.17 was $0.09 lower than 2015. This decline is in line with expectations communicated on our last call. Specifically, our second quarter results reflect $0.03 lower contributions from our SBUs, including anticipated drivers such as the timing of scheduled maintenance in Andes and MCAC. A reduction of $0.03 because last year's results included the favorable impact of the reversal of a liability at Eletropaulo and the $0.03 impact from the devaluation in foreign currencies, as expected, particularly in Andes in Europe. Before moving on, I want to touch a couple of large impairment charges we had this quarter that are not included in adjusted EPS. 
First, we impaired $235 million of assets at DPL, primarily at the station. This impairment impacts our quarterly diluted EPS was largely driven by the results of the recent PGM capacity auction and our expectation of higher future environmental compliance cost under EPA's F1 limitation guidelines and coal combustion residual rules. Second, as you may have seen in our 10-Q, as a result of the sale, we've included Sul in our discontinued operations, and an impairment was recognized during the second quarter. The remaining loss and sale will be recorded at the closing of the transaction. After taking into account previously recorded cumulative translation adjustments, the net impact on AES' equity will be a reduction of about $100 million. Given this business is in discontinued operations, these noncash items do not affect either diluted or adjusted EPS. As a result of placing Sul into disc ops, its earnings or losses are removed from our 2016 and 2015 results. Consequently, our first quarter results have been restated to $0.15 after moving the $0.02 negative impact from Sul, which brings our year-to-date adjusted EPS to $0.32.
Now to Slide 15 and our overall results for the quarter. We generated $417 million of proportional free cash flow, an increase of $355 million from last year and significant working capital improvements, primarily at Maritza and Bulgaria offset lower margins. We also earned $160 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of $100 million. Now I'll cover our SBUs in more detail over the next 6 slides, beginning on Slide 16. In the U.S., our results reflect relatively flat margins as lower wholesale prices and lower contributions from regulated customers at DPL and largely offset by higher contributions at IPL, including the benefit from the recent rig case and environmental upgrade that came online through this quarter. Also, adjusted PTC was up modestly, reflecting lower interest expense at DPL and IPL. Proportional free cash flow also reflects favorable working capital changes at IPL. At Andes, our results reflect slightly higher margins due to higher spot and contract sales as well as lower maintenance at Chile, partially offset by planned outages in Argentina as well as the devaluation of the Colombian and Argentine pesos. Free cash flow also benefited from higher collections in Argentina and at 
In Brazil, our results reflect lower margins due to the benefit of a liability reversal at Eletropaulo in 2015. The expiration of Tietê's PPA at the end of 2015 and the 12% devaluation of the Brazilian real. Proportional free cash flow also reflects higher collections at Eletropaulo and Sul. In Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect lower margins due to lower availability including a planned outage in the Dominican Republic where we were performing interconnection work with the preparation of expansion of our existing DPP gas-fired facility. As you may recall, we're converting the simple cycle DPP plant to combined cycle, improving its capacity by 50% to 358 megawatts. Construction on this project is progressing well. We've already completed 80% of the upgrade, and it is expected to come online in the first half of 2017. Our quarterly results were also impacted by lower third-party gas sales in the Dominican Republic. 
In Europe, our results reflect lower margins due to 45% devaluation of the Proportional free cash flow also reflects the settlement of our $350 million outstanding receivable at Maritza in Bulgaria this quarter. It's worth mentioning greatly improved collections in the roughly 3 months since that settlement, and payments are current. As a direct result of recent energy sector reforms, our offtaker, NEK, is now cash flow positive versus substantially negative in 2015. This improved financial condition also drove strong interest in the recent bond issuance by NEK's parent where we're able to raise more than EUR 0.5 billion at attractive rates. Finally, in Asia, our results reflect steady margins and lower working capital requirements at Mong Duong in Vietnam. 
And on Slide 22, I'll provide an update on a regulatory filing at DP&L in Ohio. Under DP&L's current ESP, which covers the period from 2014 to '16, DP&L has been collecting a service stability rider of a little over $9 million per month. As you may know, the Supreme Court of Ohio reversed the utility commission's approval of the current ESP in late June. The court has since remanded the case to the commission, which now has jurisdiction. Last week, DP&L filed to withdraw its current ESP and requested that the commission revert to the rates in effect prior to 2014, which would result in an immaterial financial impact to the company. The matter is now pending before the commission, and we expect the ruling within a matter of weeks. At the same time, we continued to progress on our filing for a new ESP, which we expect to be effective beginning in January 2017. We expect an outcome that will support the financial viability and credit profile of the business.
Now to Slide 23 and the progress we're making to improve our credit profile. We recently completed the refinancing of $500 million of our 2019 notes, extending the tenure with new 10-year notes. Additionally, since our last call, we have prepaid $180 million of parent debt, bringing our total pay down year-to-date to $300 million, exceeding our 2016 debt reduction target by 50%. Since 2011, we reduced parent debt by $1.7 billion or 27% and reduced interest by 125 basis points, resulting in an annualized interest savings of $180 million. As you can see at the top of the slide, we now have no debt maturities maturing at the parent until 2019 and only $240 million is due. In addition to the refinancing we executed at the parent, we've also taken advantage of favorable market conditions and refinanced $1.4 billion in nonrecourse debt, primarily in Latin America. Through these proactive actions, we've been able to extend the maturities, lower interest cost and reduce our exposure to floating-rate interest. As you can see at the bottom of the slide, these proactive steps have helped us to reduce our parent leverage ratio from almost 6.5x to slightly over 5x debt to parent free cash flow plus interest. These actions reflect our continued efforts to derisk our portfolio and improve our credit metrics. We believe this will help us reduce our cost of debt and enhance our equity valuation.
Now to our parent capital allocation on Slide 24. Sources on the left-hand side reflect $1.5 billion of total available discretionary cash, which includes $575 million of parent free cash flow. We continue to focus on maximizing cash in the quarter. And as a recent example, once the administration lifted currency controls in Argentina, we took a modest dividend out of the country for the first time since 2011. We remain confident in our 2016 parent free cash flow range of $525 million to $625 million, which is the foundation for our discretionary cash available for dividend growth and value creation. Sources also include $540 million of proceeds from asset sales, including approximately $470 million sale of Sul. As we expect the sale to close late in the year, we'll likely not apply much of capital in 2016. We have, however, accelerated the use of a portion of the expected proceeds by prepaying $180 million of parent debt in July as I just discussed. Now uses on the right-hand side of the slide. Consistent with our capital allocation plan that we showed during our last call, the 10% growth in our dividend and completed share repurchases, we've returned about 1/3 of our allocated cash to shareholders this year. Going forward, we continue to see our dividend as a primary means to distribute cash to shareholders. As I just discussed, we've already prepaid $300 million in near-term maturities. We've also allocated $360 million for investments in our subsidiaries, a majority of which is for new projects to drive growth through '18 and beyond. After considering these investments in our subsidiaries debt repayment of our current dividend, we're left with roughly $450 million of discretionary cash which we'll invest consistent with our capital allocation framework.
Finally turning to Slide 25. We are reaffirming our 2016 guidance and 2017, '18 expectations for all metrics based on foreign currency and commodity foreign curves as of June 30. We continue to generate strong proportional free cash flow with our first half results reflecting the settlement of all outstanding receivables at Maritza. In our first half, adjusted EPS was in line with what we communicated on our last call as our results were impacted by a higher tax rate, planned outages and softness in U.S. power prices. The majority of our earnings are expected to be generated in second half of the year, and we should benefit from a few factors including lower scheduled maintenance, lower effective tax rate, the realization of cost savings initiative and a couple other items we're working on.
With that, I'll now turn it back to Andrés."

We do continue to think that there is strong support in the state for in-state generation, given the polar vortex that wasn't too far removed, the in-state jobs and in-state revenue from taxes and those kind of things. So we think there's strong support for that and I'll probably just say we're encouraged by the discussions. As we said, we refiled our rates for the remainder of '16 to go basically back to the pre-'14 structure. And we think that, that is constructive and consistent with the sentiments."

So what I would like to say is that we'll continue to grow those businesses, especially those that are cash accretive.

So yes, I'm not going to get into it specifically but I think if you do it by the process the elimination which are those places where we don't see growth where we don't see a long-term contract.

We've always had this for many years we had this leverage capacity and the ability to buy new assets to grow, but we didn't really see the valuations. We really didn't see valuations that were attractive for us. With the correction in prices in Brazil, we're starting to see opportunity that would make it more attractive to leverage up Tietê and buy something in Brazil. Now what would we buy? As we said in the past, we are really looking at our sort of risks and we wouldn't want more risk in Brazil. So ideally, it'd be something like solar or wind or perhaps even thermal that would not be correlated to hydrology in Brazil to make our cash flow from Tietê more steady.

What we're seeing in this business is continued reduction in cost. So if we look at the cost of batteries, they have come down 80% in the last 5 years, and we're projecting an additional 50% in the next 5. So that will drive them down significantly.",425,"Yes. What we're seeing in this business is continued reduction in cost. So if we look at the cost of batteries, they have come down 80% in the last 5 years, and we're projecting an additional 50% in the next 5. So that will drive them down significantly. And really, this is not technological breakthrough, this is massive of the production process. So the more people that bring online gig fractories and drive down battery prices, the better it will be for people such as ourselves. Now given that, how do we see this market? Well, this market is growing. One of the main, let's say, things that are slowing it down is regulatory since these batteries operate differently than just regulatory, say, peaking plants, other people providing ancillary services because. For example, it goes positive and it goes negative. But having said that, we're seeing this market that was a couple of hundred megawatts last year. This year it's growing. Some of the forecast by 2020 could be 10 gigawatts globally. So the forecast -- the lower forecast, you'll see is probably around 6 gigawatts. That's still a tremendous rate of growth. Now there are many applications it's a little bit of a hammer, and so you can use it for many different things from load shifting, ancillary services, capacity release, transmission constraints. So that's how we see this market. Now I see it kind of growing quickly. Some markets quicker than others. The U.S. is clearly leading. Great -- the U.K. is having an important auction now. We see interesting markets in India with their expansion of renewables. So basically, as I said in my speech, as you have more renewables on the grid, interruptible renewables, the greater the need for these batteries in their different forms to alleviate that. So we're pursuing it by 2 means. One is on our own platform. We're participating in some of these auctions. When they're big enough, we do bring in partners like we do on large projects. But we're also pursuing through some direct sales but also through sales channel partners. Global sales, we've already had some success with $70 million so far this year. We expect that to grow over the remainder of the year and into next. And of course, that has, over time, will have an interesting margin. But right now, one of the things that this help is drive down cost. It's all about scale. You're one of the largest suppliers to the market I think you have a cost advantage."

So for example, we have a lower ROE for those projects that rate based on a regulated utility than we do on some of the other projects, which are on different locations. So the one thing we are moving towards, I would say, derisking the company. And that is an important component. So it's dollar-denominated long-term contracted in a good zip code, investment grade country have a lower return than some of the other locations I do think that when you look at the projects what's important is that there's a lot of synergies between them. So if we look at, for example, the Panama project, it has significant synergies. If we increase the amount of tolling we do from that facility our power plant will take roughly about 30% of the capacity, the tank and the terminal. So we're really looking for third-party sales like we do in the Dominican Republic. So once you have the 2 hubs operating, the return from the project will not only be from the project itself but also be from the existing businesses. So that's how we're looking at it. And just to say, I don't think if interest rates go up, it depends how much they go but, but  also shifting our businesses to less risky businesses. And the returns of the project is also returns to existing businesses, which perhaps were not included in ROE."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2016 financial review call. Today I will discuss our year-to-date performance, provide an update on market conditions and our progress on our strategic and financial objectives. Tom will then discuss our second quarter results and capital allocation in more detail.
Before turning to results, I would like to highlight the most significant milestone that we have achieved so far on our key objectives for 2016. To continue derisking our portfolio, we announced or closed asset sales with proceeds of more than $500 million, well above our target range of $200 million to $300 million. We brought online 1/3 of our capacity under construction, or 2.4 gigawatts, on time and on budget. We prepaid $300 million in parent debt, exceeding our full year target of $200 million, to accelerate our credit improvement. We are on track to achieve our 3-year $150 million cost reduction and revenue enhancement goals. In Bulgaria, we received payment of all outstanding receivables and continue to collect timely payment of invoices, and we continue to make progress to resolve DP&L's pending rate case and are encouraged with recent regulatory developments in Ohio. I will discuss these achievements in more detail in a moment, but first I'd like to summarize our financial results on Slide 4. 
Year-to-date, we generated proportional free cash flow of $670 million, representing 57% of our full year guidance and reflecting the collection of outstanding receivables in Bulgaria during the second quarter. Our year-to-date adjusted EPS was $0.32, representing 32% of our full year guidance, consistent with our comments on our last call. These results keep us on track to achieve our full year financial guidance, which Tom will cover in detail.
Now I'll provide an update on macroeconomic conditions in our markets on Slide 5. First in Brazil. Although we have seen a modest improvement in energy demand since our last call, we're still projecting negative growth for the year. In the U.S., demand is essentially flat. But in most of our other markets, we continue to see robust growth in energy demand in the range of 4% to 10%. Second, while we have seen significant volatility in foreign exchange and commodity prices over the last couple of years, we're generally seeing markets stabilize. As a result, foreign exchange and commodity forward curves are largely in line with our expectations as of our last call. The one exception is that as a result of Brexit, the British pound has depreciated by roughly 10%. However, we are largely hedged in the near term, and more importantly, our exposure to the pound is only about 3% of our pretax contribution.
Turning to Slide 6 and our portfolio optimization activities. In Brazil, we are seeing significant consolidation of the regulated utility sector at attractive valuations. We capitalized on this trend with the announced sale of our 100% ownership interest in Sul, our most material utility business in Brazil from an investment point of view, for approximately $470 million in equity proceeds to AES. We are currently seeking regulatory approval for the transaction and expect to close before the end of the year. Including the proceeds from the sale of Sul, we have announced or closed a total of 400 -- $540 million in asset sales this year. Since September 2011, we have announced or closed asset sales with $3.8 billion in proceeds. The cornerstone of our strategy in Brazil is to grow Tietê by pursuing contracted wind and solar generation now that we are seeing the opportunity for reasonable inflation-adjusted returns. These investments will help diversify Tietê generation mix while also allowing us to take advantage of the $300 million to $500 million in untapped debt capacity at Tietê.
Turning now to our platform expansion opportunities on Slide 7. Our ongoing construction program is the most significant driver of our growth over the next few years. We are focusing on our investment efforts on platform expansion projects with long-term U.S.-dollar-denominated contracts. One such opportunity is using our DR and future Panamanian assets to play a leading role in expanding the use of LNG throughout Central America and the Caribbean. Regarding our construction projects, I'm happy to report that thus far this year, we have commissioned 2.4 gigawatts on time and on budget. The majority of this capacity is at Indianapolis Power & Light, our regulated utility in Indiana, where we will be earning predictable regulated returns on these investments. Later this year, we expect to complete our 552-megawatt Cochrane plant in Chile, also on time and on budget. We have another 3.9 gigawatts of new capacity currently under construction and expect it to come online through 2019. To deliver sustainable growth beyond 2019, we continue to advance our development pipeline. To that end, we recently received approval for the 1.4 gigawatts Southland repowering project from the California utility commission, and we are on track to receive final environmental permits early in 2017 and expect to break ground that summer.
Turning now to Slide 8. Our 30.9 [ph] gigawatts currently under construction represent total capital expenditures of $7.8 billion. However, through a combination of nonrecourse financing and equity partners, AES' equity commitment is limited to $1.3 billion. Of this, all but $250 million has already been funded. Roughly 74% of our investments are in the Americas. And of this, a majority is in the U.S. and Chile. We expect average return on equity from these projects of approximately 15%. The majority of our construction projects are conventional power plants, such as the 670-megawatt Eagle Valley combined cycle gas-powered plant at IPL. Additionally, as we've discussed in the past, we're also building the 530-megawatt Alto Maipo run of the river hydro project in Chile. This project is our most complex, as we're excavating 67 kilometers of underground tunnels, 1/3 of which are already complete. The project is roughly 6 months behind its original schedule, and we expect to complete the project in 2019.
Turning to Slide 9 and our Colon project in Panama. We have made significant progress since our last call. As a reminder, the $1 billion Colon project will contribute to our growth beyond 2018 and includes a 380-megawatt combined cycle gas plant and a 180,000-cubic-meter LNG regasification and storage facility. The power plant is contracted under a 10-year U.S. dollar-denominated power purchase agreement, and our partner is Grupo Motta, one of the largest financial commercial groups in the country. We recently achieved 2 important milestones at Colon: closing the financing of $535 million with a consortium of banks and initiating construction. The Colon project seeks to replicate the success of our Andres LNG facility in the Dominican Republic. Andres provides gas to our adjacent power plant, to another power plant by a gas pipeline and to numerous downstream customers in the transportation and industrial sector. Last month, Andres also delivered its first international shipment of LNG to Barbados. This is a great example of our facility's ability to serve as a regional gas hub by breaking large bulk shipments to serve smaller markets. There are many commercial and operational synergies between our LNG terminals in the Dominican Republic and Panama. And with both facilities in operation, we will become the largest provider of LNG regasification and storages services in Central America and the Caribbean.
Turning to Slide 10. We remain optimistic on the future of battery-based energy storage because we believe it will play a critical role in an increasingly renewables-based generation mix. As you may know, with our proprietary Advancion system, we are the world leader in battery-based energy storage with 136 megawatts in operation across 4 countries, 30 megawatts under construction and 228 megawatts in advanced development, including 100 megawatts under a long-term contract. We aim to create value in the energy storage space through 2 primary business models. First, by developing and operating AES-owned projects, such as the 20-megawatt Harding Street battery array we recently commissioned at IPL. As I just mentioned, we currently have 166 megawatts in operation or construction and another 228 megawatts in advance stage development. Second, by marketing and selling our Advancion energy storage solution to other utilities, commercial and industrial customers directly or through our sales channels partners, these sales require no investment capital and help Advancion capture economies of scale. Thus far this year, we have sold 40 megawatts of Advancion systems to third parties, representing approximately $70 million of gross revenue. Our second quarter results do not include these sales, but margins on our initial sales will be modest as we amortize start-up costs.
Although battery-based energy storage is still in its early adoption cycle, and we have not included any material amount in our projection, we believe that Advancion represents an interesting opportunity for upside.
Turning to Slide 11. As a result of all the actions we are taking, we expect at least 10% annual growth in proportional free cash flow through 2018, which will support our 10% annual growth in dividend, continued deleveraging of the parent and subsidiaries and investment in attractive platform expansions. 
As you can see on Slide 12, we also see robust growth in earnings for 2018. From 2016 to 2018, we expect an attractive growth rate of 12% to 16% in our adjusted EPS. Approximately 5% of this annual growth is driven by cost reductions and revenue enhancements. Another 8% to 10% of expected growth is driven by the construction projects coming online in 2017 and 2018.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss our second quarter results, capital allocation and full year guidance in more detail."
35312,371681177,1027054,"The AES Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Andrés. Good morning, everyone. Today I'll review our results, including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit or SBU. And I'll cover our 2016 capital allocation as well as",1674,"Thanks, Andrés. Good morning, everyone. Today I'll review our results, including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit or SBU. And I'll cover our 2016 capital allocation as well as our guidance and expectations.
Turning to Slide 14. Second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.17 was $0.09 lower than 2015. This decline is in line with expectations communicated on our last call. Specifically, our second quarter results reflect $0.03 lower contributions from our SBUs, including anticipated drivers such as the timing of scheduled maintenance in Andes and MCAC. A reduction of $0.03 because last year's result included the favorable impact of a reversal of a liability at Eletropaulo and a $0.03 impact from the devaluation in foreign currencies, as expected, particularly in Andes in Europe. Before moving on, I want to touch a couple of large impairment charges we had this quarter that are not included in adjusted EPS. 
First, we impaired $235 million of assets at DPL, primarily at the Killen Station. This impairment impacts our quarterly diluted EPS and was largely driven by the results of the recent PJM capacity auction and our expectation of higher future environmental compliance costs under the EPA's effluent limitation guidelines and coal combustion residual rules. Second, as you may have seen in our 10-Q, as a result of the sale, we've included Sul in our discontinued operations, and an impairment was recognized during the second quarter. The remaining loss on sale will be recorded at the closing of the transaction. After taking into account previously recorded cumulative translation adjustments, the net impact on AES' equity will be a reduction of about $100 million. Given this business is in discontinued operations, these noncash items do not affect either diluted or adjusted EPS. As a result of placing Sul into disc ops, its earnings or losses are removed from our 2016 and 2015 results. Consequently, our first quarter results have been restated to $0.15 after removing the $0.02 negative impact from Sul, which brings our year-to-date adjusted EPS to $0.32.
Now to Slide 15 and our overall results for the quarter. We generated $417 million of proportional free cash flow, an increase of $355 million from last year, as significant working capital improvements, primarily at Maritza in Bulgaria, offset lower margins. We also earned $160 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of $100 million. Now I'll cover our SBUs in more detail over the next 6 slides, beginning on Slide 16. In the U.S., our results reflect relatively flat margins as lower wholesale prices and lower contributions from regulated customers at DPL were largely offset by higher contributions at IPL, including the benefit from the recent rate case and environmental upgrades that came online through this quarter. Also, adjusted PTC was up modestly, reflecting lower interest expense at DPL and IPL. Proportional free cash flow also reflects favorable working capital changes at IPL. At Andes, our results reflect slightly higher margins due to higher spot and contract sales as well as lower maintenance at Gener in Chile, partially offset by planned outages in Argentina as well as the devaluation of the Colombian and Argentine pesos. Proportional free cash flow also benefited from higher collections in Argentina and at Gener.
In Brazil, our results reflect lower margins due to the benefit of a liability reversal at Eletropaulo in 2015, the expiration of Tietê's PPA at the end of 2015 and the 12% devaluation of the Brazilian real. Proportional free cash flow also reflects higher collections at Eletropaulo and Sul. In Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect lower margins due to lower availability, including a planned outage in the Dominican Republic, where we were performing interconnection work in the preparation for the expansion of our existing DPP gas-fired facility. As you may recall, we're converting the simple cycle DPP plant to combined cycle, improving its capacity by 50% to 358 megawatts. Construction on this project is progressing well. We've already completed 80% of the upgrade, and it is expected to come online in the first half of 2017. Our quarterly results were also impacted by lower third-party gas sales in the Dominican Republic. 
In Europe, our results reflect lower margins due to the 45% devaluation of the Kazakhstan tenge. Proportional free cash flow also reflects the settlement of our $350 million outstanding receivable at Maritza in Bulgaria this quarter. It's worth mentioning that we've seen greatly improved collections in the roughly 3 months since that settlement, and payments are current. As a direct result of recent energy sector reforms, our offtaker, NEK, is now cash flow positive versus substantially negative in 2015. This improved financial condition also drove strong interest in the recent bond issuance by NEK's parent, where they're able to raise more than EUR 0.5 billion at attractive rates. Finally, in Asia, our results reflect steady margins and lower working capital requirements at Mong Duong in Vietnam. 
And on Slide 22, I'll provide an update on our regulatory filing at DP&L in Ohio. Under DP&L's current ESP, which covers the period from 2014 to '16, DP&L has been collecting a service stability rider of a little over $9 million per month. As you may know, the Supreme Court of Ohio reversed the utility commission's approval of the current ESP in late June. The court has since remanded the case to the commission, which now has jurisdiction. Last week, DP&L filed to withdraw its current ESP and requested that the commission revert to the rates in effect prior to 2014, which would result in an immaterial financial impact to the company. The matter is now pending before the commission, and we expect the ruling within a matter of weeks. At the same time, we continued to progress on our filing for a new ESP, which we expect to be effective beginning in January 2017. We expect an outcome that will support the financial viability and credit profile of the business.
Now to Slide 23 and the progress we're making to improve our credit profile. We recently completed the refinancing of $500 million of our 2019 notes, extending the tenure with new 10-year notes. Additionally, since our last call, we have prepaid $180 million in parent debt, bringing our total paydown year-to-date to $300 million, exceeding our 2016 debt reduction target by 50%. Since 2011, we have reduced parent debt by $1.7 billion or 27% and reduced interest by 125 basis points, resulting in an annualized interest savings of $180 million. As you can see at the top of the slide, we now have no debt maturities maturing at the parent until 2019, when only $240 million is due. In addition to the refinancing we executed at the parent, we've also taken advantage of favorable market conditions and refinanced $1.4 billion in nonrecourse debt, primarily in Latin America. Through these proactive actions, we've been able to extend our maturities, lower interest costs and reduce our exposure to floating-rate interest. As you can see at the bottom of the slide, these proactive steps have helped us to reduce our parent leverage ratio from almost 6.5x to slightly over 5x debt to parent free cash flow plus interest. These actions reflect our continued efforts to derisk our portfolio and improve our credit metrics. We believe this will help us reduce our cost of debt and enhance our equity valuation.
Now to our parent capital allocation on Slide 24. Sources on the left-hand side reflect $1.5 billion of total available discretionary cash, which includes $575 million in parent free cash flow. We continue to focus on maximizing cash to corp. And as a recent example, once the Macri administration lifted currency controls in Argentina, we took a modest dividend out of the country for the first time since 2011. We remain confident in our 2016 parent free cash flow range of $525 million to $625 million, which is the foundation for our discretionary cash available for dividend growth and value creation. Sources also include $540 million of proceeds from asset sales, including the approximately $470 million sale of Sul. As we expect the sale to close late in the year, we'll likely not deploy much of this capital in 2016. We have, however, accelerated the use of a portion of expected proceeds by prepaying $180 million of parent debt in July, as I just discussed. Now the uses on the right-hand side of the slide. Consistent with our capital allocation plan that we showed during our last call, with 10% growth in our dividend and completed share repurchases, we've returned about 1/3 of our allocated cash to shareholders this year. Going forward, we continue to see our dividend as a primary means to distribute cash to shareholders. As I just discussed, we've already prepaid $300 million in near-term maturities. We've also allocated $360 million for investments in our subsidiaries, the majority of which is for new projects driving our growth through '18 and beyond. After considering these investments in our subsidiaries, debt prepayment and our current dividend, we're left with roughly $450 million of discretionary cash, which we'll invest consistent with our capital allocation framework.
Finally turning to Slide 25. We are reaffirming our 2016 guidance and 2017, '18 expectations for all metrics based on foreign currency and commodity foreign curves as of June 30. We continue to generate strong proportional free cash flow with our first half results reflecting the settlement of all outstanding receivables at Maritza. In our first half, adjusted EPS was in line with what we communicated on our last call, as our results were impacted by a higher tax rate, planned outages and softness in U.S. power prices. The majority of our earnings are expected to be generated in second half of the year, when we should benefit from a few factors, including lower scheduled maintenance, a lower effective tax rate, the realization of cost savings initiative and a couple other items we're working on.
With that, I'll now turn it back to Andrés."

Second, we continue to invest our growing cash flow to reduce debt and in select growth projects as well as offering our investors a significant and growing dividend. Third, we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong free cash flow growth through 2018, which is driven by our projects under construction and our cost savings and revenue enhancement initiatives. Finally, we believe we are well positioned to deliver sustainable growth beyond 2018 due to our strong business platforms in attractive and growing markets and our leadership position in deploying new technologies.
With that, I would like to open up the call for questions."

So we think there is strong support for that. And I'd probably just say we're encouraged by discussions.

So what I would like to say is that we'll continue to grow those businesses, especially those that are cash accretive. Our real focus is on creating a company where we have a strong, sustainable growth in our dividend. And that's what we're focused on. So I'm not going to get into it specifically, but I think if you do it by the process of elimination which are those places where we don't see growth, where we don't see a long-term contracts and we really don't have any really sort of particularly advantageous position, we will get out of.

It's a little bit different way to slice up the same amounts. In terms of going forward, we believe that what we had filed earlier in, what, January February, we can work under that umbrella, if you will. So we don't need to pull that back and refile.

Second, we've been very disciplined in Brazil, especially at Tietê. We've always had this -- or for many years have had this leverage capacity and the ability to buy new assets to grow, but we didn't really see the valuations. We really didn't see valuations that were attractive for us. With the correction in prices in Brazil, we're starting to see opportunity that would make it more attractive to leverage up Tietê and buy something in Brazil. Now what would we buy? Well, as we've said in the past, we are really looking at our sort of risks, and we wouldn't want more hydro risk in Brazil. So ideally, it would be something like solar or wind or perhaps even thermal that would not be correlated to hydrology in Brazil to make our cash flow from Tietê more steady.

What we're seeing in this business is continued reduction in cost.

What we're seeing in this business is continued reduction in cost. So if we look at the cost of batteries, they have come down 80% in the last 5 years, and we're projecting an additional 50% in the next 5. So that will drive them down significantly. And really, this is not technological breakthroughs as much as just really massification of the production process. So the more people that bring online giga factories and drive down battery prices, the better it will be for people such as ourselves. Now given that, how do we see this market? Well, this market is growing. One of the main, let's say, things that are slowing it down is regulatory, since these batteries operate differently than just regulatory, say, peaking plants or other people providing ancillary services because, for example, it goes positive and it goes negative. But having said that, we're seeing this market that was a couple hundred megawatts last year. This year it's growing. Some of the forecasts, by 2020, could be 10 gigawatts globally. So the forecast -- the lowest forecast you'll see is probably around 6 gigawatts. That's still a tremendous rate of growth. Now there are many applications. This is a little bit of a hammer, and so you can use it for many different things from load shifting, ancillary services, capacity release, transmission constraints. So that's how we see this market. Now I see it kind of growing quickly. Some markets quicker than others. The U.S. is clearly leading. Great -- the U.K. is having an important auction now. We see interesting markets in India with their expansion of renewables. So basically, as I said in my speech, as you have more renewables on the grid, interruptible renewables, the greater the need for these batteries in their different forms to alleviate that. So we're pursuing it by 2 means. One is on our own platform. We're participating in some of these auctions. When they're big enough, we do bring in partners like we do on all large projects. But we're also pursuing through some direct sales but also through sales channel partners. Global sales, we've already had some success with $70 million so far this year. We expect that to grow over the remainder of the year and into next. And of course, that has, over time, will have an interesting margin. But right now, one of the things it does is help drive down cost, because this is all about scale. So if you're one of the largest suppliers to the market, I think you will have a cost advantage."

So for example, we have a lower ROE for those projects that are rate based on a regulated utility than we do on some of the other projects, which are on different locations. So the one thing, we are moving towards, I would say, derisking the company. And that is an important component. So it's dollar-denominated long-term contract in a good ZIP code, investment-grade country, those will have a lower return than some of the other locations. But I do think that when you look at our projects, what's important is that there are a lot of synergies between them. So if we look at, for example, the Panama project, it has significant synergies. If we increase the amount of tolling we do from that facility, our power plant will take roughly about 30% of the capacity, the tank and the terminal. So we're really looking for third-party sales, like we're doing in the Dominican Republic. So once you have the 2 hubs operating, the return from the project will not only be from the project itself, it will also be from the existing businesses. So that's how we're looking at it. And just to say, so I don't think that if interest rates go up -- it depends how much they go up, but we're also shifting our businesses to less risky businesses. And the returns of the project is also returns to existing businesses, which perhaps were not included in that ROE."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2016 financial review call. Today I will discuss our year-to-date performance, provide an update on market conditions and our progress on our strategic and financial objectives. Tom will then discuss our second quarter results and capital allocation in more detail.
Before turning to results, I would like to highlight the most significant milestone that we have achieved so far on our key objectives for 2016. To continue derisking our portfolio, we announced or closed asset sales with proceeds of more than $500 million, well above our target range of $200 million to $300 million. We brought online 1/3 of our capacity under construction, or 2.4 gigawatts, on time and on budget. We prepaid $300 million in parent debt, exceeding our full year target of $200 million, to accelerate our credit improvement. We are on track to achieve our 3-year $150 million cost reduction and revenue enhancement goals. In Bulgaria, we received payment of all outstanding receivables and continue to collect timely payment of invoices, and we continue to make progress to resolve DP&L's pending rate case and are encouraged with recent regulatory developments in Ohio. I will discuss these achievements in more detail in a moment, but first I'd like to summarize our financial results on Slide 4. 
Year-to-date, we generated proportional free cash flow of $670 million, representing 57% of our full year guidance and reflecting the collection of outstanding receivables in Bulgaria during the second quarter. Our year-to-date adjusted EPS was $0.32, representing 32% of our full year guidance, consistent with our comments on our last call. These results keep us on track to achieve our full year financial guidance, which Tom will cover in detail.
Now I'll provide an update on macroeconomic conditions in our markets on Slide 5. First in Brazil. Although we have seen a modest improvement in energy demand since our last call, we're still projecting negative growth for the year. In the U.S., demand is essentially flat. But in most of our other markets, we continue to see robust growth in energy demand in the range of 4% to 10%. Second, while we have seen significant volatility in foreign exchange and commodity prices over the last couple of years, we're generally seeing markets stabilize. As a result, foreign exchange and commodity forward curves are largely in line with our expectations as of our last call. The one exception is that as a result of Brexit, the British pound has depreciated by roughly 10%. However, we are largely hedged in the near term, and more importantly, our exposure to the pound is only about 3% of our pretax contribution.
Turning to Slide 6 and our portfolio optimization activities. In Brazil, we are seeing significant consolidation of the regulated utility sector at attractive valuations. We capitalized on this trend with the announced sale of our 100% ownership interest in Sul, our most material utility business in Brazil from an investment point of view, for approximately $470 million in equity proceeds to AES. We are currently seeking regulatory approvals for the transaction and expect to close before the end of the year. Including the proceeds from the sale of Sul, we have announced or closed a total of 400 -- $540 million in asset sales this year. Since September 2011, we have announced or closed asset sales with $3.8 billion in proceeds. The cornerstone of our strategy in Brazil is to grow Tietê by pursuing contracted wind and solar generation now that we are seeing the opportunity for reasonable inflation-adjusted returns. These investments will help diversify Tietê generation mix while also allowing us to take advantage of the $300 million to $500 million in untapped debt capacity at Tietê.
Turning now to our platform expansion opportunities on Slide 7. Our ongoing construction program is the most significant driver of our growth over the next few years. We are focusing on our investment efforts on platform expansion projects with long-term U.S.-dollar-denominated contracts. One such opportunity is using our DR and future Panamanian assets to play a leading role in expanding the use of LNG throughout Central America and the Caribbean. Regarding our construction projects, I'm happy to report that thus far this year, we have commissioned 2.4 gigawatts on time and on budget. The majority of this capacity is at Indianapolis Power & Light, our regulated utility in Indiana, where we will be earning predictable regulated returns on these investments. Later this year, we expect to complete our 552-megawatt Cochrane plant in Chile, also on time and on budget. We have another 3.9 gigawatts of new capacity currently under construction and expect it to come online through 2019. To deliver sustainable growth beyond 2019, we continue to advance our development pipeline. To that end, we recently received approval for the 1.4 gigawatt Southland repowering project from the California utility commission, and we are on track to receive final environmental permits early in 2017 and expect to break ground that summer.
Turning now to Slide 8. Our 3.9 gigawatts currently under construction represent total capital expenditures of $7.8 billion. However, through a combination of nonrecourse financing and equity partners, AES' equity commitment is limited to $1.3 billion. Of this, all but $250 million has already been funded. Roughly 74% of our investments are in the Americas. And of this, a majority is in the U.S. and Chile. We expect average return on equity from these projects of approximately 15%. The majority of our construction projects are conventional power plants, such as the 670-megawatt Eagle Valley combined cycle gas-fired plant at IPL. Additionally, as we've discussed in the past, we're also building the 530-megawatt Alto Maipo run of the river hydro project in Chile. This project is our most complex, as we're excavating 67 kilometers of underground tunnels, 1/3 of which are already complete. The project is roughly 6 months behind its original schedule, and we expect to complete the project in 2019.
Turning to Slide 9 and our Colon project in Panama. We have made significant progress since our last call. As a reminder, the $1 billion Colon project will contribute to our growth beyond 2018 and includes a 380-megawatt combined cycle gas plant and a 180,000-cubic-meter LNG regasification and storage facility. The power plant is contracted under a 10-year U.S. dollar-denominated power purchase agreement, and our partner is Grupo Motta, one of the largest financial and commercial groups in the country. We recently achieved 2 important milestones at Colon: closing the financing of $535 million with a consortium of banks and initiating construction. The Colon project seeks to replicate the success of our Andres LNG facility in the Dominican Republic. Andres provides gas to our adjacent power plant, to another power plant by a gas pipeline and to numerous downstream customers in the transportation and industrial sector. Last month, Andres also delivered its first international shipment of LNG to Barbados. This is a great example of our facility's ability to serve as a regional gas hub by breaking large bulk shipments to serve smaller markets. There are many commercial and operational synergies between our LNG terminals in the Dominican Republic and Panama. And with both facilities in operation, we will become the largest provider of LNG regasification and storages services in Central America and the Caribbean.
Turning to Slide 10. We remain optimistic on the future of battery-based energy storage because we believe it will play a critical role in an increasingly renewables-based generation mix. As you may know, with our proprietary Advancion system, we are the world leader in battery-based energy storage with 136 megawatts in operation across 4 countries, 30 megawatts under construction and 228 megawatts in advanced development, including 100 megawatts under a long-term contract. We aim to create value in the energy storage space through 2 primary business models. First, by developing and operating AES-owned projects, such as the 20-megawatt Harding Street battery array we recently commissioned at IPL. As I just mentioned, we currently have 166 megawatts in operation or construction and another 228 megawatts in advanced stage development. Second, by marketing and selling our Advancion energy storage solution to other utilities, commercial and industrial customers directly or through our sales channels partners, these sales require no investment capital and help Advancion capture economies of scale. Thus far this year, we have sold 40 megawatts of Advancion systems to third parties, representing approximately $70 million of gross revenue. Our second quarter results do not include these sales, but margins on our initial sales will be modest as we amortize start-up costs.
Although battery-based energy storage is still in its early adoption cycle, and we have not included any material amount in our projection, we believe that Advancion represents an interesting opportunity for upside.
Turning to Slide 11. As a result of all the actions we are taking, we expect at least 10% annual growth in proportional free cash flow through 2018, which will support our 10% annual growth in dividend, continued deleveraging of the parent and subsidiaries and investment in attractive platform expansions. 
As you can see on Slide 12, we also see robust growth in earnings for 2018. From 2016 to 2018, we expect an attractive growth rate of 12% to 16% in our adjusted EPS. Approximately 5% of this annual growth is driven by cost reductions and revenue enhancements. Another 8% to 10% of expected growth is driven by the construction projects coming online in 2017 and 2018.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss our second quarter results, capital allocation and full year guidance in more detail."

Today I'll review our results, including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit or SBU. And I'll cover our 2016 capital allocation as well as our guidance and expectations.
Turning to Slide 14. Second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.17 was $0.09 lower than 2015. This decline is in line with expectations communicated on our last call. Specifically, our second quarter results reflect $0.03 lower contributions from our SBUs, including anticipated drivers such as the timing of scheduled maintenance in Andes and MCAC. A reduction of $0.03 because last year's result included the favorable impact of a reversal of a liability at Eletropaulo and a $0.03 impact from the devaluation in foreign currencies, as expected, particularly in Andes and Europe. Before moving on, I want to touch a couple of large impairment charges we had this quarter that are not included in adjusted EPS. 
First, we impaired $235 million of assets at DPL, primarily at the Killen Station. This impairment impacts our quarterly diluted EPS and was largely driven by the results of the recent PJM capacity auction and our expectation of higher future environmental compliance costs under the EPA's effluent limitation guidelines and coal combustion residual rules. Second, as you may have seen in our 10-Q, as a result of the sale, we've included Sul in discontinued operations, and an impairment was recognized during the second quarter. The remaining loss on sale will be recorded at the closing of the transaction. After taking into account previously recorded cumulative translation adjustments, the net impact on AES' equity will be a reduction of about $100 million. Given this business is in discontinued operations, these noncash items do not affect either diluted or adjusted EPS. As a result of placing Sul into disc ops, its earnings or losses are removed from our 2016 and 2015 results. Consequently, our first quarter results have been restated to $0.15 after removing the $0.02 negative impact from Sul, which brings our year-to-date adjusted EPS to $0.32.
Now to Slide 15 and our overall results for the quarter. We generated $417 million of proportional free cash flow, an increase of $355 million from last year, as significant working capital improvements, primarily at Maritza in Bulgaria, offset lower margins. We also earned $160 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of $100 million. Now I'll cover our SBUs in more detail over the next 6 slides, beginning on Slide 16. In the U.S., our results reflect relatively flat margins as lower wholesale prices and lower contributions from regulated customers at DPL were largely offset by higher contributions at IPL, including the benefit from the recent rate case and environmental upgrades that came online through this quarter. Also, adjusted PTC was up modestly, reflecting lower interest expense at DPL and IPL. Proportional free cash flow also reflects favorable working capital changes at IPL. At Andes, our results reflect slightly higher margins due to higher spot and contract sales as well as lower maintenance at Gener in Chile, partially offset by planned outages in Argentina as well as the devaluation of the Colombian and Argentine pesos. Proportional free cash flow also benefited from higher collections in Argentina and at Gener.
In Brazil, our results reflect lower margins due to the benefit of a liability reversal at Eletropaulo in 2015, the expiration of Tietê's PPA at the end of 2015 and the 12% devaluation of the Brazilian real. Proportional free cash flow also reflects higher collections at Eletropaulo and Sul. In Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect lower margins due to lower availability, including a planned outage in the Dominican Republic, where we were performing interconnection work in the preparation for the expansion of our existing DPP gas-fired facility. As you may recall, we're converting the simple cycle DPP plant to combined cycle, improving its capacity by 50% to 358 megawatts. Construction on this project is progressing well. We've already completed 80% of the upgrade, and it is expected to come online in the first half of 2017. Our quarterly results were also impacted by lower third-party gas sales in the Dominican Republic. 
In Europe, our results reflect lower margins due to the 45% devaluation of the Kazakhstan tenge. Proportional free cash flow also reflects the settlement of our $350 million outstanding receivable at Maritza in Bulgaria this quarter. It's worth mentioning that we've seen greatly improved collections in the roughly 3 months since that settlement, and payments are current. As a direct result of recent energy sector reforms, our offtaker, NEK, is now cash flow positive versus substantially negative in 2015. This improved financial condition also drove strong interest in the recent bond issuance by NEK's parent, where they were able to raise more than EUR 0.5 billion at attractive rates. Finally, in Asia, our results reflect steady margins and lower working capital requirements at Mong Duong in Vietnam. 
Now to Slide 22, I'll provide an update on our regulatory filing at DP&L in Ohio. Under DP&L's current ESP, which covers the period from 2014 to '16, DP&L has been collecting a service stability rider of a little over $9 million per month. As you may know, the Supreme Court of Ohio reversed the utility commission's approval of the current ESP in late June. The court has since remanded the case to the commission, which now has jurisdiction. Last week, DP&L filed to withdraw its current ESP and requested that the commission revert to the rates in effect prior to 2014, which would result in an immaterial financial impact to the company. The matter is now pending before the commission, and we expect a ruling within a matter of weeks. At the same time, we continued to progress on our filing for a new ESP, which we expect to be effective beginning in January 2017. We expect an outcome that will support the financial viability and credit profile of the business.
Now to Slide 23 and the progress we're making to improve our credit profile. We recently completed the refinancing of $500 million of our 2019 notes, extending the tenure with new 10-year notes. Additionally, since our last call, we have prepaid $180 million in parent debt, bringing our total paydown year-to-date to $300 million, exceeding our 2016 debt reduction target by 50%. Since 2011, we have reduced parent debt by $1.7 billion or 27% and reduced interest by 125 basis points, resulting in an annualized interest savings of $180 million. As you can see at the top of the slide, we now have no debt maturities maturing at the parent until 2019, when only $240 million is due. In addition to the refinancing we executed at the parent, we've also taken advantage of favorable market conditions and refinanced $1.4 billion in nonrecourse debt, primarily in Latin America. Through these proactive actions, we've been able to extend our maturities, lower interest costs and reduce our exposure to floating-rate interest. As you can see at the bottom of the slide, these proactive steps have helped us to reduce our parent leverage ratio from almost 6.5x to slightly over 5x debt to parent free cash flow plus interest. These actions reflect our continued efforts to derisk our portfolio and improve our credit metrics. We believe this will help us reduce our cost of debt and enhance our equity valuation.
Now to our parent capital allocation on Slide 24. Sources on the left-hand side reflect $1.5 billion of total available discretionary cash, which includes $575 million in parent free cash flow. We continue to focus on maximizing cash to corp. And as a recent example, once the Macri administration lifted currency controls in Argentina, we took a modest dividend out of the country for the first time since 2011. We remain confident in our 2016 parent free cash flow range of $525 million to $625 million, which is the foundation for our discretionary cash available for dividend growth and value creation. Sources also include $540 million of proceeds from asset sales, including the approximately $470 million sale of Sul. As we expect the sale to close late in the year, we'll likely not deploy much of this capital in 2016. We have, however, accelerated the use of a portion of expected proceeds by prepaying $180 million of parent debt in July, as I just discussed. Now the uses on the right-hand side of the slide. Consistent with our capital allocation plan that we showed during our last call, with 10% growth in our dividend and completed share repurchases, we've returned about 1/3 of our allocated cash to shareholders this year. Going forward, we continue to see our dividend as a primary means to distribute cash to shareholders. As I just discussed, we've already prepaid $300 million in near-term maturities. We've also allocated $360 million for investments in our subsidiaries, the majority of which is for new projects driving our growth through '18 and beyond. After considering these investments in our subsidiaries, debt prepayment and our current dividend, we're left with roughly $450 million of discretionary cash, which we'll invest consistent with our capital allocation framework.
Finally turning to Slide 25. We are reaffirming our 2016 guidance and 2017, '18 expectations for all metrics based on foreign currency and commodity forward curves as of June 30. We continue to generate strong proportional free cash flow with our first half results reflecting the settlement of all outstanding receivables at Maritza. In our first half, adjusted EPS was in line with what we communicated on our last call, as our results were impacted by a higher tax rate, planned outages and softness in U.S. power prices. The majority of our earnings are expected to be generated in second half of the year, when we should benefit from a few factors, including lower scheduled maintenance, a lower effective tax rate, the realization of cost savings initiative and a couple other items we're working on.
With that, I'll now turn it back to Andrés."

So I'm not going to get into it specifically, but I think if you do it by the process of elimination which are those places where we don't see growth, where we don't see long-term contracts and we really don't have any really sort of particularly advantageous position, we will get out of.

It's a little bit different way to slice up the same amounts. In terms of going forward, we believe that what we had filed earlier in, what, January February, we can work under that umbrella, if you will. So we don't need to pull that back and refile.

We really didn't see valuations that were attractive for us. With the correction in prices in Brazil, we're starting to see opportunities that would make it more attractive to leverage up Tietê and buy something in Brazil. Now what would we buy? Well, as we've said in the past, we are really looking at our sort of risks, and we wouldn't want more hydro risk in Brazil. So ideally, it would be something like solar or wind or perhaps even thermal that would not be correlated to hydrology in Brazil to make our cash flow from Tietê more steady.

What we're seeing in this business is continued reduction in cost.

What we're seeing in this business is continued reduction in cost. So if we look at the cost of batteries, they have come down 80% in the last 5 years, and we're projecting an additional 50% in the next 5. So that will drive them down significantly. And really, this is not technological breakthroughs as much as just really massification of the production process. So the more people that bring online giga factories and drive down battery prices, the better it will be for people such as ourselves. Now given that, how do we see this market? Well, this market is growing. One of the main, let's say, things that are slowing it down is regulatory, since these batteries operate differently than just regulatory, say, peaking plants or other people providing ancillary services because, for example, it goes positive and it goes negative. But having said that, we're seeing this market that was a couple hundred megawatts last year. This year it's growing. Some of the forecasts, by 2020, could be 10 gigawatts globally. So the forecast -- the lowest forecast you'll see is probably around 6 gigawatts. That's still a tremendous rate of growth. Now there are many applications. This is a little bit of a hammer, and so you can use it for many different things from load shifting, ancillary services, capacity release, transmission constraints. So that's how we see this market. Now I see it kind of growing quickly. Some markets quicker than others. The U.S. is clearly leading. Great -- the U.K. is having an important auction now. We see interesting markets in India with their expansion of renewables. So basically, as I said in my speech, as you have more renewables on the grid, interruptible renewables, the greater the need for these batteries in their different forms to alleviate that. So we're pursuing it by 2 means. One is on our own platform. We're participating in some of these auctions. When they're big enough, we do bring in partners like we do on all large projects. But we're also pursuing through some direct sales but also through sales channel partners. Global sales, we've already had some success with $70 million so far this year. We expect that to grow over the remainder of the year and into next. And of course, that has, over time, will have an interesting margin. But right now, one of the things it does is help drive down cost, because this is all about scale. So if you're one of the largest suppliers to the market, I think you will have a cost advantage."

So for example, we'll have a lower ROE for those projects that are rate based on our regulated utilities than we do on some of the other projects, which are on different locations. So the one thing, we are moving towards, I would say, derisking the company. And so that I think is an important component. So it's dollar-denominated long-term contract in a good ZIP code, investment-grade country, those will have a lower return than some of the other locations. But I do think that when you look at our projects, what's important is that there are a lot of synergies between them. So if we look at, for example, the Panama project, it has significant synergies. If we increase the amount of tolling we do from that facility, our power plant will take roughly about 30% of the capacity, the tank and the terminal. So we're really looking for third-party sales, like we're doing in the Dominican Republic. So once you have the 2 hubs operating, the return from the project will not only be from the project itself, it will also be from the existing businesses. So that's how we're looking at it. And just to say, so I don't think that if interest rates go up -- it depends how much they go up, but we're also shifting our businesses to less risky businesses. And the returns of the project is also returns to existing businesses, which perhaps were not included in that ROE."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2016 financial review call. Today I will discuss our year-to-date performance, provide an update on market conditions and our progress on our strategic and financial objectives. Tom will then discuss our second quarter results and capital allocation in more detail.
Before turning to results, I would like to highlight the most significant milestone that we have achieved so far on our key objectives for 2016. To continue derisking our portfolio, we announced or closed asset sales with proceeds of more than $500 million, well above our target range of $200 million to $300 million. We brought online 1/3 of our capacity under construction, or 2.4 gigawatts, on time and on budget. We prepaid $300 million in parent debt, exceeding our full year target of $200 million, to accelerate our credit improvement. We are on track to achieve our 3-year $150 million cost reduction and revenue enhancement goals. In Bulgaria, we received payment of all outstanding receivables and continue to collect timely payment of invoices, and we continue to make progress to resolve DP&L's pending rate case and are encouraged with recent regulatory developments in Ohio. I will discuss these achievements in more detail in a moment, but first I'd like to summarize our financial results on Slide 4. 
Year-to-date, we generated proportional free cash flow of $670 million, representing 57% of our full year guidance and reflecting the collection of outstanding receivables in Bulgaria during the second quarter. Our year-to-date adjusted EPS was $0.32, representing 32% of our full year guidance, consistent with our comments on our last call. These results keep us on track to achieve our full year financial guidance, which Tom will cover in detail.
Now I'll provide an update on macroeconomic conditions in our markets on Slide 5. First in Brazil. Although we have seen a modest improvement in energy demand since our last call, we're still projecting negative growth for the year. In the U.S., demand is essentially flat. But in most of our other markets, we continue to see robust growth in energy demand in the range of 4% to 10%. Second, while we have seen significant volatility in foreign exchange and commodity prices over the last couple of years, we're generally seeing markets stabilize. As a result, foreign exchange and commodity forward curves are largely in line with our expectations as of our last call. The one exception is that as a result of Brexit, the British pound has depreciated by roughly 10%. However, we are largely hedged in the near term, and more importantly, our exposure to the pound is only about 3% of our pretax contribution.
Turning to Slide 6 and our portfolio optimization activities. In Brazil, we are seeing significant consolidation of the regulated utility sector at attractive valuations. We capitalized on this trend with the announced sale of our 100% ownership interest in Sul, our most material utility business in Brazil from an investment point of view, for approximately $470 million in equity proceeds to AES. We are currently seeking regulatory approvals for the transaction and expect to close before the end of the year. Including the proceeds from the sale of Sul, we have announced or closed a total of 400 -- $540 million in asset sales this year. Since September 2011, we have announced or closed asset sales with $3.8 billion in proceeds. The cornerstone of our strategy in Brazil is to grow Tietê by pursuing contracted wind and solar generation now that we are seeing the opportunity for reasonable inflation-adjusted returns. These investments will help diversify Tietê generation mix while also allowing us to take advantage of the $300 million to $500 million in untapped debt capacity at Tietê.
Turning now to our platform expansion opportunities on Slide 7. Our ongoing construction program is the most significant driver of our growth over the next few years. We are focusing on our investment efforts on platform expansion projects with long-term U.S.-dollar-denominated contracts. One such opportunity is using our DR and future Panamanian assets to play a leading role in expanding the use of LNG throughout Central America and the Caribbean. Regarding our construction projects, I'm happy to report that thus far this year, we have commissioned 2.4 gigawatts on time and on budget. The majority of this capacity is at Indianapolis Power & Light, our regulated utility in Indiana, where we will be earning predictable regulated returns on these investments. Later this year, we expect to complete our 552-megawatt Cochrane plant in Chile, also on time and on budget. We have another 3.9 gigawatts of new capacity currently under construction and expect it to come online through 2019. To deliver sustainable growth beyond 2019, we continue to advance our development pipeline. To that end, we recently received approval for the 1.4 gigawatt Southland repowering project from the California utility commission, and we are on track to receive final environmental permits early in 2017 and expect to break ground that summer.
Turning now to Slide 8. Our 3.9 gigawatts currently under construction represent total capital expenditures of $7.8 billion. However, through a combination of nonrecourse financing and equity partners, AES' equity commitment is limited to $1.3 billion. Of this, all but $250 million has already been funded. Roughly 74% of our investments are in the Americas. And of this, a majority is in the U.S. and Chile. We expect average return on equity from these projects of approximately 15%. The majority of our construction projects are conventional power plants, such as the 670-megawatt Eagle Valley combined cycle gas-fired plant at IPL. Additionally, as we've discussed in the past, we're also building the 530-megawatt Alto Maipo run of the river hydro project in Chile. This project is our most complex, as we're excavating 67 kilometers of underground tunnels, 1/3 of which are already complete. The project is roughly 6 months behind its original schedule, and we expect to complete the project in 2019.
Turning to Slide 9 and our Colon project in Panama. We have made significant progress since our last call. As a reminder, the $1 billion Colon project will contribute to our growth beyond 2018 and includes a 380-megawatt combined cycle gas plant and a 180,000-cubic-meter LNG regasification and storage facility. The power plant is contracted under a 10-year U.S. dollar-denominated power purchase agreement, and our partner is Grupo Motta, one of the largest financial and commercial groups in the country. We recently achieved 2 important milestones at Colon: closing the financing of $535 million with a consortium of banks and initiating construction. The Colon project seeks to replicate the success of our Andres LNG facility in the Dominican Republic. Andres provides gas to our adjacent power plant, to another power plant by a gas pipeline and to numerous downstream customers in the transportation and industrial sector. Last month, Andres also delivered its first international shipment of LNG to Barbados. This is a great example of our facility's ability to serve as a regional gas hub by breaking large bulk shipments to serve smaller markets. There are many commercial and operational synergies between our LNG terminals in the Dominican Republic and Panama. And with both facilities in operation, we will become the largest provider of LNG regasification and storages services in Central America and the Caribbean.
Turning to Slide 10. We remain optimistic on the future of battery-based energy storage because we believe it will play a critical role in an increasingly renewables-based generation mix. As you may know, with our proprietary Advancion system, we are the world leader in battery-based energy storage with 136 megawatts in operation across 4 countries, 30 megawatts under construction and 228 megawatts in advanced development, including 100 megawatts under a long-term contract. We aim to create value in the energy storage space through 2 primary business models. First, by developing and operating AES-owned projects, such as the 20-megawatt Harding Street battery array we recently commissioned at IPL. As I just mentioned, we currently have 166 megawatts in operation or construction and another 228 megawatts in advanced stage development. Second, by marketing and selling our Advancion energy storage solution to other utilities, commercial and industrial customers directly or through our sales channels partners, these sales require no investment capital and help Advancion capture economies of scale. Thus far this year, we have sold 40 megawatts of Advancion systems to third parties, representing approximately $70 million of gross revenue. Our second quarter results do not include these sales, but margins on our initial sales will be modest as we amortize start-up costs.
Although battery-based energy storage is still in its early adoption cycle, and we have not included any material amount in our projection, we believe that Advancion represents an interesting opportunity for upside.
Turning to Slide 11. As a result of all the actions we are taking, we expect at least 10% annual growth in proportional free cash flow through 2018, which will support our 10% annual growth in dividend, continued deleveraging of the parent and subsidiaries and investment in attractive platform expansions. 
As you can see on Slide 12, we also see robust growth in earnings for 2018. From 2016 to 2018, we expect an attractive growth rate of 12% to 16% in our adjusted EPS. Approximately 5% of this annual growth is driven by cost reductions and revenue enhancements. Another 8% to 10% of expected growth is driven by the construction projects coming online in 2017 and 2018.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss our second quarter results, capital allocation and full year guidance in more detail."
35312,371681177,1028200,"The AES Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Andrés. Good morning, everyone. Today I'll review our results, including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit or SBU. And I'll cover our 2016 capital allocation as well as",1674,"Thanks, Andrés. Good morning, everyone. Today I'll review our results, including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit or SBU. And I'll cover our 2016 capital allocation as well as our guidance and expectations.
Turning to Slide 14. Second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.17 was $0.09 lower than 2015. This decline is in line with expectations communicated on our last call. Specifically, our second quarter results reflect $0.03 lower contributions from our SBUs, including anticipated drivers such as the timing of scheduled maintenance in Andes and MCAC. A reduction of $0.03 because last year's result included the favorable impact of a reversal of a liability at Eletropaulo and a $0.03 impact from the devaluation in foreign currencies, as expected, particularly in Andes and Europe. Before moving on, I want to touch a couple of large impairment charges we had this quarter that are not included in adjusted EPS. 
First, we impaired $235 million of assets at DPL, primarily at the Killen Station. This impairment impacts our quarterly diluted EPS and was largely driven by the results of the recent PJM capacity auction and our expectation of higher future environmental compliance costs under the EPA's effluent limitation guidelines and coal combustion residual rules. Second, as you may have seen in our 10-Q, as a result of the sale, we've included Sul in discontinued operations, and an impairment was recognized during the second quarter. The remaining loss on sale will be recorded at the closing of the transaction. After taking into account previously recorded cumulative translation adjustments, the net impact on AES' equity will be a reduction of about $100 million. Given this business is in discontinued operations, these noncash items do not affect either diluted or adjusted EPS. As a result of placing Sul into disc ops, its earnings or losses are removed from our 2016 and 2015 results. Consequently, our first quarter results have been restated to $0.15 after removing the $0.02 negative impact from Sul, which brings our year-to-date adjusted EPS to $0.32.
Now to Slide 15 and our overall results for the quarter. We generated $417 million of proportional free cash flow, an increase of $355 million from last year, as significant working capital improvements, primarily at Maritza in Bulgaria, offset lower margins. We also earned $160 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of $100 million. Now I'll cover our SBUs in more detail over the next 6 slides, beginning on Slide 16. In the U.S., our results reflect relatively flat margins as lower wholesale prices and lower contributions from regulated customers at DPL were largely offset by higher contributions at IPL, including the benefit from the recent rate case and environmental upgrades that came online through this quarter. Also, adjusted PTC was up modestly, reflecting lower interest expense at DPL and IPL. Proportional free cash flow also reflects favorable working capital changes at IPL. At Andes, our results reflect slightly higher margins due to higher spot and contract sales as well as lower maintenance at Gener in Chile, partially offset by planned outages in Argentina as well as the devaluation of the Colombian and Argentine pesos. Proportional free cash flow also benefited from higher collections in Argentina and at Gener.
In Brazil, our results reflect lower margins due to the benefit of a liability reversal at Eletropaulo in 2015, the expiration of Tietê's PPA at the end of 2015 and the 12% devaluation of the Brazilian real. Proportional free cash flow also reflects higher collections at Eletropaulo and Sul. In Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect lower margins due to lower availability, including a planned outage in the Dominican Republic, where we were performing interconnection work in the preparation for the expansion of our existing DPP gas-fired facility. As you may recall, we're converting the simple cycle DPP plant to combined cycle, improving its capacity by 50% to 358 megawatts. Construction on this project is progressing well. We've already completed 80% of the upgrade, and it is expected to come online in the first half of 2017. Our quarterly results were also impacted by lower third-party gas sales in the Dominican Republic. 
In Europe, our results reflect lower margins due to the 45% devaluation of the Kazakhstan tenge. Proportional free cash flow also reflects the settlement of our $350 million outstanding receivable at Maritza in Bulgaria this quarter. It's worth mentioning that we've seen greatly improved collections in the roughly 3 months since that settlement, and payments are current. As a direct result of recent energy sector reforms, our offtaker, NEK, is now cash flow positive versus substantially negative in 2015. This improved financial condition also drove strong interest in the recent bond issuance by NEK's parent, where they were able to raise more than EUR 0.5 billion at attractive rates. Finally, in Asia, our results reflect steady margins and lower working capital requirements at Mong Duong in Vietnam. 
Now to Slide 22, I'll provide an update on our regulatory filing at DP&L in Ohio. Under DP&L's current ESP, which covers the period from 2014 to '16, DP&L has been collecting a service stability rider of a little over $9 million per month. As you may know, the Supreme Court of Ohio reversed the utility commission's approval of the current ESP in late June. The court has since remanded the case to the commission, which now has jurisdiction. Last week, DP&L filed to withdraw its current ESP and requested that the commission revert to the rates in effect prior to 2014, which would result in an immaterial financial impact to the company. The matter is now pending before the commission, and we expect a ruling within a matter of weeks. At the same time, we continued to progress on our filing for a new ESP, which we expect to be effective beginning in January 2017. We expect an outcome that will support the financial viability and credit profile of the business.
Now to Slide 23 and the progress we're making to improve our credit profile. We recently completed the refinancing of $500 million of our 2019 notes, extending the tenure with new 10-year notes. Additionally, since our last call, we have prepaid $180 million in parent debt, bringing our total paydown year-to-date to $300 million, exceeding our 2016 debt reduction target by 50%. Since 2011, we have reduced parent debt by $1.7 billion or 27% and reduced interest by 125 basis points, resulting in an annualized interest savings of $180 million. As you can see at the top of the slide, we now have no debt maturities maturing at the parent until 2019, when only $240 million is due. In addition to the refinancing we executed at the parent, we've also taken advantage of favorable market conditions and refinanced $1.4 billion in nonrecourse debt, primarily in Latin America. Through these proactive actions, we've been able to extend our maturities, lower interest costs and reduce our exposure to floating-rate interest. As you can see at the bottom of the slide, these proactive steps have helped us to reduce our parent leverage ratio from almost 6.5x to slightly over 5x debt to parent free cash flow plus interest. These actions reflect our continued efforts to derisk our portfolio and improve our credit metrics. We believe this will help us reduce our cost of debt and enhance our equity valuation.
Now to our parent capital allocation on Slide 24. Sources on the left-hand side reflect $1.5 billion of total available discretionary cash, which includes $575 million in parent free cash flow. We continue to focus on maximizing cash to corp. And as a recent example, once the Macri administration lifted currency controls in Argentina, we took a modest dividend out of the country for the first time since 2011. We remain confident in our 2016 parent free cash flow range of $525 million to $625 million, which is the foundation for our discretionary cash available for dividend growth and value creation. Sources also include $540 million of proceeds from asset sales, including the approximately $470 million sale of Sul. As we expect the sale to close late in the year, we'll likely not deploy much of this capital in 2016. We have, however, accelerated the use of a portion of expected proceeds by prepaying $180 million of parent debt in July, as I just discussed. Now the uses on the right-hand side of the slide. Consistent with our capital allocation plan that we showed during our last call, with 10% growth in our dividend and completed share repurchases, we've returned about 1/3 of our allocated cash to shareholders this year. Going forward, we continue to see our dividend as a primary means to distribute cash to shareholders. As I just discussed, we've already prepaid $300 million in near-term maturities. We've also allocated $360 million for investments in our subsidiaries, the majority of which is for new projects driving our growth through '18 and beyond. After considering these investments in our subsidiaries, debt prepayment and our current dividend, we're left with roughly $450 million of discretionary cash, which we'll invest consistent with our capital allocation framework.
Finally turning to Slide 25. We are reaffirming our 2016 guidance and 2017, '18 expectations for all metrics based on foreign currency and commodity forward curves as of June 30. We continue to generate strong proportional free cash flow with our first half results reflecting the settlement of all outstanding receivables at Maritza. In our first half, adjusted EPS was in line with what we communicated on our last call, as our results were impacted by a higher tax rate, planned outages and softness in U.S. power prices. The majority of our earnings are expected to be generated in second half of the year, when we should benefit from a few factors, including lower scheduled maintenance, a lower effective tax rate, the realization of cost savings initiative and a couple other items we're working on.
With that, I'll now turn it back to Andrés."

And you know we've very much stuck to that rule over the years. But I would say those countries where we don't see those opportunities, where we see that they -- quite frankly, they're either too volatile or we don't see opportunities for growth. So what I would like to say is that we'll continue to grow those businesses, especially those that are cash accretive. Our real focus is on creating a company where we have a strong, sustainable growth in our dividend. And that's what we're focused on. So I'm not going to get into it specifically, but I think if you do it by the process of elimination which are those places where we don't see growth, where we don't see long-term contracts and we really don't have any really sort of particularly advantageous position, we will get out of.

With the correction in prices in Brazil, we're starting to see opportunities that would make it more attractive to leverage up Tietê and buy something in Brazil. Now what would we buy? Well, as we've said in the past, we are really looking at our sort of risks, and we wouldn't want more hydro risk in Brazil. So ideally, it would be something like solar or wind or perhaps even thermal that would not be correlated to hydrology in Brazil to make our cash flow from Tietê more steady. So again, Eletropaulo being a publicly listed company, it would be a process pertinent to that market, but we're not going to comment on it."

There's increasingly talk about the business, and you all, obviously, were very early into this business. When you think about growth potential -- we're seeing reports that costs are coming down for the actual equipment. Do you see that there's sort of inflection points at which this does become a fairly large driver of spending? Or is it a more gradual thing where there isn't really a step change, but it's rather just a gradual increase as you go down the curve? In other words, do you see relatively significant changes within a year or 2 or 3 in terms of where the costs are going that's going to allow the business to scale up a lot? Or do you think it's probably a more gradual pace?"

What we're seeing in this business is continued reduction in cost. So if we look at the cost of batteries, they have come down 80% in the last 5 years, and we're projecting an additional 50% in the next 5. So that will drive them down significantly.",435,"Yes. What we're seeing in this business is continued reduction in cost. So if we look at the cost of batteries, they have come down 80% in the last 5 years, and we're projecting an additional 50% in the next 5. So that will drive them down significantly. And really, this is not technological breakthroughs as much as just really massification of the production process. So the more people that bring online giga factories and drive down battery prices, the better it will be for people such as ourselves. Now given that, how do we see this market? Well, this market is growing. One of the main, let's say, things that are slowing it down is regulatory, since these batteries operate differently than just regulatory, say, peaking plants or other people providing ancillary services because, for example, it goes positive and it goes negative. But having said that, we're seeing this market that was a couple hundred megawatts last year. This year it's growing. Some of the forecasts, by 2020, could be 10 gigawatts globally. So the forecast -- the lowest forecast you'll see is probably around 6 gigawatts. That's still a tremendous rate of growth. Now there are many applications. This is a little bit of a hammer, and so you can use it for many different things from load shifting, ancillary services, capacity release, transmission constraints. So that's how we see this market. Now I see it kind of growing quickly. Some markets quicker than others. The U.S. is clearly leading. Great -- the U.K. is having an important auction now. We see interesting markets in India with their expansion of renewables. So basically, as I said in my speech, as you have more renewables on the grid, interruptible renewables, the greater the need for these batteries in their different forms to alleviate that. So we're pursuing it by 2 means. One is on our own platform. We're participating in some of these auctions. When they're big enough, we do bring in partners like we do on all large projects. But we're also pursuing through some direct sales but also through sales channel partners. Global sales, we've already had some success with $70 million so far this year. We expect that to grow over the remainder of the year and into next. And of course, that has, over time, will have an interesting margin. But right now, one of the things it does is help drive down cost, because this is all about scale. So if you're one of the largest suppliers to the market, I think you will have a cost advantage."

So for example, we'll have a lower ROE for those projects that are rate based on our regulated utilities than we do on some of the other projects, which are on different locations. So the one thing, we are moving towards, I would say, derisking the company. And so that I think is an important component. So it's dollar-denominated long-term contract in a good ZIP code, investment-grade country, those will have a lower return than some of the other locations. But I do think that when you look at our projects, what's important is that there are a lot of synergies between them. So if we look at, for example, the Panama project, it has significant synergies. If we increase the amount of tolling we do from that facility, our power plant will take roughly about 30% of the capacity, the tank and the terminal. So we're really looking for third-party sales, like we're doing in the Dominican Republic. So once you have the 2 hubs operating, the return from the project will not only be from the project itself, it will also be from the existing businesses. So that's how we're looking at it. And just to say, so I don't think that if interest rates go up -- it depends how much they go up, but we're also shifting our businesses to less risky businesses. And the returns of the project is also returns to existing businesses, which perhaps were not included in that ROE."

Today, I will provide an update on our year-to-date performance, key market trends and our long-term strategy in the context of those trends. Tom will then review positive regulatory developments at DPL in Ohio and our financial results as well as provide color on our current guidance.
Year-to-date, we generated proportional free cash flow of $1.1 billion, representing 91% of the midpoint of our full year guidance and reflecting the collection of outstanding receivables in Bulgaria during the second quarter. Our year-to-date adjusted EPS was $0.64, representing 64% of our full year guidance, consistent with the expectations that we communicated to you previously. These results keep us on track to achieve our full year guidance, which Tom will address in detail.
Now turning to key market trends on Slide 5. At a high level, we are seeing changes in some of our markets due to the entry of natural gas and low-cost renewables. However, we're generally well positioned to take advantage of these changes because we have already begun to invest in these technologies and because most of our largely contracted portfolio has locational and cost advantages. Accordingly, despite what we have recently seen in some markets like Chile, we remain confident in the long-term strength of our portfolio. We see a future where the operator, who has an efficient thermal and hydro fleet and can integrate them with the new technologies will be the winner. We're also on track to meet our expectations through 2018, which are driven by our construction and cost reduction programs. Most of our construction programs are going well, with the exception of Alto Maipo, which represents 15% of the total megawatts under construction. 
There's no question that the future growth across our markets will be heavily weighted towards less carbon-intensive gas, wind and solar generation. Accordingly, we have been taking actions in this regard for some time now. For example, as we've discussed on previous calls, we have been expanding our LNG infrastructure into Central America, as shown on Slide 6. Our $1 billion Colon project in Panama will contribute to our growth beyond 2018 and includes a 380-megawatt combined-cycle gas plant and 180,000 cubic meter LNG regasification and storage facility. The power plant is contracted under a 10-year U.S. dollar-denominated power purchase agreement. This project will diversify Panama's reliance on hydro-based generation while also meeting a growing need for natural gas across Central America. By introducing natural gas to the region, we're displacing oil-fired generation in favor of a cheaper and cleaner alternative and also serving the needs of many potential downstream customers, including commercial and industrial users and the transportation industry.
On Slide 7, we see another example of how we're responding to environmental concerns about coal-fired generation. In Indiana, we just completed a multiyear $550 million rate-based investment in environmental upgrades to our coal plant and the repowering of several units from coal to gas. We will further shift IPL's fuel mix away from coal when we complete the 671-megawatt Eagle Valley CCGT in Indiana in the first half of 2017. The combined impact of these investments will be to reduce the gigawatt hours IPL produces from coal by about 40%.
Turning to Slide 8. The growth in renewables not only provides an opportunity for direct investments in wind and solar generation but creates a market for energy storage. We plan to invest in wind and solar generation in our markets with a primary focus on U.S. dollar-denominated long-term contracts. In fact, since last year, we have added more than 150 megawatts of solar with long-term contracts in the U.S., about half of which is operating and the rest will come online in 2017. Regarding energy storage, we believe this technology will play a critical role in an increasingly renewable space generation mix. AES has been designing, deploying and operating battery-based energy storage systems for almost a decade. 
Today, with our [ph] proprietary Advancion platform is the world leader with more than 400 megawatts in operation under construction or in advanced stage development across 7 countries. In 2016, we have already closed Advancion sales to third parties totaling more than $70 million in gross revenue. With our proven storage platform, unequaled experience and global reach through AES and our sales channel partnerships, we are ideally positioned to capitalize on this rapidly growing market.
Turning now to Slide 9. I'd like to discuss what we consider to be key underlying strengths of our businesses: a highly contracted portfolio and the competitive nature of our assets even in those markets where LNG-based and renewable generation are making en route. As you can see on this slide, as a result of our proactive contracting and portfolio rebalancing initiatives, today, about 75% of our business is U.S. dollar-based. About 85% of our business is either contracted generation or regulated utilities. The average remaining life on our PPAs at our contracted businesses is 7 years. And when we complete our current construction program in 2020, it will be extended to 10 years.
Turning to Slide 10. Although that's a long average remaining contract life, there are a few markets where our contracts will roll off sooner. Nonetheless, we believe that our position in those particular markets will allow us to continue to earn attractive returns after the current contracts expire. The majority of our businesses are low-cost, flexible and reliable energy providers with strong locational advantages. Our knowledge of these markets and critical mass also puts us in a position to take advantage of growth opportunities or quickly respond to changing conditions.
Let me talk about a few of these markets in more detail. In the Dominican Republic, a portion of our contracts are rolling off in the next 3 years. However, our plants are mostly gas-fired, and we offer the lowest-cost source of generation in the system, which is 54% oil-based. Based on today's relative fuel prices, our variable cost is half of that of oil-fired generation, which puts us in a good position to recontract our plants on favorable terms. In 2017, we will complete the closing of the cycle at our DPP gas plant, which will add 122 megawatts without increasing our carbon footprint. 
In the Philippines, we operate a 630-megawatt coal-fired plant and are building a 335-megawatt expansion. The existing Masinloc plant is more than 90% contracted until 2019, and we've already reached an agreement pending regulatory approval with the plant's offtaker for an extension to 2022. In terms of the 335-megawatt expansion project, which will come online in 2019, we have already signed 10- to 20-year contracts covering 50% of the capacity. Our plants in the Philippines will be even more competitive once the country's gas plants, which account for 25% of the system supply, move from base low to mid-merit when their current take-or-pay gas contracts roll off from 2019 to 2023. 
In California, our Southland contracts are expiring in December of 2019 and 2020, but we have already recontracted these facilities under a 20-year PPA that will require the repowering of our assets. With the new contract, we expect to see growth in earnings and cash flows from this business.
Now moving to Chile on Slide 11 where we are largely contracted. Although there has been a slowdown in economic growth mainly due to the impact of falling mineral prices on the Chilean economy, we remain optimistic about the future prospects of the country. As you may know, the recent auctions for contracts beginning in 2021 and '22 cleared significantly below market expectations. We believe these prices reflect aggressive bidding by both new market participants and existing hydro owners. Nonetheless, we do not believe that this will have a meaningful impact on our business in Chile in the near to medium term because AES Gener is largely hedged with an average remaining PPA life of 11 years. So our exposure for the next 5 years is quite limited, with only 8% of our contracts rolling off in '21 and '22. Although over the long term we do forecast some softening in prices, we do not believe this auction result is necessarily indicative of the long-term price lift. While Chile does have excellent solar and good wind resources, some of the assumptions underlying the recent auction outcome may have been aggressive on capital cost declines, load factors and the all-in cost to support renewable assets with a 24/7 load following obligation. We see renewables, energy storage and thermal resources as complementary in the future Chilean grid. In fact, we believe our existing portfolio will be even more important in the long term as we see higher demand growth driven by an eventual acceleration in economic growth. Accordingly, our existing assets are well positioned to provide reliable and competitive energy to the Chilean grid.
Now turning to Slide 12, to our construction program, which is the most significant driver of cash flow and dividend growth in the coming years.  Since our last call, we have completed construction of our 532-megawatt Cochrane power plant in Chile, which is 100% contracted for 18 years. This brings our year-to-date commission capacity to 3 gigawatts, all of which were completed on time and on budget. We have another 3.4 gigawatts remaining under construction where we are generally making good progress. The main exception to our strong performance on construction is Alto Maipo, a 531-megawatt run of the river hydro plant in Chile, which is by far our most complex construction project underway. Today, the overall project is about 40% completed. As we discussed on our last call, we have encountered geological issues while excavating some underground tunnels. After consultation with a contractor and independent consultant, our expectation is still for Alto Maipo to be completed in 2019 at a cost that is about 10% to 20% over the original budget. We expect the additional capital cost of roughly $200 million to $400 million will be funded by a combination of lenders and project sponsors. Discussions with lenders are underway.
I'd note that notwithstanding the challenges we have encountered at Alto Maipo, we have a strong track record of completing projects on time and on budget. In the last 5 years, AES has delivered more than 5 gigawatts of projects, which were completed on time and on budget. Accordingly, we are confident that our construction program will continue to drive attractive growth in our free cash flow and earnings.
Turning to Slide 13. Excluding the cost overrun at Alto Maipo, which I mentioned earlier, our 3.4 gigawatts currently under construction represent total capital expenditures of $6.4 billion. However, AES' equity commitment is limited to $1.1 billion. Of this, all but $250 million has already been funded. Roughly 70% of our investments are in the Americas, mainly Chile, Panama and the U.S.
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I would like to emphasize our derisking of our company over the last 5 years on Slide 14. Today, we're in a strong position to execute on the strategic growth opportunities I just discussed, in large part because of the actions we have taken. We have exited 11 markets, including the riskiest countries in our portfolio. This week, we also closed the sale of AES Sul, a utility in Brazil, which decreases our exposure to Brazilian regulatory and hydrology risks to more appropriate levels. 
In total, our asset sales program since September of 2011 has raised $4 billion in cash to the parent. We're investing our discretionary cash towards projects that are better aligned with our strategy, like LNG in Central America and renewables in the U.S. 
In Panama, our hydro assets will be more valuable by 2019 when we begin operating the nation's first gas-fired plant and LNG facility, which will cap energy prices in times of drought. These investments not only drive solid growth in cash flow and earnings but also offer our investors a more robust and optimal portfolio. 
Last but not least, deleveraging has been and will continue to be an important part of our strategy. Over the past 5 years, we have reduced our parent debt by 28%. And based on the growth of our cash flow, we expect to achieve investment-grade stats by 2020. We believe that in conjunction, all of these actions will deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Today, I'll review our results, including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit, or SBU, then I'll cover our 2016 capital allocation as well as our",1490,"Thanks, Andrés, and good morning. Today, I'll review our results, including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit, or SBU, then I'll cover our 2016 capital allocation as well as our guidance and expectations. 
Before I get started, I'll remind you of a couple items that helped our results in the third quarter of last year: One was the restructuring of Guacolda in Chile that generated $0.06 of equity in earnings; and the other was a large receivables collection in the Dominican Republic, which led to higher-than-normal proportional free cash flow.
Now turning to Slide 16. Third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.32 was $0.06 lower than 2015. This decline is in line with our expectations that we communicated on our last call. Specifically, our third quarter results reflect positive contribution for our businesses, particularly in the U.S., where we benefited from rate-based growth at our utility IPL in Indiana, an improved availability at DPL in Ohio; the impact of the Guacolda restructuring in 2015; and also the $0.02 impact from the devaluation of foreign currencies, as expected, particularly in Andes in Europe. 
And on Slide 17, our proportional free cash flow and adjusted PTC for the quarter. We generated $400 million in proportional of free cash flow, a decrease of $221 million from last year. This reflects slightly lower margins and the impact of working capital in the MCAC SBU, specifically the DR, where although collections remain strong, we had the large receivable settlement last year.
We also won $272 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of $43 million, largely driven by the Guacolda restructuring.
Next, I'll cover SBUs in more detail over the next 6 slides, beginning on Slide 18. In the U.S., our results reflect relatively higher margins, including the benefit from environmental upgrades on 1,700 megawatts of capacity that came online through this quarter and from this year's rate case at IPL as well as higher contributions from DPL, reflecting our continuing actions to improve the availability of our generation fleet. 
At Andes, our results reflect higher margins, primarily due to lower spot fuel and energy purchases as well as the start of commercial operations at Cochrane Unit 1 in Chile. This is partially offset by lower spot prices and generation at Chivor in Colombia, where we replenished reservoir levels after increasing production when energy prices were at record highs in December of last year. 
Margins also reflect the 38% devaluation of the Argentine peso. Adjusted PTC decreased due to the Guacolda restructuring, and proportional free cash flow also reflects the timing of lower VAT collections in Chile after Cochrane came online. 
In Brazil, our results were largely driven by lower margins, mainly due to the expiration of Tietê's PPA at the end of 2015. As part of our rolling hedging strategy that we had in place since 2014, Tietê is about 80% hedged over the next 2 years. 
In Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect lower margins, primarily due to lower rolling 12-month availability in Puerto Rico, which was impacted by a fourth quarter outage in 2015. Adjusted PTC was further impacted by lower interest income on overdue receivables in the Dominican Republic, where collections have improved. Proportional free cash flow decreased, primarily due to the large settlement of receivables in the DR. 
In Europe, our results reflect lower margins due to the contracted capacity price reduction following the successful settlement of outstanding receivables at Maritza in Bulgaria as well as the 36% devaluation of the Kazakhstan tenge. Proportional free cash flow benefited from higher collections at Maritza. It's worth mentioning that we continue to see improved collections in the roughly 6 months since that settlement, and payments are current. 
Finally, in Asia, our results reflect steady margins and working capital requirements year-over-year. 
Now to Slide 24. I'll provide an update on our filing at DP&L in Ohio, where we've seen some positive momentum on the regulatory front. We remain in active discussions with the commission staff and intervenors. As you may know, last month, we amended our ESP filing to propose a distribution monetization rider of $145 million per year over 7 years with the aim of achieving and maintaining an investment-grade rating at DP&L. Hearings are now set for early December, and we expect the ruling to be effective beginning in the first quarter of 2017 that will support the financial viability and credit profile of the business.
Now Slide 25 and the progress we're making to improve our credit profile. In third quarter, we prepaid $180 million in parent debt, bringing our total debt paydown year-to-date to $300 million. Since 2011, we reduced parent debt by $1.8 billion or 28% and reduced interest by 125 basis points, resulting in an annualized interest savings of $180 million. As you can see on the top of the slide, we have no debt maturing at the parent until 2019 when only $240 million is due.
Turning to the bottom of the slide. These proactive steps have helped us to reduce our parent leverage ratio from almost 6.5x to slightly over 5x debt to parent free cash flow plus interest. These actions reflect our strategy to derisk our portfolio and improve our credit metrics. We expect our credit to continue to improve, largely driven by a strong growth in parent free cash flow as well as a modest amount of annual debt reduction. As a result, we expect to attain investment-grade credit metrics by 2020. We believe this will help us reduce our cost of debt; improve financial flexibility; and also importantly, enhance our equity valuation.
Turning now to our 2016 parent capital allocation on Slide 26, which is materially in line with our prior discussions. Sources on the left-hand side reflect $1.5 billion of total available discretionary cash, which includes $575 million in parent free cash flow. We remain confident in our 2016 parent free cash flow range of $525 million to $625 million, which is the foundation for our discretionary cash available for dividend growth and value creation. Sources also include proceeds from asset sales, primarily from AES Sul, where we're estimating net proceeds of $440 million, including a stub dividend of around $25 million after accounting for working capital adjustments and transaction costs. Although we've successfully closed the sale in October, we anticipate receiving the majority of the proceeds at the parent in the first quarter 2017 after meeting the required notice period for distributions.
Now the uses on the right-hand side of the slide. Consistent with our capital allocation plan, with 10% growth in our dividend and completed share repurchases, we are returning about 1/3 of our allocated cash to shareholders this year. Going forward, we continue to see our dividend as the primary means to distribute cash to shareholders. As I just mentioned, we've already prepaid $300 million of our near-term maturities. We've also allocated $360 million for investments in our subsidiaries, the majority of which is for new projects driving our growth through 2018 and beyond. After considering these investments in our subsidiaries, debt prepayment and our current dividend, we're left with roughly $400 million of discretionary cash. This, together with our 2017 free cash flow, will provide a strong foundation to grow our dividend, continue to delever and earn attractive risk-adjusted returns by investing in our development pipeline focused on gas and low-cost renewables.
Now turning to Slide 27. As reflected in our third quarter and year-to-date, we continue to generate strong proportional free cash flow, and our third quarter adjusted EPS was also in line with our expectations. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our 2016 guidance for all metrics. Since earlier this year, we've also experienced some headwinds, including outages at 2 of our businesses in MCAC as well as a slightly negative impact from reverting back to ESP 1 rigs and also some dark spread compression at DPL in Ohio. However, we're expecting to offset these impacts with a couple of items, one of which would lead to a lower full year effective tax rate.
Finally, before handing back to Andrés, I want to briefly discuss our expectations beyond 2016. On our fourth quarter call in February, we plan to provide guidance for '17 as well as longer-term expectations through at least 2019. At that point, we will have completed our annual budget process and will be in a better position to provide more detailed guidance. Based on our preliminary view, we expect to be within the previously disclosed ranges for average annual growth through 2018. 
As Andrés has discussed, the majority of our new projects are coming online in 2018, so we expect growth to be stronger in 2018 and 2017. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our previously disclosed ranges for expected growth in 2017, '18 from both proportional free cash flow and adjusted EPS.
With that, I'll now turn it back to Andrés."

To summarize today's call, we have a portfolio of assets that is generating strong cash flow and a construction and development pipeline that is driving growth in cash flow and earnings.

Second, we remain committed to continuing to strengthen our credit, which is largely driven by the successful completion of our construction program, cost reductions and delevering. Accordingly, we remain confident that we can achieve investment-grade stats by 2020.

And of those, I think, probably about $40 billion have been suspended. So the growth in demand from the mining sector did not materialize, and those projects are on hold. So that really changed the dynamics to give you much higher reserve ratio in Chile and certainly any of the projections have been. So that's I think the most important thing to understand. So when there was this auction came, and there have been some changes to the option process what we saw was it was below certainly consensus estimates and basically came in on 2 sides. One was in new entrants on the renewables side and also we believe on the hydro side people bid lower than expected. I would say of the thermal bids, we were probably we believe the lowest, so we had I think a better view of that. What do we think is the sustainable level? Well, if you go to the market research in Chile today, some of the sustainable level is north of 60, $60 a megawatt hour. If you look at where this auction cleared. It's more like 47. And there issues here because you have to follow the load with intermittent renewables, and you have to put back just together. So we think some of these assumptions obviously people are bidding for future prices of the capital investment of future prices for other things. There's a lot of assumptions here, so we think that more in line with the consensus view overall. And the one thing I would say is if these mining projects get reactivated, maybe even 1/3 of them, then the situation in Chile will change because you also should remember that the very high reserve margin that the market has a lot of that is very old -- is very old coal plant and other ones that are not efficient. So we think that that's reasonable and that any way the market moves though, I think that we're in a very good position having that existing thermal and hydro base to combine it with renewables to be able to offer more secure load following supply."

And the Philippine market will change as what you have today is basically a lot of gas plants that are using domestic gas, which are basically first to be dispatched so there's sort of base load when these contracts burn off in the next couple of years, they go to mid-merit. And quite frankly, they may have to search for new sources of gas. So given that, this plant will be very well positioned.

One thing I'd say is we probably look to do bundles more than one-off deals where we can, and it still fits with the strategy. So we're doing that in some places. We got expansion right now in the Dominican Republic, about $250 million to close the cycle make a project about more efficient on gas usage, and that's being done. It's basically being bundled with our plant. It's a very efficient plant. So we're bundling those 2 together so it means we don't put in equity basically use the equity value of the -- of Andrés to bundle that and equity requirements and also just upgrade the credit package.

So we believe -- I think it's next year, we'll have about installations around the world around 1 gigawatt, and we're starting maybe 2 years ago at 200. So first it's growing very rapidly, and it's a technology that has many applications. It has applications for capacity release. Those are some of our first project, ancillary services and you're right, substituting peaking plants we have a lot of renewables. That's our big project in California, but it also has applications to business in terms of transmission -- alleviating transmission constraints. Now part of the lithium ion battery energy storage solutions, batteries are one component. So we've seen over the last 5 years battery price is up by 65%. There's no technical reason you couldn't make it an 8-hour if you want it to. It's just a question you got to put on more batteries, and it becomes more expensive. So we expect battery prices to continue to drop because these are the same batteries we use in electric vehicles. So as that becomes pacified, it should drop continually. So we're projecting a continued drop in those prices. So the duration is really a function of your battery price. So we are seeing that it's  in many places, the applications are more sort of in the 2- to 4-hour today at today's battery prices, but you could extend those for longer. And I think that, again, we're seeing a very rapid growth of demand. And again, this year alone, we've already closed $70 million in gross revenues from sales to third parties, that is sales to other people to our grid. So I'm certain that this will continue to grow very quickly. I'm also certain the prices will drop, and what we're really trying to see is our sort of two-pronged approach where we put our product on our own platforms and use them to enhance our renewables or even enhance our thermal plant and selling it to third parties. Now that third-party sales, we're using channel partners who have sales forces.

So quite frankly, that puts pressure on our distribution companies in terms of cash, so we think that one of the main drivers of our evaluation is the strong cash flow having less assets and distribution in Brazil would make our cash flow more stable as we redeploy that cash. So there, I think it's clear with our core markets, which we're going after, the markets we're most interested in.

Today, I will provide an update on our year-to-date performance, key market trends and our long-term strategy in the context of those trends. Tom will then review positive regulatory developments at DPL in Ohio and our financial results as well as provide color on our current guidance.
Year-to-date, we generated proportional free cash flow of $1.1 billion, representing 91% of the midpoint of our full year guidance and reflecting the collection of outstanding receivables in Bulgaria during the second quarter. Our year-to-date adjusted EPS was $0.64, representing 64% of our full year guidance, consistent with the expectations that we communicated to you previously. These results keep us on track to achieve our full year guidance, which Tom will address in detail.
Now turning to key market trends on Slide 5. At a high level, we are seeing changes in some of our markets due to the entry of natural gas and low-cost renewables. However, we're generally well positioned to take advantage of these changes because we have already begun to invest in these technologies and because most of our largely contracted portfolio has locational and cost advantages. Accordingly, despite what we have recently seen in some markets like Chile, we remain confident in the long-term strength of our portfolio. We see a future where the operator, who has an efficient thermal and hydro fleet and can integrate them with the new technologies will be the winner. We're also on track to meet our expectations through 2018, which are driven by our construction and cost reduction programs. Most of our construction programs are going well, with the exception of Alto Maipo, which represents 15% of the total megawatts under construction. 
There's no question that the future growth across our markets will be heavily weighted towards less carbon-intensive gas, wind and solar generation. Accordingly, we have been taking actions in this regard for some time now. For example, as we've discussed on previous calls, we have been expanding our LNG infrastructure into Central America, as shown on Slide 6. Our $1 billion Colon project in Panama will contribute to our growth beyond 2018 and includes a 380-megawatt combined-cycle gas plant and 180,000 cubic meter LNG regasification and storage facility. The power plant is contracted under a 10-year U.S. dollar-denominated power purchase agreement. This project will diversify Panama's reliance on hydro-based generation while also meeting a growing need for natural gas across Central America. By introducing natural gas to the region, we're displacing oil-fired generation in favor of a cheaper and cleaner alternative and also serving the needs of many potential downstream customers, including commercial and industrial users and the transportation industry.
On Slide 7, we see another example of how we're responding to environmental concerns about coal-fired generation. In Indiana, we just completed a multiyear $550 million rate-based investment in environmental upgrades to our coal plant and the repowering of several units from coal to gas. We will further shift IPL's fuel mix away from coal when we complete the 671-megawatt Eagle Valley CCGT in Indiana in the first half of 2017. The combined impact of these investments will be to reduce the gigawatt hours IPL produces from coal by about 40%.
Turning to Slide 8. The growth in renewables not only provides an opportunity for direct investments in wind and solar generation but creates a market for energy storage. We plan to invest in wind and solar generation in our markets with a primary focus on U.S. dollar-denominated long-term contracts. In fact, since last year, we have added more than 150 megawatts of solar with long-term contracts in the U.S., about half of which is operating and the rest will come online in 2017. Regarding energy storage, we believe this technology will play a critical role in an increasingly renewable space generation mix. AES has been designing, deploying and operating battery-based energy storage systems for almost a decade. 
Today, with our proprietary Advancion platform is the world leader with more than 400 megawatts in operation under construction or in advanced stage development across 7 countries. In 2016, we have already closed Advancion sales to third parties totaling more than $70 million in gross revenue. With our proven storage platform, unequaled experience and global reach through AES and our sales channel partnerships, we are ideally positioned to capitalize on this rapidly growing market.
Turning now to Slide 9. I'd like to discuss what we consider to be key underlying strengths of our businesses: a highly contracted portfolio and the competitive nature of our assets even in those markets where LNG-based and renewable generation are making en route. As you can see on this slide, as a result of our proactive contracting and portfolio rebalancing initiatives, today, about 75% of our business is U.S. dollar-based. About 85% of our business is either contracted generation or regulated utilities. The average remaining life on our PPAs at our contracted businesses is 7 years. And when we complete our current construction program in 2020, it will be extended to 10 years.
Turning to Slide 10. Although that's a long average remaining contract life, there are a few markets where our contracts will roll off sooner. Nonetheless, we believe that our position in those particular markets will allow us to continue to earn attractive returns after the current contracts expire. The majority of our businesses are low-cost, flexible and reliable energy providers with strong locational advantages. Our knowledge of these markets and critical mass also puts us in a position to take advantage of growth opportunities or quickly respond to changing conditions.
Let me talk about a few of these markets in more detail. In the Dominican Republic, a portion of our contracts are rolling off in the next 3 years. However, our plants are mostly gas-fired, and we offer the lowest-cost source of generation in the system, which is 54% oil-based. Based on today's relative fuel prices, our variable cost is half of that of oil-fired generation, which puts us in a good position to recontract our plants on favorable terms. In 2017, we will complete the closing of the cycle at our DPP gas plant, which will add 122 megawatts without increasing our carbon footprint. 
In the Philippines, we operate a 630-megawatt coal-fired plant and are building a 335-megawatt expansion. The existing Masinloc plant is more than 90% contracted until 2019, and we've already reached an agreement pending regulatory approval with the plant's offtaker for an extension to 2022. In terms of the 335-megawatt expansion project, which will come online in 2019, we have already signed 10- to 20-year contracts covering 50% of the capacity. Our plants in the Philippines will be even more competitive once the country's gas plants, which account for 25% of the system supply, move from base low to mid-merit when their current take-or-pay gas contracts roll off from 2019 to 2023. 
In California, our Southland contracts are expiring in December of 2019 and 2020, but we have already recontracted these facilities under a 20-year PPA that will require the repowering of our assets. With the new contract, we expect to see growth in earnings and cash flows from this business.
Now moving to Chile on Slide 11 where we are largely contracted. Although there has been a slowdown in economic growth mainly due to the impact of falling mineral prices on the Chilean economy, we remain optimistic about the future prospects of the country. As you may know, the recent auctions for contracts beginning in 2021 and '22 cleared significantly below market expectations. We believe these prices reflect aggressive bidding by both new market participants and existing hydro owners. Nonetheless, we do not believe that this will have a meaningful impact on our business in Chile in the near to medium term because AES Gener is largely hedged with an average remaining PPA life of 11 years. So our exposure for the next 5 years is quite limited, with only 8% of our contracts rolling off in '21 and '22. Although over the long term we do forecast some softening in prices, we do not believe this auction result is necessarily indicative of the long-term price lift. While Chile does have excellent solar and good wind resources, some of the assumptions underlying the recent auction outcome may have been aggressive on capital cost declines, load factors and the all-in cost to support renewable assets with a 24/7 load following obligation. We see renewables, energy storage and thermal resources as complementary in the future Chilean grid. In fact, we believe our existing portfolio will be even more important in the long term as we see higher demand growth driven by an eventual acceleration in economic growth. Accordingly, our existing assets are well positioned to provide reliable and competitive energy to the Chilean grid.
Now turning to Slide 12, to our construction program, which is the most significant driver of cash flow and dividend growth in the coming years. Since our last call, we have completed construction of our 532-megawatt Cochrane power plant in Chile, which is 100% contracted for 18 years. This brings our year-to-date commission capacity to 3 gigawatts, all of which were completed on time and on budget. We have another 3.4 gigawatts remaining under construction where we are generally making good progress. The main exception to our strong performance on construction is Alto Maipo, a 531-megawatt run of the river hydro plant in Chile, which is by far our most complex construction project underway. Today, the overall project is about 40% completed. As we discussed on our last call, we have encountered geological issues while excavating some underground tunnels. After consultation with a contractor and independent consultant, our expectation is still for Alto Maipo to be completed in 2019 at a cost that is about 10% to 20% over the original budget. We expect the additional capital cost of roughly $200 million to $400 million will be funded by a combination of lenders and project sponsors. Discussions with lenders are underway.
I'd note that notwithstanding the challenges we have encountered at Alto Maipo, we have a strong track record of completing projects on time and on budget. In the last 5 years, AES has delivered more than 5 gigawatts of projects, which were completed on time and on budget. Accordingly, we are confident that our construction program will continue to drive attractive growth in our free cash flow and earnings.
Turning to Slide 13. Excluding the cost overrun at Alto Maipo, which I mentioned earlier, our 3.4 gigawatts currently under construction represent total capital expenditures of $6.4 billion. However, AES' equity commitment is limited to $1.1 billion. Of this, all but $250 million has already been funded. Roughly 70% of our investments are in the Americas, mainly Chile, Panama and the U.S.
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I would like to emphasize our derisking of our company over the last 5 years on Slide 14. Today, we're in a strong position to execute on the strategic growth opportunities I just discussed, in large part because of the actions we have taken. We have exited 11 markets, including the riskiest countries in our portfolio. This week, we also closed the sale of AES Sul, a utility in Brazil, which decreases our exposure to Brazilian regulatory and hydrology risks to more appropriate levels. 
In total, our asset sales program since September of 2011 has raised $4 billion in cash to the parent. We're investing our discretionary cash towards projects that are better aligned with our strategy, like LNG in Central America and renewables in the U.S. 
In Panama, our hydro assets will be more valuable by 2019 when we begin operating the nation's first gas-fired plant and LNG facility, which will cap energy prices in times of drought. These investments not only drive solid growth in cash flow and earnings but also offer our investors a more robust and optimal portfolio. 
Last but not least, deleveraging has been and will continue to be an important part of our strategy. Over the past 5 years, we have reduced our parent debt by 28%. And based on the growth of our cash flow, we expect to achieve investment-grade stats by 2020. We believe that in conjunction, all of these actions will deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Today, I'll review our results, including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit, or SBU, then I'll cover our 2016 capital allocation as well as our",1490,"Thanks, Andrés, and good morning. Today, I'll review our results, including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit, or SBU, then I'll cover our 2016 capital allocation as well as our guidance and expectations. 
Before I get started, I'll remind you of a couple items that helped our results in the third quarter of last year: One was the restructuring of Guacolda in Chile that generated $0.06 of equity in earnings; and the other was a large receivables collection in the Dominican Republic, which led to higher-than-normal proportional free cash flow.
Now turning to Slide 16. Third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.32 was $0.06 lower than 2015. This decline is in line with our expectations that we communicated on our last call. Specifically, our third quarter results reflect positive contribution for our businesses, particularly in the U.S., where we benefited from rate-based growth at our utility IPL in Indiana, an improved availability at DPL in Ohio; the impact of the Guacolda restructuring in 2015; and also the $0.02 impact from the devaluation of foreign currencies, as expected, particularly in Andes in Europe. 
And on Slide 17, our proportional free cash flow and adjusted PTC for the quarter. We generated $400 million in proportional of free cash flow, a decrease of $221 million from last year. This reflects slightly lower margins and the impact of working capital in the MCAC SBU, specifically the DR, where although collections remain strong, we had the large receivable settlement last year.
We also won $272 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of $43 million, largely driven by the Guacolda restructuring.
Next, I'll cover SBUs in more detail over the next 6 slides, beginning on Slide 18. In the U.S., our results reflect relatively higher margins, including the benefit from environmental upgrades on 1,700 megawatts of capacity that came online through this quarter and from this year's rate case at IPL as well as higher contributions from DPL, reflecting our continuing actions to improve the availability of our generation fleet. 
At Andes, our results reflect higher margins, primarily due to lower spot fuel and energy purchases as well as the start of commercial operations at Cochrane Unit 1 in Chile. This is partially offset by lower spot prices and generation at Chivor in Colombia, where we replenished reservoir levels after increasing production when energy prices were at record highs in December of last year. 
Margins also reflect the 38% devaluation of the Argentine peso. Adjusted PTC decreased due to the Guacolda restructuring, and proportional free cash flow also reflects the timing of lower VAT collections in Chile after Cochrane came online. 
In Brazil, our results were largely driven by lower margins, mainly due to the expiration of Tietê's PPA at the end of 2015. As part of our rolling hedging strategy that we had in place since 2014, Tietê is about 80% hedged over the next 2 years. 
In Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect lower margins, primarily due to lower rolling 12-month availability in Puerto Rico, which was impacted by a fourth quarter outage in 2015. Adjusted PTC was further impacted by lower interest income on overdue receivables in the Dominican Republic, where collections have improved. Proportional free cash flow decreased, primarily due to the large settlement of receivables in the DR. 
In Europe, our results reflect lower margins due to the contracted capacity price reduction following the successful settlement of outstanding receivables at Maritza in Bulgaria as well as the 36% devaluation of the Kazakhstan tenge. Proportional free cash flow benefited from higher collections at Maritza. It's worth mentioning that we continue to see improved collections in the roughly 6 months since that settlement, and payments are current. 
Finally, in Asia, our results reflect steady margins and working capital requirements year-over-year. 
Now to Slide 24. I'll provide an update on our filing at DP&L in Ohio, where we've seen some positive momentum on the regulatory front. We remain in active discussions with the commission staff and intervenors. As you may know, last month, we amended our ESP filing to propose a distribution monetization rider of $145 million per year over 7 years with the aim of achieving and maintaining an investment-grade rating at DP&L. Hearings are now set for early December, and we expect the ruling to be effective beginning in the first quarter of 2017 that will support the financial viability and credit profile of the business.
Now Slide 25 and the progress we're making to improve our credit profile. In third quarter, we prepaid $180 million in parent debt, bringing our total debt paydown year-to-date to $300 million. Since 2011, we reduced parent debt by $1.8 billion or 28% and reduced interest by 125 basis points, resulting in an annualized interest savings of $180 million. As you can see on the top of the slide, we have no debt maturing at the parent until 2019 when only $240 million is due.
Turning to the bottom of the slide. These proactive steps have helped us to reduce our parent leverage ratio from almost 6.5x to slightly over 5x debt to parent free cash flow plus interest. These actions reflect our strategy to derisk our portfolio and improve our credit metrics. We expect our credit to continue to improve, largely driven by a strong growth in parent free cash flow as well as a modest amount of annual debt reduction. As a result, we expect to attain investment-grade credit metrics by 2020. We believe this will help us reduce our cost of debt; improve financial flexibility; and also importantly, enhance our equity valuation.
Turning now to our 2016 parent capital allocation on Slide 26, which is materially in line with our prior discussions. Sources on the left-hand side reflect $1.5 billion of total available discretionary cash, which includes $575 million in parent free cash flow. We remain confident in our 2016 parent free cash flow range of $525 million to $625 million, which is the foundation for our discretionary cash available for dividend growth and value creation. Sources also include proceeds from asset sales, primarily from AES Sul, where we're estimating net proceeds of $440 million, including a stub dividend of around $25 million after accounting for working capital adjustments and transaction costs. Although we've successfully closed the sale in October, we anticipate receiving the majority of the proceeds at the parent in the first quarter 2017 after meeting the required notice period for distributions.
Now the uses on the right-hand side of the slide. Consistent with our capital allocation plan, with 10% growth in our dividend and completed share repurchases, we are returning about 1/3 of our allocated cash to shareholders this year. Going forward, we continue to see our dividend as the primary means to distribute cash to shareholders. As I just mentioned, we've already prepaid $300 million of our near-term maturities. We've also allocated $360 million for investments in our subsidiaries, the majority of which is for new projects driving our growth through 2018 and beyond. After considering these investments in our subsidiaries, debt prepayment and our current dividend, we're left with roughly $400 million of discretionary cash. This, together with our 2017 free cash flow, will provide a strong foundation to grow our dividend, continue to delever and earn attractive risk-adjusted returns by investing in our development pipeline focused on gas and low-cost renewables.
Now turning to Slide 27. As reflected in our third quarter and year-to-date, we continue to generate strong proportional free cash flow, and our third quarter adjusted EPS was also in line with our expectations. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our 2016 guidance for all metrics. Since earlier this year, we've also experienced some headwinds, including outages at 2 of our businesses in MCAC as well as a slightly negative impact from reverting back to ESP 1 rigs and also some dark spread compression at DPL in Ohio. However, we're expecting to offset these impacts with a couple of items, one of which would lead to a lower full year effective tax rate.
Finally, before handing back to Andrés, I want to briefly discuss our expectations beyond 2016. On our fourth quarter call in February, we plan to provide guidance for '17 as well as longer-term expectations through at least 2019. At that point, we will have completed our annual budget process and will be in a better position to provide more detailed guidance. Based on our preliminary view, we expect to be within the previously disclosed ranges for average annual growth through 2018. 
As Andrés has discussed, the majority of our new projects are coming online in 2018, so we expect growth to be stronger in 2018 and 2017. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our previously disclosed ranges for expected growth in 2017, '18 from both proportional free cash flow and adjusted EPS.
With that, I'll now turn it back to Andrés."

To summarize today's call, we have a portfolio of assets that is generating strong cash flow and a construction and development pipeline that is driving growth in cash flow and earnings. We are well positioned to maximize shareholder value through the following: First, we are rebalancing our business mix by exiting certain businesses to reduce risk and redeploying our excess cash in growth projects with long-term U.S. dollar-denominated contracts and focusing on less carbon-intensive sources of generation. 
Second, we remain committed to continuing to strengthen our credit, which is largely driven by the successful completion of our construction program, cost reductions and delevering. Accordingly, we remain confident that we can achieve investment-grade stats by 2020. 
Third, we're capitalizing on our advantaged position in key high-growth markets, and we continue to expect double-digit growth in all key metrics through 2018.
Furthermore, we believe that we are well placed to deliver attractive growth in cash flow and earnings beyond 2018.
With that, I would like to open the call for questions."

And of those, I think probably about $40 billion have been suspended. So the growth in demand from the mining sector did not materialize, and those projects are on hold. So that really changed the dynamics that give you a much higher reserve ratio in Chile than certainly any of the projections had been. So that's, I think, the most important thing to understand. So when there was -- this auction came in, and there had been some changes to the auction process, what we saw was it was below, certainly, I think, consensus estimates and basically came in on 2 sides. One was a new entrant on the renewables side and also, we believe, on the hydro side, people bid lower than expected. I would say of the thermal bids, we were probably, we believe, the lowest, so we had I think a better view of that. What do we think is a sustainable level? Well, if you go to the market research in Chile today, some of the sustainable level is north of $60, $60 a megawatt hour. If you look at where this auction cleared, it's more like $47. And there are issues here because you have to follow the load with intermittent renewables, and you have to put packages together. So we think that some of these assumptions -- obviously, people are bidding for future prices of the capital investment, future prices for other things. There's a lot of assumptions here, so we think that more in line with the consensus view overall. And the one thing I would say is if these mining projects get reactivated, maybe even 1/3 of them, then the situation in Chile will change. Because you also should remember that the very high reserve margin that the market has, a lot of that's very old -- is very old coal plants and other ones that are not efficient. So we think that that's reasonable. And that any way the market moves, though, I think that we're in a very good position having that existing thermal and hydro base to combine it with renewables to be able to offer more secure load following supply."

And the Philippine market will change as what you have today is basically a lot of gas plants that are using domestic gas, which are basically first to be dispatched so they're sort of base load. When these contracts burn off in the next couple years, they go to mid-merit. And quite frankly, they may have to search for new sources of gas. So given that, this plant will be very well positioned. And basically, I think that perhaps where you're going is that the new contracts we're signing for 10- and 20-year PPAs are at the same -- similar prices, and we basically have an extension on the existing Masinloc at the same price with the offtaker.

We have to go to 4, low 4s, depending upon our business mix and the stability of the business. I don't think it would materially change our business or our financing strategy. I will say that we've done and will continue to do a lot to look ahead and refinance, take advantage of market windows, be it at the parent or really all throughout our subs, be it project finances or subsidiary finances that would be bundles. The one thing I'd say is that we probably look to do bundles more than one-off deals where we can. And it still fits with the strategy, so we're doing that in some places. We've got an expansion right now in the Dominican Republic of -- about $250 million to close the cycle, make a project about 1/3 more efficient on its gas usage, and that's being done. It's basically being bundled with our Andres plant. It's a very efficient plant. So we're bundling those 2 together. So it means we don't put in equity. We basically use the equity value of the -- of Andres to bundle that and alleviate equity requirements and the new -- and also, just upgrade the credit package. We're doing the same thing in the Philippines, where the new Masinloc is part of the credit package of the Philippines. So we'll look to do more of that. And I think especially as we go and look at some smaller renewables, we're doing some smaller renewables in the U.S. This year, we'll do about almost 100, and those are things that you really do bundled financing as opposed to project by project."

So we believe, I think it's next year, we'll have about installations around the world around 1 gigawatt, and we're starting maybe 2 years ago at 200. So first, it's growing very rapidly. And it's a technology that has many applications. I mean, it has applications for capacity release. Those were some of our first project, ancillary services. And you're right, sort of substituting peaking plants, where you have a lot of renewables. That's our big project in California. But it also has applications in the T&D business in terms of transmission -- alleviating transmission constraints. Now part of the lithium ion battery energy storage solutions, batteries are one component. So we've seen over the last 5 years battery prices drop by 65%. There's no technical reason you couldn't make it an 8-hour if you wanted to. It's just a question you got to put on more batteries and it becomes more expensive. So we expect battery prices to continue to drop because these are the same batteries you use in electric vehicles. So as that becomes massified, it should drop continually. So we're projecting a continued drop in those prices. So the duration is really a function of your battery price. So we are seeing that it's -- in many places, the applications are more sort of in the 2- to 4-hour today at today's battery prices, but you could extend those for longer. And I think that, again, we're seeing a very rapid growth of demand. And again, this year alone, we've already closed $70 million in gross revenues from sales to third parties, that is sales to other people to plant on our grid. So I'm certain that this will continue to grow very quickly. I'm also certain that prices will drop. And what we're really trying to see is our sort of two-pronged approach, where we put our Advancion product on our own platforms and use them to enhance our renewables or even enhance our thermal plant and selling it to third parties. Now the third-party sales, we're using channel partners who have sales forces. And finally, I would say that the combination of the 2, what are we driving at? We want to be the low-cost provider and also, quite frankly, the best provider of this service. So third-party sales helps lower the costs to us."

Tom will then rev",2069,"Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our Third Quarter 2016 Financial Review Call. Today, I will provide an update on our year-to-date performance, key market trends and our long-term strategy in the context of those trends. Tom will then review positive regulatory developments at DPL in Ohio and our financial results as well as provide color on our current guidance.
Year-to-date, we generated proportional free cash flow of $1.1 billion, representing 91% of the midpoint of our full year guidance and reflecting the collection of outstanding receivables in Bulgaria during the second quarter. Our year-to-date adjusted EPS was $0.64, representing 64% of our full year guidance, consistent with expectations that we communicated to you previously. These results keep us on track to achieve our full year guidance, which Tom will address in detail.
Now turning to key market trends on Slide 5. At a high level, we are seeing changes in some of our markets due to the entry of natural gas and low-cost renewables. However, we're generally well positioned to take advantage of these changes because we have already begun to invest in these technologies and because most of our largely contracted portfolio has locational and cost advantages. Accordingly, despite what we have recently seen in some markets like Chile, we remain confident in the long-term strength of our portfolio. We see a future where the operator, who has an efficient thermal and hydro fleet and can integrate them with the new technologies will be the winner. We're also on track to meet our expectations through 2018, which are driven by our construction and cost reduction programs. Most of our construction programs are going well, with the exception of Alto Maipo, which represents 15% of the total megawatts under construction. 
There's no question that the future growth across our markets will be heavily weighted towards less carbon-intensive gas, wind and solar generation. Accordingly, we have been taking actions in this regard for some time now. For example, as we've discussed on previous calls, we have been expanding our LNG infrastructure into Central America, as shown on Slide 6. Our $1 billion Colon project in Panama will contribute to our growth beyond 2018 and includes a 380-megawatt combined-cycle gas plant and 180,000 cubic meter LNG regasification and storage facility. The power plant is contracted under a 10-year U.S. dollar-denominated power purchase agreement. This project will diversify Panama's reliance on hydro-based generation while also meeting a growing need for natural gas across Central America. By introducing natural gas to the region, we're displacing oil-fired generation in favor of a cheaper and cleaner alternative and also serving the needs of many potential downstream customers, including commercial and industrial users and the transportation industry.
On Slide 7, we see another example of how we're responding to environmental concerns about coal-fired generation. In Indiana, we just completed a multiyear $550 million rate-based investment in environmental upgrades to our coal plant and the repowering of several units from coal to gas. We will further shift IPL's fuel mix away from coal when we complete the 671-megawatt Eagle Valley CCGT in Indiana in the first half of 2017. The combined impact of these investments will be to reduce the gigawatt hours IPL produces from coal by about 40%.
Turning to Slide 8. The growth in renewables not only provides an opportunity for direct investments in wind and solar generation but creates a market for energy storage. We plan to invest in wind and solar generation in our markets with a primary focus on U.S. dollar-denominated long-term contracts. In fact, since last year, we have added more than 150 megawatts of solar with long-term contracts in the U.S., about half of which is operating and the rest will come online in 2017. Regarding energy storage, we believe this technology will play a critical role in an increasingly renewables-based generation mix. AES has been designing, deploying and operating battery-based energy storage systems for almost a decade. 
Today, our proprietary Advancion platform is the world leader with more than 400 megawatts in operation under construction or in advanced stage development across 7 countries. In 2016, we have already closed Advancion sales to third parties totaling more than $70 million in gross revenue. With our proven storage platform, unequaled experience and global reach through AES and our sales channel partnerships, we are ideally positioned to capitalize on this rapidly growing market.
Turning now to Slide 9. I'd like to discuss what we consider to be key underlying strengths of our businesses: a highly contracted portfolio and the competitive nature of our assets even in those markets where LNG-based and renewable generation are making in-roads. As you can see on this slide, as a result of our proactive contracting and portfolio rebalancing initiatives, today, about 75% of our business is U.S. dollar-based. About 85% of our business is either contracted generation or regulated utilities. The average remaining life on our PPAs at our contracted businesses is 7 years. And when we complete our current construction program in 2020, it will be extended to 10 years.
Turning to Slide 10. Although that's a long average remaining contract life, there are a few markets where our contracts will roll off sooner. Nonetheless, we believe that our position in those particular markets will allow us to continue to earn attractive returns after the current contracts expire. The majority of our businesses are low-cost, flexible and reliable energy providers with strong locational advantages. Our knowledge of these markets and critical mass also puts us in a position to take advantage of growth opportunities or quickly respond to changing conditions.
Let me talk about a few of these markets in more detail. In the Dominican Republic, a portion of our contracts are rolling off in the next 3 years. However, our plants are mostly gas-fired, and we offer the lowest-cost source of generation in the system, which is 54% oil-based. Based on today's relative fuel prices, our variable cost is half of that of oil-fired generation, which puts us in a good position to re-contract our plants on favorable terms. In 2017, we will complete the closing of the cycle at our DPP gas plant, which will add 122 megawatts without increasing our carbon footprint. 
In the Philippines, we operate a 630-megawatt coal-fired plant and are building a 335-megawatt expansion. The existing Masinloc plant is more than 90% contracted until 2019, and we've already reached an agreement pending regulatory approval with the plant's off-taker for an extension to 2022. In terms of the 335-megawatt expansion project, which will come online in 2019, we have already signed 10- to 20-year contracts covering 50% of the capacity. Our plants in the Philippines will be even more competitive once the country's gas plants, which account for 25% of the system's supply, move from base low to mid-merit when their current take-or-pay gas contracts roll off from 2019 to 2023. 
In California, our Southland contracts are expiring in December of 2019 and 2020, but we have already re-contracted these facilities under a 20-year PPA that will require the repowering of our assets. With the new contract, we expect to see growth in earnings and cash flows from this business.
Now moving to Chile on Slide 11 where we are largely contracted. Although there has been a slowdown in economic growth mainly due to the impact of falling mineral prices on the Chilean economy, we remain optimistic about the future prospects of the country. As you may know, the recent auctions for contracts beginning in 2021 and '22 cleared significantly below market expectations. We believe these prices reflect aggressive bidding by both new market participants and existing hydro owners. Nonetheless, we do not believe that this will have a meaningful impact on our business in Chile in the near to medium term because AES Gener is largely hedged with an average remaining PPA life of 11 years. So our exposure for the next 5 years is quite limited, with only 8% of our contracts rolling off in '21 and '22. Although over the long term we do forecast some softening in prices, we do not believe this auction result is necessarily indicative of the long-term price level. While Chile does have excellent solar and good wind resources, some of the assumptions underlying the recent auction outcome may have been aggressive on capital cost declines, load factors and the all-in cost to support renewable assets with a 24/7 load following obligation. We see renewables, energy storage and thermal resources as complementary in the future Chilean grid. In fact, we believe our existing portfolio will be even more important in the long term as we see higher demand growth driven by an eventual acceleration in economic growth. Accordingly, our existing assets are well positioned to provide reliable and competitive energy to the Chilean grid.
Now turning to Slide 12, to our construction program, which is the most significant driver of cash flow and dividend growth in the coming years. Since our last call, we have completed construction of our 532-megawatt Cochrane power plant in Chile, which is 100% contracted for 18 years. This brings our year-to-date commission capacity to 3 gigawatts, all of which were completed on time and on budget. We have another 3.4 gigawatts remaining under construction where we are generally making good progress. The main exception to our strong performance on construction is Alto Maipo, a 531-megawatt run of the river hydro plant in Chile, which is by far our most complex construction project underway. Today, the overall project is about 40% completed. As we discussed on our last call, we have encountered geological issues while excavating some underground tunnels. After consultation with a contractor and independent consultant, our expectation is still for Alto Maipo to be completed in 2019 at a cost that is about 10% to 20% over the original budget. We expect the additional capital cost of roughly $200 million to $400 million will be funded by a combination of lenders and project sponsors. Discussions with lenders are underway.
I'd note that notwithstanding the challenges we have encountered at Alto Maipo, we have a strong track record of completing projects on time and on budget. In the last 5 years, AES has delivered more than 5 gigawatts of projects, which were completed on time and on budget. Accordingly, we are confident that our construction program will continue to drive attractive growth in our free cash flow and earnings.
Turning to Slide 13. Excluding the cost overrun at Alto Maipo, which I mentioned earlier, our 3.4 gigawatts currently under construction represent total capital expenditures of $6.4 billion. However, AES' equity commitment is limited to $1.1 billion. Of this, all but $250 million has already been funded. Roughly 70% of our investments are in the Americas, mainly Chile, Panama and the U.S.
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I would like to emphasize our derisking of our company over the last 5 years on Slide 14. Today, we're in a strong position to execute on the strategic growth opportunities I just discussed, in large part because of the actions we have taken. We have exited 11 markets, including the riskiest countries in our portfolio. This week, we also closed the sale of AES Sul, a utility in Brazil, which decreases our exposure to Brazilian regulatory and hydrology risks to more appropriate levels. 
In total, our asset sales program since September of 2011 has raised $4 billion in cash to the parent. We're investing our discretionary cash towards projects that are better aligned with our strategy, like LNG in Central America and renewables in the U.S. 
In Panama, our hydro assets will be more valuable by 2019 when we begin operating the nation's first gas-fired plant and LNG facility, which will cap energy prices in times of drought. These investments not only drive solid growth in cash flow and earnings but also offer our investors a more robust and optimal portfolio. 
Last but not least, deleveraging has been and will continue to be an important part of our strategy. Over the past 5 years, we have reduced our parent debt by 28%. And based on the growth of our cash flow, we expect to achieve investment-grade stats by 2020. We believe that in conjunction, all of these actions will deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."
35312,403760274,1074528,"The AES Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2016",2016-11-04,"Earnings Calls","The AES Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Andrés, and good morning. Today, I'll review our results, including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit, or SBU, then I'll cover our 2016 capital allocation as well as our",1490,"Thanks, Andrés, and good morning. Today, I'll review our results, including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit, or SBU, then I'll cover our 2016 capital allocation as well as our guidance and expectations. 
Before I get started, I'll remind you of a couple items that helped our results in the third quarter of last year: One was the restructuring of Guacolda in Chile that generated $0.06 of equity in earnings; and the other was a large receivables collection in the Dominican Republic, which led to higher-than-normal proportional free cash flow.
Now turning to Slide 16. Third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.32 was $0.06 lower than 2015. This decline is in line with our expectations that we communicated on our last call. Specifically, our third quarter results reflect positive contribution from our businesses, particularly in the U.S., where we benefited from rate-based growth at our utility IPL in Indiana, an improved availability at DPL in Ohio; the impact of the Guacolda restructuring in 2015; and also the $0.02 impact from the devaluation of foreign currencies, as expected, particularly in Andes and Europe. 
And on Slide 17, our proportional free cash flow and adjusted PTC for the quarter. We generated $400 million in proportional of free cash flow, a decrease of $221 million from last year. This reflects slightly lower margins and the impact of working capital in the MCAC SBU, specifically the DR, where although collections remain strong, we had the large receivables settlement last year.
We also earned $272 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of $43 million, largely driven by the Guacolda restructuring.
Next, I'll cover SBUs in more detail over the next 6 slides, beginning on Slide 18. In the U.S., our results reflect relatively higher margins, including the benefit from environmental upgrades on 1,700 megawatts of capacity that came online through this quarter and from this year's rate case at IPL as well as higher contributions from DPL, reflecting our continuing actions to improve the availability of our generation fleet. 
At Andes, our results reflect higher margins, primarily due to lower spot fuel and energy purchases as well as the start of commercial operations at Cochrane Unit 1 in Chile. This is partially offset by lower spot prices and generation at Chivor in Colombia, where we replenished reservoir levels after increasing production when energy prices were at record highs in December of last year. 
Margins also reflect the 38% devaluation of the Argentine peso. Adjusted PTC decreased due to the Guacolda restructuring, and proportional free cash flow also reflects the timing of lower VAT collections in Chile after Cochrane came online. 
In Brazil, our results were largely driven by lower margins, mainly due to the expiration of Tietê's PPA at the end of 2015. As part of our rolling hedging strategy that we had in place since 2014, Tietê is about 80% hedged over the next 2 years. 
In Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect lower margins, primarily due to lower rolling 12-month availability in Puerto Rico, which was impacted by a fourth quarter outage in 2015. Adjusted PTC was further impacted by lower interest income on overdue receivables in the Dominican Republic, where collections have improved. Proportional free cash flow decreased, primarily due to the large settlement of receivables in the DR. 
In Europe, our results reflect lower margins due to the contracted capacity price reduction following the successful settlement of outstanding receivables at Maritza in Bulgaria as well as the 36% devaluation of the Kazakhstan tenge. Proportional free cash flow benefited from higher collections at Maritza. It's worth mentioning that we continue to see improved collections in the roughly 6 months since that settlement, and payments are current. 
Finally, in Asia, our results reflect steady margins and working capital requirements year-over-year. 
Now to Slide 24. I'll provide an update on our filing at DP&L in Ohio, where we've seen some positive momentum on the regulatory front. We remain in active discussions with the commission staff and intervenors. As you may know, last month, we amended our ESP filing to propose a distribution monetization rider of $145 million per year over 7 years with the aim of achieving and maintaining an investment-grade rating at DP&L. Hearings are now set for early December, and we expect the ruling to be effective beginning in the first quarter of 2017 that will support the financial viability and credit profile of the business.
Now Slide 25 and the progress we're making to improve our credit profile. In third quarter, we prepaid $180 million in parent debt, bringing our total debt pay down year-to-date to $300 million. Since 2011, we reduced parent debt by $1.8 billion or 28% and reduced interest by 125 basis points, resulting in an annualized interest savings of $180 million. As you can see on the top of the slide, we have no debt maturing at the parent until 2019 when only $240 million is due.
Turning to the bottom of the slide. These proactive steps have helped us to reduce our parent leverage ratio from almost 6.5x to slightly over 5x debt to parent free cash flow plus interest. These actions reflect our strategy to de-risk our portfolio and improve our credit metrics. We expect our credit to continue to improve, largely driven by strong growth in parent free cash flow as well as a modest amount of annual debt reduction. As a result, we expect to attain investment-grade credit metrics by 2020. We believe this will help us reduce our cost of debt; improve financial flexibility; and also importantly, enhance our equity valuation.
Turning now to our 2016 parent capital allocation on Slide 26, which is materially in line with our prior discussions. Sources on the left-hand side reflect $1.5 billion of total available discretionary cash, which includes $575 million in parent free cash flow. We remain confident in our 2016 parent free cash flow range of $525 million to $625 million, which is the foundation for our discretionary cash available for dividend growth and value creation. Sources also include proceeds from asset sales, primarily from AES Sul, where we're estimating net proceeds of $440 million, including a stub dividend of around $25 million after accounting for working capital adjustments and transaction costs. Although we've successfully closed the sale in October, we anticipate receiving the majority of the proceeds at the parent in the first quarter 2017 after meeting the required notice period for distributions.
Now to uses on the right-hand side of the slide. Consistent with our capital allocation plan, with 10% growth in our dividend and completed share repurchases, we are returning about 1/3 of our allocated cash to shareholders this year. Going forward, we continue to see our dividend as the primary means to distribute cash to shareholders. As I just mentioned, we've already prepaid $300 million of our near-term maturities. We've also allocated $360 million for investments in our subsidiaries, the majority of which is for new projects driving our growth through 2018 and beyond. After considering these investments in our subsidiaries, debt prepayment and our current dividend, we're left with roughly $400 million of discretionary cash. This, together with our 2017 free cash flow, will provide a strong foundation to grow our dividend, continue to de-lever and earn attractive risk-adjusted returns by investing in our development pipeline focused on gas and low-cost renewables.
Now turning to Slide 27. As reflected in our third quarter and year-to-date, we continue to generate strong proportional free cash flow, and our third quarter adjusted EPS was also in line with our expectations. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our 2016 guidance for all metrics. Since earlier this year, we've also experienced some headwinds, including outages at 2 of our businesses in MCAC as well as a slightly negative impact from reverting back to ESP 1 rates and also some dark spread compression at DPL in Ohio. However, we're expecting to offset these impacts with a couple of items, one of which would lead to a lower full year effective tax rate.
Finally, before handing back to Andrés, I want to briefly discuss our expectations beyond 2016. On our fourth quarter call in February, we plan to provide guidance for '17 as well as longer-term expectations through at least 2019. At that point, we will have completed our annual budget process and will be in a better position to provide more detailed guidance. Based on our preliminary view, we expect to be within the previously disclosed ranges for average annual growth through 2018. 
As Andrés has discussed, the majority of our new projects are coming online in 2018, so we expect growth to be stronger in 2018 and 2017. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our previously disclosed ranges for expected growth in 2017, '18 from both proportional free cash flow and adjusted EPS.
With that, I'll now turn it back to Andrés."

To summarize today's call, we have a portfolio of assets that is generating strong cash flow and a construction and development pipeline that is driving growth in cash flow and earnings. We are well positioned to maximize shareholder value through the following: First, we are rebalancing our business mix by exiting certain businesses to reduce risk and redeploying our excess cash in growth projects with long-term U.S. dollar-denominated contracts and focusing on less carbon-intensive sources of generation. 
Second, we remain committed to continuing to strengthen our credit, which is largely driven by the successful completion of our construction program, cost reductions and de-levering. Accordingly, we remain confident that we can achieve investment-grade stats by 2020. 
Third, we're capitalizing on our advantaged position in key high-growth markets, and we continue to expect double-digit growth in all key metrics through 2018.

And of those, I think probably about $40 billion have been suspended. So the growth in demand from the mining sector did not materialize, and those projects are on hold. So that really changed the dynamics, that give you a much higher reserve ratio in Chile than certainly any of the projections had been. So that's, I think, the most important thing to understand. So when there was -- this auction came in, and there had been some changes to the auction process, what we saw was it was below, certainly, I think, consensus estimates and basically came in on 2 sides. One was a new entrant on the renewables side and also, we believe, on the hydro side, people bid lower than expected. I would say of the thermal bids, we were probably, we believe, the lowest, so we had I think a better view of that. What do we think is a sustainable level? Well, if you go to the market research in Chile today, some of the sustainable level is north of $60, $60 a megawatt hour. If you look at where this auction cleared, it's more like $47. And there are issues here because you have to follow the load with intermittent renewables, and you have to put packages together. So we think that some of these assumptions -- obviously, people are bidding for future prices of the capital investment, future prices for other things. There's a lot of assumptions here, so we think that more in line with the consensus view overall. And the one thing I would say is if these mining projects get reactivated, maybe even 1/3 of them, then the situation in Chile will change. Because you also should remember that the very high reserve margin that the market has, a lot of that's very old -- is very old coal plants and other ones that are not efficient. So we think that that's reasonable. And that any way the market moves, though, I think that we're in a very good position having that existing thermal and hydro base to combine it with renewables to be able to offer more secure load-following supply."

And the Philippine market will change as what you have today is basically a lot of gas plants that are using domestic gas, which are basically first to be dispatched so they're sort of base load. When these contracts burn off in the next couple years, they go to mid-merit. And quite frankly, they may have to search for new sources of gas. So given that, this plant will be very well positioned.

We have to go to 4, low 4s, depending upon our business mix and the stability of the business. I don't think it would materially change our business or our financing strategy. I will say that we've done and will continue to do a lot to look ahead and refinance, take advantage of market windows, be it at the parent or really all throughout our subs, be it project finances or subsidiary finances that would be bundles. The one thing I'd say is that we'd probably look to do bundles more than one-off deals where we can. And it still fits with the strategy, so we're doing that in some places. We've got an expansion right now in the Dominican Republic of about $250 million to close the cycle, make a project about 1/3 more efficient on its gas usage, and that's being done. It's basically being bundled with our Andres plant. That's a very efficient plant. So we're bundling those 2 together. So it means we don't put in equity. We basically use the equity value of the -- of Andres to bundle that and alleviate equity requirements and the new -- and also, just upgrade the credit package. We're doing the same thing in the Philippines, where the new Masinloc is part of the credit package of the Philippines. So we'll look to do more of that.

And it's a technology that has many applications. I mean, it has applications for capacity release. Those were some of our first project, ancillary services. And you're right, sort of substituting peaking plants, where you have a lot of renewables. That's our big project in California. But it also has applications in the T&D business in terms of transmission -- alleviating transmission constraints. Now part of the lithium ion battery energy storage solutions -- batteries are one component. So we've seen over the last 5 years battery prices drop by 65%. There's no technical reason you couldn't make it an 8-hour if you wanted to. It's just a question you got to put on more batteries and it becomes more expensive. So we expect battery prices to continue to drop because these are the same batteries you use in electric vehicles. So as that becomes mass-ified, it should drop continually. So we're projecting a continued drop in those prices. So the duration is really a function of your battery price. So we are seeing that it's -- in many places, the applications are more sort of in the 2- to 4-hour today at today's battery prices, but you could extend those for longer. And I think that, again, we're seeing a very rapid growth of demand. And again, this year alone, we've already closed $70 million in gross revenues from sales to third parties; that is sales to other people to apply in on our grid. So I'm certain that this will continue to grow very quickly. I'm also certain that prices will drop. And what we're really trying to see is our sort of two-prong approach, where we put our Advancion product on our own platforms and use them to enhance our renewables or even enhance our thermal plant and selling it to third parties. Now the third-party sales, we're using channel partners who have sales forces. And finally, I would say that the combination of the 2, what are we driving at? We want to be the low-cost provider and also, quite frankly, the best provider of this service. So third-party sales helps lower the costs to us."

Quite frankly, when you have droughts and you have an increase in energy prices because they're running more thermal, there isn't an immediate pass-through to the distribution companies. So quite frankly, that puts pressure on our distribution companies in terms of cash. So we think that one of the main drivers of our value creation is the strong cash flow. Having less assets in -- distribution in Brazil would make our cash flow more stable as we redeploy that cash. So we -- there -- I'd say it's clear with our core markets, which we're going after -- I mean, the markets we're most interested in.

Today, I will provide an update on our year-to-date performance, key market trends and our long-term strategy in the context of those trends. Tom will then review positive regulatory developments at DPL in Ohio and our financial results as well as provide color on our current guidance.
Year-to-date, we generated proportional free cash flow of $1.1 billion, representing 91% of the midpoint of our full year guidance and reflecting the collection of outstanding receivables in Bulgaria during the second quarter. Our year-to-date adjusted EPS was $0.64, representing 64% of our full year guidance, consistent with expectations that we communicated to you previously. These results keep us on track to achieve our full year guidance, which Tom will address in detail.
Now turning to key market trends on Slide 5. At a high level, we are seeing changes in some of our markets due to the entry of natural gas and low-cost renewables. However, we're generally well positioned to take advantage of these changes because we have already begun to invest in these technologies and because most of our largely contracted portfolio has locational and cost advantages. Accordingly, despite what we have recently seen in some markets like Chile, we remain confident in the long-term strength of our portfolio. We see a future where the operator, who has an efficient thermal and hydro fleet and can integrate them with the new technologies will be the winner. We're also on track to meet our expectations through 2018, which are driven by our construction and cost reduction programs. Most of our construction programs are going well, with the exception of Alto Maipo, which represents 15% of the total megawatts under construction. 
There's no question that the future growth across our markets will be heavily weighted towards less carbon-intensive gas, wind and solar generation. Accordingly, we have been taking actions in this regard for some time now. For example, as we've discussed on previous calls, we have been expanding our LNG infrastructure into Central America, as shown on Slide 6. Our $1 billion Colon project in Panama will contribute to our growth beyond 2018 and includes a 380-megawatt combined-cycle gas plant and 180,000 cubic meter LNG regasification and storage facility. The power plant is contracted under a 10-year U.S. dollar-denominated power purchase agreement. This project will diversify Panama's reliance on hydro-based generation while also meeting a growing need for natural gas across Central America. By introducing natural gas to the region, we're displacing oil-fired generation in favor of a cheaper and cleaner alternative and also serving the needs of many potential downstream customers, including commercial and industrial users and the transportation industry.
On Slide 7, we see another example of how we're responding to environmental concerns about coal-fired generation. In Indiana, we just completed a multiyear $550 million rate-based investment in environmental upgrades to our coal plant and the repowering of several units from coal to gas. We will further shift IPL's fuel mix away from coal when we complete the 671-megawatt Eagle Valley CCGT in Indiana in the first half of 2017. The combined impact of these investments will be to reduce the gigawatt hours IPL produces from coal by about 40%.
Turning to Slide 8. The growth in renewables not only provides an opportunity for direct investments in wind and solar generation but creates a market for energy storage. We plan to invest in wind and solar generation in our markets with a primary focus on U.S. dollar-denominated long-term contracts. In fact, since last year, we have added more than 150 megawatts of solar with long-term contracts in the U.S., about half of which is operating and the rest will come online in 2017. Regarding energy storage, we believe this technology will play a critical role in an increasingly renewables-based generation mix. AES has been designing, deploying and operating battery-based energy storage systems for almost a decade. 
Today, our proprietary Advancion platform is the world leader with more than 400 megawatts in operation under construction or in advanced stage development across 7 countries. In 2016, we have already closed Advancion sales to third parties totaling more than $70 million in gross revenue. With our proven storage platform, unequaled experience and global reach through AES and our sales channel partnerships, we are ideally positioned to capitalize on this rapidly growing market.
Turning now to Slide 9. I'd like to discuss what we consider to be key underlying strengths of our businesses: a highly contracted portfolio and the competitive nature of our assets even in those markets where LNG-based and renewable generation are making in-roads. As you can see on this slide, as a result of our proactive contracting and portfolio rebalancing initiatives, today, about 75% of our business is U.S. dollar-based. About 85% of our business is either contracted generation or regulated utilities. The average remaining life on our PPAs at our contracted businesses is 7 years. And when we complete our current construction program in 2020, it will be extended to 10 years.
Turning to Slide 10. Although that's a long average remaining contract life, there are a few markets where our contracts will roll off sooner. Nonetheless, we believe that our position in those particular markets will allow us to continue to earn attractive returns after the current contracts expire. The majority of our businesses are low-cost, flexible and reliable energy providers with strong locational advantages. Our knowledge of these markets and critical mass also puts us in a position to take advantage of growth opportunities or quickly respond to changing conditions.
Let me talk about a few of these markets in more detail. In the Dominican Republic, a portion of our contracts are rolling off in the next 3 years. However, our plants are mostly gas-fired, and we offer the lowest-cost source of generation in the system, which is 54% oil-based. Based on today's relative fuel prices, our variable cost is half of that of oil-fired generation, which puts us in a good position to re-contract our plants on favorable terms. In 2017, we will complete the closing of the cycle at our DPP gas plant, which will add 122 megawatts without increasing our carbon footprint. 
In the Philippines, we operate a 630-megawatt coal-fired plant and are building a 335-megawatt expansion. The existing Masinloc plant is more than 90% contracted until 2019, and we've already reached an agreement pending regulatory approval with the plant's off-taker for an extension to 2022. In terms of the 335-megawatt expansion project, which will come online in 2019, we have already signed 10- to 20-year contracts covering 50% of the capacity. Our plants in the Philippines will be even more competitive once the country's gas plants, which account for 25% of the system's supply, move from base low to mid-merit when their current take-or-pay gas contracts roll off from 2019 to 2023. 
In California, our Southland contracts are expiring in December of 2019 and 2020, but we have already re-contracted these facilities under a 20-year PPA that will require the repowering of our assets. With the new contract, we expect to see growth in earnings and cash flows from this business.
Now moving to Chile on Slide 11 where we are largely contracted. Although there has been a slowdown in economic growth mainly due to the impact of falling mineral prices on the Chilean economy, we remain optimistic about the future prospects of the country. As you may know, the recent auctions for contracts beginning in 2021 and '22 cleared significantly below market expectations. We believe these prices reflect aggressive bidding by both new market participants and existing hydro owners. Nonetheless, we do not believe that this will have a meaningful impact on our business in Chile in the near to medium term because AES Gener is largely hedged with an average remaining PPA life of 11 years. So our exposure for the next 5 years is quite limited, with only 8% of our contracts rolling off in '21 and '22. Although over the long term we do forecast some softening in prices, we do not believe this auction result is necessarily indicative of the long-term price level. While Chile does have excellent solar and good wind resources, some of the assumptions underlying the recent auction outcome may have been aggressive on capital cost declines, load factors and the all-in cost to support renewable assets with a 24/7 load following obligation. We see renewables, energy storage and thermal resources as complementary in the future Chilean grid. In fact, we believe our existing portfolio will be even more important in the long term as we see higher demand growth driven by an eventual acceleration in economic growth. Accordingly, our existing assets are well positioned to provide reliable and competitive energy to the Chilean grid.
Now turning to Slide 12, to our construction program, which is the most significant driver of cash flow and dividend growth in the coming years. Since our last call, we have completed construction of our 532-megawatt Cochrane power plant in Chile, which is 100% contracted for 18 years. This brings our year-to-date commission capacity to 3 gigawatts, all of which were completed on time and on budget. We have another 3.4 gigawatts remaining under construction where we are generally making good progress. The main exception to our strong performance on construction is Alto Maipo, a 531-megawatt run of the river hydro plant in Chile, which is by far our most complex construction project underway. Today, the overall project is about 40% completed. As we discussed on our last call, we have encountered geological issues while excavating some underground tunnels. After consultation with a contractor and independent consultant, our expectation is still for Alto Maipo to be completed in 2019 at a cost that is about 10% to 20% over the original budget. We expect the additional capital cost of roughly $200 million to $400 million will be funded by a combination of lenders and project sponsors. Discussions with lenders are underway.
I'd note that notwithstanding the challenges we have encountered at Alto Maipo, we have a strong track record of completing projects on time and on budget. In the last 5 years, AES has delivered more than 5 gigawatts of projects, which were completed on time and on budget. Accordingly, we are confident that our construction program will continue to drive attractive growth in our free cash flow and earnings.
Turning to Slide 13. Excluding the cost overrun at Alto Maipo, which I mentioned earlier, our 3.4 gigawatts currently under construction represent total capital expenditures of $6.4 billion. However, AES' equity commitment is limited to $1.1 billion. Of this, all but $250 million has already been funded. Roughly 70% of our investments are in the Americas, mainly Chile, Panama and the U.S.
Before I turn the call over to Tom, I would like to emphasize our derisking of our company over the last 5 years on Slide 14. Today, we're in a strong position to execute on the strategic growth opportunities I just discussed, in large part because of the actions we have taken. We have exited 11 markets, including the riskiest countries in our portfolio. This week, we also closed the sale of AES Sul, a utility in Brazil, which decreases our exposure to Brazilian regulatory and hydrology risks to more appropriate levels. 
In total, our asset sales program since September of 2011 has raised $4 billion in cash to the parent. We're investing our discretionary cash towards projects that are better aligned with our strategy, like LNG in Central America and renewables in the U.S. 
In Panama, our hydro assets will be more valuable by 2019 when we begin operating the nation's first gas-fired plant and LNG facility, which will cap energy prices in times of drought. These investments not only drive solid growth in cash flow and earnings but also offer our investors a more robust and optimal portfolio. 
Last but not least, deleveraging has been and will continue to be an important part of our strategy. Over the past 5 years, we have reduced our parent debt by 28%. And based on the growth of our cash flow, we expect to achieve investment-grade stats by 2020. We believe that in conjunction, all of these actions will deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom."

Today, I'll review our results, including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit, or SBU, then I'll cover our 2016 capital allocation as well as our",1490,"Thanks, Andrés, and good morning. Today, I'll review our results, including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, by strategic business unit, or SBU, then I'll cover our 2016 capital allocation as well as our guidance and expectations. 
Before I get started, I'll remind you of a couple items that helped our results in the third quarter of last year: One was the restructuring of Guacolda in Chile that generated $0.06 of equity in earnings; and the other was a large receivables collection in the Dominican Republic, which led to higher-than-normal proportional free cash flow.
Now turning to Slide 16. Third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.32 was $0.06 lower than 2015. This decline is in line with our expectations that we communicated on our last call. Specifically, our third quarter results reflect positive contribution from our businesses, particularly in the U.S., where we benefited from rate-based growth at our utility IPL in Indiana, an improved availability at DPL in Ohio; the impact of the Guacolda restructuring in 2015; and also the $0.02 impact from the devaluation of foreign currencies, as expected, particularly in Andes and Europe. 
And on Slide 17, our proportional free cash flow and adjusted PTC for the quarter. We generated $400 million in proportional of free cash flow, a decrease of $221 million from last year. This reflects slightly lower margins and the impact of working capital in the MCAC SBU, specifically the DR, where although collections remain strong, we had the large receivables settlement last year.
We also earned $272 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of $43 million, largely driven by the Guacolda restructuring.
Next, I'll cover SBUs in more detail over the next 6 slides, beginning on Slide 18. In the U.S., our results reflect relatively higher margins, including the benefit from environmental upgrades on 1,700 megawatts of capacity that came online through this quarter and from this year's rate case at IPL as well as higher contributions from DPL, reflecting our continuing actions to improve the availability of our generation fleet. 
At Andes, our results reflect higher margins, primarily due to lower spot fuel and energy purchases as well as the start of commercial operations at Cochrane Unit 1 in Chile. This is partially offset by lower spot prices and generation at Chivor in Colombia, where we replenished reservoir levels after increasing production when energy prices were at record highs in December of last year. 
Margins also reflect the 38% devaluation of the Argentine peso. Adjusted PTC decreased due to the Guacolda restructuring, and proportional free cash flow also reflects the timing of lower VAT collections in Chile after Cochrane came online. 
In Brazil, our results were largely driven by lower margins, mainly due to the expiration of Tietê's PPA at the end of 2015. As part of our rolling hedging strategy that we had in place since 2014, Tietê is about 80% hedged over the next 2 years. 
In Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect lower margins, primarily due to lower rolling 12-month availability in Puerto Rico, which was impacted by a fourth quarter outage in 2015. Adjusted PTC was further impacted by lower interest income on overdue receivables in the Dominican Republic, where collections have improved. Proportional free cash flow decreased, primarily due to the large settlement of receivables in the DR. 
In Europe, our results reflect lower margins due to the contracted capacity price reduction following the successful settlement of outstanding receivables at Maritza in Bulgaria as well as the 36% devaluation of the Kazakhstan tenge. Proportional free cash flow benefited from higher collections at Maritza. It's worth mentioning that we continue to see improved collections in the roughly 6 months since that settlement, and payments are current. 
Finally, in Asia, our results reflect steady margins and working capital requirements year-over-year. 
Now to Slide 24. I'll provide an update on our filing at DP&L in Ohio, where we've seen some positive momentum on the regulatory front. We remain in active discussions with the commission staff and intervenors. As you may know, last month, we amended our ESP filing to propose a distribution monetization rider of $145 million per year over 7 years with the aim of achieving and maintaining an investment-grade rating at DP&L. Hearings are now set for early December, and we expect the ruling to be effective beginning in the first quarter of 2017 that will support the financial viability and credit profile of the business.
Now Slide 25 and the progress we're making to improve our credit profile. In third quarter, we prepaid $180 million in parent debt, bringing our total debt pay down year-to-date to $300 million. Since 2011, we reduced parent debt by $1.8 billion or 28% and reduced interest by 125 basis points, resulting in an annualized interest savings of $180 million. As you can see on the top of the slide, we have no debt maturing at the parent until 2019 when only $240 million is due.
Turning to the bottom of the slide. These proactive steps have helped us to reduce our parent leverage ratio from almost 6.5x to slightly over 5x debt to parent free cash flow plus interest. These actions reflect our strategy to de-risk our portfolio and improve our credit metrics. We expect our credit to continue to improve, largely driven by strong growth in parent free cash flow as well as a modest amount of annual debt reduction. As a result, we expect to attain investment-grade credit metrics by 2020. We believe this will help us reduce our cost of debt; improve financial flexibility; and also importantly, enhance our equity valuation.
Turning now to our 2016 parent capital allocation on Slide 26, which is materially in line with our prior discussions. Sources on the left-hand side reflect $1.5 billion of total available discretionary cash, which includes $575 million in parent free cash flow. We remain confident in our 2016 parent free cash flow range of $525 million to $625 million, which is the foundation for our discretionary cash available for dividend growth and value creation. Sources also include proceeds from asset sales, primarily from AES Sul, where we're estimating net proceeds of $440 million, including a stub dividend of around $25 million after accounting for working capital adjustments and transaction costs. Although we've successfully closed the sale in October, we anticipate receiving the majority of the proceeds at the parent in the first quarter 2017 after meeting the required notice period for distributions.
Now to uses on the right-hand side of the slide. Consistent with our capital allocation plan, with 10% growth in our dividend and completed share repurchases, we are returning about 1/3 of our allocated cash to shareholders this year. Going forward, we continue to see our dividend as the primary means to distribute cash to shareholders. As I just mentioned, we've already prepaid $300 million of our near-term maturities. We've also allocated $360 million for investments in our subsidiaries, the majority of which is for new projects driving our growth through 2018 and beyond. After considering these investments in our subsidiaries, debt prepayment and our current dividend, we're left with roughly $400 million of discretionary cash. This, together with our 2017 free cash flow, will provide a strong foundation to grow our dividend, continue to de-lever and earn attractive risk-adjusted returns by investing in our development pipeline focused on gas and low-cost renewables.
Now turning to Slide 27. As reflected in our third quarter and year-to-date, we continue to generate strong proportional free cash flow, and our third quarter adjusted EPS was also in line with our expectations. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our 2016 guidance for all metrics. Since earlier this year, we've also experienced some headwinds, including outages at 2 of our businesses in MCAC as well as a slightly negative impact from reverting back to ESP 1 rates and also some dark spread compression at DPL in Ohio. However, we're expecting to offset these impacts with a couple of items, one of which would lead to a lower full year effective tax rate.
Finally, before handing back to Andrés, I want to briefly discuss our expectations beyond 2016. On our fourth quarter call in February, we plan to provide guidance for '17 as well as longer-term expectations through at least 2019. At that point, we will have completed our annual budget process and will be in a better position to provide more detailed guidance. Based on our preliminary view, we expect to be within the previously disclosed ranges for average annual growth through 2018. 
As Andrés has discussed, the majority of our new projects are coming online in 2018, so we expect growth to be stronger in 2018 and 2017. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our previously disclosed ranges for expected growth in 2017, '18 from both proportional free cash flow and adjusted EPS.
With that, I'll now turn it back to Andrés."

To summarize today's call, we have a portfolio of assets that is generating strong cash flow and a construction and development pipeline that is driving growth in cash flow and earnings. We are well positioned to maximize shareholder value through the following: First, we are rebalancing our business mix by exiting certain businesses to reduce risk and redeploying our excess cash in growth projects with long-term U.S. dollar-denominated contracts and focusing on less carbon-intensive sources of generation. 
Second, we remain committed to continuing to strengthen our credit, which is largely driven by the successful completion of our construction program, cost reductions and de-levering. Accordingly, we remain confident that we can achieve investment-grade stats by 2020. 
Third, we're capitalizing on our advantaged position in key high-growth markets, and we continue to expect double-digit growth in all key metrics through 2018.
Furthermore, we believe that we are well placed to deliver attractive growth in cash flow and earnings beyond 2018.
With that, I would like to open the call for questions."

And of those, I think probably about $40 billion have been suspended. So the growth in demand from the mining sector did not materialize, and those projects are on hold. So that really changed the dynamics, that give you a much higher reserve ratio in Chile than certainly any of the projections had been. So that's, I think, the most important thing to understand. So when there was -- this auction came in, and there had been some changes to the auction process, what we saw was it was below, certainly, I think, consensus estimates and basically came in on 2 sides. One was a new entrant on the renewables side and also, we believe, on the hydro side, people bid lower than expected. I would say of the thermal bids, we were probably, we believe, the lowest, so we had I think a better view of that. What do we think is a sustainable level? Well, if you go to the market research in Chile today, some of the sustainable level is north of $60, $60 a megawatt hour. If you look at where this auction cleared, it's more like $47. And there are issues here because you have to follow the load with intermittent renewables, and you have to put packages together. So we think that some of these assumptions -- obviously, people are bidding for future prices of the capital investment, future prices for other things. There's a lot of assumptions here, so we think that more in line with the consensus view overall. And the one thing I would say is if these mining projects get reactivated, maybe even 1/3 of them, then the situation in Chile will change. Because you also should remember that the very high reserve margin that the market has, a lot of that's very old -- is very old coal plants and other ones that are not efficient. So we think that that's reasonable. And that any way the market moves, though, I think that we're in a very good position having that existing thermal and hydro base to combine it with renewables to be able to offer more secure load-following supply."

And the Philippine market will change as what you have today is basically a lot of gas plants that are using domestic gas, which are basically first to be dispatched so they're sort of base load. When these contracts burn off in the next couple years, they go to mid-merit. And quite frankly, they may have to search for new sources of gas. So given that, this plant will be very well positioned. And basically, I think that perhaps where you're going is that the new contracts we're signing for 10- and 20-year PPAs are at the same -- similar prices, and we basically have an extension on the existing Masinloc at the same price with the off-taker.

We have to go to 4, low 4s, depending upon our business mix and the stability of the business. I don't think it would materially change our business or our financing strategy. I will say that we've done and will continue to do a lot to look ahead and refinance, take advantage of market windows, be it at the parent or really all throughout our subs, be it project finances or subsidiary finances that would be bundles. The one thing I'd say is that we'd probably look to do bundles more than one-off deals where we can. And it still fits with the strategy, so we're doing that in some places. We've got an expansion right now in the Dominican Republic of about $250 million to close the cycle, make a project about 1/3 more efficient on its gas usage, and that's being done. It's basically being bundled with our Andres plant. That's a very efficient plant. So we're bundling those 2 together. So it means we don't put in equity. We basically use the equity value of the -- of Andres to bundle that and alleviate equity requirements and the new -- and also, just upgrade the credit package. We're doing the same thing in the Philippines, where the new Masinloc is part of the credit package of the Philippines. So we'll look to do more of that. And I think especially as we go and look at some smaller renewables, we're doing some smaller renewables in the U.S. This year, we'll do about almost 100, and those are things that you really do bundled financing as opposed to project by project."

And it's a technology that has many applications. I mean, it has applications for capacity release. Those were some of our first project, ancillary services. And you're right, sort of substituting peaking plants, where you have a lot of renewables. That's our big project in California. But it also has applications in the T&D business in terms of transmission -- alleviating transmission constraints. Now part of the lithium ion battery energy storage solutions -- batteries are one component. So we've seen over the last 5 years battery prices drop by 65%. There's no technical reason you couldn't make it an 8-hour if you wanted to. It's just a question you got to put on more batteries and it becomes more expensive. So we expect battery prices to continue to drop because these are the same batteries you use in electric vehicles. So as that becomes mass-ified, it should drop continually. So we're projecting a continued drop in those prices. So the duration is really a function of your battery price. So we are seeing that it's -- in many places, the applications are more sort of in the 2- to 4-hour today at today's battery prices, but you could extend those for longer. And I think that, again, we're seeing a very rapid growth of demand. And again, this year alone, we've already closed $70 million in gross revenues from sales to third parties; that is sales to other people to apply in on our grid. So I'm certain that this will continue to grow very quickly. I'm also certain that prices will drop. And what we're really trying to see is our sort of two-prong approach, where we put our Advancion product on our own platforms and use them to enhance our renewables or even enhance our thermal plant and selling it to third parties. Now the third-party sales, we're using channel partners who have sales forces. And finally, I would say that the combination of the 2, what are we driving at? We want to be the low-cost provider and also, quite frankly, the best provider of this service. So third-party sales helps lower the costs to us."
