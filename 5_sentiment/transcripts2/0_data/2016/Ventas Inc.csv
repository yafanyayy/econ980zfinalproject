Good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants, and welcome to the Ventas year-end 2015 earnings call. I'm delighted to be joined this morning by my Ventas colleagues to discuss our exciting and productive year, highlight",1335,"Thank you, Ryan. Good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants, and welcome to the Ventas year-end 2015 earnings call. I'm delighted to be joined this morning by my Ventas colleagues to discuss our exciting and productive year, highlight the innovative and strategic transactions of 2015 and discuss our outlook for 2016. 
The Ventas advantage of superior properties, people and platforms has enabled us to consistently deliver outstanding results through multiple cycles for almost 2 decades. That is what distinguishes us. Over the years, we have demonstrated excellence through clear commitment to our shareholders, dedication to our customers and partners and engagement of our skilled interdisciplinary team. Ventas has a long track record of delivering superior FFO and dividend growth. We continued our outperformance in 2015 with 9% comparable normalized FFO per share growth and a 10% dividend increase, inclusive of CCP. Our excellent and diversified portfolio generated industry-leading same-store growth during the year, and we ended 2015 with a strong balance sheet and $2.2 billion of liquidity.
During my 17 years at Ventas, we have seen a lot of changes in our markets, and we've become the leading provider of capital to high-quality healthcare and senior housing companies. We've navigated successfully through multiple economic, capital markets and reimbursement cycles and have continued to grow with strength and integrity. We haven't gotten everything right, to be sure, but we've been consistently early and opportunistic relative to the 5 asset classes where we do business.
In 2015, we were once again at the forefront. Our experienced team really stepped up to complete several important and complex transactions that significantly improved Ventas and showed our continued ability to stay ahead of the curve in healthcare real estate, which we strongly believe is an attractive place to be for investors. Key accomplishments of the year included our strategic disposition of nearly $5 billion in assets, including over $4 billion of skilled nursing facilities through our innovative tax-efficient spinoff of Care Capital Properties, and completion of over $5 billion in accretive acquisitions, including our successful beachhead investment in the large attractive hospital space with Ardent, a top 10 provider of care. These successful transactions have reshaped our enterprise, provided additional channels for growth, improved the quality of our portfolio and enhanced the reliability of our cash flows.
[indiscernible] specifics, our balanced and diversified portfolio generates industry-leading 83% of our NOI from private pay sources, principally medical office buildings and senior housing communities. Our partners are the best in the business. Post spin, over 80% of our NOI comes from top operators in each sector who have scale, a sound capital structure and operational excellence. We have a nice balance in our portfolio among operating businesses and triple-net leases. And none of our tenants represents more than 10% of our NOI. 
Importantly, Ventas now generates only 4% of our NOI from our 53 owned skilled nursing assets. Most of our postacute facility rent comes from Kindred, our largest tenant. All of our postacute facilities produce excellent 2x property level cash flow to rent coverage, and our rents are guaranteed. Kindred has become the nation's leader in postacute care with a well-developed strategy, strong balance sheet and diversified business model. 
Our entry into the hospital space in 2015 was also a significant example of our ability to capitalize early on trends in healthcare and create high-quality platforms for future growth. We invested $1.3 billion in Ardent's extensive network of real estate sites in 3 key markets. As we demonstrated during our Investor Day, we think it's smart business to align with leading hospital providers who have always been at the top of the food chain in healthcare services and are increasingly influential in the delivery of care and the distribution of dollars in our rapidly evolving healthcare system. 
Ardent provides both inpatient and outpatient care throughout its most multiple access points in its market, and it just completed a strong year where same-store revenues, adjusted admissions and ER visits showed solid growth. Our investment in Ardent was expertly executed and structured with outstanding property EBITDARM to rent coverage and low leverage at the operating company. It was also very timely. We are seeing significant deal flow and actively working with our partners at EGI and Ardent to consolidate and grow. 
While the spinoff of CCP in our Ardent investment have rightly received a lot of attention, I also want to highlight our senior housing portfolio and our commitment to that important sector. Atria had another outstanding year, and we thank John Moore and his team for their significant contributions to Ventas' success. I'm really glad you had a chance to see Atria's excellence during our Investor Day. Senior living is an incredible space, its potential is only beginning to be realized. Despite the ebbs and flows of supply cycles, we own an outstanding portfolio of SHOP communities in advantage markets and high-quality triple-net lease assets. We believe deeply in the value proposition of senior housing. As an industry, we have tremendous opportunity to advocate the benefits of communal living to our residents and their families. Growth in the senior population will provide undeniable tailwinds and increasing demand for our communities. And a mere 1 percentage point increase in the seniors who choose to live in senior housing community would create powerful new incremental demand, enough to fill all the currently vacant senior housing units in the nation.
We continued to invest in our properties during 2015 to fuel future growth, through increased capital allocation to selective, high-quality, ground-up developments and redevelopments. We committed over $200 million to ground-up development projects, including a trophy medical office building in downtown San Francisco connected to Sutter Health newly constructed flagship $2 billion hospital as well as 2 luxury senior housing communities in Palm Beach County and San Francisco. On the redevelopment front, in 2015 we committed to approximately $150 million in SHOP and triple-net redevelopment projects. These investments should provide attractive risk-adjusted returns, improve the quality of our properties and help our customers maintain and expand their market share.
We also allocated a portion of our strong cash flow to our shareholders through our cash dividend, which has always been and will continue to be an important component of the value proposition we offer our shareholders. Ventas has one of the best dividend growth records in the REIT industry and, with the projected 70% FFO dividend payout ratio, we are well-positioned to continue growing our dividend into the future. 
That's a good segue to our 2016 outlook. Our expectations for the macro economic environment are tempered. We believe the U.S. economy will remain in a low growth, low interest rate and low inflation mode. Our segments should, once again, prove resilient because of the inelasticity of demand, the rapid aging of our population and the need-based nature of healthcare services. 
In that context, we are happy to provide 2016 normalized FFO guidance representing 3% to 5% growth per share on a comparable basis, which assumes the CCP spinoff occurred at 1/1 of '14. In 2016, we intend again to drive excellent consistent results by focusing on operational excellence and continued portfolio optimization in our senior housing operating and medical office building businesses, building on our advantage platforms, including hospitals and Atria, recycling capital through value-creating dispositions, making attractive accretive new investments, including improving our properties through development and redevelopment; providing innovative capital solutions to leading healthcare and senior housing providers in a dynamic market; and harnessing the potential empower of our outstanding and cohesive team at Ventas.
That Ventas team has delivered superior consistent results for investors and customers for almost 2 decades. We have the properties, the people and the platforms to continue leading our sector. I want to thank our investors for having continued faith and trust in us. You are in safe and sure hands. 
Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Bob Probst who is hosting his second year-end call as the CFO of Ventas. Bob?"
398549,323124229,932915,"Ventas, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2016",2016-02-12,"Earnings Calls","Ventas, Inc.","Executives","Think you, Debbie. I am pleased to report an outstanding year of growth for our portfolio of nearly 1,300 diversified senior housing, medical office, postacute and general acute care hospital properties. Our overall same-store cash NOI for the portfolio g",1971,"Think you, Debbie. I am pleased to report an outstanding year of growth for our portfolio of nearly 1,300 diversified senior housing, medical office, postacute and general acute care hospital properties. Our overall same-store cash NOI for the portfolio grew an impressive 3.8% for the year, right in line with our 3.5% to 4% full company same-store guidance range. Our triple-net business led all segments by growing same-store 5.8% in 2015, with SHOP full year results in line with our 2% to 3% guidance and MOBs up 2% year-over-year. 
For 2016, we expect our same-store cash NOI to grow in the range of 1.5% to 3% for the overall portfolio. 
Let me detail our 2015 performance and our 2016 outlook at a segment level, starting with SHOP. Our same-store SHOP portfolio increased 2.3% for the full year 2015 over 2014. For the fourth quarter of '15, SHOP same-store cash NOI increased 1.1%. These results were in line with our expectations for the fourth quarter. As expected, same store occupancy in Q4 trended modestly higher and strong rate growth held, together driving 3% revenue growth. Adjusting for approximately $1.7 million of nonrecurring items in the fourth quarter of 2014, same-store NOI for the fourth quarter 2015 grew 2.4% versus prior year.
As seen throughout 2015, our NOI performance in the fourth quarter was led by continued strong growth across many of our high barrier to entry infill locations. Key markets such as New York, Los Angeles and Boston grew organic NOI more than 6% in the quarter. Double-digit NOI growth in tertiary markets also continued in the quarter as a result of productive development and redevelopment activity. SHOP performance in Canada in the fourth quarter, the first quarter in which the 29 assets acquired from Holiday in 2014 are included in same-store, showed an expected modest decline. During the year, Atria accelerated the transition of these assets to its operating model in order to position them for future growth.
Q4 performance was affected by new supply coming online within our relevant trade area in a number of markets. Notably, Houston, Chicago and Sacramento saw NOI declines in the quarter driven principally by occupancy pressure. As a reminder, last quarter, we introduced a more refined supply methodology, which identifies new buildings under construction within the relevant 7-mile and 3-mile trade areas around our assets based on population density. On that basis, and using the fourth quarter NIC data, more than 70% of our SHOP portfolio NOI comes from markets that are in supply equilibrium or better. The 30% of the SHOP portfolio NOI that is exposed to a potential new supply surplus represents less than 10% of Ventas total NOI. Remember that our methodology assumes 3% absorption and is arguably conservative as it assumes that all new supply within the relevant trade area is competitive regardless of care model, price point, et cetera.
Using this methodology, construction as a percentage of inventory across our SHOP portfolio stands at 4.5% in Q4, a 40 basis point increase from Q3, principally driven by markets such as Atlanta, Sacramento and Denver. Against this backdrop, Ventas and our focus leading SHOP operators are working to drive operational excellence to gain share and grow even in the context of new supply. Our largest operator, Atria, continue to drive strong results in Q4 and for 2015 overall. These results are a testament to the operational excellence demonstrated at our Investor Day November at Atria's headquarters.
Now let's turn to our guidance and key assumptions for our SHOP business. In 2016, we project SHOP same-store NOI to grow in the range of 1% to 3%. This outlook assumes that our core engines of growth, namely the 70% of our SHOP portfolio insulated from supply, will continue to grow NOI at a mid-single-digit rate in 2016. This growth will be partially offset by assets in the markets where we anticipate increased supply challenges.
As we begin the year, we are pleased with the mid-single-digit annual rental rate increases that took effect January 1, 2016. These increases appear to be holding up well, thus demonstrating the value proposition of our communities and our operators. In fact our SHOP operators have some exciting plans in place in 2016 to compete and thrive in the market to retain their great teams and to deliver value to seniors and their families.
Next I'll cover our triple-net lease portfolio, which accounts for 44% of our NOI. The 507 same-store properties within this portfolio, comprised of senior housing and postacute assets, delivered accelerated growth, increasing 5.8% in 2015 versus 2014. As we mentioned in previous calls, triple-net's 2015 performance benefited from the $15 million rent increase for the Kindred assets, where we increased rent to market levels in October 2014, as well as other income items. Even after adjusting for these items, full year same-store NOI in the triple-net portfolio grew 3.2%, above historical trend, in confirmation of the positive growth impact of the CCP spin. In the fourth quarter, triple-net same-store cash NOI grew 2.9%, reflecting customer rent escalations as well as the cycling of the Kindred increase in Q4 of 2014. Trailing 12-month cash flow coverage in our same-store triple-net lease portfolio for the third quarter of 2015, the latest available information, was solid at 1.5x. As Debbie mentioned, our postacute coverage is a strong 2x. Although we had a 10 basis point compression due to the combination of the aforementioned Kindred rent increase and lower third quarter performance. Coverage in our triple-net senior housing portfolio remains solid at 1.3x. Occupancy is up 50 basis points sequentially and operator EBITDARM and rate are higher year-over-year.
For 2016, we expect our triple-net portfolio to grow in the range of 2% to 3%. Consistent with our practice, we have not included in our 2016 triple-net projections speculative fees, which have the effect of lowering the growth rate in our '16 outlook. 
Let me close out the segment review with our leading MOB business, which represents 20% of Ventas' overall NOI. Our Lillibridge business posted full year NOI in the total consolidated portfolio of 364 properties of $381 million in 2015, an increase of 33% over 2014. Performance was driven by the addition of 83 properties from the HCT acquisition in January. Occupancy in the total portfolio in 2015 was up 40 basis points to 92.3%, and margins increased by an exceptional 330 basis points, reflecting the quality of the properties we acquired as well as the cost synergy arising from leveraging the Lillibridge platform. In the 268 properties in the same-store portfolio, full year 2015 cash NOI grew a solid 2%. Occupancy declined modestly in 2015 versus 2014. Revenue grew slightly as a result of a roughly 2% increase in rental rate, and NOI margins improved 40 basis points on the heels of cost productivity initiatives. 
In the fourth quarter, MOB same-store cash NOI was stable versus 2014. Rate growth in the quarter remained solid at 2% versus prior year, while expense growth outpaced revenue growth due to unexpected R&M cost increases.
We forecast our MOB same-store segment to continue to provide steady growth in the 1% to 2% range in 2016. This guidance assumes modest occupancy in rate growth and continued cost productivity. In 2016, our MOB team is actively working on driving occupancy gains, enhancing our portfolio of quality further through asset disposition and commencing on significant potential redevelopment opportunities stemming from our well-located portfolio.
Turning now to our financial results for Ventas. As a quick note, I will frequently refer to our results on a comparable basis, which adjusts all current and prior periods for the effects of the spinoff as if the spinoff was completed January 1, 2014. This is best practice for spin situations and is intended to give investors a true like-for-like reflection of our performance. Please note that adjusting for the spinoff, comparable normalized FFO per share was $3.95 in 2015 and $3.64 in 2014. Details of both our reported and comparable FFO per share are set forth on Page 25 of our Q4 supplemental.
Turning to Ventas' outstanding financial results overall for the full year 2015. Full year 2015 normalized FFO on a reported basis totaled $4.47 per fully diluted share, topping our most recent full year FFO guidance range of $4.43 to $4.46 per share. On a comparable basis, full year 2015 normalized FFO per share of $3.95 represents 9% growth over 2014. This strong year-over-year growth was driven by outstanding same-store NOI growth of 3.8%, together with over $5 billion in new investments in the year, including our beachhead investment in the U.S. acute-care space with Ardent. We also invested $232 million in CapEx during 2015, inclusive of high-return redevelopments and development investments. 
To fund these investments, we recycled capital and enhanced our portfolio via over $700 million of asset sales and loan repayments, ahead of our original guidance of $600 million. We also issued and sold $7.2 million of shares of common stock for approximately $500 million under the ATM. Nearly 80% of this ATM's issuance was pre-spin at a gross price of $72.94, while the remaining 20% was issued post spin at an average gross price of $54.87. 
In 2015, we continued our track record of strong cash flow generation, delivering a record $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the year. With our strong cash flow, we paid attractive cash dividends to shareholders totaling $3.04 per share, including a 10% increase when combined with CCP.
The company's liquidity profile was solid at year end, including exceptional fixed charge coverage of 4.5x, net debt to adjusted pro forma EBITDA of 6.1x, a weighted average maturity approximating 7 years and debt-to-total capitalization of 37%. 
In the fourth quarter, Ventas delivered normalized FFO of $346 million or $1.03 per fully diluted share. On a comparable basis, normalized FFO per share grew 7% in Q4 2015 over prior year. In the fourth quarter, the company acquired $93 million in high-quality MOBs. Ventas also committed to funding approximately $240 million in new development and redevelopment activity.
To fund investments, we raised $167 million under our ATM program during and after the fourth quarter, issuing 3 million shares at an average price of $55.42 per share before underwriter discount. We also continued to recycle capital via asset dispositions in senior housing and MOB assets, generating proceeds of $105 million in Q4 '15 and $61 million thus far in Q1 '16.
Before we take questions, I want to share a summary of our outlook for 2016. Our expectation as we begin the year is to deliver normalized FFO per share in the range of $4.07 to $4.15. This range represents a comparable normalized FFO per share growth rate of 3% to 5% over 2015. As highlighted earlier, we project total company same-store 2016 cash NOI growth to range from 1.5% to 3%. 
During 2016, we intend to continue to improve the company through intelligent value-creating dispositions and deliberate balance sheet strengthening. Our guidance assumes 2016 asset dispositions of approximately $500 million using a midyear estimate of completion. We intend to use the net proceeds to reinvest in about $350 million of new acquisitions, generating immediate cash returns, and to fund our accelerating development redevelopment program, which will generate growth and returns in future years.  
We have assumed no additional material acquisitions, dispositions or capital activity in our guidance. Through application of operating cash flow and asset sale proceeds to both new investments and debt reduction, we project the reduction in leverage in 2016 to below 6x net debt to EBITDA.
So in summary, the entire Ventas team is proud of the excellent results we delivered in 2015, and we are excited to sustain that excellence in 2016. With that, I will ask the operator to please open the line for questions."

Let me start with the fourth quarter and characterize the nonrecurring expenses, where they hit, they were about $1.7 million. That takes when you adjust for those the NOI growth from 1.1% to about 2.4% same-store for the quarter, so pretty much in line quarter and year if you look at it that way. And these nonrecurring tend to normalize over the course of the year, so I think that's a reasonable way to view the year overall. The margin and expense versus revenue profile in the fourth quarter to note reflects that onetime type benefit in 2014. So when you align for those, the margins are really in line, expense were in line with revenue throughout the fourth quarter. As we think about '16 and how we model '16, overall on a blended basis, I highlighted a 1% to 3% outlook for SHOP overall. Really has 2 building blocks to that and really important to highlight those. The first is we call it the 70% engine room of growth, the markets like New York, Los Angeles, the coastal markets in which we have a strong hold, we think those markets are going to grow mid single digits, so that's a continuation of the momentum we've seen in those markets in 2015. That will be partially offset by call it 30%. That is the list of markets which may be affected by supply challenges. And really, to think about what those challenges might be, it's hard to model exactly because it could be a function of occupancy, it could be a function of rate, even a potential expense impact. But overall, we think that on a blended basis, that performance for that 30% will bring down the overall average, so partially offset the strength and momentum we see in the 70%. Therefore, overall, coming back to your 1% to 3% growth overall, showing the benefit of the great portfolio, which we think we have. So within that, I can't give more assumptions, but that's sort of the overall flavor for '16."

That meets my hurdle for ground-up development. In terms of senior housing development, ground-up, we've got only 2 projects underway, very good market areas in Palm Beach County and San Francisco. And there, where you are looking at different cycles and economies and so on, we are a partial owner and have brought in third-party pension fund capital as a partner to kind of spread the risk and narrow that. We think those projects will be very successful. Atria is going to manage them. They have good developers. But again, the typical Ventas go with opportunities but also make sure you're managing risks. So those are our 3 ground-up developments, and I think you'll see us continue to be highly selective in those. On redevelopment, we think there are good opportunities. We have been allocating more capital. And those, as we've said, provide good risk-adjusted return."

Good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. And welcome to the Ventas year end 2015 earnings call. I'm delighted to be joined this morning by my Ventas colleagues to discuss our exciting and productive year, highlight",1337,"Thank you, Ryan. Good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. And welcome to the Ventas year end 2015 earnings call. I'm delighted to be joined this morning by my Ventas colleagues to discuss our exciting and productive year, highlight the innovative and strategic transactions of 2015 and discuss our outlook for 2016. 
The Ventas advantage of superior properties, people and platforms has enabled us to consistently deliver outstanding results through multiple cycles for almost 2 decades. That is what distinguishes us. Over the years, we have demonstrated excellence through clear commitment to our shareholders, dedication to our customers and partners and engagement of our skilled interdisciplinary team. Ventas has a long track record of delivering superior FFO and dividend growth. We continued our outperformance in 2015 with 9% comparable normalized FFO per share growth and a 10% dividend increase, inclusive of CCP. Our excellent and diversified portfolio generated industry-leading same-store growth during the year, and we ended 2015 with a strong balance sheet and $2.2 billion of liquidity.
During my 17 years at Ventas, we have seen a lot of changes in our markets. And we've become the leading provider of capital to high-quality healthcare and senior housing companies. We've navigated successfully through multiple economic, capital markets and reimbursement cycles and have continued to grow with strength and integrity. We haven't gotten everything right to be sure, but we've been consistently early and opportunistic relative to the 5 asset classes where we do business.
In 2015, we were once again at the forefront. Our experienced team really stepped up to complete several important and complex transactions that significantly improved Ventas and showed our continued ability to stay ahead of the curve in healthcare real estate, which we strongly believe is an attractive place to be for investors. Key accomplishments of the year included our strategic disposition of nearly $5 billion in assets, including over $4 billion of skilled nursing facilities through our innovative tax-efficient spinoff of Care Capital Properties, and completion of over $5 billion in accretive acquisitions, including our successful beachhead investment in the large attractive hospital space with Ardent, a top 10 provider of care. These successful transactions have reshaped our enterprise, provided additional channels for growth, improved the quality of our portfolio and enhanced the reliability of our cash flows.
The site specifics, our balanced and diversified portfolio generates industry-leading 83% of our NOI from private-pay sources, principally medical office buildings and senior housing communities. Our partners are the best in the business. Postspin, over 80% of our NOI comes from top operators in each sector who have scale, a sound capital structure and operational excellence. We have a nice balance in our portfolio among operating businesses and triple-net leases. And none of our tenants represents more than 10% of our NOI. 
Importantly, Ventas now generates only 4% of our NOI from our 53 owned skilled nursing assets. Most of our postacute facility rent comes from Kindred, our largest tenant. All of our postacute facilities produce excellent 2x property level cash flow to rent coverage. And our rents are guaranteed. Kindred has become the nation's leader in postacute care with a well-developed strategy, strong balance sheet and diversified business model. 
Our entry into the hospital space in 2015 was also a significant example of our ability to capitalize early on trends in healthcare and create high-quality platforms for future growth. We invested $1.3 billion in Ardent's extensive network of real estate sites in 3 key markets. As we demonstrated during our Investor Day, we think it's smart business to align with leading hospital providers who have always been at the top of the food chain in healthcare services and are increasingly influential in the delivery of care and the distribution of dollars in our rapidly evolving healthcare system. 
Ardent provides both inpatient and outpatient care throughout its multiple access points in its market. And it just completed a strong year where same-store revenues, adjusted admissions and ER visits showed solid growth. Our investment in Ardent was expertly executed and structured with outstanding property EBITDARM to rent coverage and low leverage at the operating company. It was also very timely. We are seeing significant deal flow and actively working with our partners at EGI and Ardent to consolidate and grow. 
While the spinoff of CCP in our Ardent investment have rightly received a lot of attention, I also want to highlight our senior housing portfolio and our commitment to that important sector. Atria had another outstanding year, and we thank John Moore and his team for their significant contributions to Ventas' success. I'm really glad you had a chance to see Atria's excellence during our Investor Day. 
Senior living is an incredible space, its potential is only beginning to be realized. Despite the ebbs and flows of supply cycles, we own an outstanding portfolio of SHOP communities in advantage markets and high quality triple-net lease assets. We believe deeply in the value proposition of senior housing. As an industry, we have tremendous opportunity to advocate the benefits of communal living to our residents and their families. Growth in the senior population will provide undeniable tailwinds and increasing demand for our communities. And a mere 1 percentage point increase in the seniors who choose to live in senior housing community would create powerful new incremental demand, enough to fill all the currently vacant senior housing units in the nation.
We continue to invest in our properties during 2015 to fuel future growth, through increased capital allocation to selective high quality, ground-up developments and redevelopments. We committed over $200 million to ground-up development projects, including a trophy medical office building in downtown San Francisco connected to Sutter Health newly constructed flagship $2 billion hospital as well as 2 luxury senior housing communities in Palm Beach County and San Francisco. On the redevelopment front in 2015, we committed to approximately $150 million in SHOP and triple-net redevelopment projects. These investments should provide attractive risk-adjusted returns, improve the quality of our properties and help our customers maintain and expand their market share.
We also allocated a portion of our strong cash flow to our shareholders through our cash dividend, which has always been and will continue to be an important component of the value proposition we offer our shareholders. Ventas has one of the best dividend growth records in the REIT industry. And with the projected 70% FFO dividend payout ratio, we are well-positioned to continue growing our dividend into the future. 
That's a good segue to our 2016 outlook. Our expectations for the macro economic environment are tempered. We believe the U.S. economy will remain in a low growth, low interest rate and low inflation mode. Our segments should, once again, prove resilient because of the inelasticity of demand, the rapid aging of our population and the need-based nature of healthcare services. 
In that context, we are happy to provide 2016 normalized FFO guidance representing 3% to 5% growth per share on a comparable basis, which assumes the CCP spinoff occurred at 1/1 of '14. In 2016, we intend again to drive excellent consistent results by focusing on operational excellence and continued portfolio optimization in our senior housing operating and medical office building businesses; building on our advantage platforms, including hospitals and Atria; recycling capital through value-creating dispositions; making attractive accretive new investments, including improving our properties through development and redevelopment; providing innovative capital solutions to leading healthcare and senior housing providers in a dynamic market; and harnessing the potential empower of our outstanding and cohesive team at Ventas.
That Ventas team has delivered superior consistent results for investors and customers for almost 2 decades. We have the properties, the people and the platforms to continue leading our sector. I want to thank our investors for having continued faith and trust in us. You are in safe and sure hands. 
Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Bob Probst, who is hosting his second year end call as the CFO of Ventas. Bob?"
398549,323124229,933082,"Ventas, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2016",2016-02-12,"Earnings Calls","Ventas, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Debbie. I am pleased to report an outstanding year of growth for our portfolio of nearly 1,300 diversified senior housing, medical office, postacute and general acute care hospital properties. Our overall same-store cash NOI for the portfolio",1970,"Thank you, Debbie. I am pleased to report an outstanding year of growth for our portfolio of nearly 1,300 diversified senior housing, medical office, postacute and general acute care hospital properties. 
Our overall same-store cash NOI for the portfolio grew an impressive 3.8% for the year, right in line with our 3.5% to 4% full company same-store guidance range. Our triple-net business led all segments by growing same-store 5.8% in 2015, with SHOP full year results in line with our 2% to 3% guidance and MOBs up 2% year-over-year. For 2016, we expect our same-store cash NOI to grow in the range of 1.5% to 3% for the overall portfolio. 
Let me detail our 2015 performance and our 2016 outlook at a segment level, starting with SHOP. Our same-store SHOP portfolio increased 2.3% for the full year 2015 over 2014. For the fourth quarter of '15, SHOP same-store cash NOI increased 1.1%. These results were in line with our expectations for the fourth quarter. As expected, same store occupancy in Q4 trended modestly higher and strong rate growth held, together driving 3% revenue growth. Adjusting for approximately $1.7 million of nonrecurring items in the fourth quarter of 2014, same-store NOI for the fourth quarter 2015 grew 2.4% versus prior year.
As seen throughout 2015, our NOI performance in the  quarter was led by continued strong growth across many of our high barrier-to-entry infill locations. Key markets such as New York, Los Angeles and Boston grew organic NOI more than 6% in the quarter. Double-digit NOI growth in tertiary markets also continued in the quarter as a result of productive development and redevelopment activity. SHOP performance in Canada in the fourth quarter, the first quarter in which the 29 assets acquired from Holiday in 2014 are included in same store, showed an expected modest decline. During the year, Atria accelerated the transition of these assets to its operating model in order to position them for future growth.
Q4 performance was affected by new supply coming online within our relevant trade area in a number of markets. Notably, Houston, Chicago and Sacramento saw NOI declines in the quarter driven principally by occupancy pressure. As a reminder, last quarter, we introduced a more refined supply methodology, which identifies new buildings under construction within the relevant 7-mile and 3-mile trade areas around our assets based on population density. On that basis and using the fourth quarter NIC data, more than 70% of our SHOP portfolio NOI comes from markets that are in supply equilibrium or better. The 30% of the SHOP portfolio NOI, that is exposed to a potential new supply surplus, represents less than 10% of Ventas total NOI. Remember that our methodology assumes 3% absorption and is arguably conservative as it assumes that all new supply within the relevant trade area is competitive regardless of care model, price point, et cetera.
Using this methodology, construction as a percentage of inventory across our SHOP portfolio, stands at 4.5% in Q4, a 40 basis point increase from Q3, principally driven by markets, such as Atlanta, Sacramento and Denver. Against this backdrop, Ventas and our focus leading SHOP operators are working to drive operational excellence to gain share and grow even in the context of new supply. Our largest operator, Atria, continued to drive strong results in Q4 and for 2015 overall. These results are a testament to the operational excellence demonstrated at our Investor Day November at Atria's headquarters.
Now let's turn to our guidance and key assumptions for our SHOP business. In 2016, we project SHOP same-store NOI to grow in the range of 1% to 3%. This outlook assumes that our core engines of growth, namely the 70% of our SHOP portfolio insulated from supply, will continue to grow NOI at a mid-single-digit rate in 2016. This growth will be partially offset by assets in the markets where we anticipate increased supply challenges.
As we begin the year, we are pleased with the mid-single-digit annual rental rate increases that took effect January 1, 2016. These increases appear to be holding up well, thus demonstrating the value proposition of our communities and our operators. In fact, our SHOP operators have some exciting plans in place in 2016 to compete and thrive in the market to retain their great teams and to deliver value to seniors and their families.
Next, I'll cover our triple-net lease portfolio, which accounts for 44% of our NOI. The 507 same-store properties within this portfolio, comprised of senior housing and postacute assets, delivered accelerated growth, increasing 5.8% in 2015 versus 2014. As we mentioned in previous calls, triple-net's 2015 performance benefited from the $15 million rent increase for the Kindred assets, where we increased rent to market levels in October 2014, as well as other income items. Even after adjusting for these items, full year same-store NOI in the triple-net portfolio grew 3.2%, above historical trend in confirmation of the positive growth impact of the CCP spin. In the fourth quarter, triple-net same-store cash NOI grew 2.9%, reflecting customer rent escalations as well as the cycling of the Kindred increase in Q4 of 2014. 
Trailing 12-month cash flow coverage in our same-store triple-net lease portfolio for the third quarter of 2015, the latest available information, was solid at 1.5x. As Debbie mentioned, our postacute coverage is a strong 2x. Although we had a 10 basis point compression due to the combination of the aforementioned Kindred rent increase and lower third quarter performance. Coverage in our triple-net senior housing portfolio remains solid at 1.3x. Occupancy is up 50 basis points sequentially and operator EBITDARM and rate are higher year-over-year.
For 2016, we expect our triple-net portfolio to grow in the range of 2% to 3%. Consistent with our practice, we have not included in our 2016 triple-net projections speculative fees, which has the effect of lowering the growth rate in our '16 outlook. 
Let me close out the segment review with our leading MOB business, which represents 20% of Ventas' overall NOI. Our Lillibridge business posted full year NOI in the total consolidated portfolio of 364 properties of $381 million in 2015, an increase of 33% over 2014. Performance was driven by the addition of 83 properties from the HCT acquisition in January. Occupancy in the total portfolio in 2015 was up 40 basis points to 92.3%, and margins increased by an exceptional 330 basis points, reflecting the quality of the properties we acquired as well as the cost synergy arising from leveraging the Lillibridge platform. 
In the 268 properties in the same-store portfolio, full year 2015 cash NOI grew a solid 2%. Occupancy declined modestly in 2015 versus 2014. Revenue grew slightly as a result of a roughly 2% increase in rental rate. And NOI margins improved 40 basis points on the heels of cost productivity initiatives. 
In the fourth quarter, MOB same-store cash NOI was stable versus 2014. Rate growth in the quarter remained solid at 2% versus prior year, while expense growth outpaced revenue growth due to unexpected R&M cost increases. We forecast our MOB same-store segment to continue to provide steady growth in the 1% to 2% range in 2016. This guidance assumes modest occupancy in rate growth and continued cost productivity. In 2016, our MOB team is actively working on driving occupancy gains, enhancing our portfolio of quality further through asset disposition and commencing on significant potential redevelopment opportunities stemming from our well-located portfolio.
Turning now to our financial results for Ventas. As a quick note, I will frequently refer to our results on a comparable basis, which adjusts all current and prior periods for the effects of the spinoff as if the spinoff was completed January 1, 2014. This is best practice for spin situations and is intended to get investors a true like-for-like reflection of our performance. Please note that adjusting for the spinoff, comparable normalized FFO per share was $3.95 in 2015 and $3.64 in 2014. Details of both our reported, and comparable FFO per share are set forth on Page 25 of our Q4 supplemental.
Turning to Ventas' outstanding financial results overall for the full year 2015. Full year 2015 normalized FFO on a reported basis totaled $4.47 per fully diluted share, topping our most recent full year FFO guidance range of $4.43 to $4.46 per share. On a comparable basis, full year 2015 normalized FFO per share of $3.95 represents 9% growth over 2014. This strong year-over-year growth was driven by outstanding same-store NOI growth of 3.8%, together with over $5 billion in new investments in the year, including our beachhead investment in the U.S. acute care space with Ardent. We also invested $232 million in CapEx during 2015, inclusive of high-return redevelopment and development investments. 
To fund these investments, we recycled capital and enhanced our portfolio via over $700 million of asset sales and loan repayments, ahead of our original guidance of $600 million. We also issued and sold $7.2 million of shares of common stock for approximately $500 million under the ATM. Nearly 80% of this ATM's issuance was prespin at a gross price of $72.94, while the remaining 20% was issued post spin at an average gross price of $54.87. 
In 2015, we continued our track record of strong cash flow generation, delivering a record $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the year. With our strong cash flow, we paid attractive cash dividends to shareholders totaling $3.04 per share, including a 10% increase when combined with CCP.
The company's liquidity profile was solid at year end, including exceptional fixed charge coverage of 4.5x, net debt to adjusted pro forma EBITDA of 6.1x, a weighted average maturity approximating 7 years and debt-to-total capitalization of 37%. 
In the fourth quarter, Ventas delivered normalized FFO of $346 million or $1.03 per fully diluted share. On a comparable basis, normalized FFO per share grew 7% in Q4 2015 over prior year. In the fourth quarter, the company acquired $93 million in high-quality MOBs. Ventas also committed to funding approximately $240 million in new development and redevelopment activity.
To fund investments, we raised $167 million under our ATM program during and after the fourth quarter, issuing 3 million shares at an average price of $55.42 per share before underwriter discount. We also continued to recycle capital via asset dispositions in senior housing and MOB assets, generating proceeds of $105 million in Q4 '15 and $61 million thus far in Q1 '16.
Before we take questions, I want to share a summary of our outlook for 2016. Our expectation as we begin the year is to deliver normalized FFO per share in the range of $4.07 to $4.15. This range represents a comparable normalized FFO per share growth rate of 3% to 5% over 2015. As highlighted earlier, we project total company same-store 2016 cash NOI growth to range from 1.5% to 3%. 
During 2016, we intend to continue to improve the company through intelligent value-creating dispositions and deliberate balance sheet strengthening. Our guidance assumes 2016 asset dispositions of approximately $500 million using a midyear estimate of completion. We intend to use the net proceeds to reinvest in about $350 million of new acquisitions, generating immediate cash returns, and to fund our accelerating development redevelopment program, which will generate growth and returns in future years.  
We have assumed no additional material acquisitions, dispositions or capital activity in our guidance. Through application of operating cash flow and asset sale proceeds to both new investments and debt reduction, we project the reduction in leverage in 2016 to below 6x net debt to EBITDA.
So in summary, the entire Ventas team is proud of the excellent results we delivered in 2015. And we are excited to sustain that excellence in 2016. With that, I will ask the operator to please open the line for questions."

Let me start with the fourth quarter and characterize the nonrecurring expenses where they hit. They were about $1.7 million. That takes -- when you adjust for those the NOI growth from 1.1% to about 2.4% same store for the quarter, so pretty much in line quarter and year if you look at it that way. And these nonrecurring tend to normalize over the course of the year, so I think that's a reasonable way to view the year overall. The margin and expense versus revenue profile in the fourth quarter to note reflects that onetime-type benefit in 2014. So when you align for those, the margins are really in line, expense grew in line with revenue. So that's the fourth quarter. As we think about '16 and how we model '16, overall on a blended basis, I highlighted a 1% to 3% outlook for SHOP overall. Really has 2 building blocks to that and really important to highlight those. The first is, we call it, the 70% engine room of growth, the markets like New York, Los Angeles, the coastal markets in which we have a strong hold, we think those markets are going to grow mid single digits. So that's a continuation of the momentum we've seen in those markets in 2015. That will be partially offset by, call it, 30%. That is the list of markets which may be affected by supply challenges. And really, to think about what those challenges might be, it's hard to model exactly because it could be a function of occupancy. It could be a function of rate, even a potential expense impact. But overall, we think that on a blended basis, that performance for that 30% will bring down the overall average, so partially offset the strength and momentum we see in the 70%. Therefore, overall, coming back to your 1% to 3% growth overall, showing the benefit of the great portfolio, which we think we have. So within that, I can give more assumptions, but that's sort of the overall flavor for '16."

The key for us is really to drive the operational excellence, I'll come back to that, that theme, to really win and grow in those markets.

And we certainly are in a dynamic policy environment now. And we think Ardent has the right characteristics to be able to manage through that. Ardent has. . . yes, okay.

That meets my hurdle for ground-up development. In terms of senior housing development, ground-up, we've got only 2 projects underway, very good market areas in Palm Beach County and San Francisco. And there, where you are looking at different cycles and economies and so on, we are a partial owner and have brought in third-party pension fund capital as a partner to kind of spread the risk and narrow that. We think those projects will be very successful. Atria is going to manage them. They have good developers. But again, the typical Ventas go with opportunities, but also make sure you're managing risks. So those are our 3 ground-up developments.

Good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. And welcome to the Ventas year end 2015 earnings call. I'm delighted to be joined this morning by my Ventas colleagues to discuss our exciting and productive year, highlight",1342,"Thank you, Ryan. Good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. And welcome to the Ventas year end 2015 earnings call. I'm delighted to be joined this morning by my Ventas colleagues to discuss our exciting and productive year, highlight the innovative and strategic transactions of 2015 and discuss our outlook for 2016. 
The Ventas advantage of superior properties, people and platforms has enabled us to consistently deliver outstanding results through multiple cycles for almost 2 decades. That is what distinguishes us. Over the years, we have demonstrated excellence through clear commitment to our shareholders, dedication to our customers and partners and engagement of our skilled interdisciplinary team. Ventas has a long track record of delivering superior FFO and dividend growth. We continued our outperformance in 2015 with 9% comparable normalized FFO per share growth and a 10% dividend increase, inclusive of CCP. Our excellent and diversified portfolio generated industry-leading same-store growth during the year, and we ended 2015 with a strong balance sheet and $2.2 billion of liquidity.
During my 17 years at Ventas, we have seen a lot of changes in our markets. And we've become the leading provider of capital to high-quality healthcare and senior housing companies. We've navigated successfully through multiple economic, capital markets and reimbursement cycles and have continued to grow with strength and integrity. We haven't gotten everything right to be sure, but we've been consistently early and opportunistic relative to the 5 asset classes where we do business.
In 2015, we were once again at the forefront. Our experienced team really stepped up to complete several important and complex transactions that significantly improved Ventas and showed our continued ability to stay ahead of the curve in healthcare real estate, which we strongly believe is an attractive place to be for investors. Key accomplishments of the year included our strategic disposition of nearly $5 billion in assets, including over $4 billion of skilled nursing facilities through our innovative tax-efficient spinoff of Care Capital Properties, and completion of over $5 billion in accretive acquisitions, including our successful beachhead investment in the large attractive hospital space with Ardent, a top 10 provider of care. These successful transactions have reshaped our enterprise, provided additional channels for growth, improved the quality of our portfolio and enhanced the reliability of our cash flows.
To cite specifics, our balanced and diversified portfolio generates industry-leading 83% of our NOI from private-pay sources, principally medical office buildings and senior housing communities. Our partners are the best in the business. Post-spin, over 80% of our NOI comes from top operators in each sector who have scale, a sound capital structure and operational excellence. We have a nice balance in our portfolio among operating businesses and triple-net leases. And none of our tenants represents more than 10% of our NOI. 
Importantly, Ventas now generates only 4% of our NOI from our 53 owned skilled nursing assets. Most of our post acute facility rent comes from Kindred, our largest tenant. All of our post acute facilities produce excellent 2x property level cash flow to rent coverage and our rents are guaranteed. Kindred has become the nation's leader in post acute care with a well-developed strategy, strong balance sheet and diversified business model. 
Our entry into the hospital space in 2015 was also a significant example of our ability to capitalize early on trends in healthcare and create high-quality platforms for future growth. We invested $1.3 billion in Ardent's extensive network of real estate sites in 3 key markets. As we demonstrated during our Investor Day, we think it's smart business to align with leading hospital providers who have always been at the top of the food chain in healthcare services and are increasingly influential in the delivery of care and the distribution of dollars in our rapidly evolving healthcare system. 
Ardent provides both inpatient and outpatient care throughout its multiple access points in its markets. And it just completed a strong year where same-store revenues, adjusted admissions and ER visits showed solid growth. Our investment in Ardent was expertly executed and structured, with outstanding property EBITDARM to rent coverage and low leverage at the operating company. It was also very timely. We are seeing significant deal flow and actively working with our partners at EGI and Ardent to consolidate and grow. 
While the spinoff of CCP in our Ardent investment have rightly received a lot of attention, I also want to highlight our senior housing portfolio and our commitment to that important sector. Atria had another outstanding year, and we thank John Moore and his team for their significant contributions to Ventas' success. I'm really glad you had a chance to see Atria's excellence during our Investor Day. 
Senior living is an incredible space, its potential is only beginning to be realized. Despite the ebbs and flows of supply cycles, we own an outstanding portfolio of SHOP communities in advantaged markets and high quality triple-net lease assets. We believe deeply in the value proposition of senior housing. As an industry, we have tremendous opportunity to advocate the benefits of communal living to our residents and their families. Growth in the senior population will provide undeniable tailwinds and increasing demand for our communities. And a mere 1 percentage point increase in the seniors who choose to live in senior housing communities would create powerful new incremental demand, enough to fill all the currently vacant senior housing units in the nation.
We continue to invest in our properties during 2015 to fuel future growth, through increased capital allocation to selective, high quality, ground-up developments and redevelopments. We committed over $200 million to ground-up development projects, including a trophy medical office building in downtown San Francisco connected to Sutter Health's newly constructed flagship $2 billion hospital, as well as 2 luxury senior housing communities in Palm Beach County and San Francisco. On the redevelopment front in 2015, we committed to approximately $150 million in SHOP and triple-net redevelopment projects. These investments should provide attractive risk-adjusted returns, improve the quality of our properties and help our customers maintain and expand their market share.
We also allocated a portion of our strong cash flow to our shareholders through our cash dividend, which has always been and will continue to be an important component of the value proposition we offer our shareholders. Ventas has one of the best dividend growth records in the REIT industry and with a projected 70% FFO dividend payout ratio, we are well positioned to continue growing our dividend into the future. 
That's a good segue to our 2016 outlook. Our expectations for the macro economic environment are tempered. We believe the U.S. economy will remain in a low growth, low interest rate and low inflation mode. Our segments should, once again, prove resilient because of the inelasticity of demand, the rapid aging of our population and the need-based nature of healthcare services. 
In that context, we are happy to provide 2016 normalized FFO guidance representing 3% to 5% growth per share on a comparable basis, which assumes the CCP spinoff occurred at 1/1 of '14. In 2016, we intend again to drive excellent consistent results by focusing on operational excellence and continued portfolio optimization in our senior housing operating and medical office building businesses; building on our advantage platforms, including hospitals and Atria; recycling capital through value-creating dispositions; making attractive accretive new investments, including improving our properties through development and redevelopment; providing innovative capital solutions to leading healthcare and senior housing providers in a dynamic market; and harnessing the potential and power of our outstanding and cohesive team at Ventas.
That Ventas team has delivered superior consistent results for investors and customers for almost 2 decades. We have the properties, the people and the platforms to continue leading our sector. I want to thank our investors for having continued faith and trust in us. You are in safe and sure hands. 
Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Bob Probst, who is hosting his second year end call as the CFO of Ventas. Bob?"
398549,323124229,933165,"Ventas, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 12, 2016",2016-02-12,"Earnings Calls","Ventas, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Debbie. I am pleased to report an outstanding year of growth for our portfolio of nearly 1,300 diversified senior housing, medical office, post acute and general acute care hospital properties. Our overall same-store cash NOI for the portfoli",1974,"Thank you, Debbie. I am pleased to report an outstanding year of growth for our portfolio of nearly 1,300 diversified senior housing, medical office, post acute and general acute care hospital properties. 
Our overall same-store cash NOI for the portfolio grew an impressive 3.8% for the year, right in line with our 3.5% to 4% full company same-store guidance range. Our triple-net business led all segments by growing same-store 5.8% in 2015, with SHOP full year results in line with our 2% to 3% guidance and MOBs up 2% year-over-year. For 2016, we expect our same-store cash NOI to grow in the range of 1.5% to 3% for the overall portfolio. 
Let me detail our 2015 performance and our 2016 outlook at a segment level, starting with SHOP. Our same-store SHOP portfolio increased 2.3% for the full year 2015 over 2014. For the fourth quarter of '15, SHOP same-store cash NOI increased 1.1%. These results were in line with our expectations for the fourth quarter. As expected, same store occupancy in Q4 trended modestly higher and strong rate growth held, together driving 3% revenue growth. Adjusting for approximately $1.7 million of nonrecurring items in the fourth quarter of 2014, same-store NOI for the fourth quarter 2015 grew 2.4% versus prior year.
As seen throughout 2015, our NOI performance in the  quarter was led by continued strong growth across many of our high barrier-to-entry infill locations. Key markets such as New York, Los Angeles and Boston grew organic NOI more than 6% in the quarter. Double-digit NOI growth in tertiary markets also continued in the quarter as a result of productive development and redevelopment activity. SHOP performance in Canada in the fourth quarter, the first quarter in which the 29 assets acquired from Holiday in 2014 are included in same store, showed an expected modest decline. During the year, Atria accelerated the transition of these assets to its operating model in order to position them for future growth.
Q4 performance was affected by new supply coming online within our relevant trade area in a number of markets. Notably, Houston, Chicago and Sacramento saw NOI declines in the quarter driven principally by occupancy pressure. As a reminder, last quarter, we introduced a more refined supply methodology, which identifies new buildings under construction within the relevant 7-mile and 3-mile trade areas around our assets, based on population density. On that basis and using the fourth quarter NIC data, more than 70% of our SHOP portfolio NOI comes from markets that are in supply equilibrium or better. The 30% of the SHOP portfolio NOI that is exposed to a potential new supply surplus, represents less than 10% of Ventas total NOI. Remember that our methodology assumes 3% absorption and is arguably conservative as it assumes that all new supply within the relevant trade area is competitive regardless of care model, price point, et cetera.
Using this methodology, construction as a percentage of inventory across our SHOP portfolio stands at 4.5% in Q4, a 40 basis point increase from Q3, principally driven by markets, such as Atlanta, Sacramento and Denver. Against this backdrop, Ventas and our focus leading SHOP operators are working to drive operational excellence to gain share and grow even in the context of new supply. Our largest operator, Atria, continued to drive strong results in Q4 and for 2015 overall. These results are a testament to the operational excellence demonstrated at our Investor Day November at Atria's headquarters.
Now let's turn to our guidance and key assumptions for our SHOP business. In 2016, we project SHOP same-store NOI to grow in the range of 1% to 3%. This outlook assumes that our core engines of growth, namely the 70% of our SHOP portfolio insulated from supply, will continue to grow NOI at a mid-single-digit rate in 2016. This growth will be partially offset by assets in the markets where we anticipate increased supply challenges.
As we begin the year, we are pleased with the mid-single-digit annual rental rate increases that took effect January 1, 2016. These increases appear to be holding up well, thus demonstrating the value proposition of our communities and our operators. In fact, our SHOP operators have some exciting plans in place in 2016 to compete and thrive in the market to retain their great teams and to deliver value to seniors and their families.
Next, I'll cover our triple-net lease portfolio, which accounts for 44% of our NOI. The 507 same-store properties within this portfolio, comprised of senior housing and post acute assets, delivered accelerated growth, increasing 5.8% in 2015 versus 2014. As we mentioned in previous calls, triple-net's 2015 performance benefited from the $15 million rent increase for the Kindred assets, where we increased rent to market levels in October 2014, as well as other income items. Even after adjusting for these items, full year same-store NOI in the triple-net portfolio grew 3.2% above historical trend and confirmation of the positive growth impact of the CCP spin. In the fourth quarter, triple-net same-store cash NOI grew 2.9%, reflecting customary rent escalations as well as the cycling of the Kindred increase in Q4 of 2014. 
Trailing 12-month cash flow coverage in our same-store triple-net lease portfolio for the third quarter of 2015, the latest available information, was solid at 1.5x. As Debbie mentioned, our post acute coverage is a strong 2x. Although we had a 10 basis point compression due to the combination of the aforementioned Kindred rent increase and lower third quarter performance. Coverage in our triple-net senior housing portfolio remains solid at 1.3x. Occupancy is up 50 basis points sequentially and operator EBITDARM and rate are higher year-over-year.
For 2016, we expect our triple-net portfolio to grow in the range of 2% to 3%. Consistent with our practice, we have not included in our 2016 triple-net projections speculative fees, which has the effect of lowering the growth rate in our '16 outlook. 
Let me close out the segment review with our leading MOB business, which represents 20% of Ventas' overall NOI. Our Lillibridge business posted full year NOI in the total consolidated portfolio of 364 properties of $381 million in 2015, an increase of 33% over 2014. Performance was driven by the addition of 83 properties from the HCT acquisition in January. Occupancy in the total portfolio in 2015 was up 40 basis points to 92.3%, and margins increased by an exceptional 330 basis points, reflecting the quality of the properties we acquired as well as the cost synergy arising from leveraging the Lillibridge platform. 
In the 268 properties in the same-store portfolio, full year 2015 cash NOI grew a solid 2%. Occupancy declined modestly in 2015 versus 2014. Revenue grew slightly as a result of a roughly 2% increase in rental rate. And NOI margins improved 40 basis points on the heels of cost productivity initiatives. 
In the fourth quarter, MOB same-store cash NOI was stable versus 2014. Rate growth in the quarter remained solid at 2% versus prior year, while expense growth outpaced revenue growth due to unexpected R&M cost increases. We forecast our MOB same-store segment to continue to provide steady growth in the 1% to 2% range in 2016. This guidance assumes modest occupancy in rate growth and continued cost productivity. In 2016, our MOB team is actively working on driving occupancy gains, enhancing our portfolio of quality further through asset disposition and commencing on significant potential redevelopment opportunities stemming from our well-located portfolio.
Turning now to our financial results for Ventas. As a quick note, I will frequently refer to our results on a comparable basis, which adjusts all current and prior periods for the effects of the spinoff as if the spinoff was completed January 1, 2014. This is best practice for spin situations and is intended to get investors a true like-for-like reflection of our performance. Please note that, adjusting for the spinoff, comparable normalized FFO per share was $3.95 in 2015 and $3.64 in 2014. Details of both our reported, and comparable FFO per share are set forth on Page 25 of our Q4 supplemental.
Turning to Ventas' outstanding financial results overall for the full year 2015. Full year 2015 normalized FFO on a reported basis totaled $4.47 per fully diluted share, topping our most recent full year FFO guidance range of $4.43 to $4.46 per share. On a comparable basis, full year 2015 normalized FFO per share of $3.95 represents 9% growth over 2014. This strong year-over-year growth was driven by outstanding same-store NOI growth of 3.8%, together with over $5 billion in new investments in the year, including our beachhead investment in the U.S. acute care space with Ardent. We also invested $232 million in CapEx during 2015, inclusive of high-return redevelopment and development investments. 
To fund these investments, we recycled capital and enhanced our portfolio via over $700 million of asset sales and loan repayments, ahead of our original guidance of $600 million. We also issued and sold $7.2 million of shares of common stock for approximately $500 million under the ATM. Nearly 80% of this ATM's issuance was pre-spin, at a gross price of $72.94, while the remaining 20% was issued post spin at an average gross price of $54.87. 
In 2015, we continued our track record of strong cash flow generation, delivering a record $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the year. With our strong cash flow, we paid attractive cash dividends to shareholders totaling $3.04 per share, including a 10% increase when combined with CCP.
The company's liquidity profile was solid at year end, including exceptional fixed charge coverage of 4.5x, net debt to adjusted pro forma EBITDA of 6.1x, a weighted average maturity approximating 7 years and debt-to-total capitalization of 37%. 
In the fourth quarter, Ventas delivered normalized FFO of $346 million or $1.03 per fully diluted share. On a comparable basis, normalized FFO per share grew 7% in Q4 2015 over prior year. In the fourth quarter, the company acquired $93 million in high-quality MOBs. Ventas also committed to funding approximately $240 million in new development and redevelopment activity.
To fund investments, we raised $167 million under our ATM program during and after the fourth quarter, issuing 3 million shares at an average price of $55.42 per share before underwriter discount. We also continued to recycle capital via asset dispositions in senior housing and MOB assets, generating proceeds of $105 million in Q4 '15 and $61 million thus far in Q1 '16.
Before we take questions, I want to share a summary of our outlook for 2016. Our expectation as we begin the year is to deliver normalized FFO per share in the range of $4.07 to $4.15. This range represents a comparable normalized FFO per share growth rate of 3% to 5% over 2015. As highlighted earlier, we project total company same-store 2016 cash NOI growth to range from 1.5% to 3%. 
During 2016, we intend to continue to improve the company through intelligent value-creating dispositions and deliberate balance sheet strengthening. Our guidance assumes 2016 asset dispositions of approximately $500 million using a midyear estimate of completion. We intend to use the net proceeds to reinvest in about $350 million of new acquisitions, generating immediate cash returns, and to fund our accelerating development and redevelopment program, which will generate growth in returns in future years.  
We have assumed no additional material acquisitions, dispositions or capital activity in our guidance. Through application of operating cash flow and asset sale proceeds to both new investments and debt reduction, we project a reduction in leverage in 2016 to below 6x net debt to EBITDA.
So in summary, the entire Ventas team is proud of the excellent results we've delivered in 2015. And we are excited to sustain that excellence in 2016. With that, I will ask the operator to please open the line for questions."

Let me start with the fourth quarter and characterize the nonrecurring expenses where they hit. They were about $1.7 million. That takes -- when you adjust for those, the NOI growth from 1.1% to about 2.4% same store for the quarter, so pretty much in line quarter and year if you look at it that way. And these nonrecurring tend to normalize over the course of the year, so I think that's a reasonable way to view the year overall. The margin and expense versus revenue profile in the fourth quarter to note reflects that onetime-type benefit in 2014. So when you align for those, the margins are really in line, expense grew in line with revenue. So that's the fourth quarter. As we think about '16 and how we model '16, overall on a blended basis, I highlighted a 1% to 3% outlook for SHOP overall. Really has 2 building blocks to that and really important to highlight those. The first is, we call it, the 70% engine room of growth, the markets like New York, Los Angeles, the coastal markets in which we have a strong hold, we think those markets are going to grow mid-single digits. So that's a continuation of the momentum we've seen in those markets in 2015. That will be partially offset by, I call it, 30%. That is the list of markets which may be affected by supply challenges. And really, to think about what those challenges might be, it's hard to model exactly because it could be a function of occupancy, it could be a function of rate, even a potential expense impact. But overall, we think that on a blended basis, that performance for that 30% will bring down the overall average, so it will partially offset the strength and momentum we see in the 70%. Therefore, overall, coming back to your 1% to 3% growth overall, showing the benefit of the great portfolio, which we think we have. So within that, I can give more assumptions, but that's sort of the overall flavor for '16."

Indeed, we went back to try to truly understand this and modeled where we have assets, where there has been new supply coming on online, what happens.

If you looked at it 80 plus, within our trade rings, you kind of come back to the same sort of number. That central tendency, I would say, of 30% of the portfolio being exposed, really comes back no matter which methodology. The 3%, therefore, is a combination of population growth and then some level of obsolescence, which is relatively small. Overall, averaging assumption, it will differ by market.

Good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. And welcome to the Ventas year end 2015 earnings call. I'm delighted to be joined this morning by my Ventas colleagues to discuss our exciting and productive year, highlight",1337,"Thank you, Ryan. Good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants. And welcome to the Ventas year end 2015 earnings call. I'm delighted to be joined this morning by my Ventas colleagues to discuss our exciting and productive year, highlight the innovative and strategic transactions of 2015 and discuss our outlook for 2016. 
The Ventas advantage of superior properties, people and platforms has enabled us to consistently deliver outstanding results through multiple cycles for almost 2 decades. That is what distinguishes us. Over the years, we have demonstrated excellence through clear commitment to our shareholders, dedication to our customers and partners and engagement of our skilled interdisciplinary team. Ventas has a long track record of delivering superior FFO and dividend growth. We continued our outperformance in 2015 with 9% comparable normalized FFO per share growth and a 10% dividend increase, inclusive of CCP. Our excellent and diversified portfolio generated industry-leading same-store growth during the year, and we ended 2015 with a strong balance sheet and $2.2 billion of liquidity.
During my 17 years at Ventas, we have seen a lot of changes in our markets. And we've become the leading provider of capital to high-quality healthcare and senior housing companies. We've navigated successfully through multiple economic, capital markets and reimbursement cycles and have continued to grow with strength and integrity. We haven't gotten everything right to be sure, but we've been consistently early and opportunistic relative to the 5 asset classes where we do business.
In 2015, we were once again at the forefront. Our experienced team really stepped up to complete several important and complex transactions that significantly improved Ventas and showed our continued ability to stay ahead of the curve in healthcare real estate, which we strongly believe is an attractive place to be for investors. Key accomplishments of the year included our strategic disposition of nearly $5 billion in assets, including over $4 billion of skilled nursing facilities through our innovative tax-efficient spinoff of Care Capital Properties, and completion of over $5 billion in accretive acquisitions, including our successful beachhead investment in the large attractive hospital space with Ardent, a top 10 provider of care. These successful transactions have reshaped our enterprise, provided additional channels for growth, improved the quality of our portfolio and enhanced the reliability of our cash flows.
The site specifics, our balanced and diversified portfolio generates industry-leading 83% of our NOI from private-pay sources, principally medical office buildings and senior housing communities. Our partners are the best in the business. Post-spin, over 80% of our NOI comes from top operators in each sector who have scale, a sound capital structure and operational excellence. We have a nice balance in our portfolio among operating businesses and triple-net leases. And none of our tenants represents more than 10% of our NOI. 
Importantly, Ventas now generates only 4% of our NOI from our 53 owned skilled nursing assets. Most of our postacute facility rent comes from Kindred, our largest tenant. All of our postacute facilities produce excellent 2x property level cash flow to rent coverage and our rents are guaranteed. Kindred has become the nation's leader in postacute care with a well-developed strategy, strong balance sheet and diversified business model. 
Our entry into the hospital space in 2015 was also a significant example of our ability to capitalize early on trends in healthcare and create high-quality platforms for future growth. We invested $1.3 billion in Ardent's extensive network of real estate sites in 3 key markets. As we demonstrated during our Investor Day, we think it's smart business to align with leading hospital providers who have always been at the top of the food chain in healthcare services and are increasingly influential in the delivery of care and the distribution of dollars in our rapidly evolving healthcare system. 
Ardent provides both inpatient and outpatient care throughout its multiple access points in its markets. And it just completed a strong year where same-store revenues, adjusted admissions and ER visits showed solid growth. Our investment in Ardent was expertly executed and structured, with outstanding property EBITDARM to rent coverage and low leverage at the operating company. It was also very timely. We are seeing significant deal flow and actively working with our partners at EGI and Ardent to consolidate and grow. 
While the spinoff of CCP and our Ardent investment have rightly received a lot of attention, I also want to highlight our senior housing portfolio and our commitment to that important sector. Atria had another outstanding year, and we thank John Moore and his team for their significant contributions to Ventas' success. I'm really glad you had a chance to see Atria's excellence during our Investor Day. 
Senior living is an incredible space, its potential is only beginning to be realized. Despite the ebbs and flows of supply cycles, we own an outstanding portfolio of SHOP communities in advantaged markets and high quality triple-net lease assets. We believe deeply in the value proposition of senior housing. As an industry, we have tremendous opportunity to advocate the benefits of communal living to our residents and their families. Growth in the senior population will provide undeniable tailwinds and increasing demand for our communities. And a mere 1 percentage point increase in the seniors who choose to live in senior housing communities would create powerful new incremental demand, enough to fill all the currently vacant senior housing units in the nation.
We continue to invest in our properties during 2015 to fuel future growth, through increased capital allocation to selective, high quality, ground-up developments and redevelopments. We committed over $200 million to ground-up development projects, including a trophy medical office building in downtown San Francisco connected to Sutter Health's newly constructed flagship $2 billion hospital, as well as 2 luxury senior housing communities in Palm Beach County and San Francisco. On the redevelopment front in 2015, we committed to approximately $150 million in SHOP and triple-net redevelopment projects. These investments should provide attractive risk-adjusted returns, improve the quality of our properties and help our customers maintain and expand their market share.
We also allocated a portion of our strong cash flow to our shareholders through our cash dividend, which has always been and will continue to be an important component of the value proposition we offer our shareholders. Ventas has one of the best dividend growth records in the REIT industry and with a projected 70% FFO dividend payout ratio, we are well-positioned to continue growing our dividend into the future. 
That's a good segue to our 2016 outlook. Our expectations for the macroeconomic environment are tempered. We believe the U.S. economy will remain in a low growth, low interest rate and low inflation mode. Our segments should, once again, prove resilient because of the inelasticity of demand, the rapid aging of our population and the need-based nature of healthcare services. 
In that context, we are happy to provide 2016 normalized FFO guidance representing 3% to 5% growth per share on a comparable basis, which assumes the CCP spinoff occurred at 1/1 of '14. In 2016, we intend again to drive excellent consistent results by focusing on operational excellence and continued portfolio optimization in our senior housing operating and medical office building businesses; building on our advantage platforms, including hospitals and Atria; recycling capital through value-creating dispositions; making attractive accretive new investments, including improving our properties through development and redevelopment; providing innovative capital solutions to leading healthcare and senior housing providers in a dynamic market; and harnessing the potential and power of our outstanding and cohesive team at Ventas.
That Ventas team has delivered superior consistent results for investors and customers for almost 2 decades. We have the properties, the people and the platforms to continue leading our sector. I want to thank our investors for having continued faith and trust in us. You are in safe and sure hands. 
Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Bob Probst, who is hosting his second year end call as the CFO of Ventas. Bob?"

Let me detail our 2015 performance and our 2016 outlook at a segment level, starting with SHOP. Our same-store SHOP portfolio increased 2.3% for the full year 2015 over 2014. For the fourth quarter of '15, SHOP same-store cash NOI increased 1.1%. These results were in line with our expectations for the fourth quarter. As expected, same store occupancy in Q4 trended modestly higher and strong rate growth held, together driving 3% revenue growth. Adjusting for approximately $1.7 million of nonrecurring items in the fourth quarter of 2014, same-store NOI for the fourth quarter 2015 grew 2.4% versus prior year.
As seen throughout 2015, our NOI performance in the  fourth quarter was led by continued strong growth across many of our high barrier-to-entry infill locations. Key markets such as New York, Los Angeles and Boston grew organic NOI more than 6% in the quarter. Double-digit NOI growth in tertiary markets also continued in the quarter as a result of productive development and redevelopment activity. SHOP performance in Canada in the fourth quarter, the first quarter in which the 29 assets acquired from Holiday in 2014 are included in same store, showed an expected modest decline. During the year, Atria accelerated the transition of these assets to its operating model in order to position them for future growth.
Q4 performance was affected by new supply coming online within our relevant trade area in a number of markets. Notably, Houston, Chicago and Sacramento saw NOI declines in the quarter driven principally by occupancy pressure. As a reminder, last quarter, we introduced a more refined supply methodology, which identifies new buildings under construction within the relevant 7-mile and 3-mile trade areas around our assets, based on population density. On that basis and using the fourth quarter NIC data, more than 70% of our SHOP portfolio NOI comes from markets that are in supply equilibrium or better. The 30% of the SHOP portfolio NOI that is exposed to a potential new supply surplus, represents less than 10% of Ventas total NOI. Remember that our methodology assumes 3% absorption and is arguably conservative as it assumes that all new supply within the relevant trade area is competitive regardless of care model, price point, et cetera.
Using this methodology, construction as a percentage of inventory across our SHOP portfolio stands at 4.5% in Q4, a 40 basis point increase from Q3, principally driven by markets, such as Atlanta, Sacramento and Denver. Against this backdrop, Ventas and our focus leading SHOP operators are working to drive operational excellence to gain share and grow even in the context of new supply. Our largest operator, Atria, continued to drive strong results in Q4 and for 2015 overall. These results are a testament to the operational excellence demonstrated at our Investor Day November at Atria's headquarters.
Now let's turn to our guidance and key assumptions for our SHOP business. In 2016, we project SHOP same-store NOI to grow in the range of 1% to 3%. This outlook assumes that our core engines of growth, namely the 70% of our SHOP portfolio insulated from supply, will continue to grow NOI at a mid-single-digit rate in 2016. This growth will be partially offset by assets in the markets where we anticipate increased supply challenges.
As we begin the year, we are pleased with the mid-single-digit annual rental rate increases that took effect January 1, 2016. These increases appear to be holding up well, thus demonstrating the value proposition of our communities and our operators. In fact, our SHOP operators have some exciting plans in place in 2016 to compete and thrive in the market to retain their great teams and to deliver value to seniors and their families.
Next, I'll cover our triple-net lease portfolio, which accounts for 44% of our NOI. The 507 same-store properties within this portfolio, comprised of senior housing and postacute assets, delivered accelerated growth, increasing 5.8% in 2015 versus 2014. As we mentioned in previous calls, triple-net's 2015 performance benefited from the $15 million rent increase for the Kindred assets, where we increased rent to market levels in October 2014, as well as other income items. Even after adjusting for these items, full year same-store NOI in the triple-net portfolio grew 3.2% above historical trends in confirmation of the positive growth impact of the CCP spin. In the fourth quarter, triple-net same-store cash NOI grew 2.9%, reflecting customary rent escalations as well as the cycling of the Kindred increase in Q4 of 2014. 
Trailing 12-month cash flow coverage in our same-store triple-net lease portfolio for the third quarter of 2015, the latest available information, was solid at 1.5x. As Debbie mentioned, our postacute coverage is a strong 2x. Although we had a 10 basis point compression due to the combination of the aforementioned Kindred rent increase and lower third quarter performance. Coverage in our triple-net senior housing portfolio remains solid at 1.3x. Occupancy is up 50 basis points sequentially and operator EBITDARM and rate are higher year-over-year.
For 2016, we expect our triple-net portfolio to grow in the range of 2% to 3%. Consistent with our practice, we have not included in our 2016 triple-net projections speculative fees, which has the effect of lowering the growth rate in our '16 outlook. 
Let me close out the segment review with our leading MOB business, which represents 20% of Ventas' overall NOI. Our Lillibridge business posted full year NOI in the total consolidated portfolio of 364 properties of $381 million in 2015, an increase of 33% over 2014. Performance was driven by the addition of 83 properties from the HCT acquisition in January. Occupancy in the total portfolio in 2015 was up 40 basis points to 92.3%, and margins increased by an exceptional 330 basis points, reflecting the quality of the properties we acquired as well as the cost synergy arising from leveraging the Lillibridge platform. 
In the 268 properties in the same-store portfolio, full year 2015 cash NOI grew a solid 2%. Occupancy declined modestly in 2015 versus 2014. Revenue grew slightly as a result of a roughly 2% increase in rental rate. And NOI margins improved 40 basis points on the heels of cost productivity initiatives. 
In the fourth quarter, MOB same-store cash NOI was stable versus 2014. Rate growth in the quarter remained solid at 2% versus prior year, while expense growth outpaced revenue growth due to unexpected R&M cost increases. We forecast our MOB same-store segment to continue to provide steady growth in the 1% to 2% range in 2016. This guidance assumes modest occupancy and rate growth and continued cost productivity. In 2016, our MOB team is actively working on driving occupancy gains, enhancing our portfolio of quality further through asset disposition and commencing on significant potential redevelopment opportunities stemming from our well-located portfolio.
Turning now to our financial results for Ventas. As a quick note, I will frequently refer to our results on a comparable basis, which adjusts all current and prior periods for the effects of the spinoff as if the spinoff was completed January 1, 2014. This is best practice for spin situations and is intended to give investors a true like-for-like reflection of our performance. Please note that, adjusting for the spinoff, comparable normalized FFO per share was $3.95 in 2015 and $3.64 in 2014. Details of both our reported, and comparable FFO per share are set forth on Page 25 of our Q4 supplemental.
Turning to Ventas' outstanding financial results overall for the full year 2015. Full year 2015 normalized FFO on a reported basis totaled $4.47 per fully diluted share, topping our most recent full year FFO guidance range of $4.43 to $4.46 per share. On a comparable basis, full year 2015 normalized FFO per share of $3.95 represents 9% growth over 2014. This strong year-over-year growth was driven by outstanding same-store NOI growth of 3.8%, together with over $5 billion in new investments in the year, including our beachhead investment in the U.S. acute care space with Ardent. We also invested $232 million in CapEx during 2015, inclusive of high-return redevelopment and development investments. 
To fund these investments, we recycled capital and enhanced our portfolio via over $700 million of asset sales and loan repayments, ahead of our original guidance of $600 million. We also issued and sold $7.2 million of shares of common stock for approximately $500 million under the ATM. Nearly 80% of this ATM's issuance was pre-spin, at a gross price of $72.94, while the remaining 20% was issued post spin at an average gross price of $54.87. 
In 2015, we continued our track record of strong cash flow generation, delivering a record $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the year. With our strong cash flow, we paid attractive cash dividends to shareholders totaling $3.04 per share, including a 10% increase when combined with CCP.
The company's liquidity profile was solid at year end, including exceptional fixed charge coverage of 4.5x, net debt to adjusted pro forma EBITDA of 6.1x, a weighted average maturity approximating 7 years and debt-to-total capitalization of 37%. 
In the fourth quarter, Ventas delivered normalized FFO of $346 million or $1.03 per fully diluted share. On a comparable basis, normalized FFO per share grew 7% in Q4 2015 over prior year. In the fourth quarter, the company acquired $93 million in high-quality MOBs. Ventas also committed to funding approximately $240 million in new development and redevelopment activity.
To fund investments, we raised $167 million under our ATM program during and after the fourth quarter, issuing 3 million shares at an average price of $55.42 per share before underwriter discount. We also continued to recycle capital via asset dispositions in senior housing and MOB assets, generating proceeds of $105 million in Q4 '15 and $61 million thus far in Q1 '16.
Before we take questions, I want to share a summary of our outlook for 2016. Our expectation as we begin the year is to deliver normalized FFO per share in the range of $4.07 to $4.15. This range represents a comparable normalized FFO per share growth rate of 3% to 5% over 2015. As highlighted earlier, we project total company same-store 2016 cash NOI growth to range from 1.5% to 3%. 
During 2016, we intend to continue to improve the company through intelligent value-creating dispositions and deliberate balance sheet strengthening. Our guidance assumes 2016 asset dispositions of approximately $500 million using a midyear estimate of completion. We intend to use the net proceeds to reinvest in about $350 million of new acquisitions, generating immediate cash returns, and to fund our accelerating development and redevelopment program, which will generate growth in returns in future years.  
We have assumed no additional material acquisitions, dispositions or capital activity in our guidance. Through application of operating cash flow and asset sale proceeds to both new investments and debt reduction, we project a reduction in leverage in 2016 to below 6x net debt to EBITDA.
So in summary, the entire Ventas team is proud of the excellent results we've delivered in 2015. And we are excited to sustain that excellence in 2016. With that, I will ask the operator to please open the line for questions."

Let me start with the fourth quarter and characterize the nonrecurring expenses where they hit. They were about $1.7 million. That takes -- when you adjust for those the NOI growth from 1.1% to about 2.4% same store for the quarter, so pretty much in line quarter and year if you look at it that way. And these nonrecurring tend to normalize over the course of the year, so I think that's a reasonable way to view the year overall. The margin and expense versus revenue profile in the fourth quarter to note reflects that onetime-type benefit in 2014. So when you align for those, the margins are really in line, expense grew in line with revenue. So that's the fourth quarter. As we think about '16 and how we model '16, overall on a blended basis, I highlighted a 1% to 3% outlook for SHOP overall. Really has 2 building blocks to that and really important to highlight those. The first is, we call it, the 70% engine room of growth, the markets like New York, Los Angeles, the coastal markets in which we have a strong hold, we think those markets are going to grow mid-single digits. So that's a continuation of the momentum we've seen in those markets in 2015. That will be partially offset by, I call it, 30%. That is the list of markets which may be affected by supply challenges. And really, to think about what those challenges might be, it's hard to model exactly because it could be a function of occupancy, it could be a function of rate, even a potential expense impact. But overall, we think that on a blended basis, that performance for that 30% will bring down the overall average, so it will partially offset the strength and momentum we see in the 70%. Therefore, overall, coming back to your 1% to 3% growth overall, showing the benefit of the great portfolio, which we think we have. So within that, I can give more assumptions, but that's sort of the overall flavor for '16."

That meets my hurdle for ground-up development. In terms of senior housing development, ground-up, we've got only 2 projects underway, very good market areas in Palm Beach County and San Francisco. And there, where you are looking at different cycles and economies and so on, we are a partial owner and have brought in third-party pension fund capital as a partner to kind of spread the risk and narrow that. We think those projects will be very successful. Atria is going to manage them. They have good developers. But again, the typical Ventas -- go with opportunities but also make sure you're managing risk. So those are our 3 ground-up developments.

Welcome to the Ventas' First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. We are delighted to be here with our colleagues to discuss large trends fueling our business and report on our strong first quarter results from our diverse high-quality portfolio. Following my remarks, Rob Probst will review our first quarter performance and financial results before we welcome your questions. 
On the heels of a productive and value creating 2015, we started our year off strong. Building off our advantage, properties, platforms and people, we extended our long track record of excellence this quarter. We generated normalized FFO per share of $1.04, representing comparable growth of 7% versus the fourth quarter 2015. And we are right on track to deliver our full-year expectation of 3% to 5% comparable normalized FFO per share growth despite projected net asset sales and results since modest deleveraging in the back half of the year. We are well-positioned over the short and long-term to capture opportunities and continue to grow cash flow and value for our investors. Our strong positioning is based on the decisions we made and actions we took in 2015, particularly the CCP spin-off and our acquisition of Ardent, large macro trends that favor our business, our financial strength and flexibility and our well covered dividend with room to grow. Let me address some of these factors. We are excited to do business at the intersection of 2 large and dynamic industries with powerful fundamentals and growth process. Both healthcare and real estate represent nearly 20% of our nation's GDP. Our $1 trillion healthcare real estate market is fragmented and continues to be right for consolidation. We are still in the early stages of asset migration from private to public, given that only 15% of healthcare and senior housing real estate asset is owned by REIT. Overtime, Ventas' excellent, diversified platform should be a magnet for asset growth. Our long-term growth prospects are also supported by the increasing demand for healthcare and senior living products and services created by a large and growing aging population. Longer life expectancy increase the need for health and senior care and seniors have immense spending power and will. Our asset and operators will be the beneficiary of this wave of oncoming demand. 
Turning to the upcoming change to the global industry classification standard, making REIT the stand-alone GIC, we anticipate that this change should attract more capital to our industry overtime. As time pass, we believe our size, leading position in healthcare and senior housing, track record of discipline capital allocation and excellent team make us attractive to generalist investors. Honestly, if I were a generalist investor looking at GDP growth at 0.5% in the first quarter, corporate practice declining for 3 consecutive quarters and global weakness, Ventas looks incredibly attractive. We have a 4.7% dividend yield with room to grow, significant liquidity, a BBB+ balance sheet, diversified business model, high quality asset and impeccable track record of consistent growth in income over cycle, opportunities to grow externally and powerful increasing demand from consumers for our real estate. To my mind, that's a compelling value proposition. So whether there's a new GIC or not, what wouldn't you want to own Ventas? That said, we are obviously, focused on our core REIT investors who are crucial to our continued success and we will continue driving to deliver outstanding results for all of our stakeholders. 
As we look at our company, we also like our positioning with a diversified, balanced and high quality portfolio, generating 83% of our NOI from private pay sources. Our outstanding SHOP assets are located in highly attractive markets with strong home values, medium income and senior population growth. In a MOB portfolio, 88% of our NOI is affiliated with investment-grade hospital and HCA, and 96% of our NOI is on campus or affiliated with leading healthcare systems and hospitals. Finally, Ventas' entire portfolio is advantage with only 4% of our NOI derived from, who our adapting to revolve payment model and upcoming RAC. Ventas enjoys a strong presence across 5 verticals, in each case doing business with the nation's leading providers. This exposure and expertise enables us to invest capital across cycles to create value for investors and customers and fund operator consolidation. Although the vast majority of our NOI is from private pay sources, I do want to note that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or CMS recently announced its proposals for fiscal year 2017 Medicare reimbursement rate. In general, Medicare rates for different government reimbursed asset classes are slated to increase by varying percentages, subject to previously announced initiative or other offset. We view the proposal as in line with our expectations. On that note, we recently reached positive agreements with Kindred on a long-term acute care or LTAC portfolio to better position it for success. Our agreement contemplates this position of 7 LTAC and retaining full rent under our master leases with Kindred. This is just 1 more example of our long-standing collaborative relationship with Kindred where the companies have repeatedly found innovative ways to create value for both sets of stakeholders. So with our portfolio performing well and liquidity and balance sheet strong, our customers leading our industry and our team aligned and efficient, we are continually looking for ways to create additional value through investment activity that delivers good risk-adjusted return. As we have for the past several quarters, we are being highly selective and picking our spots as we consider investment opportunities. Our focus continues to be on committing capital to high-quality hospitals, funding our selective development and redevelopment projects and helping our customers grow. 
We also have found some intriguing investment opportunities in superior real estate as different layers in the capital, such as our recent investment in a secured junior loan tranche of Blackstone's core life science asset, principally in Cambridge, San Diego and San Francisco. In the acquisitions arena, we see a very deep and active financing investment market for MOB with interest from a variety of investor category. In senior housings too, we see aggressive activity from private equity and pension fund, among others even when communities are in areas with significant construction start. However, the deal size in senior housing has been trending towards the smaller end of the spectrum. In hospitals, our effort continue to gain traction as more providers and their constituents are interested in the benefit that our capital can bring to their organization. Our conversations with hospitals and health systems have been accelerating and broadening. So I have complete confidence in our ole as the leading capital provider in our 5 asset classes and our team's ability to capture opportunities and grow cash flows and value for our investors. However, as you know, the timing and volume of our future investment activities are not subject to precise prediction. 
In closing, for almost 2 decades, we have used the Ventas advantage of superior properties, people and platform to translate the powerful forces of consolidation, demographic demand and dynamism in the large healthcare and senior housing real estate market into consistent growth, income and value creation for our investors. And today, as we stand at the corner of healthcare and real estate, we are well-positioned to continue doing so. Now, to talk about our positive quarter, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CFO, Rob Probst."
398549,330267436,967346,"Ventas, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2016",2016-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Ventas, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Debbie. I am pleased to report a strong first quarter for Ventas, which included solid same-store growth, 7% comparable normalized FFO per share growth and an even stronger balance sheet. I'm equally pleased to reaffirm our full-year guidance for",1308,"Thanks, Debbie. I am pleased to report a strong first quarter for Ventas, which included solid same-store growth, 7% comparable normalized FFO per share growth and an even stronger balance sheet. I'm equally pleased to reaffirm our full-year guidance for 2016 of 3% to 5% comparable normalized FFO per share growth. On that note, let me first discuss the performance of our highly productive portfolio of nearly 1,300 diversified healthcare and senior housing properties. Same-store cash NOI growth for the company's total portfolio for the first quarter was 2.9% excluding certain items in their respective 2016 and 2015 period and 1.7 on a reported basis. 
Turning to our first quarter 2016 segment level performance, starting with SHOP. Our SHOP business performed well in Q1. Our reported same-store SHOP portfolio increased 2.9% for the first quarter of 2016 over 2015, which is at the high-end of our 1% to 3% full-year guidance. This reported performance was delivered despite incurring unanticipated real estate tax expenses of $1.2 million in the current quarter relating to prior years. Without these expenses, same-store SHOP NOI growth would have been 3.8%[ph]. Our intentional rate driven strategy as well as the quality of our portfolio was visible in the quarter with same-store RevPAR growth of 4.7% in Q1 2016 versus prior year. The aggressive rate increases had an impact on occupancy that resulted in overall strong revenue growth of nearly 4% in the quarter. Adjusting for the aforementioned property tax charge, operating expenses grew in line with revenue and margins held steady. Consistent with our full-year guidance, our Q1 performance was led by the engines of growth in our high barrier to entry coastal infill locations. Our core markets represent more than 70% of our SHOP portfolio NOI. NOI in these markets increased at a mid-mid-single-digit rate in the first quarter. Within these key markets, New York, Los Angeles and Boston posted particularly strong results the start of the year. We did see the performance impacting Q1 of new units coming online within our relevant trade areas in select markets. As expected, NOI from communities in these markets declined low single-digits in the quarter in aggregate driven by occupancy pressures. Encouragingly, based on the latest NIC data, new construction as a percentage of inventory for our SHOP portfolio declined 10 basis points sequentially to 4.4% in Q1 2016. Our framework by which we evaluate and quantify the NOI impact of new construction in 2016 shared on our last earnings call in February has held up very well this year. We affirm our full-year guidance for SHOP 2016 reported same-store cash NOI to grow in the range of 1% to 3%. From a phasing point of view, the second quarter 2015 generated our strongest NOI delivery last year, enhances our most challenging comparison period in 2016. For the full year, we project continued strong rate growth on lower occupancy levels versus prior year with growth fueled by the continued momentum in our core market. 
Next, I'll cover our triple-net lease asset which account for 44% of our NOI. Triple-net reported same-store cash NOI was roughly flat in Q1 versus prior year. The first quarter 2016 results did not contain $5 million in fee income we've received in the comparable 2015 period. Adjusting for this item, triple-net same-store cash NOI grew 2.9% reflecting customary rent escalations. Cash flow coverage in our overall stabilize triple-net lease portfolio for the fourth quarter of 2015, the latest available quarterly information, was stable at 1.6x. Coverage in our triple-net same-store senior housing portfolio remains strong at 1.3x with solid low single-digit trailing 12 month EBITDARM growth at the asset. Our deliberately constructed portfolio partnered with industry leader, Kindred, now represents only 12% of Ventas' NOI post the CCP spinoff. Our same-store posted cash flow coverage remained a strong 2.0x in Q4 2015. Finally, our Ardent triple-net coverage held steady at 3.0x with solid performance across nearly all key performance indicators continuing into 2016. We are pleased to raise our triple-net full-year reported same-store guidance by 50 basis points to 2.5% to 3.5% growth. Our Q2 and full year cash NOI will benefit by $3.5 million in lease modification fees without loss of rent from the recently announced Kindred LTAC deal that we mentioned earlier. 
Let me close the segment review with our MOB business which represents 23% of Ventas' overall NOI. MOB cash NOI in the 270 properties same-store pool grew 4.2%. First quarter 2016 results benefited from an early lease termination fee with net value of $2.3 million. Adjusted for this item, MOB growth in Q1 was 1%. Q1 revenue grew as a result of a modest rate increase on in place rents, partially offset by lower recovery income and occupancy declines driven by the aforementioned early lease termination. NOI benefited from cost productivity in the first quarter on the heels of a milder winter. We continue to forecast the MOB segment will grow reported full-year, same-store cash NOI in the range of 1% to 2% in 2016. We expect a softer second quarter and then to trend higher in the back half of the year as we fill budgeted vacancy. We remain confident in our valuable MOB business and the leverage platform. 
Turning to Ventas' overall financial results. I'll refer to our results on accountable basis which adjust all prior periods with the effects of the spinoff. First quarter 2016 normalized FFO totaled $1.04 per fully diluted share representing 7% growth on a comparable basis over the first quarter 2015. The strong year-over-year growth was driven by the carryover impact of 2015 investments including Ardent together with new investments in the first and same-store NOI growth. Ventas made approximately $150 million in new investments in the first quarter 2016. In addition, the company funded nearly $40 million from development and redevelopment projects during the quarter. To fully equity fund these new investments, since year end 2015 earnings release in February, Ventas opportunistically issued a total of 1.6 million shares of common stock under our ATM with gross proceeds of approximately $100 million at an average price of $62.30. Year-to-date, Ventas has issued 3.3 million shares of common stock with gross proceeds of approximately $190 million. Ventas also contributed asset disposition program filling 7 properties thus far in 2016 with aggregate sales price approaching $70 million. As a result of these deliberate steps, the company's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved sequentially to 6.0x. Now, within our 5x to 6x targeted range. Further, fixed charge coverage is exceptionally strong at 4.6x while debt to total capitalization approximated 34%. 
Finally, we are pleased to affirm our guidance to deliver 2016 normalized FFO per share in the range of $4.07 to $4.15. This range represent the comparable normalized FFO per share growth rate of 3% to 5% over 2015. We also affirm guidance for total company same-store 2016 cash NOI to grow in the range of 1.5% to 3%. Our guidance continues to assume 2016 asset dispositions of approximately $500 million, inclusive of dispositions closed year-to-date. We intend to use the net proceeds to reinvest in approximately $200 million of incremental acquisitions and also to reduce debt. Our guidance therefore, assumes further modest reduction in leverage below the 6.0x net debt EBITDA observed at the end of Q1. With a strong 7% increase in normalized FFO to start 2016, we expect that further leverage reduction, asset sales and refinancing activity over the balance of the year will bring the full-year FFO per share growth to our 3% to 5% guidance range. We have assumed no additional material acquisitions, dispositions or capital activity in our guidance. 
In summary, the entire Ventas team is proud of our strong start to 2016 and confident in our prospects for the remainder of the year. With that, I will ask the operator to please open the call for questions."

Welcome to the Ventas First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. We are delighted to be here with our colleagues to discuss large trends fueling our business and report on our strong first quarter results from our diverse high-quality portfolio. Following my remarks, Bob Probst will review our segment performance and financial results before we welcome your questions. 
On the heels of a productive and value-creating 2015, we started our year off strong. Building off our advantage, properties, platforms and people, we extended our long track record of excellence this quarter. We generated normalized FFO per share of $1.04, representing comparable growth of 7% versus the fourth quarter 2015. And we are right on track to deliver our full year expectation of 3% to 5% comparable normalized FFO per share growth despite projected net asset sales and results since modest deleveraging in the back half of the year. We are well positioned over the short- and long-term to capture opportunities and continue to grow cash flow and value for our investors. Our strong positioning is based on the decisions we made and actions we took in 2015, particularly the CCP spinoff and our acquisition of Ardent, large macro trends that favor our business, our financial strength and flexibility and our well-covered dividend with room to grow. 
Let me address some of these factors. We are excited to do business at the intersection of 2 large and dynamic industries with powerful fundamentals and growth process. Both health care and real estate represent nearly 20% of our nation's GDP. Our $1 trillion health care real estate market is fragmented and continues to be ripe for consolidation. We are still in the early stages of asset migration from private to public hands, given that only 15% of health care and senior housing real estate assets is owned by REITs. Over time, Ventas' excellent diversified platform should be a magnet for asset flow. Our long-term growth prospects are also supported by the increasing demand for health care and senior living products and services created by a large and growing aging population. Longer life expectancies increased the need for health and senior care, and seniors have immense spending power and wealth. Our assets and operators will be the beneficiary of this wave of oncoming demand. 
Turning to the upcoming change to the global industry classification standard, making REITs a standalone GIC, we anticipate that this change should attract more capital to our industry over time. At Ventas, we believe our size, leading position in health care and senior housing, track record of disciplined capital allocation and excellent team make us attractive to generalist investors. 
Honestly, if I were a generalist investor looking at GDP growth of 0.5% in the first quarter, corporate practice declining for 3 consecutive quarters and global weakness, Ventas looks incredibly attractive. We have a 4.7% dividend yield with room to grow, significant liquidity, a BBB+ balance sheet, diversified business model, high-quality assets, an impeccable track record of consistent growth in income over cycles, opportunities to grow externally and powerful increasing demand from consumers for our real estate, to my mind, that's a compelling value proposition. So whether there's a new GIC or not, why wouldn't you want to own Ventas? That said, we are obviously focused on our core REIT investors who are crucial to our continued success and we will continue driving to deliver outstanding results for all of our stakeholders. 
As we look at our company, we also like our positioning, with a diversified, balanced and high-quality portfolio, generating 83% of our NOI from private pay sources. Our outstanding SHOP assets are located in highly attractive markets, with strong home values, median income and seniors population growth. 
In our MOB portfolio, 88% of our NOI is affiliated with investment-grade hospitals and HCA, and 96% of our NOI is on campus or affiliated with leading health care systems and hospitals. 
Finally, Ventas' entire portfolio is advantaged, with only 4% of our NOI derived from SNF, who are adapting to evolving payment models and upcoming RAC audits. 
Ventas enjoys a strong presence across 5 verticals, in each case, doing business with the nation's leading providers. This exposure and expertise enables us to invest capital across cycles to create value for investors and customers and fund operator consolidation. Although the vast majority of our NOI is from private pay sources, I do want to note that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or CMS recently announced its proposals for fiscal year 2017 Medicare reimbursement rates. In general, Medicare rates for different government-reimbursed asset classes are slated to increase by varying percentages, subject to previously announced initiatives or other offsets. We view the proposals as in line with our expectations. 
On that note, we recently reached positive agreements with Kindred on our long-term acute care or LTAC portfolio to better position it for success. Our agreement contemplates this position of 7 LTACs and retaining full rent under our master leases with Kindred. This is just one more example of our long-standing collaborative relationship with Kindred, where the companies have repeatedly found innovative ways to create value for both sets of stakeholders. 
So with our portfolio performing well, our liquidity and balance sheet strong, our customers leading their industries and our team aligned and efficient, we are continually looking for ways to create additional value through investment activity that delivers good risk-adjusted return. As we have for the past several quarters, we are being highly selective and picking our spots as we consider investment opportunities. Our focus continues to be on committing capital to high-quality hospitals, funding our selective development and redevelopment projects and helping our customers grow. 
We also have found some intriguing investment opportunities in superior real estate as different layers in the capital stack, such as our recent investment in a secured junior loan tranche of Blackstone's core life science asset, principally in Cambridge, San Diego and San Francisco. In the acquisitions arena, we see a very deep and active financing investment market for MOBs, with interest from a variety of investor categories. In senior housings too, we see aggressive activity from private equity and pension fund, among others, even when communities are in areas with significant construction starts. However, the deal size in senior housing has been trending towards the smaller end of the spectrum. In hospitals, our effort continued to gain traction as more providers and their constituents are interested in the benefits that our capital can bring to their organization. Our conversations with hospitals and health systems have been accelerating and broadening. So I have complete confidence in our role as the leading capital provider in our 5 asset classes and our team's ability to capture opportunities and grow cash flows and value for our investors. However, as you know, the timing and volume of our future investment activities are not subject to precise prediction. 
In closing, for almost 2 decades, we have used the Ventas advantage of superior properties, people and platforms to translate the powerful forces of consolidation, demographic demand and dynamism in the large health care and senior housing real estate market into consistent growth, income and value creation for our investors. And today, as we stand at the corner of health care and real estate, we are well positioned to continue doing so. 
Now to talk about our positive quarter, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CFO, Bob Probst."
398549,330267436,967786,"Ventas, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2016",2016-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Ventas, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Debbie. I am pleased to report a strong first quarter for Ventas, which included solid same-store growth, 7% comparable normalized FFO per share growth and an even stronger balance sheet. I'm equally pleased to reaffirm our full year guidance for",1315,"Thanks, Debbie. I am pleased to report a strong first quarter for Ventas, which included solid same-store growth, 7% comparable normalized FFO per share growth and an even stronger balance sheet. I'm equally pleased to reaffirm our full year guidance for 2016 of 3% to 5% comparable normalized FFO per share growth. On that note, let me first discuss the performance of our highly productive portfolio of nearly 1,300 diversified health care and senior housing properties. Same-store cash NOI growth for the company's total portfolio for the first quarter was 2.9%, excluding certain items, in the respective 2016 and 2015 periods and 1.7% on a reported basis. 
Turning to our first quarter 2016 segment level performance, starting with SHOP. Our SHOP business performed well in Q1. Our reported same-store SHOP portfolio increased 2.9% for the first quarter of 2016 over 2015, which is at the high end of our 1% to 3% full year guidance. This reported performance was delivered despite incurring unanticipated real estate tax expenses of $1.2 million in the current quarter relating to prior years. Without these expenses, same-store SHOP NOI growth would have been 3.8%. Our intentional rate-driven strategy as well as the quality of our portfolio was visible in the quarter, with same-store REVPOR growth of 4.7% in Q1 2016 versus prior year. The aggressive rate increases had an impact on occupancy but resulted in overall strong revenue growth of nearly 4% in the quarter. 
Adjusting for the aforementioned property tax charge, operating expenses grew in line with revenue and margins held steady. 
Consistent with our full year guidance, our Q1 performance was led by the engines of growth in our high barrier-to-entry coastal infill locations. Our core markets represent more than 70% of our SHOP portfolio NOI. NOI in these markets increased at a mid-single-digit rate in the first quarter. Within these key markets, New York, Los Angeles and Boston posted particularly strong results at the start of the year. We did see the performance impacting Q1 of new units coming online within our relevant trade areas in select markets. As expected, NOI from communities in these markets declined low single digits in the quarter in aggregate, driven by occupancy pressures. 
Encouragingly, based on the latest NIC data, new construction as a percentage of inventory across our SHOP portfolio declined 10 basis points sequentially to 4.4% in Q1 2016. Our framework by which we evaluate and quantify the NOI impact of new construction in 2016 shared on our last earnings call in February has held up very well this year. We affirm our full year guidance for SHOP 2016 reported same-store cash NOI to grow in the range of 1% to 3%. From a phasing point of view, the second quarter 2015 generated our strongest NOI delivery last year, enhances our most challenging comparison period in 2016. For the full year, we project continued strong rate growth on lower occupancy levels versus prior year, with growth fueled by the continued momentum in our core market. 
Next, I'll cover our triple-net lease assets which account for 44% of our NOI. Triple-net reported same-store cash NOI was roughly flat in Q1 versus prior year. The first quarter 2016 result did not contain $5 million in fee income we received in the comparable 2015 period. Adjusting for this item, triple-net same-store cash NOI grew 2.9%, reflecting customary rent escalations. Cash flow coverage in our overall stabilized triple-net lease portfolio for the fourth quarter of 2015, the latest available quarterly information, was stable at 1.6x. Coverage in our triple-net same-store senior housing portfolio remained strong at 1.3x, with solid low single-digit trailing 12-month EBITDARM growth at the asset. Our deliberately constructed post-acute portfolio, partnered with industry leader, Kindred, now represents only 12% of Ventas' NOI post the CCP spinoff. Our same-store post-acute cash flow coverage remained a strong 2.0x in Q4 2015. 
Finally, our Ardent triple-net coverage held steady at 3.0x, with solid performance across nearly all key performance indicators continuing into 2016. We are pleased to raise our triple-net full year reported same-store guidance by 50 basis points to 2.5% to 3.5% growth. Our Q2 and full year cash NOI will benefit by $3.5 million in lease modification fees without loss of rent from the recently announced Kindred LTAC deal Debbie mentioned earlier. 
Let me close the segment review with our MOB business, which represents 20% of Ventas' overall NOI. MOB cash NOI in the 270-property same-store pool grew 4.2%. First quarter 2016 results benefited from an early lease termination fee, with net value of $2.3 million. Adjusted for this item, MOB growth in Q1 was 1%. Q1 revenue grew as a result of a modest rate increase on in-place rents, partially offset by lower recovery income and occupancy declines driven by the aforementioned early lease termination. NOI benefited from cost productivity in the first quarter, on the heels of a mild winter. We continue to forecast the MOB segment will grow reported full year same-store cash NOI in the range of 1% to 2% in 2016. We expect a softer second quarter and then to trend higher in the back half of the year as we fill budgeted vacancy. We remain confident in our valuable MOB business and the Lillibridge platform. 
Turning to Ventas' overall financial results. I'll refer to our results on a comparable basis which adjust all prior periods with the effects of the spinoff. First quarter 2016 normalized FFO totaled $1.04 per fully diluted share, representing 7% growth on a comparable basis over the first quarter 2015. The strong year-over-year growth was driven by the carryover impact of 2015 investments, including Ardent, together with new investments in the first quarter and same-store NOI growth. Ventas made approximately $150 million in new investments in the first quarter of 2016. In addition, the company funded nearly $40 million of development and redevelopment projects during the quarter. To fully equity fund these new investments, since our year-end 2015 earnings release in February, Ventas opportunistically issued a total of 1.6 million shares of common stock under our ATM for gross proceeds of approximately $100 million, at an average price of $62.30. Year-to-date, Ventas has issued 3.3 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $190 million. Ventas also continued its asset disposition program, filling 7 properties thus far in 2016 for an aggregate sales price approaching $70 million. 
As a result of these deliberate steps, the company's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved sequentially to 6.0x, now within our 5x to 6x targeted range. Further, fixed charge coverage is exceptionally strong at 4.6x, while debt-to-total-capitalization approximated 34%. 
Finally, we are pleased to affirm our guidance to deliver 2016 normalized FFO per share in the range of $4.07 to $4.15. This range represent the comparable normalized FFO per share growth rate of 3% to 5% over 2015. We also affirm guidance for total company same-store 2016 cash NOI to grow in the range of 1.5% to 3%. Our guidance continues to assume 2016 asset dispositions of approximately $500 million, inclusive of dispositions closed year-to-date. We intend to use the net proceeds to reinvest in approximately $200 million of incremental acquisitions and also to reduce debt. Our guidance therefore assumes further modest reduction in leverage below the 6.0x net debt EBITDA observed at the end of Q1. 
With a strong 7% increase in normalized FFO to start 2016, we expect that further leverage reduction, asset sales and refinancing activity over the balance of the year will bring the full year FFO per share growth to our 3% to 5% guidance range. We have assumed no additional material acquisitions, dispositions or capital activity in our guidance. 
In summary, the entire Ventas team is proud of our strong start to 2016 and confident in our prospects for the remainder of the year. With that, I will ask the operator to please open the call for questions."

From our standpoint, we believe that Kindred, who is our principal post-acute partner, is very well-positioned. The services that Kindred provide are clinically mandated and approved, and it has a really good infrastructure too.

Welcome to the Ventas First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call.

Welcome to the Ventas First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. We are delighted to be here with our colleagues to discuss large trends fueling our business and report on our strong first quarter results from our diverse high-quality portfolio. Following my remarks, Bob Probst will review our segment performance and financial results before we welcome your questions. 
On the heels of a productive and value-creating 2015, we started our year off strong. Building off our advantage, properties, platforms and people, we extended our long track record of excellence this quarter. We generated normalized FFO per share of $1.04, representing comparable growth of 7% versus the fourth quarter 2015. And we are right on track to deliver our full year expectation of 3% to 5% comparable normalized FFO per share growth despite projected net asset sales and results since modest deleveraging in the back half of the year. We are well positioned over the short- and long-term to capture opportunities and continue to grow cash flow and value for our investors. Our strong positioning is based on the decisions we made and actions we took in 2015, particularly the CCP spinoff and our acquisition of Ardent, large macro trends that favor our business, our financial strength and flexibility and our well-covered dividend with room to grow. 
Let me address some of these factors. We are excited to do business at the intersection of 2 large and dynamic industries with powerful fundamentals and growth process. Both health care and real estate represent nearly 20% of our nation's GDP. Our $1 trillion health care real estate market is fragmented and continues to be ripe for consolidation. We are still in the early stages of asset migration from private to public hands, given that only 15% of health care and senior housing real estate assets is owned by REITs. Over time, Ventas' excellent diversified platform should be a magnet for asset flow. Our long-term growth prospects are also supported by the increasing demand for health care and senior living products and services created by a large and growing aging population. Longer life expectancies increased the need for health and senior care, and seniors have immense spending power and wealth. Our assets and operators will be the beneficiary of this wave of oncoming demand. 
Turning to the upcoming change to the global industry classification standard, making REITs a standalone GIC, we anticipate that this change should attract more capital to our industry over time. At Ventas, we believe our size, leading position in health care and senior housing, track record of disciplined capital allocation and excellent team make us attractive to generalist investors. 
Honestly, if I were a generalist investor looking at GDP growth of 0.5% in the first quarter, corporate practice declining for 3 consecutive quarters and global weakness, Ventas looks incredibly attractive. We have a 4.7% dividend yield with room to grow, significant liquidity, a BBB+ balance sheet, diversified business model, high-quality assets, an impeccable track record of consistent growth in income over cycles, opportunities to grow externally and powerful increasing demand from consumers for our real estate, to my mind, that's a compelling value proposition. So whether there's a new GIC or not, why wouldn't you want to own Ventas? That said, we are obviously focused on our core REIT investors who are crucial to our continued success and we will continue driving to deliver outstanding results for all of our stakeholders. 
As we look at our company, we also like our positioning, with a diversified, balanced and high-quality portfolio, generating 83% of our NOI from private pay sources. Our outstanding SHOP assets are located in highly attractive markets, with strong home values, median income and seniors population growth. 
In our MOB portfolio, 88% of our NOI is affiliated with investment-grade hospitals and HCA, and 96% of our NOI is on campus or affiliated with leading health care systems and hospitals. 
Finally, Ventas' entire portfolio is advantaged, with only 4% of our NOI derived from SNF, who are adapting to evolving payment models and upcoming RAC audits. 
Ventas enjoys a strong presence across 5 verticals, in each case, doing business with the nation's leading providers. This exposure and expertise enables us to invest capital across cycles to create value for investors and customers and fund operator consolidation. Although the vast majority of our NOI is from private pay sources, I do want to note that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or CMS recently announced its proposals for fiscal year 2017 Medicare reimbursement rates. In general, Medicare rates for different government-reimbursed asset classes are slated to increase by varying percentages, subject to previously announced initiatives or other offsets. We view the proposals as in line with our expectations. 
On that note, we recently reached positive agreements with Kindred on our long-term acute care or LTAC portfolio to better position it for success. Our agreement contemplates this position of 7 LTACs and retaining full rent under our master leases with Kindred. This is just one more example of our long-standing collaborative relationship with Kindred, where the companies have repeatedly found innovative ways to create value for both sets of stakeholders. 
So with our portfolio performing well, our liquidity and balance sheet strong, our customers leading their industries and our team aligned and efficient, we are continually looking for ways to create additional value through investment activity that delivers good risk-adjusted return. As we have for the past several quarters, we are being highly selective and picking our spots as we consider investment opportunities. Our focus continues to be on committing capital to high-quality hospitals, funding our selective development and redevelopment projects and helping our customers grow. 
We also have found some intriguing investment opportunities in superior real estate at different layers in the capital stack, such as our recent investment in a secured junior loan tranche of Blackstone's core life science assets, principally in Cambridge, San Diego and San Francisco. In the acquisitions arena, we see a very deep and active financing investment market for MOBs, with interest from a variety of investor categories. In senior housings too, we see aggressive activity from private equity and pension fund, among others, even when communities are in areas with significant construction starts. However, the deal size in senior housing has been trending towards the smaller end of the spectrum. In hospitals, our effort continued to gain traction as more providers and their constituents are interested in the benefits that our capital can bring to their organization. Our conversations with hospitals and health systems have been accelerating and broadening. So I have complete confidence in our role as the leading capital provider in our 5 asset classes and our team's ability to capture opportunities and grow cash flows and value for our investors. However, as you know, the timing and volume of our future investment activities are not subject to precise prediction. 
In closing, for almost 2 decades, we have used the Ventas advantage of superior properties, people and platforms to translate the powerful forces of consolidation, demographic demand and dynamism in the large health care and senior housing real estate market into consistent growth, income and value creation for our investors. And today, as we stand at the corner of health care and real estate, we are well positioned to continue doing so. 
Now to talk about our positive quarter, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CFO, Bob Probst."
398549,330267436,968045,"Ventas, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2016",2016-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Ventas, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Debbie. I am pleased to report a strong first quarter for Ventas, which included solid same-store growth, 7% comparable normalized FFO per share growth and an even stronger balance sheet. I'm equally pleased to reaffirm our full year guidance for",1314,"Thanks, Debbie. I am pleased to report a strong first quarter for Ventas, which included solid same-store growth, 7% comparable normalized FFO per share growth and an even stronger balance sheet. I'm equally pleased to reaffirm our full year guidance for 2016 of 3% to 5% comparable normalized FFO per share growth. On that note, let me first discuss the performance of our highly productive portfolio of nearly 1,300 diversified health care and senior housing properties. Same-store cash NOI growth for the company's total portfolio for the first quarter was 2.9%, excluding certain items, in the respective 2016 and 2015 periods and 1.7% on a reported basis. 
Turning to our first quarter 2016 segment level performance, starting with SHOP. Our SHOP business performed well in Q1. Our reported same-store SHOP portfolio increased 2.9% for the first quarter of 2016 over 2015, which is at the high end of our 1% to 3% full year guidance. This reported performance was delivered despite incurring unanticipated real estate tax expenses of $1.2 million in the current quarter relating to prior years. Without these expenses, same-store SHOP NOI growth would have been 3.8%. Our intentional rate-driven strategy as well as the quality of our portfolio was visible in the quarter, with same-store REVPOR growth of 4.7% in Q1 2016 versus prior year. The aggressive rate increases had an impact on occupancy but resulted in overall strong revenue growth of nearly 4% in the quarter. 
Adjusting for the aforementioned property tax charge, operating expenses grew in line with revenue and margins held steady. 
Consistent with our full year guidance, our Q1 performance was led by the engines of growth in our high barrier-to-entry coastal infill locations. Our core markets represent more than 70% of our SHOP portfolio NOI. NOI in these markets increased at a mid-single-digit rate in the first quarter. Within these key markets, New York, Los Angeles and Boston posted particularly strong results at the start of the year. We did see the performance impacting Q1 of new units coming online within our relevant trade areas in select markets. As expected, NOI from communities in these markets declined low single digits in the quarter in aggregate, driven by occupancy pressures. 
Encouragingly, based on the latest NIC data, new construction as a percentage of inventory across our SHOP portfolio declined 10 basis points sequentially to 4.4% in Q1 2016. Our framework by which we evaluate and quantify the NOI impact of new construction in 2016, shared on our last earnings call in February, has held up very well this year. We affirm our full year guidance for SHOP 2016 reported same-store cash NOI to grow in the range of 1% to 3%. From a phasing point of view, the second quarter 2015 generated our strongest NOI delivery last year, enhances our most challenging comparison period in 2016. For the full year, we project continued strong rate growth on lower occupancy levels versus prior year, with growth fueled by the continued momentum in our core market. 
Next, I'll cover our triple-net lease assets which account for 44% of our NOI. Triple-net reported same-store cash NOI was roughly flat in Q1 versus prior year. The first quarter 2016 result did not contain $5 million in fee income we received in the comparable 2015 period. Adjusting for this item, triple-net same-store cash NOI grew 2.9%, reflecting customary rent escalations. Cash flow coverage in our overall stabilized triple-net lease portfolio for the fourth quarter of 2015, the latest available quarterly information, was stable at 1.6x. Coverage in our triple-net same-store senior housing portfolio remained strong at 1.3x, with solid low single-digit trailing 12-month EBITDARM growth at the asset. Our deliberately constructed post-acute portfolio, partnered with industry leader, Kindred, now represents only 12% of Ventas' NOI post the CCP spinoff. Our same-store post-acute cash flow coverage remained a strong 2.0x in Q4 2015. 
Finally, our Ardent triple-net coverage held steady at 3.0x, with solid performance across nearly all key performance indicators continuing into 2016. We are pleased to raise our triple-net full year reported same-store guidance by 50 basis points to 2.5% to 3.5% growth. Our Q2 and full year cash NOI will benefit by $3.5 million in lease modification fees without loss of rent from the recently announced Kindred LTAC deal Debbie mentioned earlier. 
Let me close the segment review with our MOB business, which represents 20% of Ventas' overall NOI. MOB cash NOI in the 270-property same-store pool grew 4.2%. First quarter 2016 results benefited from an early lease termination fee, with net value of $2.3 million. Adjusted for this item, MOB growth in Q1 was 1%. Q1 revenue grew as a result of a modest rate increase on in-place rents, partially offset by lower recovery income and occupancy declines driven by the aforementioned early lease termination. NOI benefited from cost productivity in the first quarter, on the heels of a mild winter. We continue to forecast the MOB segment will grow reported full year same-store cash NOI in the range of 1% to 2% in 2016. We expect a softer second quarter and then to trend higher in the back half of the year as we fill budgeted vacancy. We remain confident in our valuable MOB business and the Lillibridge platform. 
Turning to Ventas' overall financial results. I'll refer to our results on a comparable basis which adjust all prior periods with the effects of the spinoff. First quarter 2016 normalized FFO totaled $1.04 per fully diluted share, representing 7% growth on a comparable basis over the first quarter 2015. This strong year-over-year growth was driven by the carryover impact of 2015 investments, including Ardent, together with new investments in the first quarter and same-store NOI growth. Ventas made approximately $150 million in new investments in the first quarter of 2016. In addition, the company funded nearly $40 million of development and redevelopment projects during the quarter. To fully equity-fund these new investments, since our year-end 2015 earnings release in February, Ventas opportunistically issued a total of 1.6 million shares of common stock under our ATM for gross proceeds of approximately $100 million, at an average price of $62.30. Year-to-date, Ventas has issued 3.3 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $190 million. Ventas also continued its asset disposition program, filling 7 properties thus far in 2016 for an aggregate sales price approaching $70 million. 
As a result of these deliberate steps, the company's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved sequentially to 6.0x, now within our 5x to 6x targeted range. Further, fixed charge coverage is exceptionally strong at 4.6x, while debt-to-total-capitalization approximated 34%. 
Finally, we are pleased to affirm our guidance to deliver 2016 normalized FFO per share in the range of $4.07 to $4.15. This range represent the comparable normalized FFO per share growth rate of 3% to 5% over 2015. We also affirm guidance for total company same-store 2016 cash NOI to grow in the range of 1.5% to 3%. Our guidance continues to assume 2016 asset dispositions of approximately $500 million, inclusive of dispositions closed year-to-date. We intend to use the net proceeds to reinvest in approximately $200 million of incremental acquisitions and also to reduce debt. Our guidance therefore assumes further modest reduction in leverage below the 6.0x net debt EBITDA observed at the end of Q1. 
With a strong 7% increase in normalized FFO to start 2016, we expect that further leverage reduction, asset sales and refinancing activity over the balance of the year will bring the full year FFO per share growth to our 3% to 5% guidance range. We have assumed no additional material acquisitions, dispositions or capital activity in our guidance. 
In summary, the entire Ventas team is proud of our strong start to 2016 and confident in our prospects for the remainder of the year. With that, I will ask the operator to please open the call for questions."

It declined at a low single-digit rate, again, very much in line with guidance provided in February. So performing very much as expected, and that is with units coming online. So we are seeing units coming online that began about Q3 of last year and will continue basically through the year as per the NIC data. So very much consistent with what we told you."

We are delighted to be here with our colleagues to report on our strong results from our diverse high-quality portfolio, discuss our pending investment in life sciences and medical real estate and provide color on macro trends. Following my remarks, our CFO, Bob Probst, will review our segment performance and financial results and walk through our full year guidance before we welcome your questions. 
We have great momentum at Ventas. [indiscernible our superior properties, platforms and people, we extended our long track record of excellence this quarter. If you invest in Ventas for reliable growth and income on a strong balance sheet, then this is a good quarter for you. 
Leading with results, we delivered $1.04 in normalized FFO per share, representing 7% year-over-year comparable growth. And we remain on track for 3% to 5% normalized FFO growth this year. We were opportunistic in access to debt and equity capital markets, again demonstrating our commitments to financial strength and flexibility, as well as our expertise in capital markets activity. 
As you know, we love cash flow, because it enables us to reinvest in our business and pay you a dividend. Our strong and secure dividend yield of nearly 4% is very attractive and has plenty of room to continue to grow. 
Our strong performance is fueled by our market position as the exciting intersection of health care and real estate to large and dynamic industries with powerful fundamentals and growth prospects. Within this attractive space, our incredible team has made strategic decisions and executed our strategy with sustained excellence. As a result, we have differentiated our portfolio and our company, benefited our shareholders and shaped Ventas for continued success. 
Recent examples of our disciplined capital allocation moves include our successful spin-off of most of our skilled nursing business and our entry into the large growing hospital space with Ardent, both completed last year. The elevation and evolution of our business continued this year with our recent deal to announce to acquire $1.5 billion in high-quality life science and medical real estate operated by best-in-class developer, Wexford. We believe the Wexford deal is both financially and strategically attractive. With the going in cash yield on stabilized assets of 6.8%, it is our wonderful fit with our goal of delivering reliable growth and income through cycles. This investment represents an accretive institutional quality entry into the large and growing health care-driven research and development space. It adds an adjacent business line that further diversifies our portfolio and cash flows and adds a large component of private pay NOI to our business mix. The powerful combination of attractive properties, superior platforms and outstanding people creates the Ventas Advantage. All 3 are on display with the Wexford deal. 
The 25 Wexford properties we will acquire our new, Class A assets that are environmentally advanced and architecturally appealing. I hope you'll go to our website for a property tour to see this portfolio. The assets are also well leased to highly rated top-tier universities, academic medical centers and research companies, including Yale, U Penn Medicine, Wash U, Duke and Wake Forest. Like other areas of our business, our prospective tenants are market leaders. The universities in our portfolio account for fully 10% of all university life sciences research and development spending in the U.S., that's an outstanding way to enter a new space. It was really fun to travel up and down the East Coast with Ryan recently, visiting these hotbeds of academic and commercial research, cutting-edge medical activity, innovation and education. 
The Wexford acquisition also creates another superior platform for Ventas growth. The Wexford team has a terrific reputation within the sophisticated tight knit community of elite universities. Demand is increasing as universities take difficult decisions about capital allocation. In this environment, combining Ventas' capital with a trusted developer who can deliver complex projects that benefit leading institutions should be a winning formula. 
We have an exclusive pipeline for growth with Wexford, with 2 assets under development coming online in 2017 and 9 development sites available to satisfy growing demand in research hubs anchored by leading universities. We already have identified 1 potential new development project adjacent to U Penn Medical, which could get green lighted soon. We're hopeful we can grow the business like we have with Lillibridge and Atria. 
The Ventas people and culture were once again truly exceptional in the Wexford deal. We have always admired the Wexford business and have worked on it many times in the past. So when we were recently presented with the opportunity to acquire it, we were a knowledgeable buyer, with an incredibly fast, sophisticated and interdisciplinary team. With our deep knowledge of the business and assets, substantial trust among the players, a good structure and accommodative capital market, we were able to execute with excellence. If luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity, then Ventas is lucky indeed. Hats off to the team. And thanks to the many Ventas investors who participated in our Wexford equity funding in July. We sincerely appreciate your support. 
Next, I'd like to comment briefly on the investment market. We are remaining highly selective as we consider investment opportunities in the current market. Our cost of capital has improved significantly, but we will only execute on deals we believe will generate reliable earnings growth at an appropriate risk-adjusted return. Thus, our focus continues to be on committing capital to high-quality hospitals, helping our customers grow and funding selective development and redevelopment projects. With the addition of Wexford, we expect our capital allocation to preleased university-based development projects to represent a larger percentage of our investment pie. We believe strongly in our ability to invest capital across cycles to create value for our investors and customers. This confidence flows from the combination of our advantaged position within 5 and soon to be 6 asset classes, our relationships with market leading customers and platforms and our team hard-earned experience and skill. 
Before closing, it's worthwhile to spend a few minutes on the macro environment. In the health care arena, we see an acceleration of the transition to value-based payment model. Just this week, CMS announced that it will layer on additional mandatory bundling for cardiac care in 2017. This and other development support our thesis that hospitals are beginning to exert even more influence in post-acute patient care and cost, and that revenue streams for skilled nursing providers will likely remain under pressure in the near term. In the longer term, diversified post-acute care providers like Kindred, who can deliver quality care in a variety of settings, maintain a sound capital structure and adequate liquidity, and enjoy the benefits of scale should have a competitive advantage. 
From an economic and market standpoint, we are benefiting from multiple tailwinds that favor our business, including domestic GDP growth that continues to hover in the low single-digits, a global thirst for yield, the creation of a new REIT global industry classification and historically low long-term borrowing rates. In this environment, U.S. real estate and Ventas should thrive. With our need-based demographically-driven business model, a superb track record of consistent, reliable growth, external investment opportunities, a best-in-class credit profile, a differentiated business mix that is 84% private pay and a secure, nearly 4% dividend, Ventas should continue to be a magnet for investment dollars. 
Now, to talk about our positive quarter, I'm happy to turn the call over to Bob."

I'm pleased to report solid earnings growth on an even stronger balance sheet in the second quarter.

I'm pleased to report solid earnings growth on an even stronger balance sheet in the second quarter. Let me jump right into the performance of our high-quality health care and senior housing properties, which, together, delivered same-store cash NOI growth of 3.5% for the nearly 1,200 assets in the company's quarterly same-store total portfolio. Performance in the quarter was led by our triple-net lease business, which accounts for 43% of our NOI. Triple net reported same-store cash NOI growth was 6.2% in Q2 versus the prior year. Growth in the quarter benefited from a $3.5 million cash fee associated with the previously announced collaborative agreements between Ventas and Kindred. Excluding the Kindred fee, triple net same-store cash NOI grew 4.1% in the quarter, principally reflecting strong in-place lease escalations. Cash flow coverage in our overall stabilized triple net lease portfolio for the first quarter of 2016, the latest available quarterly information, improved 10 basis points sequentially to 1.7x. This strong coverage level reflects the quality of our triple net lease properties and of our operators. Coverage in our triple net same-store senior housing portfolio remained stable at 1.3x. Coverage trends were supported by low-single-digit EBITDARM growth at the asset level for the trailing 12 months. 
Our decision to spin off the majority of our post-acute portfolio in 2015 continues to be validated. Our remaining post-acute portfolio, where SNFs now represent only 4% of our NOI, demonstrated market leading same-store cash flow coverage at 2x in Q1 of 2016. 
Finally, Ardent triple net coverage held steady at 3x, and continues to perform well at the assets. Ardent showed positive momentum in top and bottom line key performance indicators in both the first and second quarters. With the strong first half of the year and the majority of lease escalations now in place for 2016, we are pleased to update our forecast for the triple net segment to grow reported full year same-store NOI in the range of 3.5% to 4%, an increase of 75 basis points at the midpoint. 
We are happy to report another solid quarter in our SHOP portfolio, generating Q2 same-store cash NOI growth of 2.1% versus the prior year. This result is right in line with our expectations and reflects our most challenging year-over-year comparison period in 2015. The framework by which we established our SHOP guidance range for the year is holding up very well in both the second quarter and the first half of the year. And with the first half now under our belt, we have performed at the higher end of our guidance range, with H1 growth of 2.5% versus prior year on a reported basis. 
In the second quarter, as expected, our rate-driven strategy continued to fuel our earnings with REVPOR growth of nearly 4%. Our high barrier to entry infill coastal markets continued to be the engine room of our overall SHOP portfolio growth in the second quarter. These communities, which represent approximately 70% of our SHOP NOI, grew Q2 same-store NOI mid-single digits on continued strong rate growth. Major coastal markets, including New York, LA and Boston, continued to drive consistently outstanding growth in both rates and NOI in the quarter and the first half. In select markets, we observed the impact of new construction coming online within our relevant trade areas. In these communities, same-store NOI posted low single-digit declines in aggregate, driven by occupancy and wage pressures. Again, this performance is consistent with our framework with the approximately 30% of our SHOP portfolio located in markets with the new construction surplus. 
Construction as a percentage of inventory in our trade areas, as reported by NIC, increased in the quarter by 40 basis points to 4.8%. Importantly, however, the amount of our SHOP NOI that is affected by new supply remains at roughly 30%. We have observed that a significant number of projected openings, as reported by NIC, have been delayed into 2017, and that anecdotally, financing and completing new developments may be getting more challenging. 
Overall, we are pleased with our SHOP performance through the first half of the year. We're, therefore, raising our full year guidance for SHOP reported cash NOI in the full year same-store asset pool to grow in the range of 1.5% to 3%, up from our 1% to 3% range previously communicated. Strong rate growth and lower year-over-year occupancy, led by our high barrier to entry markets is expected to fuel this NOI performance. 
Let me close out the segment review with our MOB business, which represents 20% of Ventas' overall NOI. MOB cash NOI in its 353 property quarterly same-store pool grew nearly 1% in the second quarter and increased 2.3% in the first half. Both the second quarter and the first half benefited from in-place rent escalations and continued cost productivity from the Lillibridge platform, partially offset by lower occupancy. For the balance of the year, we are actively filling the leasing pipeline to backfill move outs and to cover increased repair and maintenance cost expected in the back half of the year. For the full year 2016, we continue to forecast the MOB segment will grow same-store cash NOI for the full year asset pool in the range of 1% to 2%. 
Turning now to our overall financial results. This was a very busy and productive quarter for Ventas. In the second quarter, we generated strong FFO growth, reduced refinancing risk while capitalizing on favorable market conditions and further strengthened our credit profile. 
First, our earnings growth. Second quarter 2016 normalized FFO totaled $1.04 per fully diluted share, representing 7% growth on a comparable basis over the second quarter of 2015. This strong year-over-year growth was driven by the carryover impact of 2015 investments, including Ardent, together with new year-to-date investments in 2016 and second quarter same-store NOI growth. 
Ventas made $65 million in new investments in the second quarter of 2016, including $30 million of acquisitions and $35 million of development and redevelopment spending during the quarter. We strengthened our balance sheet in Q2 through the issuance of a total of 3.5 million shares of common stock under our ATM for gross proceeds of approximately $232 million. We also capitalized on the strong debt capital markets and took refinancing risk off the table in the quarter. In June, we tendered, and ultimately, retired in full the $550 million 1.55% senior notes maturing in September 2016. The September note was retired principally through the issuance of a $400 million 3/8 7-year unsecured note. Demand for Ventas' debt offering was very high, with the order book 7.5x oversubscribed. 
As a result of this cumulative capital activity during the quarter, we have an even healthier balance sheet and excellent liquidity. The company's net debt to EBITDA ratio improved from 6.1x at year-end 2015 to 5.8x at the end of the second quarter, ahead of our expectations. We have lowered gross debt by nearly $300 million since the beginning of the year. Our fixed charge coverage is exceptionally strong at 4.6x, and our debt to total capitalization is outstanding at 30%. 
And we did not stop there. Following the quarter-end, we elected to lock in our attractive return and accretion on the Wexford acquisition through a block equity issuance. Concurrent with deal announcement in early July, Ventas sold 10.3 million shares of common stock for total proceeds of $736 million at an issuance price of approximately $72 per share. We plan to hold the proceeds in cash until the Wexford's closing. The temporary FFO cost of the strategy is $0.01 a month, notably dampening our Q3 FFO per share, assuming a Q4 Wexford closing. We believe the short run dilution of pre-funding is more than offset by the longer-term value creation of this strategy. 
And that's a good segue to our full year guidance for the company. We are updating our normalized FFO per share guidance for 2016 to a range of $4.05 to $4.13, representing 3% to 5% growth over 2015 on a comparable basis. Put simply, the modest $0.02 revision from previous guidance reflects paying $0.04 for the certainty that comes with the Wexford equity pre-funding, as well as Q2 deleveraging, partially offset by the accretive impact of Wexford post close. Our second half FFO per share guidance is expected to be lower than our first half results, driven by these same factors. 
Setting aside capital activity, our underlying same-store portfolio performance is solid. On the heels of a healthy first half, we're raising the bottom end of our total 2016 same-store NOI guidance range by 50 basis points. 2016 same-store NOI is now estimated to grow in the range of 2% to 3%, up from the company's previous range of 1.5% to 3%. 
Our guidance continues to assume 2016 asset dispositions of approximately $500 million, inclusive of $75 million in dispositions closed year-to-date. No further material acquisitions, dispositions or capital activity are assumed in guidance. 
In summary, the entire Ventas team is proud of our productive and strong first half of the year and is committed to sustaining our track record of excellence. 
With that, I will ask the operator to please open the call for questions."

As I mentioned, we expected to have a strong first half in a way we did, and it really has been fueled by the injury I keep referring to those key coastal markets like New York, like LA, like Boston, which have continued to grow mid-single-digit. On the back of that, as you reference, the rate-driven strategy, you see the strongest rates and NOI growth in those markets, and that's very much as expected. So we're really pleased with that. At the same time, the construction impact, again, very much in line with the initial guidance we gave in February and the framework we put around that. Indeed, the impact of the new units coming online is on the better end of the guidance that we gave in February. And as a consequence, net, net that, when you step back and look at the performance -- portfolio in the first half, 2.5% growth above the midpoint of the guidance towards the higher end. So we feel very good about the first half, and that is the core reason why we are raising the guidance for the back half of the year. The reason for the range continues to be very consistent with that framework of engine room performance continue to drive forward and potential variability, depending on the impact of new construction, and that's the reason for the range in the back half. But fundamentally, the confidence in that guidance is solid."

And I would say having a good relationship with Blackstone and the Wexford management team is a helpful, facilitated factor in the transaction as well. And the structure is always, I would say, a helpful factor, but normally, it's not this positive. It's really those cash flows. And here, when we look at Wexford and these are new assets, they're Class A assets, and about 3/4 of the NOI is from tenants who have investment-grade ratings, have billion-plus market caps, have a AA rated -- or universities. That, to us, is a really good risk-adjusted return when you're looking at 10-plus year length of lease maturities. And so everything came together, I think, in a really positive way. The fact that we've looked at the deal before, I think really shows our discipline and patience, and that's really how we operate here.

We are bullish on senior housing, short, medium, long-term, because when you look at the services that seniors get in senior housing communities, economically to replicate that at home is 2x as expensive, not to mention the social benefits of being part of a community, which are proven to be enhancing and extending life. And therefore, there's a great product offering here where affordability, importantly, affordability, if you look at net worth among seniors, affordability of senior housing is not the gating issue. They can afford comfortably, on average, to enter senior housing. So that, together with, of course, the aging population, the megatrend of longevity as a huge tailwind to this business give me and us confidence in that business. Now, within that, as you already point out, we've been driving a rate strategy in light of that value proposition. We think that's a smart move. It really is very much predicated on the annual rent letter. And that increase we saw this year, which was among the highest we've had has held nicely and is proving out to be a good strategy. At the same time, we are being sensitive to the occupancy impacts. And this is proving out to be a good formula. One that will be dynamic though. I mean, we will make sure we're managing well, because it is a more complex equation between rate and occupancy. But nonetheless, we like where we are. The strategy is proving out very much in line with where we expect it to be. And then short, medium, long-term, this is a great business."

However, rate, we continue to expect, will be strong and to hold with where we are, and that is really important, in part, to cover costs. And therefore, the paradigm of the P&L is one of revenue growth very much in line with expense growth to deliver the guidance we gave for the year. So that's the P&L profile. I think if you look within construction markets, you'll see a different dynamic, where we still see rate growth albeit not as strong, and we do see some occupancy pressure.

And the good thing is you point out with our cost of capital and just overall strength of our business is that we are sellers by choice. So what we are trying to do is create options in terms of sale and continue to refine our portfolio and do some routine capital recycling. And so I think that's all to the good.

We are delighted to be here with our colleagues to report on our strong results from our diverse high-quality port",1261,"Thank you, Ryan, and good morning to all of our shareholders and other participants, and welcome to the Ventas Second Quarter Earnings Call. We are delighted to be here with our colleagues to report on our strong results from our diverse high-quality portfolio, discuss our pending investment in life sciences and medical real estate and provide color on macro trends. Following my remarks, our CFO, Bob Probst, will review our segment performance and financial results and walk through our full year guidance before we welcome your questions. 
We have great momentum at Ventas. Building off our superior properties, platforms and people, we extended our long track record of excellence this quarter. If you invest in Ventas for reliable growth and income on a strong balance sheet, then this is a good quarter for you. 
Leading these results, we delivered $1.04 in normalized FFO per share, representing 7% year-over-year comparable growth. And we remain on track for 3% to 5% normalized FFO growth this year. We were opportunistic in access to debt and equity capital markets, again demonstrating our commitments to financial strength and flexibility as well as our expertise in capital markets activity. 
As you know, we love cash flow, because it enables us to reinvest in our business and pay you a dividend. Our strong and secure dividend yield of nearly 4% is very attractive and has plenty of room to continue to grow. 
Our strong performance is fueled by our market position as the exciting intersection of health care and real estate to large and dynamic industries with powerful fundamentals and growth prospects. Within this attractive space, our incredible team has made strategic decisions and executed our strategy with sustained excellence. As a result, we have differentiated our portfolio and our company, benefited our shareholders and shaped Ventas for continued success. 
Recent examples of our disciplined capital allocation moves include our successful spin-off of most of our skilled nursing business and our entry into the large growing hospital space with Ardent, both completed last year. The elevation and evolution of our business continued this year with our recent deal to announce -- to acquire $1.5 billion in high-quality life science and medical real estate operated by best-in-class developer, Wexford. We believe the Wexford deal is both financially and strategically attractive. With the going in cash yield on stabilized assets of 6.8%, it is a wonderful fit with our goal of delivering reliable growth and income through cycles. This investment represents an accretive institutional quality entry into the large and growing health care-driven research and development space. It adds an adjacent business line that further diversifies our portfolio and cash flows and adds a large component of private pay NOI to our business mix. The powerful combination of attractive properties, superior platforms and outstanding people creates the Ventas Advantage. All 3 are on display with the Wexford deal. 
The 25 Wexford properties we will acquire are new Class A assets that are environmentally advanced and architecturally appealing. I hope you'll go to our website for a property tour to see this portfolio. The assets are also well leased to highly rated top-tier universities, academic medical centers and research companies, including Yale, U Penn Medicine, Wash U, Duke and Wake Forest. Like other areas of our business, our prospective tenants are market leaders. The universities in our portfolio account for fully 10% of all university life sciences research and development spending in the U.S. That's an outstanding way to enter a new space. It was really fun to travel up and down the East Coast with Ryan recently, visiting these hotbeds of academic and commercial research, cutting-edge medical activity, innovation and education. 
The Wexford acquisition also creates another superior platform for Ventas growth. The Wexford team has a terrific reputation within the sophisticated tight knit community of elite universities. Demand is increasing as universities take difficult decisions about capital allocation. In this environment, combining Ventas' capital with a trusted developer who can deliver complex projects that benefit leading institutions should be a winning formula. 
We have an exclusive pipeline for growth with Wexford, with 2 assets under development coming online in 2017 and 9 development sites available to satisfy growing demand in research hubs anchored by leading universities. We already have identified 1 potential new development project adjacent to U Penn Medical, which could get green lighted soon. We're hopeful we can grow the business like we have with Lillibridge and Atria. 
The Ventas people and culture were once again truly exceptional in the Wexford deal. We have always admired the Wexford business and have worked on it many times in the past. So when we were recently presented with the opportunity to acquire it, we were a knowledgeable buyer with an incredibly fast, sophisticated and interdisciplinary team. With our deep knowledge of the business and assets, substantial trust among the players, a good structure and accommodative capital market, we were able to execute with excellence. If luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity, then Ventas is lucky indeed. Hats off to the team. And thanks to the many Ventas investors who participated in our Wexford equity funding in July. We sincerely appreciate your support. 
Next, I'd like to comment briefly on the investment market. We are remaining highly selective as we consider investment opportunities in the current market. Our cost of capital has improved significantly, but we will only execute on deals we believe will generate reliable earnings growth at an appropriate risk-adjusted return. Thus, our focus continues to be on committing capital to high-quality hospitals, helping our customers grow and funding selective development and redevelopment projects. With the addition of Wexford, we expect our capital allocation to preleased university-based development projects to represent a larger percentage of our investment pie. We believe strongly in our ability to invest capital across cycles to create value for our investors and customers. This confidence flows from the combination of our advantaged position within 5 and soon to be 6 asset classes, our relationships with market leading customers and platforms and our team's hard-earned experience and skill. 
Before closing, it's worthwhile to spend a few minutes on the macro environment. In the health care arena, we see an acceleration of the transition to value-based payment model. Just this week, CMS announced that it will layer on additional mandatory bundling for cardiac care in 2017. This and other development support our thesis that hospitals are beginning to exert even more influence in post-acute patient care and cost, and that revenue streams for skilled nursing providers will likely remain under pressure in the near term. In the longer term, diversified post-acute care providers like Kindred, who can deliver quality care in a variety of settings, maintain a sound capital structure and adequate liquidity, and enjoy the benefits of scale should have a competitive advantage. 
From an economic and market standpoint, we are benefiting from multiple tailwinds that favor our business, including domestic GDP growth that continues to hover in the low single-digits, a global thirst for yield, the creation of a new REIT global industry classification and historically low long-term borrowing rates. In this environment, U.S. real estate and Ventas should thrive. With our need-based demographically-driven business model, a superb track record of consistent, reliable growth, external investment opportunities, a best-in-class credit profile, a differentiated business mix that is 84% private pay and a secure, nearly 4% dividend, Ventas should continue to be a magnet for investment dollars. 
Now, to talk about our positive quarter, I'm happy to turn the call over to Bob."

I'm pleased to report solid earnings growth on an even stronger balance sheet in the second quarter. Let me jump right into the performance of our high-quality health care and senior housing properties, which together delivered same-store cash NOI growth of 3.5% for the nearly 1,200 assets in the company's quarterly same-store total portfolio. Performance in the quarter was led by our triple-net leased business, which accounts for 43% of our NOI. Triple-net reported same-store cash NOI growth was 6.2% in Q2 versus the prior year. Growth in the quarter benefited from a $3.5 million cash fee associated with the previously announced collaborative agreements between Ventas and Kindred. Excluding the Kindred fee, triple-net same-store cash NOI grew 4.1% in the quarter, principally reflecting strong in-place lease escalations. Cash flow coverage in our overall stabilized triple-net lease portfolio for the first quarter of 2016, the latest available quarterly information, improved 10 basis points sequentially to 1.7x. This strong coverage level reflects the quality of our triple-net lease properties and of our operators. Coverage in our triple-net same-store senior housing portfolio remained stable at 1.3x. Coverage trends were supported by low-single-digit EBITDARM growth at the asset level for the trailing 12 months. 
Our decision to spin off the majority of our post-acute portfolio in 2015 continues to be validated. Our remaining post-acute portfolio, where SNFs now represent only 4% of our NOI, demonstrated market leading same-store cash flow coverage at 2x in Q1 of 2016. 
Finally, Ardent triple-net coverage held steady at 3x, and continues to perform well at the assets. Ardent showed positive momentum in top and bottom line key performance indicators in both the first and second quarters. With the strong first half of the year and the majority of lease escalations now in place for 2016, we are pleased to update our forecast for the triple-net segment to grow reported full year same-store NOI in the range of 3.5% to 4%, an increase of 75 basis points at the midpoint. 
We are happy to report another solid quarter in our SHOP portfolio, generating Q2 same-store cash NOI growth of 2.1% versus the prior year. This result is right in line with our expectations and reflects our most challenging year-over-year comparison period in 2015. The framework by which we established our SHOP guidance range for the year is holding up very well in both the second quarter and the first half of the year. And with the first half now under our belt, we have performed at the higher end of our guidance range with H1 growth of 2.5% versus prior year on a reported basis. 
In the second quarter, as expected, our rate-driven strategy continued to fuel our earnings with REVPOR growth of nearly 4%. Our high barrier-to-entry infill coastal markets continued to be the engine room of our overall SHOP portfolio growth in the second quarter. These communities, which represent approximately 70% of our SHOP NOI, grew Q2 same-store NOI mid-single digits on continued strong rate growth. Major coastal markets, including New York, LA and Boston, continued to drive consistently outstanding growth in both rates and NOI in the quarter and the first half. In select markets, we observed the impact of new construction coming online within our relevant trade areas. In these communities, same-store NOI posted low single-digit declines in aggregate, driven by occupancy and wage pressures. Again, this performance is consistent with our framework for the approximately 30% of our SHOP portfolio located in markets with the new construction surplus. 
Construction as a percentage of inventory in our trade areas, as reported by NIC, increased in the quarter by 40 basis points to 4.8%. Importantly, however, the amount of our SHOP NOI that is affected by new supply remains at roughly 30%. We have observed that a significant number of projected openings, as reported by NIC, have been delayed into 2017, and that anecdotally, financing and completing new developments may be getting more challenging. 
Overall, we are pleased with our SHOP performance through the first half of the year. We are, therefore, raising our full year guidance for SHOP reported cash NOI in the full year same-store asset pool to grow in the range of 1.5% to 3%, up from our 1% to 3% range previously communicated. Strong rate growth and lower year-over-year occupancy, led by our high barrier-to-entry markets, is expected to fuel this NOI performance. 
Let me close out the segment review with our MOB business, which represents 20% of Ventas' overall NOI. MOB cash NOI in the 353-property quarterly same-store pool grew nearly 1% in the second quarter and increased 2.3% in the first half. Both the second quarter and the first half benefited from in-place rent escalations and continued cost productivity from the Lillibridge platform, partially offset by lower occupancy. For the balance of the year, we are actively filling the leasing pipeline to backfill budgeted move outs and to cover increased repair and maintenance costs expected in the back half of the year. For the full year 2016, we continue to forecast the MOB segment will grow same-store cash NOI for the full year asset pool in the range of 1% to 2%. 
Turning now to our overall financial results. This was a very busy and productive quarter for Ventas. In the second quarter, we generated strong FFO growth, reduced refinancing risk while capitalizing on favorable market conditions and further strengthened our credit profile. 
First, our earnings growth. Second quarter 2016 normalized FFO totaled $1.04 per fully diluted share, representing 7% growth on a comparable basis over the second quarter of 2015. This strong year-over-year growth was driven by the carryover impact of 2015 investments, including Ardent, together with new year-to-date investments in 2016 and second quarter same-store NOI growth. 
Ventas made $65 million in new investments in the second quarter of 2016, including $30 million of acquisitions and $35 million of development and redevelopment spending during the quarter. We strengthened our balance sheet in Q2 through the issuance of a total of 3.5 million shares of common stock under our ATM for gross proceeds of approximately $232 million. We also capitalized on the strong debt capital markets and took refinancing risk off the table in the quarter. In June, we tendered, and ultimately retired in full the $550 million 1.55% senior notes maturing in September 2016. The September note was retired principally through the issuance of a $400 million 3/8 7-year unsecured note. Demand for Ventas' debt offering was very high, with the order book 7.5x oversubscribed. 
As a result of this cumulative capital activity during the quarter, we have an even healthier balance sheet and excellent liquidity. The company's net debt to EBITDA ratio improved from 6.1x at year-end 2015 to 5.8x at the end of the second quarter, ahead of our expectations. We have lowered gross debt by nearly $300 million since the beginning of the year. Our fixed charge coverage is exceptionally strong at 4.6x, and our debt to total capitalization is outstanding at 30%. 
And we did not stop there. Following the quarter-end, we elected to lock in our attractive return and accretion on the Wexford acquisition through a block equity issuance. Concurrent with deal announcement in early July, Ventas sold 10.3 million shares of common stock for total proceeds of $736 million at an issuance price of approximately $72 per share. We plan to hold the proceeds in cash until the Wexford closing. The temporary FFO cost of the strategy is $0.01 a month, notably dampening our Q3 FFO per share, assuming a Q4 Wexford closing. We believe the short run dilution of pre-funding is more than offset by the longer-term value creation of this strategy. 
And that's a good segue to our full year guidance for the company. We are updating our normalized FFO per share guidance for 2016 to a range of $4.05 to $4.13, representing 3% to 5% growth over 2015 on a comparable basis. Put simply, the modest $0.02 revision from previous guidance reflects paying $0.04 for the certainty that comes with the Wexford equity pre-funding as well as Q2 deleveraging, partially offset by the accretive impact of Wexford post close. Our second half FFO per share guidance is expected to be lower than our first half results, driven by these same factors. 
Setting aside capital activity, our underlying same-store portfolio performance is solid. On the heels of a healthy first half, we're raising the bottom end of our total 2016 same-store NOI guidance range by 50 basis points. 2016 same-store NOI is now estimated to grow in the range of 2% to 3%, up from the company's previous range of 1.5% to 3%. 
Our guidance continues to assume 2016 asset dispositions of approximately $500 million, inclusive of $75 million in dispositions closed year-to-date. No further material acquisitions, dispositions or capital activity are assumed in guidance. 
In summary, the entire Ventas team is proud of our productive and strong first half of the year and is committed to sustaining our track record of excellence. 
With that, I will ask the operator to please open the call for questions."

On the back of that, as you referenced, the rate-driven strategy, you see the strongest rates and NOI growth in those markets, and that's very much as expected. So we're really pleased with that. At the same time, the construction impact, again, very much in line with the initial guidance we gave in February and the framework we put around that. Indeed, the impact of the new units coming online is on the better end of the guidance that we gave in February. And as a consequence, net, net, net, when you step back and look at the portfolio in the first half, 2.5% growth above the midpoint of the guidance towards the higher end. So we feel very good about the first half and that is the core reason why we are raising the guidance for the back half of the year. The reason for the range continues to be very consistent with that framework of engine room performance continue to drive forward and potential variability, depending on the impact of new construction, and that's the reason for the range in the back half. But fundamentally, the confidence in the guidance is solid."

So that is the #1 factor in all deals, definitely. And obviously, our funding costs are critical because we are here to add value for shareholders, and so appropriate capital markets is extremely important. And I would say having a good relationship with Blackstone and the Wexford management team is a helpful, facilitated factor in the transaction as well. And the structure is always, I would say, a helpful factor, but normally, it's not this positive. It's really those cash flows. And here, when we look at Wexford and these are new assets, they're Class A assets, and about 3/4 of the NOI is from tenants who have investment-grade ratings, have billion-plus market caps, have AA rated -- or universities. That, to us, is a really good risk-adjusted return when you're looking at 10-plus year length of lease maturities. And so everything came together, I think, in a really positive way. The fact that we've looked at the deal before, I think really shows our discipline and patience, and that's really how we operate here.

I would say to you that the reliability of these cash flows is extremely high, and they will produce this reliable growth and income that Ventas prizes and that our investors prize. But it's a different game in Cambridge, really. And there's excellent players like Alexandria and Blackstone, who will invest in those 4, 5 cap rate markets and deal with the turnover and all of that. But Wexford sits with the Ventas business model, and that's really the key thing. It is a very reliable, consistent growth in income, with institutional tenants and even cross-selling opportunities with medical assets as well.

We are bullish on senior housing, short, medium, long-term, because when you look at the services that seniors get in senior housing communities, economically to replicate that at home is 2x as expensive, not to mention the social benefits of being part of a community, which are proven to be enhancing and extending life. And therefore, there's a great product offering here where affordability, importantly, affordability, if you look at net worth among seniors, affordability of senior housing is not the gating issue. They can afford comfortably, on average, to enter senior housing. So that, together with, of course, the aging population, the megatrend of longevity as a huge tailwind to this business give me and us confidence in that business. Now, within that, as you already point out, we've been driving a rate strategy in light of that value proposition. We think that's a smart move. That really is very much predicated on the annual rent letter. And that increase we saw this year, which was among the highest we've had, has held nicely and is proving out to be a good strategy. At the same time, we're being sensitive to the occupancy impacts. And this is proving out to be a good formula. One that will be dynamic though. I mean, we'll make sure we're managing well because it is a more complex equation between rate and occupancy. But nonetheless, we like where we are. The strategy is proving out very much in line with where we expect it to be. And then short, medium, long-term, this is a great business."

However, rate, we continue to expect, will be strong and to hold with where we are, and that is really important, in part, to cover costs. And therefore, the paradigm of the P&L is one of a revenue growth, very much in line with expense growth to deliver the guidance we gave for the year. So that's the P&L profile. I think if you look within construction markets, you'll see a different dynamic, where we still see rate growth albeit not as strong, and we do see some occupancy pressure. And so for that 30% of the portfolio, you do see a slightly different P&L. But again, because of the engine room, it's more than offset by the key markets to deliver the overall year."

We are delighted to be here with our colleagues to report on our strong results from our diverse, high-quality portfolio, discuss our pending investment in life sciences and medical real estate and provide color on macro trends. Following my remarks, our CFO, Bob Probst, will review our segment performance and financial results and walk through our full year guidance before we welcome your questions. 
We have great momentum at Ventas. Building off our superior properties, platforms and people, we extended our long track record of excellence this quarter. If you invest in Ventas for reliable growth and income on a strong balance sheet, then this is a good quarter for you. 
Leading these results, we delivered $1.04 in normalized FFO per share, representing 7% year-over-year comparable growth. And we remain on track for 3% to 5% normalized FFO growth this year. We were opportunistic in access to debt and equity capital markets, again demonstrating our commitments to financial strength and flexibility as well as our expertise in capital markets activity. 
As you know, we love cash flow because it enables us to reinvest in our business and pay you a dividend. Our strong and secure dividend yield of nearly 4% is very attractive and has plenty of room to continue to grow. 
Our strong performance is fueled by our market position at the exciting intersection of health care and real estate to large and dynamic industries with powerful fundamentals and growth prospects. Within this attractive space, our incredible team has made strategic decisions and executed our strategy with sustained excellence. As a result, we have differentiated our portfolio and our company, benefited our shareholders and shaped Ventas for continued success. 
Recent examples of our disciplined capital allocation moves include our successful spin-off of most of our skilled nursing business and our entry into the large growing hospital space with Ardent, both completed last year. The elevation and evolution of our business continued this year with our recent deal to announce -- to acquire $1.5 billion in high-quality life science and medical real estate operated by best-in-class developer, Wexford. We believe the Wexford deal is both financially and strategically attractive. With the going in cash yield on stabilized assets of 6.8%, it is a wonderful fit with our goal of delivering reliable growth and income through cycles. This investment represents an accretive, institutional-quality entry into the large and growing health care-driven research and development space. It adds an adjacent business line that further diversifies our portfolio and cash flows and adds a large component of private pay NOI to our business mix. The powerful combination of attractive properties, superior platforms and outstanding people creates the Ventas Advantage. All 3 are on display with the Wexford deal. 
The 25 Wexford properties we will acquire are new Class A assets that are environmentally advanced and architecturally appealing. I hope you'll go to our website for a property tour to see this portfolio. The assets are also well leased to highly rated top-tier universities, academic medical centers and research companies, including Yale, U Penn Medicine, Wash U, Duke and Wake Forest. Like other areas of our business, our prospective tenants are market leaders. The universities in our portfolio account for fully 10% of all university life sciences research and development spending in the U.S. That's an outstanding way to enter a new space. It was really fun to travel up and down the East Coast with Ryan recently, visiting these hotbeds of academic and commercial research, cutting-edge medical activity, innovation and education. 
The Wexford acquisition also creates another superior platform for Ventas growth. The Wexford team has a terrific reputation within the sophisticated tight knit community of elite universities. Demand is increasing as universities face difficult decisions about capital allocation. In this environment, combining Ventas' capital with a trusted developer who can deliver complex projects that benefit leading institutions should be a winning formula. 
We have an exclusive pipeline for growth with Wexford, with 2 assets under development coming online in 2017 and 9 development sites available to satisfy growing demand in research hubs anchored by leading universities. We already have identified one potential new development project adjacent to U Penn Medical, which could get green lighted soon. We're hopeful we can grow the business like we have with Lillibridge and Atria. 
The Ventas people and culture were once again truly exceptional in the Wexford deal. We have always admired the Wexford business and have worked on it many times in the past. So when we were recently presented with the opportunity to acquire it, we were a knowledgeable buyer with an incredibly fast, sophisticated and interdisciplinary team. With our deep knowledge of the business and assets, substantial trust among the players, a good structure and accommodative capital market, we were able to execute with excellence. If luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity, then Ventas is lucky indeed. Hats off to the team. And thanks to the many Ventas investors who participated in our Wexford equity funding in July. We sincerely appreciate your support. 
Next, I'd like to comment briefly on the investment market. We are remaining highly selective as we consider investment opportunities in the current market. Our cost of capital has improved significantly, but we will only execute on deals we believe will generate reliable earnings growth at an appropriate risk-adjusted return. Thus, our focus continues to be on committing capital to high-quality hospitals, helping our customers grow and funding selective development and redevelopment projects. With the addition of Wexford, we expect our capital allocation to preleased university-based development projects to represent a larger percentage of our investment pie. We believe strongly in our ability to invest capital across cycles to create value for our investors and customers. This confidence flows from the combination of our advantaged position within 5 and soon to be 6 asset classes, our relationships with market leading customers and platforms and our team's hard-earned experience and skill. 
Before closing, it's worthwhile to spend a few minutes on the macro environment. In the health care arena, we see an acceleration of the transition to value-based payment model. Just this week, CMS announced that it will layer on additional mandatory bundling for cardiac care in 2017. This and other developments support our theses that hospitals are beginning to exert even more influence in post-acute patient care and cost, and that revenue streams for skilled nursing providers will likely remain under pressure in the near term. In the longer term, diversified post-acute care providers like Kindred, who can deliver quality care in a variety of settings, maintain a sound capital structure and adequate liquidity, and enjoy the benefits of scale should have a competitive advantage. 
From an economic and market standpoint, we are benefiting from multiple tailwinds that favor our business, including domestic GDP growth that continues to hover in the low single-digits, a global thirst for yield, the creation of a new REIT global industry classification and historically low long-term borrowing rates. In this environment, U.S. real estate and Ventas should thrive. With our need-based demographically-driven business model, a superb track record of consistent, reliable growth, external investment opportunities, a best-in-class credit profile, a differentiated business mix that is 84% private pay and a secure, nearly 4% dividend, Ventas should continue to be a magnet for investment dollars. 
Now, to talk about our positive quarter, I'm happy to turn the call over to Bob."

I'm pleased to report solid earnings growth on an even stronger balance sheet in the second quarter. Let me jump right into the performance of our high-quality health care and senior housing properties, which together delivered same-store cash NOI growth of 3.5% for the nearly 1,200 assets in the company's quarterly same-store total portfolio. Performance in the quarter was led by our triple-net lease business, which accounts for 43% of our NOI. Triple-net reported same-store cash NOI growth was 6.2% in Q2 versus the prior year. Growth in the quarter benefited from a $3.5 million cash fee associated with the previously announced collaborative agreements between Ventas and Kindred. Excluding the Kindred fee, triple-net same-store cash NOI grew 4.1% in the quarter, principally reflecting strong in-place lease escalations. Cash flow coverage in our overall stabilized triple-net lease portfolio for the first quarter of 2016, the latest available quarterly information, improved 10 basis points sequentially to 1.7x. This strong coverage level reflects the quality of our triple-net lease properties and of our operators. Coverage in our triple-net same-store senior housing portfolio remained stable at 1.3x. Coverage trends were supported by low-single-digit EBITDARM growth at the asset level for the trailing 12 months. 
Our decision to spin off the majority of our post-acute portfolio in 2015 continues to be validated. Our remaining post-acute portfolio, where SNFs now represent only 4% of our NOI, demonstrated market leading same-store cash flow coverage at 2x in Q1 of 2016. 
Finally, Ardent triple-net coverage held steady at 3x, and continues to perform well at the assets. Ardent showed positive momentum in top and bottom line key performance indicators in both the first and second quarters. With the strong first half of the year and the majority of lease escalations now in place for 2016, we are pleased to update our forecast for the triple-net segment to grow reported full year same-store NOI in the range of 3.5% to 4%, an increase of 75 basis points at the midpoint. 
We are happy to report another solid quarter in our SHOP portfolio, generating Q2 same-store cash NOI growth of 2.1% versus the prior year. This result is right in line with our expectations and reflects our most challenging year-over-year comparison period in 2015. The framework by which we established our SHOP guidance range for the year is holding up very well in both the second quarter and the first half of the year. And with the first half now under our belt, we have performed at the higher end of our guidance range, with H1 growth of 2.5% versus prior year on a reported basis. 
In the second quarter, as expected, our rate-driven strategy continued to fuel our earnings with REVPOR growth of nearly 4%. Our high barrier-to-entry infill coastal markets continued to be the engine room of our overall SHOP portfolio growth in the second quarter. These communities, which represent approximately 70% of our SHOP NOI, grew Q2 same-store NOI mid-single digits on continued strong rate growth. Major coastal markets, including New York, LA and Boston, continued to drive consistently outstanding growth in both rates and NOI in the quarter and the first half. In select markets, we observed the impact of new construction coming online within our relevant trade areas. In these communities, same-store NOI posted low single-digit declines in aggregate, driven by occupancy and wage pressures. Again, this performance is consistent with our framework for the approximately 30% of our SHOP portfolio located in markets with the new construction surplus. 
Construction as a percentage of inventory in our trade areas, as reported by NIC, increased in the quarter by 40 basis points to 4.8%. Importantly, however, the amount of our SHOP NOI that is affected by new supply remains at roughly 30%. We have observed that a significant number of projected openings, as reported by NIC, have been delayed into 2017, and that anecdotally, financing and completing new developments may be getting more challenging. 
Overall, we are pleased with our SHOP performance through the first half of the year. We are, therefore, raising our full year guidance for SHOP reported cash NOI in the full year same-store asset pool to grow in the range of 1.5% to 3%, up from our 1% to 3% range previously communicated. Strong rate growth on lower year-over-year occupancy, led by our high barrier-to-entry markets, is expected to fuel this NOI performance. 
Let me close out the segment review with our MOB business, which represents 20% of Ventas' overall NOI. MOB cash NOI in the 353-property quarterly same-store pool grew nearly 1% in the second quarter and increased 2.3% in the first half. Both the second quarter and the first half benefited from in-place rent escalations and continued cost productivity from the Lillibridge platform, partially offset by lower occupancy. For the balance of the year, we are actively filling the leasing pipeline to backfill budgeted move outs and to cover increased repair and maintenance costs expected in the back half of the year. For the full year 2016, we continue to forecast the MOB segment will grow same-store cash NOI for the full year asset pool in the range of 1% to 2%. 
Turning now to our overall financial results. This was a very busy and productive quarter for Ventas. In the second quarter, we generated strong FFO growth, reduced refinancing risk while capitalizing on favorable market conditions and further strengthened our credit profile. 
First, our earnings growth. Second quarter 2016 normalized FFO totaled $1.04 per fully diluted share, representing 7% growth on a comparable basis over the second quarter of 2015. This strong year-over-year growth was driven by the carryover impact of 2015 investments, including Ardent, together with new year-to-date investments in 2016 and second quarter same-store NOI growth. 
Ventas made $65 million in new investments in the second quarter of 2016, including $30 million of acquisitions and $35 million of development and redevelopment spending during the quarter. We strengthened our balance sheet in Q2 through the issuance of a total of 3.5 million shares of common stock under our ATM for gross proceeds of approximately $232 million. We also capitalized on the strong debt capital markets and took refinancing risk off the table in the quarter. In June, we tendered, and ultimately retired in full, the $550 million 1.55% senior notes maturing in September 2016. The September note was retired principally through the issuance of a $400 million 3.125% 7-year unsecured note. Demand for Ventas' debt offering was very high, with the order book 7.5x oversubscribed. 
As a result of this cumulative capital activity during the quarter, we have an even healthier balance sheet and excellent liquidity. The company's net debt to EBITDA ratio improved from 6.1x at year-end 2015 to 5.8x at the end of the second quarter, ahead of our expectations. We have lowered gross debt by nearly $300 million since the beginning of the year. Our fixed charge coverage is exceptionally strong at 4.6x, and our debt to total capitalization is outstanding at 30%. 
And we did not stop there. Following the quarter-end, we elected to lock in our attractive return and accretion on the Wexford acquisition through a block equity issuance. Concurrent with deal announcement in early July, Ventas sold 10.3 million shares of common stock for total proceeds of $736 million at an issuance price of approximately $72 per share. We plan to hold the proceeds in cash until the Wexford closing. The temporary FFO cost of the strategy is $0.01 a month, notably dampening our Q3 FFO per share, assuming a Q4 Wexford closing. We believe the short run dilution of pre-funding is more than offset by the longer-term value creation of this strategy. 
And that's a good segue to our full year guidance for the company. We are updating our normalized FFO per share guidance for 2016 to a range of $4.05 to $4.13, representing 3% to 5% growth over 2015 on a comparable basis. Put simply, the modest $0.02 revision from previous guidance reflects paying $0.04 for the certainty that comes with the Wexford equity pre-funding as well as Q2 deleveraging, partially offset by the accretive impact of Wexford post close. Our second half FFO per share guidance is expected to be lower than our first half results, driven by these same factors. 
Setting aside capital activity, our underlying same-store portfolio performance is solid. On the heels of a healthy first half, we're raising the bottom end of our total 2016 same-store NOI guidance range by 50 basis points. 2016 same-store NOI is now estimated to grow in the range of 2% to 3%, up from the company's previous range of 1.5% to 3%. 
Our guidance continues to assume 2016 asset dispositions of approximately $500 million, inclusive of $75 million in dispositions closed year-to-date. No further material acquisitions, dispositions or capital activity are assumed in guidance. 
In summary, the entire Ventas team is proud of our productive and strong first half of the year and is committed to sustaining our track record of excellence. 
With that, I will ask the operator to please open the call for questions."

On the back of that, as you referenced, the rate-driven strategy, you see the strongest rates and NOI growth in those markets, and that's very much as expected. So we're really pleased with that. At the same time, the construction impact, again, very much in line with the initial guidance we gave in February and the framework we put around that. Indeed, the impact of the new units coming online is on the better end of the guidance that we gave in February. And as a consequence, net, net, net, when you step back and look at the portfolio in the first half, 2.5% growth above the midpoint of the guidance towards the higher end. So we feel very good about the first half and that is the core reason why we are raising the guidance for the back half of the year. The reason for the range continues to be very consistent with that framework of engine room performance continuing to drive forward and potential variability, depending on the impact of new construction, and that's the reason for the range in the back half. But fundamentally, the confidence in the guidance is solid."

And obviously, our funding costs are critical because we are here to add value for shareholders, and so appropriate capital markets is extremely important. And I would say having a good relationship with Blackstone and the Wexford management team is a helpful, facilitated factor in the transaction as well. And the structure is always, I would say, a helpful factor, but normally, it's not this positive. It's really those cash flows. And here, when we look at Wexford and these are new assets, they're Class A assets, and about 3/4 of the NOI is from tenants who have investment-grade ratings, have billion-plus market caps, have AA rated -- or universities. That, to us, is a really good risk-adjusted return when you're looking at 10-plus year length of lease maturities. And so everything came together, I think, in a really positive way. The fact that we've looked at the deal before, I think really shows our discipline and patience, and that's really how we operate here.

We are bullish on senior housing, short, medium, long-term, because when you look at the services that seniors get in senior housing communities, economically to replicate that at home is 2x as expensive, not to mention the social benefits of being part of a community, which are proven to be enhancing and extending life. And therefore, there's a great product offering here where affordability, importantly, affordability, if you look at net worth among seniors, affordability of senior housing is not the gating issue. They can afford comfortably, on average, to enter senior housing. So that, together with, of course, the aging population, the megatrend of longevity as a huge tailwind to this business give me and us confidence in that business. Now, within that, as you already point out, we've been driving a rate strategy in light of that value proposition. We think that's a smart move. That really is very much predicated on the annual rent letter. And that increase we saw this year, which was among the highest we've had, has held nicely and is proving out to be a good strategy. At the same time, we're being sensitive to the occupancy impacts. And this is proving out to be a good formula. One that will be dynamic though. I mean, we'll make sure we're managing well because it is a more complex equation between rate and occupancy. But nonetheless, again, we like where we are. The strategy is proving out very much in line with where we expect it to be. And then short, medium, long-term, this is a great business."

So looking at the guidance for the year in the back half, what we expect to happen is we narrowed the gap, if you look year-over-year, in terms of occupancy, relative to the first quarter to the second. That said, still lower than last year. We hope to continue to narrow that gap. But on a full year basis, occupancy will be below prior year. However, rate, we continue to expect, will be strong and to hold with where we are, and that is really important, in part, to cover costs. And therefore, the paradigm of the P&L is one of a revenue growth very much in line with expense growth to deliver the guidance we gave for the year. So that's the P&L profile. I think if you look within construction markets, you'll see a different dynamic where we still see rate growth, albeit not as strong, and we do see some occupancy pressure. And so for that 30% of the portfolio, you do see a slightly different P&L. But again, because of the engine room, it's more than offset by the key markets to deliver the overall year."

We are delighted to be here with our colleagues to report on our strong results from our diverse, high-quality portfolio, discuss our pending investment in life sciences and medical real estate and provide color on macro trends. Following my remarks, our CFO, Bob Probst, will review our segment performance and financial results and walk through our full year guidance before we welcome your questions. 
We have great momentum at Ventas. Building off our superior properties, platforms and people, we extended our long track record of excellence this quarter. If you invest in Ventas for reliable growth and income on a strong balance sheet, then this is a good quarter for you. 
Leading these results, we delivered $1.04 in normalized FFO per share, representing 7% year-over-year comparable growth. And we remain on track for 3% to 5% normalized FFO growth this year. We were opportunistic in access to debt and equity capital markets, again demonstrating our commitments to financial strength and flexibility as well as our expertise in capital markets activity. 
As you know, we love cash flow because it enables us to reinvest in our business and pay you a dividend. Our strong and secure dividend yield of nearly 4% is very attractive and has plenty of room to continue to grow. 
Our strong performance is fueled by our market position at the exciting intersection of health care and real estate to large and dynamic industries with powerful fundamentals and growth prospects. Within this attractive space, our incredible team has made strategic decisions and executed our strategy with sustained excellence. As a result, we have differentiated our portfolio and our company, benefited our shareholders and shaped Ventas for continued success. 
Recent examples of our disciplined capital allocation moves include our successful spin-off of most of our skilled nursing business and our entry into the large growing hospital space with Ardent, both completed last year. The elevation and evolution of our business continued this year with our recent deal to announce -- to acquire $1.5 billion in high-quality life science and medical real estate operated by best-in-class developer, Wexford. We believe the Wexford deal is both financially and strategically attractive. With the going in cash yield on stabilized assets of 6.8%, it is a wonderful fit with our goal of delivering reliable growth and income through cycles. This investment represents an accretive, institutional-quality entry into the large and growing health care-driven research and development space. It adds an adjacent business line that further diversifies our portfolio and cash flows and adds a large component of private pay NOI to our business mix. The powerful combination of attractive properties, superior platforms and outstanding people creates the Ventas Advantage. All 3 are on display with the Wexford deal. 
The 25 Wexford properties we will acquire are new Class A assets that are environmentally advanced and architecturally appealing. I hope you'll go to our website for a property tour to see this portfolio. The assets are also well leased to highly rated top-tier universities, academic medical centers and research companies, including Yale, U Penn Medicine, Wash U, Duke and Wake Forest. Like other areas of our business, our prospective tenants are market leaders. The universities in our portfolio account for fully 10% of all university life sciences research and development spending in the U.S. That's an outstanding way to enter a new space. It was really fun to travel up and down the East Coast with Ryan recently, visiting these hotbeds of academic and commercial research, cutting-edge medical activity, innovation and education. 
The Wexford acquisition also creates another superior platform for Ventas growth. The Wexford team has a terrific reputation within the sophisticated tight knit community of elite universities. Demand is increasing as universities face difficult decisions about capital allocation. In this environment, combining Ventas' capital with a trusted developer who can deliver complex projects that benefit leading institutions should be a winning formula. 
We have an exclusive pipeline for growth with Wexford, with 2 assets under development coming online in 2017 and 9 development sites available to satisfy growing demand in research hubs anchored by leading universities. We already have identified one potential new development project adjacent to U Penn Medical, which could get green lighted soon. We're hopeful we can grow the business like we have with Lillibridge and Atria. 
The Ventas people and culture were once again truly exceptional in the Wexford deal. We have always admired the Wexford business and have worked on it many times in the past. So when we were recently presented with the opportunity to acquire it, we were a knowledgeable buyer with an incredibly fast, sophisticated and interdisciplinary team. With our deep knowledge of the business and assets, substantial trust among the players, a good structure and accommodative capital market, we were able to execute with excellence. If luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity, then Ventas is lucky indeed. Hats off to the team. And thanks to the many Ventas investors who participated in our Wexford equity funding in July. We sincerely appreciate your support. 
Next, I'd like to comment briefly on the investment market. We are remaining highly selective as we consider investment opportunities in the current market. Our cost of capital has improved significantly, but we will only execute on deals we believe will generate reliable earnings growth at an appropriate risk-adjusted return. Thus, our focus continues to be on committing capital to high-quality hospitals, helping our customers grow and funding selective development and redevelopment projects. With the addition of Wexford, we expect our capital allocation to preleased university-based development projects to represent a larger percentage of our investment pie. We believe strongly in our ability to invest capital across cycles to create value for our investors and customers. This confidence flows from the combination of our advantaged position within 5 and soon to be 6 asset classes, our relationships with market leading customers and platforms and our team's hard-earned experience and skill. 
Before closing, it's worthwhile to spend a few minutes on the macro environment. In the health care arena, we see an acceleration of the transition to value-based payment model. Just this week, CMS announced that it will layer on additional mandatory bundling for cardiac care in 2017. This and other developments support our theses that hospitals are beginning to exert even more influence in post-acute patient care and cost, and that revenue streams for skilled nursing providers will likely remain under pressure in the near term. In the longer term, diversified post-acute care providers like Kindred, who can deliver quality care in a variety of settings, maintain a sound capital structure and adequate liquidity, and enjoy the benefits of scale should have a competitive advantage. 
From an economic and market standpoint, we are benefiting from multiple tailwinds that favor our business, including domestic GDP growth that continues to hover in the low single-digits, a global thirst for yield, the creation of a new REIT global industry classification and historically low long-term borrowing rates. In this environment, U.S. real estate and Ventas should thrive. With our need-based demographically-driven business model, a superb track record of consistent, reliable growth, external investment opportunities, a best-in-class credit profile, a differentiated business mix that is 84% private pay and a secure, nearly 4% dividend, Ventas should continue to be a magnet for investment dollars. 
Now, to talk about our positive quarter, I'm happy to turn the call over to Bob."

I'm pleased to report solid earnings growth on an even stronger balance sheet in the second quarter. Let me jump right into the performance of our high-quality health care and senior housing properties, which together delivered same-store cash NOI growth of 3.5% for the nearly 1,200 assets in the company's quarterly same-store total portfolio. Performance in the quarter was led by our triple-net lease business, which accounts for 43% of our NOI. Triple-net reported same-store cash NOI growth was 6.2% in Q2 versus the prior year. Growth in the quarter benefited from a $3.5 million cash fee associated with the previously announced collaborative agreements between Ventas and Kindred. Excluding the Kindred fee, triple-net same-store cash NOI grew 4.1% in the quarter, principally reflecting strong in-place lease escalations. Cash flow coverage in our overall stabilized triple-net lease portfolio for the first quarter of 2016, the latest available quarterly information, improved 10 basis points sequentially to 1.7x. This strong coverage level reflects the quality of our triple-net lease properties and of our operators. Coverage in our triple-net same-store senior housing portfolio remained stable at 1.3x. Coverage trends were supported by low-single-digit EBITDARM growth at the asset level for the trailing 12 months. 
Our decision to spin off the majority of our post-acute portfolio in 2015 continues to be validated. Our remaining post-acute portfolio, where SNFs now represent only 4% of our NOI, demonstrated market leading same-store cash flow coverage at 2x in Q1 of 2016. 
Finally, Ardent triple-net coverage held steady at 3x, and continues to perform well at the assets. Ardent showed positive momentum in top and bottom line key performance indicators in both the first and second quarters. With the strong first half of the year and the majority of lease escalations now in place for 2016, we are pleased to update our forecast for the triple-net segment to grow reported full year same-store NOI in the range of 3.5% to 4%, an increase of 75 basis points at the midpoint. 
We are happy to report another solid quarter in our SHOP portfolio, generating Q2 same-store cash NOI growth of 2.1% versus the prior year. This result is right in line with our expectations and reflects our most challenging year-over-year comparison period in 2015. The framework by which we established our SHOP guidance range for the year is holding up very well in both the second quarter and the first half of the year. And with the first half now under our belt, we have performed at the higher end of our guidance range, with H1 growth of 2.5% versus prior year on a reported basis. 
In the second quarter, as expected, our rate-driven strategy continued to fuel our earnings with REVPOR growth of nearly 4%. Our high barrier-to-entry infill coastal markets continued to be the engine room of our overall SHOP portfolio growth in the second quarter. These communities, which represent approximately 70% of our SHOP NOI, grew Q2 same-store NOI mid-single digits on continued strong rate growth. Major coastal markets, including New York, LA and Boston, continued to drive consistently outstanding growth in both rates and NOI in the quarter and the first half. In select markets, we observed the impact of new construction coming online within our relevant trade areas. In these communities, same-store NOI posted low single-digit declines in aggregate, driven by occupancy and wage pressures. Again, this performance is consistent with our framework for the approximately 30% of our SHOP portfolio located in markets with the new construction surplus. 
Construction as a percentage of inventory in our trade areas, as reported by NIC, increased in the quarter by 40 basis points to 4.8%. Importantly, however, the amount of our SHOP NOI that is affected by new supply remains at roughly 30%. We have observed that a significant number of projected openings, as reported by NIC, have been delayed into 2017, and that anecdotally, financing and completing new developments may be getting more challenging. 
Overall, we are pleased with our SHOP performance through the first half of the year. We are, therefore, raising our full year guidance for SHOP reported cash NOI in the full year same-store asset pool to grow in the range of 1.5% to 3%, up from our 1% to 3% range previously communicated. Strong rate growth on lower year-over-year occupancy, led by our high barrier-to-entry markets, is expected to fuel this NOI performance. 
Let me close out the segment review with our MOB business, which represents 20% of Ventas' overall NOI. MOB cash NOI in the 353-property quarterly same-store pool grew nearly 1% in the second quarter and increased 2.3% in the first half. Both the second quarter and the first half benefited from in-place rent escalations and continued cost productivity from the Lillibridge platform, partially offset by lower occupancy. For the balance of the year, we are actively filling the leasing pipeline to backfill budgeted move outs and to cover increased repair and maintenance costs expected in the back half of the year. For the full year 2016, we continue to forecast the MOB segment will grow same-store cash NOI for the full year asset pool in the range of 1% to 2%. 
Turning now to our overall financial results. This was a very busy and productive quarter for Ventas. In the second quarter, we generated strong FFO growth, reduced refinancing risk while capitalizing on favorable market conditions and further strengthened our credit profile. 
First, our earnings growth. Second quarter 2016 normalized FFO totaled $1.04 per fully diluted share, representing 7% growth on a comparable basis over the second quarter of 2015. This strong year-over-year growth was driven by the carryover impact of 2015 investments, including Ardent, together with new year-to-date investments in 2016 and second quarter same-store NOI growth. 
Ventas made $65 million in new investments in the second quarter of 2016, including $30 million of acquisitions and $35 million of development and redevelopment spending during the quarter. We strengthened our balance sheet in Q2 through the issuance of a total of 3.5 million shares of common stock under our ATM for gross proceeds of approximately $232 million. We also capitalized on the strong debt capital markets and took refinancing risk off the table in the quarter. In June, we tendered, and ultimately retired in full, the $550 million 1.55% senior notes maturing in September 2016. The September note was retired principally through the issuance of a $400 million 3.125% 7-year unsecured note. Demand for Ventas' debt offering was very high, with the order book 7.5x oversubscribed. 
As a result of this cumulative capital activity during the quarter, we have an even healthier balance sheet and excellent liquidity. The company's net debt to EBITDA ratio improved from 6.1x at year-end 2015 to 5.8x at the end of the second quarter, ahead of our expectations. We have lowered gross debt by nearly $300 million since the beginning of the year. Our fixed charge coverage is exceptionally strong at 4.6x, and our debt to total capitalization is outstanding at 30%. 
And we did not stop there. Following the quarter-end, we elected to lock in our attractive return and accretion on the Wexford acquisition through a block equity issuance. Concurrent with deal announcement in early July, Ventas sold 10.3 million shares of common stock for total proceeds of $736 million at an issuance price of approximately $72 per share. We plan to hold the proceeds in cash until the Wexford closing. The temporary FFO cost of the strategy is $0.01 a month, notably dampening our Q3 FFO per share, assuming a Q4 Wexford closing. We believe the short run dilution of pre-funding is more than offset by the longer-term value creation of this strategy. 
And that's a good segue to our full year guidance for the company. We are updating our normalized FFO per share guidance for 2016 to a range of $4.05 to $4.13, representing 3% to 5% growth over 2015 on a comparable basis. Put simply, the modest $0.02 revision from previous guidance reflects paying $0.04 for the certainty that comes with the Wexford equity pre-funding as well as Q2 deleveraging, partially offset by the accretive impact of Wexford post close. Our second half FFO per share guidance is expected to be lower than our first half results, driven by these same factors. 
Setting aside capital activity, our underlying same-store portfolio performance is solid. On the heels of a healthy first half, we're raising the bottom end of our total 2016 same-store NOI guidance range by 50 basis points. 2016 same-store NOI is now estimated to grow in the range of 2% to 3%, up from the company's previous range of 1.5% to 3%. 
Our guidance continues to assume 2016 asset dispositions of approximately $500 million, inclusive of $75 million in dispositions closed year-to-date. No further material acquisitions, dispositions or capital activity are assumed in guidance. 
In summary, the entire Ventas team is proud of our productive and strong first half of the year and is committed to sustaining our track record of excellence. 
With that, I will ask the operator to please open the call for questions."

On the back of that, as you referenced, the rate-driven strategy, you see the strongest rates and NOI growth in those markets, and that's very much as expected. So we're really pleased with that. At the same time, the construction impact, again, very much in line with the initial guidance we gave in February and the framework we put around that. Indeed, the impact of the new units coming online is on the better end of the guidance that we gave in February. And as a consequence, net, net, net, when you step back and look at the portfolio in the first half, 2.5% growth above the midpoint of the guidance towards the higher end. So we feel very good about the first half and that is the core reason why we are raising the guidance for the back half of the year. The reason for the range continues to be very consistent with that framework of engine room performance continuing to drive forward and potential variability, depending on the impact of new construction, and that's the reason for the range in the back half. But fundamentally, the confidence in the guidance is solid."

And obviously, our funding costs are critical because we are here to add value for shareholders, and so appropriate capital markets is extremely important. And I would say having a good relationship with Blackstone and the Wexford management team is a helpful, facilitated factor in the transaction as well. And the structure is always, I would say, a helpful factor, but normally, it's not this positive. It's really those cash flows. And here, when we look at Wexford and these are new assets, they're Class A assets, and about 3/4 of the NOI is from tenants who have investment-grade ratings, have billion-plus market caps, have AA rated -- or universities. That, to us, is a really good risk-adjusted return when you're looking at 10-plus year length of lease maturities. And so everything came together, I think, in a really positive way. The fact that we've looked at the deal before, I think really shows our discipline and patience, and that's really how we operate here.

We are bullish on senior housing, short, medium, long-term, because when you look at the services that seniors get in senior housing communities, economically to replicate that at home is 2x as expensive, not to mention the social benefits of being part of a community, which are proven to be enhancing and extending life. And therefore, there's a great product offering here where affordability, importantly, affordability, if you look at net worth among seniors, affordability of senior housing is not the gating issue. They can afford comfortably, on average, to enter senior housing. So that, together with, of course, the aging population, the megatrend of longevity as a huge tailwind to this business give me and us confidence in that business. Now, within that, as you already point out, we've been driving a rate strategy in light of that value proposition. We think that's a smart move. That really is very much predicated on the annual rent letter. And that increase we saw this year, which was among the highest we've had, has held nicely and is proving out to be a good strategy. At the same time, we're being sensitive to the occupancy impacts. And this is proving out to be a good formula. One that will be dynamic though. I mean, we'll make sure we're managing well because it is a more complex equation between rate and occupancy. But nonetheless, again, we like where we are. The strategy is proving out very much in line with where we expect it to be. And then short, medium, long-term, this is a great business."

So maybe if you could just explain how we should be thinking about your guidance and what it assumes for, I don't know, I forget if this has been mentioned yet, but occupancy, whether it's sort of declining year-over-year, if that's built into the guidance in the back half of the year."

That said, still lower than last year. We hope to continue to narrow that gap. But on a full year basis, occupancy will be below prior year. However, rate, we continue to expect, will be strong and to hold with where we are, and that is really important, in part, to cover costs. And therefore, the paradigm of the P&L is one of a revenue growth very much in line with expense growth to deliver the guidance we gave for the year. So that's the P&L profile. I think if you look within construction markets, you'll see a different dynamic where we still see rate growth, albeit not as strong, and we do see some occupancy pressure. And so for that 30% of the portfolio, you do see a slightly different P&L. But again, because of the engine room, it's more than offset by the key markets to deliver the overall year."

We are delighted to report on our strong financial results brought to you courtesy of the Ventas advantage, our excellent people, platforms and properties. Today, I'll also discuss our closed and pending major transactions and provide an overview of economic and market conditions. Because we've been so productive, there's a lot to cover. Following my remarks, Bob Probst will review our segment performance, financial results and full year expectations. After that, we will welcome your questions. 
Leading with results. This quarter, we delivered $1.03 in normalized FFO per share representing 5% year-over-year comparable growth. We also demonstrated capital markets excellence and positive trends in our credit profile. As a result, we are also pleased to improve our full year normalized FFO per share and same-store NOI guidance. Our strong and consistent performance is fueled by our market position at the exciting intersection of health care and real estate to large and dynamic industries with powerful fundamentals and gross prospects. Recent activities continue to demonstrate that we are executing on our strategy, allocating capital wisely and doing what we say, a Ventas hallmark. We have built an exceptional enterprise that continues to deliver reliable growth and income from a high quality, diverse portfolio on a strong balance sheet. 
Our innovations over the years, and especially the spin-off of most of our skilled nursing assets and other developments since the third quarter of 2015, have produced a differentiated business mix and put us in a great position for continued success. Let me highlight just a few of the platforms and properties that are driving our positive outlook. First, during the quarter, we closed on our exciting and accretive $1.5 billion acquisition of institutional quality life science, innovation and medical real estate leased by top universities, academic medical centers and research companies. Our new tenants include Yale, U Penn Medicine and Wash U. Like other areas of our business, our tenants are market leaders accounting for fully 10% of all university life science, research and development spending in the U.S. 
This investment represents a great entry into the large and growing health care-related R&D space. It adds an adjacent business line to Ventas that further diversifies our portfolio and cash flows. At a 6.8% going in cash yield for the 23 Class A operating properties, we are delighted with the Wexford investment. We are also benefiting from an exclusive development pipeline with Wexford. There are 2 assets already under development in the portfolio anchored by Duke and Wake Forest and 9 development sites for future growth. We are already making progress on a high profile, potential new development project adjacent to U Penn Medical. This demonstrates the attractive growth opportunities that should flow from combining Ventas' capital with best-in-class developer, Wexford. 
Likewise, our investment in Ardent has proven to be a channel for growth. Last year, during the third quarter, we closed our acquisition of Ardent's hospital real estate and articulated a vision for building a formidable, high-quality hospital business in this large, dynamic space. We chose Ardent as our beachhead investment because it is a winner and potential consolidator with its good hospitals, significant market presence, attractive payer mix, good quality of care and strong margins. We also designed a growth strategy that focused on scaling Ardent's experienced management team and strong infrastructure. At that time, we identified some desirable acquisition targets, and Legacy Hospital Partners, or LHP, was at the top of the list because it shared these desirable characteristics. We're now happy to say that Ardent has inked a deal to acquire LHP, just like we drew it up on the board. 
As health care's premier capital provider, Ventas is fueling Ardent's growth by providing a $700 million secured loan enabling Ardent to acquire LHP. This deal is attractive both financially and strategically for all Ardent partners, and shows our continued ability to align with market leaders to support their growth. Financially, the loan will be accretive to Ventas' 2017 earnings with a going in floating interest rate of approximately 8%. Ardent will remain financially strong and expects to achieve significant synergies. We're happy to say that Ardent continues to perform very well on it's based business through the third quarter. 
Strategically, the LHP acquisition expands Ardent's existing business by 50% making it the second-largest privately owned hospital company in the U.S. with annual pro forma revenues of $3 billion and major market share in its diversified locations. It also provides Ardent with very valuable partnerships with top not-for-profit health systems and academic medical centers. As a result, the LHP hospitals enjoy strong brand recognition, clinical integration good markets and favorable payer relationships. We expect the Ardent-LHP deal and our loan to close in the first quarter of 2017 subject to customary, regulatory and other conditions. 
Ventas is committed to being a positive influence in our industry to maintaining strong relationships with the nation's leading providers of care and to working collaboratively with them to create value. Recently, across our business lines, we've made good progress advancing our customers' interests in areas important to them. Here are a few examples. First, we recently reached mutually beneficial agreements to modify our decade-long agreements with Sunrise Senior Living. In short, we provided long-term stability and the management contracts with Sunrise, and Sunrise agreed to reduce the management fees we pay under those agreements on a permanent basis. Other changes to the agreements align the companies toward profitable growth and enables Sunrise and its dedicated on-site employees to focus on providing superior services to seniors and their family. We also entered into a new multi-year pipeline agreement with Sunrise, giving Ventas the right to fund a pool of new Sunrise ground-up developments. 
Second, we have also reached agreements with various customers to cooperate with them on modest asset sales or asset buybacks. These included the recently completed sale of 7 long-term acute care hospitals, or LTACs, with Kindred to a new operator and a pending disposition of 11 nonstrategic senior living assets with Brookdale. This approach can give the care providers operating flexibility and higher cash flow and also enable Ventas to recycle capital into attractive development, redevelopment or acquisition opportunities. We are committed to finding ways to support our customers' efforts to improve their own results and performance in ways that also benefit our portfolio and protect Ventas shareholders. As a result of our portfolio performance and accretive acquisitions, we drove good cash flow from operations this quarter 2, enabling us to pay our investors a strong and secure dividend of over 4%. We expect our board to increase our dividend in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
When we look at the investment market, we continue to see attractive opportunities, but we remain highly selective. We focus on deals that will generate reliable cash flow and cash flow growth at an appropriate risk-adjusted return. Our capital allocation is also strategic emphasizing sectors with upside and situations like Lillibridge, Atria, Wexford and Ardent, where significant future growth potential exists from consolidation and/or development. Our ability to invest capital across cycles to deliver value to our investors comes from the combination of our advantaged position within 6 asset classes or verticals, our strong relationships with market-leading customers and platforms and our team's hard-earned experience and skills. 
The macro environment on balance [ph] continues to be favorable including GDP growth in the 2% to 3% range and a global thirst for yield that is accelerating foreign investment into U.S. real estate. While the expectation of higher interest rates can initially dampen enthusiasm for REITs and real estate, we are still enjoying the benefit of incredibly low long-term borrowing rates, reasonable job growth, rising household incomes, low inflation and improving corporate confidence, as expressed in surging M&A activity. Hopefully, we will also have certainty about the election soon. All of these conditions should be positive for commercial real estate fundamentals and growth. 
At Ventas, with our needs-based, demographically-driven business, a superb track record of consistent reliable growth, external investment opportunities, a terrific credit profile and an advantaged business mix, we should continue to thrive. Finally, the third quarter marked the anniversary of our Ardent deal and the successful spin-off of most of our skilled nursing facilities. When I reflect on the tremendous improvement in our enterprise since then, I really like what I see. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, we still generate over $2 billion in annualized NOI. Our assets are higher quality. Our business is more diverse. Our cash flow is robust and even more reliable, and most of our business is with the nation's leading care providers and research institutions, and we enjoy multiple channels for growth. We are also lucky to have a best-in-class team that truly enjoys working together for the benefit of shareholders. 
Now to talk about our positive quarter, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CFO, Bob Probst."
398549,404354004,1065364,"Ventas, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2016",2016-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Ventas, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Debbie. The third quarter was representative of the hallmark of Ventas' performance for over a decade, strong earnings growth on an even stronger balance sheet. And on the back of that performance, we are pleased to update and improve our guida",1798,"Thank you, Debbie. The third quarter was representative of the hallmark of Ventas' performance for over a decade, strong earnings growth on an even stronger balance sheet. And on the back of that performance, we are pleased to update and improve our guidance for both FFO and same-store NOI for the full year 2016. 
Before I get to our overall financial results and guidance, let me start by reviewing the performance of our high-quality health care and senior housing properties which, together, delivered same-store cash NOI growth of 2.4% for the nearly 1,200 assets in the company's quarterly same-store total portfolio. Performance in the quarter was led by our triple-net leased portfolio, which accounts for 42% of our NOI. Triple-net reported same-store cash NOI growth was 4.2% in Q3 versus the prior year, driven principally by strong in place lease escalations. Cash flow coverage in our overall stabilized triple-net leased portfolio for the second quarter of 2016, the latest available quarterly information, was strong and consistent with prior quarter at 1.7x reflecting the quality of our triple-net leased properties and of our operators. Coverage in our triple-net same-store senior housing portfolio remained at 1.3x. Coverage trends were driven by low single-digit EBITDARM growth at the asset level for the trailing 12 months. 
Our shareholders continue to benefit from our decision to spin off the majority of our post-acute portfolio in 2015, and this now represent only 4% of Ventas' NOI. Cash flow coverage in our stabilized post-acute portfolio is 1.9x. This rent coverage level, though a decline of 10 basis points sequentially, is still best-in-class among peers as skilled nursing operators remain under pressure. Finally, Ardent continues to go from strength to strength delivering continued positive momentum in top and bottom line key performance indicators. Adjusted admissions, revenue and EBITDA have continued to trend favorably through the third quarter. With solid year-to-date performance, we expect our triple-net segment to deliver toward the midpoint of our 3.5% to 4% full 2016 same-store NOI range. 
Moving to our SHOP portfolio. Before we jump in to results, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on the value of senior housing through the lens of Hurricane Matthew in the Southeast United States. Our leading operators took every precaution and ensured the seniors in our communities were safe and secure as the hurricane approached, including stockpiling food supplies and fuel for generators. Staff members went above and beyond to make the residents' safety their #1 priority, often staying overnight and supporting sister communities in the area. The support that our seniors received before, during and after the hurricane highlights the value of senior housing, dedicated staff and resources, peace of mind, safety and security and a sense of community even in the most challenging situations. All of us at Ventas thank our senior housing operator teams for their continued skill and commitment to seniors and their families. 
Let's turn to the Q3 SHOP results. The framework by which we established our SHOP guidance range for the year continues to hold up well. Our SHOP portfolio delivered a solid quarter generating Q3 same-store cash NOI growth of 2% versus the prior year. Weight [ph] show continued strength growing 3.6% in the quarter versus 2015. Additionally, same-store occupancy grew 60 basis points sequentially, while the year-over-year occupancy shortfall narrowed to 30 basis points. Operating expenses rose nearly 5% driven by upward wage pressures, tempered by the lower fees from the new Sunrise agreement. The positive impact specifically of the permanent reduction in Sunrise management fees is approximately $1 million per quarter effective July 1, 2016, and therefore, benefited third quarter results. Our key coastal markets such as New York, L.A. and Boston continue to be the engine room of our overall SHOP portfolio growth in the third quarter. Our high barrier-to-entry [ph] communities over all represent approximately 70% of our SHOP NOI and grew Q3 same-store NOI mid-single digits on a continued strong rate growth. 
Also notable was a strong top and bottom line performance in the quarter of our Canadian portfolio, driven by very positive results from Atria's integration of the Canadian assets we acquired in 2014 and from our high-quality Sunrise Canada portfolio. Throughout 2016, we have consistently discussed our framework in regards to the impact of new supply on performance. This framework continues to be valid through the third quarter. Our NOI exposure and markets with a new supply surplus continues to represent 30% of our SHOP portfolio. And consistent with the framework and the initial guidance range we established at the start of the year, our same-store NOI in Q3 in these communities declined mid-single digits in aggregate. When combined with the mid-single-digit growth from the 70% of our portfolio in high barrier markets, we blend to the 2% overall same-store NOI growth in the quarter. 
We also continue to see the positive growth impact of redevelopments, overall, on our results. As a reminder, virtually all of our SHOP assets are in the same-store pool, including redevelopment properties, which can both suppress as well as increase same-store performance over time depending on stage of completion of the redevelopment. This is evident in the performance of the small pool of assets in the tertiary markets in the quarter, where the disruption from a full-scale redevelopment in Cape Cod impacted growth. 
For the full year 2016, we are trending toward the midpoint of our full year SHOP guidance range of 1.5% to 3% same-store NOI growth for the full year same-store pool. Looking ahead to 2017, we are working in close collaboration with our operator partners as they set the annual rate increases for existing residents for next year. We're encouraged by the continued pricing power in our portfolio and the clear value proposition of senior housing, as Hurricane Matthew demonstrated. Further, we continue to believe strongly that the leading operators and the best assets will continue to outperform and we like our position. 
We're excited to round out the segment review with our newly renamed office operations reporting segment, which now includes our medical office business as well as our newly acquired life science and innovation centers. Taken together, these new assets now represent approximately 25% of Ventas' annualized NOI. In our supplemental reporting this quarter, you will be able to find further details behind the office operations segments. 
We're pleased with the early performance of our life science acquisition, which closed in September. The 23 operating assets are performing well and in line with underwriting. The 2 development assets underway are on schedule, and we see exciting growth potential in the pipeline of future new developments. In our medical office business, cash NOI in the 354 property quarterly same-store pool increased modestly in the third quarter consistent with our expectations. Third quarter results were driven by rate growth from in-place rent escalations, mostly offset by lower year-over-year occupancy resulting from expected move outs as well as the timing of repair and maintenance spend. We continue to make progress on filling the leasing pipeline. Therefore, for the full year 2016, we expect the MOB business will also trend toward the midpoint of our 1% to 2% same-store growth guidance range for the full year asset pool. 
Turning to our overall financial results. In the third quarter, we delivered superior earnings growth and balance sheet strength supported by terrific capital markets execution. First, our earnings growth. Third quarter 2016 normalized FFO totaled $1.03 per fully diluted share, representing 5% growth on a comparable basis over the third quarter of 2015. The strong year-over-year growth was driven by accretive investments together with third quarter same-store NOI growth. Ventas made over $1.5 billion in new investments in the third quarter of 2016, principally, for the 25 life science and innovation centers managed by Wexford. 
During and following the quarter, in order to fund Wexford, we issued over $900 million in equity at an average gross price exceeding $73 per share. This included a block issuance in July for approximately $750 million as well as over $175 million of new ATM issuance in the quarter. We also made progress in our capital recycling program, realizing nearly $200 million in aggregate gross proceeds during and immediately after the quarter, principally, from loan repayments. The company's normalized FFO results in the third quarter benefited by $0.02 per share from receipt of a net fee associated with the repayment of loans in the quarter. Our year-to-date share of proceeds from asset sales and loan repayments now totals nearly $275 million, and we have line of sight for the $500 million of full year gross proceeds included in previous and current guidance. 
To round out the capital activity in the quarter, we also issued our best 10-year bond in the company's history, raising $450 million of 10-year senior notes and an all-in effective yield of 3.22%. This represented the lowest spread to treasuries and the lowest all-in 10-year rate in Ventas' history. In addition, the issuance was in very high demand demonstrating strong investor confidence in Ventas' financial strength. The outstanding capital markets activity during the quarter ensure that our balance sheet and liquidity grew even stronger. The company's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio held steady at 5.8x at the end of the third quarter. Our fixed charge coverage grew to an exceptional 4.7x. Our debt to gross asset value improved to 39% and our secured debt to total indebtedness reached 6%. 
Let me close out the prepared remarks with a revised full year guidance for the company. We're updating and improving our full year 2016 normalized FFO per share guidance to now range from $4.10 to $4.13, up from previous guidance of $4.05 to $4.13, an increase of nearly $0.03 at the midpoint. The new guidance represents 4% to 5% growth in normalized FFO over 2015 on a comparable basis. Our improved guidance range is a result of solid year-to-date portfolio performance, closed accretive acquisitions and excellent capital markets execution. 
On the heels of positive year-to-date portfolio performance trends, we are also raising the lower end of our total 2016 same-store NOI guidance range by 50 basis points. 2016 same-store NOI is now estimated to grow in the range of 2.5% to 3%, up from the company's previous range of 2% to 3%. Our guidance continued to assume 2016 asset dispositions of approximately $500 million. We assume the loan to Ardent to fund the LHP acquisition closes in Q1 of 2017 and therefore, is not included in our 2016 guidance. No further unannounced material acquisitions, dispositions or capital activity are assumed in guidance. 
In summary, the entire Ventas team is pleased with our highly productive third quarter, and our track record of sustained excellence throughout 2016. With that, I will ask the operator to please open the call for questions."

As you point out, it's a well-structured loan. If we get it paid back, we'll be quite happy. There are limitations, a lockout period and so on on the repayment. And of course, LHP has these great partnerships with very high-quality, not-for-profit systems and academic medical centers. And in that regard, we want to be good partners to them.

We are delighted to report on our strong financial results brought to you courtesy of the Ventas Advantage, our excellent people, platforms and properties. Today, I'll also discuss our closed and pending major transactions and provide an overview of economic and market conditions. Because we've been so productive, there's a lot to cover. Following my remarks, Bob Probst will review our segment performance, financial results and full year expectations. After that, we will welcome your questions. 
Leading with results. This quarter, we delivered $1.03 in normalized FFO per share representing 5% year-over-year comparable growth. We also demonstrated capital markets excellence and positive trends in our credit profile. As a result, we are also pleased to improve our full year normalized FFO per share and same-store NOI guidance. Our strong and consistent performance is fueled by our market position at the exciting intersection of health care and real estate to large and dynamic industries with powerful fundamentals and growth prospect. Recent activities continue to demonstrate that we are executing on our strategy, allocating capital wisely and doing what we say, a Ventas hallmark. We have built an exceptional enterprise that continues to deliver reliable growth and income from a high-quality, diverse portfolio on a strong balance sheet. 
Our innovations over the years, and especially the spin-off of most of our skilled nursing assets and other developments since the third quarter of 2015, have produced a differentiated business mix and put us in a great position for continued success. Let me highlight just a few of the platforms and properties that are driving our positive outlook. First, during the quarter, we closed on our exciting and accretive $1.5 billion acquisition of institutional quality life science, innovation and medical real estate leased by top universities, academic medical centers and research companies. Our new tenants include Yale, U Penn Medicine and Wash U. Like other areas of our business, our tenants are market leaders accounting for fully 10% of all university life science, research and development spending in the U.S. 
This investment represents a great entry into the large and growing health care-related R&D space. It adds an adjacent business line to Ventas that further diversifies our portfolio and cash flows. At a 6.8% going in cash yield for the 23 Class A operating properties, we are delighted with the Wexford investment. We are also benefiting from an exclusive development pipeline with Wexford. There are 2 assets already under development in the portfolio anchored by Duke and Wake Forest and 9 development sites for future growth. We are already making progress on a high profile, potential new development project adjacent to U Penn Medical. This demonstrates the attractive growth opportunities that should flow from combining Ventas' capital with best-in-class developer, Wexford. 
Likewise, our investment in Ardent has proven to be a channel for growth. Last year, during the third quarter, we closed our acquisition of Ardent's hospital real estate and articulated a vision for building a formidable, high-quality hospital business in this large, dynamic space. We chose Ardent as our beachhead investment because it is a winner and potential consolidator with its good hospitals, significant market presence, attractive payer mix, good quality of care and strong margins. We also designed a growth strategy that focused on scaling Ardent's experienced management team and strong infrastructure. At that time, we identified some desirable acquisition targets, and Legacy Hospital Partners, or LHP, was at the top of the list because it shared these desirable characteristics. We're now happy to say that Ardent has inked a deal to acquire LHP, just like we drew it up on the board. 
As health care's premier capital provider, Ventas is fueling Ardent's growth by providing a $700 million secured loan enabling Ardent to acquire LHP. This deal is attractive both financially and strategically for all Ardent partners, and shows our continued ability to align with market leaders to support their growth. Financially, the loan will be accretive to Ventas' 2017 earnings with a going in floating interest rate of approximately 8%. Ardent will remain financially strong and expects to achieve significant synergies. We're happy to say that Ardent continues to perform very well on it's based business through the third quarter. 
Strategically, the LHP acquisition expands Ardent's existing business by 50% making it the second-largest privately owned hospital company in the U.S. with annual pro forma revenues of $3 billion and major market share in its diversified locations. It also provides Ardent with very valuable partnerships with top not-for-profit health systems and academic medical centers. As a result, the LHP hospitals enjoy strong brand recognition, clinical integration good markets and favorable payer relationships. We expect the Ardent-LHP deal and our loan to close in the first quarter of 2017 subject to customary, regulatory and other conditions. 
Ventas is committed to being a positive influence in our industry to maintaining strong relationships with the nation's leading providers of care and to working collaboratively with them to create value. Recently, across our business lines, we've made good progress advancing our customers' interests in areas important to them. Here are a few examples. First, we recently reached mutually beneficial agreements to modify our decade-long agreements with Sunrise Senior Living. In short, we provided long-term stability and the management contracts with Sunrise, and Sunrise agreed to reduce the management fees we pay under those agreements on a permanent basis. Other changes to the agreements align the companies toward profitable growth and enables Sunrise and its dedicated on-site employees to focus on providing superior services to seniors and their family. We also entered into a new multi-year pipeline agreement with Sunrise, giving Ventas the right to fund a pool of new Sunrise ground-up developments. 
Second, we have also reached agreements with various customers to cooperate with them on modest asset sales or asset buybacks. These included the recently completed sale of 7 long-term acute care hospitals, or LTACs, with Kindred to a new operator and a pending disposition of 11 nonstrategic senior living assets with Brookdale. This approach can give the care providers operating flexibility and higher cash flow and also enable Ventas to recycle capital into attractive development, redevelopment or acquisition opportunities. We are committed to finding ways to support our customers' efforts to improve their own results and performance in ways that also benefit our portfolio and protect Ventas shareholders. As a result of our portfolio performance and accretive acquisitions, we drove good cash flow from operations this quarter 2, enabling us to pay our investors a strong and secure dividend of over 4%. We expect our board to increase our dividend in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
When we look at the investment market, we continue to see attractive opportunities, but we remain highly selective. We focus on deals that will generate reliable cash flow and cash flow growth at an appropriate risk-adjusted return. Our capital allocation is also strategic emphasizing sectors with upside and situations like Lillibridge, Atria, Wexford and Ardent, where significant future growth potential exists from consolidation and/or development. Our ability to invest capital across cycles to deliver value to our investors comes from the combination of our advantaged position within 6 asset classes or verticals, our strong relationships with market-leading customers and platforms and our team's hard-earned experience and skills. 
The macro environment, on balance, continues to be favorable including GDP growth in the 2% to 3% range and a global thirst for yield that is accelerating foreign investment into U.S. real estate. While the expectation of higher interest rates can initially dampen enthusiasm for REITs and real estate, we are still enjoying the benefit of incredibly low long-term borrowing rates, reasonable job growth, rising household incomes, low inflation and improving corporate confidence, as expressed in surging M&A activity. Hopefully, we will also have certainty about the election soon. All of these conditions should be positive for commercial real estate fundamentals and growth. 
At Ventas, with our needs-based, demographically-driven business, a superb track record of consistent reliable growth, external investment opportunities, a terrific credit profile and an advantaged business mix, we should continue to thrive. Finally, the third quarter marked the anniversary of our Ardent deal and the successful spin-off of most of our skilled nursing facilities. When I reflect on the tremendous improvement in our enterprise since then, I really like what I see. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, we still generate over $2 billion in annualized NOI. Our assets are higher quality. Our business is more diverse. Our cash flow is robust and even more reliable, and most of our business is with the nation's leading care providers and research institutions, and we enjoy multiple channels for growth. We are also lucky to have a best-in-class team that truly enjoys working together for the benefit of shareholders. 
Now to talk about our positive quarter, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CFO, Bob Probst."

The third quarter was representative of the hallmark of Ventas' performance for over a decade, strong earnings growth on an even stronger balance sheet. And on the back of that performance, we are pleased to update and improve our guida",1796,"Thank you, Debbie. The third quarter was representative of the hallmark of Ventas' performance for over a decade, strong earnings growth on an even stronger balance sheet. And on the back of that performance, we are pleased to update and improve our guidance for both FFO and same-store NOI for the full year 2016. 
Before I get to our overall financial results and guidance, let me start by reviewing the performance of our high-quality health care and senior housing properties which, together, delivered same-store cash NOI growth of 2.4% for the nearly 1,200 assets in the company's quarterly same-store total portfolio. Performance in the quarter was led by our triple-net leased portfolio, which accounts for 42% of our NOI. Triple-net reported same-store cash NOI growth was 4.2% in Q3 versus the prior year, driven principally by strong in place lease escalations. Cash flow coverage in our overall stabilized triple-net leased portfolio for the second quarter of 2016, the latest available quarterly information, was strong and consistent with prior quarter at 1.7x reflecting the quality of our triple-net leased properties and of our operators. Coverage in our triple-net same-store senior housing portfolio remained at 1.3x. Coverage trends were driven by low single-digit EBITDARM growth at the asset level for the trailing 12 months. 
Our shareholders continue to benefit from our decision to spin off the majority of our post-acute portfolio in 2015, and this now represent only 4% of Ventas' NOI. Cash flow coverage in our stabilized post-acute portfolio is 1.9x. This rent coverage level, though a decline of 10 basis points sequentially, is still best-in-class among peers as skilled nursing operators remain under pressure. Finally, Ardent continues to go from strength to strength delivering continued positive momentum in top and bottom line key performance indicators. Adjusted admissions, revenue and EBITDA have continued to trend favorably through the third quarter. With solid year-to-date performance, we expect our triple-net segment to deliver toward the midpoint of our 3.5% to 4% full 2016 same-store NOI range. 
Moving to our SHOP portfolio. Before we jump in to results, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on the value of senior housing through the lens of Hurricane Matthew in the Southeast United States. Our leading operators took every precaution and ensured the seniors in our communities were safe and secure as the hurricane approached, including stockpiling food supplies and fuel for generators. Staff members went above and beyond to make the residents' safety their #1 priority, often staying overnight and supporting sister communities in the area. The support that our seniors received before, during and after the hurricane highlights the value of senior housing, dedicated staff and resources, peace of mind, safety and security and a sense of community even in the most challenging situations. All of us at Ventas thank our senior housing operator teams for their continued skill and commitment to seniors and their families. 
Let's turn to the Q3 SHOP results. The framework by which we established our SHOP guidance range for the year continues to hold up well. Our SHOP portfolio delivered a solid quarter generating Q3 same-store cash NOI growth of 2% versus the prior year. Rate showed continued strength growing 3.6% in the quarter versus 2015. Additionally, same-store occupancy grew 60 basis points sequentially, while the year-over-year occupancy shortfall narrowed to 30 basis points. Operating expenses rose nearly 5% driven by upward wage pressures, tempered by the lower fees from the new Sunrise agreement. The positive impact specifically of the permanent reduction in Sunrise management fees is approximately $1 million per quarter effective July 1, 2016, and therefore, benefited third quarter results. Our key coastal markets such as New York, L.A. and Boston continue to be the engine room of our overall SHOP portfolio growth in the third quarter. Our high barrier-to-entry infill communities, overall, represent approximately 70% of our SHOP NOI and grew Q3 same-store NOI mid-single digits on a continued strong rate growth. 
Also notable was a strong top and bottom line performance in the quarter of our Canadian portfolio, driven by very positive results from Atria's integration of the Canadian assets we acquired in 2014 and from our high-quality Sunrise Canada portfolio. Throughout 2016, we have consistently discussed our framework in regards to the impact of new supply on performance. This framework continues to be valid through the third quarter. Our NOI exposure and markets with a new supply surplus continues to represent 30% of our SHOP portfolio. And consistent with the framework and the initial guidance range we established at the start of the year, our same-store NOI in Q3 in these communities declined mid-single digits in aggregate. When combined with the mid-single-digit growth from the 70% of our portfolio in high barrier markets, we blend to the 2% overall same-store NOI growth in the quarter. 
We also continue to see the positive growth impact of redevelopments, overall, on our results. As a reminder, virtually all of our SHOP assets are in the same-store pool, including redevelopment properties, which can both suppress as well as increase same-store performance over time depending on stage of completion of the redevelopment. This is evident in the performance of the small pool of assets in the tertiary markets in the quarter, where the disruption from a full-scale redevelopment in Cape Cod impacted growth. 
For the full year 2016, we are trending toward the midpoint of our full year SHOP guidance range of 1.5% to 3% same-store NOI growth for the full year same-store pool. Looking ahead to 2017, we are working in close collaboration with our operator partners as they set the annual rate increases for existing residents for next year. We're encouraged by the continued pricing power in our portfolio and the clear value proposition of senior housing, as Hurricane Matthew demonstrated. Further, we continue to believe strongly that the leading operators and the best assets will continue to outperform and we like our position. 
We're excited to round out the segment review with our newly renamed office operations reporting segment, which now includes our medical office business as well as our newly acquired life science and innovation centers. Taken together, these new assets now represent approximately 25% of Ventas' annualized NOI. In our supplemental reporting this quarter, you will be able to find further details behind the office operations segments. 
We're pleased with the early performance of our life science acquisition, which closed in September. The 23 operating assets are performing well and in line with underwriting. The 2 development assets underway are on schedule, and we see exciting growth potential in the pipeline of future new developments. In our medical office business, cash NOI in the 354 property quarterly same-store pool increased modestly in the third quarter consistent with our expectations. Third quarter results were driven by rate growth from in-place rent escalations, mostly offset by lower year-over-year occupancy resulting from expected move outs as well as the timing of repair and maintenance spend. We continue to make progress on filling the leasing pipeline. Therefore, for the full year 2016, we expect the MOB business will also trend toward the midpoint of our 1% to 2% same-store growth guidance range for the full year asset pool. 
Turning to our overall financial results. In the third quarter, we delivered superior earnings growth and balance sheet strength supported by terrific capital markets execution. First, our earnings growth. Third quarter 2016 normalized FFO totaled $1.03 per fully diluted share, representing 5% growth on a comparable basis over the third quarter of 2015. The strong year-over-year growth was driven by accretive investments together with third quarter same-store NOI growth. Ventas made over $1.5 billion in new investments in the third quarter of 2016, principally, for the 25 life science and innovation centers managed by Wexford. 
During and following the quarter, in order to fund Wexford, we issued over $900 million in equity at an average gross price exceeding $73 per share. This included a block issuance in July for approximately $750 million as well as over $175 million of new ATM issuance in the quarter. We also made progress in our capital recycling program, realizing nearly $200 million in aggregate gross proceeds during and immediately after the quarter, principally, from loan repayments. The company's normalized FFO results in the third quarter benefited by $0.02 per share from receipt of a net fee associated with the repayment of loans in the quarter. Our year-to-date share of proceeds from asset sales and loan repayments now totals nearly $275 million, and we have line of sight for the $500 million of full year gross proceeds included in previous and current guidance. 
To round out the capital activity in the quarter, we also issued our best 10-year bond in the company's history, raising $450 million of 10-year senior notes and an all-in effective yield of 3.22%. This represented the lowest spread to treasuries and the lowest all-in 10-year rate in Ventas' history. In addition, the issuance was in very high demand demonstrating strong investor confidence in Ventas' financial strength. The outstanding capital markets activity during the quarter ensure that our balance sheet and liquidity grew even stronger. The company's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio held steady at 5.8x at the end of the third quarter. Our fixed charge coverage grew to an exceptional 4.7x. Our debt to gross asset value improved to 39% and our secured debt to total indebtedness reached 6%. 
Let me close out the prepared remarks with a revised full year guidance for the company. We're updating and improving our full year 2016 normalized FFO per share guidance to now range from $4.10 to $4.13, up from previous guidance of $4.05 to $4.13, an increase of nearly $0.03 at the midpoint. The new guidance represents 4% to 5% growth in normalized FFO over 2015 on a comparable basis. Our improved guidance range is a result of solid year-to-date portfolio performance, closed accretive acquisitions and excellent capital markets execution. 
On the heels of positive year-to-date portfolio performance trends, we are also raising the lower end of our total 2016 same-store NOI guidance range by 50 basis points. 2016 same-store NOI is now estimated to grow in the range of 2.5% to 3%, up from the company's previous range of 2% to 3%. Our guidance continued to assume 2016 asset dispositions of approximately $500 million. We assume the loan to Ardent to fund the LHP acquisition closes in Q1 of 2017 and therefore, is not included in our 2016 guidance. No further unannounced material acquisitions, dispositions or capital activity are assumed in guidance. 
In summary, the entire Ventas team is pleased with our highly productive third quarter, and our track record of sustained excellence throughout 2016. With that, I will ask the operator to please open the call for questions."

We are delighted to report on our strong financial results brought to you courtesy of the Ventas Advantage, our excellent people, platforms and properties. Today, I'll also discuss our closed and pending major transactions and provide an overview of economic and market conditions. Because we've been so productive, there's a lot to cover. Following my remarks, Bob Probst will review our segment performance, financial results and full year expectations. After that, we will welcome your questions. 
Leading with results. This quarter, we delivered $1.03 in normalized FFO per share representing 5% year-over-year comparable growth. We also demonstrated capital markets excellence and positive trends in our credit profile. As a result, we are also pleased to improve our full year normalized FFO per share and same-store NOI guidance. Our strong and consistent performance is fueled by our market position at the exciting intersection of health care and real estate to large and dynamic industries with powerful fundamentals and growth prospect. Recent activities continue to demonstrate that we are executing on our strategy, allocating capital wisely and doing what we say, a Ventas hallmark. We have built an exceptional enterprise that continues to deliver reliable growth and income from a high-quality, diverse portfolio on a strong balance sheet. 
Our innovations over the years, and especially the spin-off of most of our skilled nursing assets and other developments since the third quarter of 2015, have produced a differentiated business mix and put us in a great position for continued success. Let me highlight just a few of the platforms and properties that are driving our positive outlook. First, during the quarter, we closed on our exciting and accretive $1.5 billion acquisition of institutional quality life science, innovation and medical real estate leased by top universities, academic medical centers and research companies. Our new tenants include Yale, U Penn Medicine and Wash U. Like other areas of our business, our tenants are market leaders accounting for fully 10% of all university life science, research and development spending in the U.S. 
This investment represents a great entry into the large and growing health care-related R&D space. It adds an adjacent business line to Ventas that further diversifies our portfolio and cash flows. At a 6.8% going in cash yield for the 23 Class A operating properties, we are delighted with the Wexford investment. We are also benefiting from an exclusive development pipeline with Wexford. There are 2 assets already under development in the portfolio anchored by Duke and Wake Forest and 9 development sites for future growth. We are already making progress on a high profile, potential new development project adjacent to U Penn Medical. This demonstrates the attractive growth opportunities that should flow from combining Ventas' capital with best-in-class developer, Wexford. 
Likewise, our investment in Ardent has proven to be a channel for growth. Last year, during the third quarter, we closed our acquisition of Ardent's hospital real estate and articulated a vision for building a formidable, high-quality hospital business in this large, dynamic space. We chose Ardent as our beachhead investment because it is a winner and potential consolidator with its good hospitals, significant market presence, attractive payer mix, good quality of care and strong margins. We also designed a growth strategy that focused on scaling Ardent's experienced management team and strong infrastructure. At that time, we identified some desirable acquisition targets, and Legacy Hospital Partners, or LHP, was at the top of the list because it shared these desirable characteristics. We're now happy to say that Ardent has inked a deal to acquire LHP, just like we drew it up on the board. 
As health care's premier capital provider, Ventas is fueling Ardent's growth by providing a $700 million secured loan enabling Ardent to acquire LHP. This deal is attractive both financially and strategically for all Ardent partners, and shows our continued ability to align with market leaders to support their growth. Financially, the loan will be accretive to Ventas' 2017 earnings with a going in floating interest rate of approximately 8%. Ardent will remain financially strong and expects to achieve significant synergies. We're happy to say that Ardent continues to perform very well on it's based business through the third quarter. 
Strategically, the LHP acquisition expands Ardent's existing business by 50% making it the second-largest privately owned hospital company in the U.S. with annual pro forma revenues of $3 billion and major market share in its diversified locations. It also provides Ardent with very valuable partnerships with top not-for-profit health systems and academic medical centers. As a result, the LHP hospitals enjoy strong brand recognition, clinical integration, good markets and favorable payer relationships. We expect the Ardent-LHP deal and our loan to close in the first quarter of 2017 subject to customary, regulatory and other conditions. 
Ventas is committed to being a positive influence in our industry to maintaining strong relationships with the nation's leading providers of care and to working collaboratively with them to create value. Recently, across our business lines, we've made good progress advancing our customers' interests in areas important to them. Here are a few examples. First, we recently reached mutually beneficial agreements to modify our decade-long agreements with Sunrise Senior Living. In short, we provided long-term stability and the management contracts with Sunrise, and Sunrise agreed to reduce the management fees we pay under those agreements on a permanent basis. Other changes to the agreements align the companies toward profitable growth and enable Sunrise and its dedicated on-site employees to focus on providing superior services to seniors and their families. We also entered into a new multi-year pipeline agreement with Sunrise, giving Ventas the right to fund a pool of new Sunrise ground-up developments. 
Second, we have also reached agreements with various customers to cooperate with them on modest asset sales or asset buybacks. These included the recently completed sale of 7 long-term acute care hospitals, or LTACs, with Kindred to a new operator and a pending disposition of 11 nonstrategic senior living assets with Brookdale. This approach can give the care providers operating flexibility and higher cash flow and also enable Ventas to recycle capital into attractive development, redevelopment or acquisition opportunities. We are committed to finding ways to support our customers' efforts to improve their own results and performance in ways that also benefit our portfolio and protect Ventas shareholders. As a result of our portfolio performance and accretive acquisitions, we drove good cash flow from operations this quarter 2, enabling us to pay our investors a strong and secure dividend of over 4%. We expect our board to increase our dividend in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
When we look at the investment market, we continue to see attractive opportunities, but we remain highly selective. We focus on deals that will generate reliable cash flow and cash flow growth at an appropriate risk-adjusted return. Our capital allocation is also strategic emphasizing sectors with upside and situations like Lillibridge, Atria, Wexford and Ardent, where significant future growth potential exists from consolidation and/or development. Our ability to invest capital across cycles to deliver value to our investors comes from the combination of our advantaged position within 6 asset classes or verticals, our strong relationships with market-leading customers and platforms and our teams' hard-earned experience and skills. 
The macro environment, on balance, continues to be favorable including GDP growth in the 2% to 3% range and a global thirst for yield that is accelerating foreign investment into U.S. real estate. While the expectation of higher interest rates can initially dampen enthusiasm for REITs and real estate, we are still enjoying the benefit of incredibly low long-term borrowing rates, reasonable job growth, rising household incomes, low inflation and improving corporate confidence, as expressed in surging M&A activity. Hopefully, we will also have certainty about the election soon. All of these conditions should be positive for commercial real estate fundamentals and growth. 
At Ventas, with our needs-based, demographically-driven business, a superb track record of consistent reliable growth, external investment opportunities, a terrific credit profile and an advantaged business mix, we should continue to thrive. Finally, the third quarter marked the anniversary of our Ardent deal and the successful spin-off of most of our skilled nursing facilities. When I reflect on the tremendous improvement in our enterprise since then, I really like what I see. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, we still generate over $2 billion in annualized NOI. Our assets are higher quality. Our business is more diverse. Our cash flow is robust and even more reliable, and most of our business is with the nation's leading care providers and research institutions, and we enjoy multiple channels for growth. We are also lucky to have a best-in-class team that truly enjoys working together for the benefit of shareholders. 
Now to talk about our positive quarter, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CFO, Bob Probst."

The third quarter was representative of the hallmark of Ventas' performance for over a decade, strong earnings growth on an even stronger balance sheet. And on the back of that performance, we are pleased to update and improve our guida",1797,"Thank you, Debbie. The third quarter was representative of the hallmark of Ventas' performance for over a decade, strong earnings growth on an even stronger balance sheet. And on the back of that performance, we are pleased to update and improve our guidance for both FFO and same-store NOI for the full year 2016. 
Before I get to our overall financial results and guidance, let me start by reviewing the performance of our high-quality health care and senior housing properties which, together, delivered same-store cash NOI growth of 2.4% for the nearly 1,200 assets in the company's quarterly same-store total portfolio. Performance in the quarter was led by our triple-net leased portfolio, which accounts for 42% of our NOI. Triple-net reported same-store cash NOI growth was 4.2% in Q3 versus the prior year, driven principally by strong in place lease escalations. Cash flow coverage in our overall stabilized triple-net leased portfolio for the second quarter of 2016, the latest available quarterly information, was strong and consistent with prior quarter at 1.7x reflecting the quality of our triple-net leased properties and of our operators. Coverage in our triple-net same-store senior housing portfolio remained at 1.3x. Coverage trends were driven by low single-digit EBITDARM growth at the asset level for the trailing 12 months. 
Our shareholders continue to benefit from our decision to spin off the majority of our post-acute portfolio in 2015, and this now represent only 4% of Ventas' NOI. Cash flow coverage in our stabilized post-acute portfolio is 1.9x. This rent coverage level, though a decline of 10 basis points sequentially, is still best-in-class among peers as skilled nursing operators remain under pressure. Finally, Ardent continues to go from strength to strength delivering continued positive momentum in top and bottom line key performance indicators. Adjusted admissions, revenue and EBITDA have continued to trend favorably through the third quarter. With solid year-to-date performance, we expect our triple-net segment to deliver toward the midpoint of our 3.5% to 4% full year 2016 same-store NOI range. 
Moving to our SHOP portfolio. Before we jump in to results, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on the value of senior housing through the lens of Hurricane Matthew in the Southeast United States. Our leading operators took every precaution and ensured the seniors in our communities were safe and secure as the hurricane approached, including stockpiling food, supplies and fuel for generators. Staff members went above and beyond to make the residents' safety their #1 priority, often staying overnight and supporting sister communities in the area. The support that our seniors received before, during and after the hurricane highlights the value of senior housing, dedicated staff and resources, peace of mind, safety and security and a sense of community even in the most challenging situations. All of us at Ventas thank our senior housing operator teams for their continued skill and commitment to seniors and their families. 
Let's turn to the Q3 SHOP results. The framework by which we established our SHOP guidance range for the year continues to hold up well. Our SHOP portfolio delivered a solid quarter generating Q3 same-store cash NOI growth of 2% versus the prior year. Rate showed continued strength growing 3.6% in the quarter versus 2015. Additionally, same-store occupancy grew 60 basis points sequentially, while the year-over-year occupancy shortfall narrowed to 30 basis points. Operating expenses rose nearly 5% driven by upward wage pressures, tempered by the lower fees from the new Sunrise agreement. The positive impact specifically of the permanent reduction in Sunrise management fees is approximately $1 million per quarter effective July 1, 2016, and therefore, benefited third quarter results. Our key coastal markets such as New York, L.A. and Boston continue to be the engine room of our overall SHOP portfolio growth in the third quarter. Our high barrier-to-entry infill communities, overall, represent approximately 70% of our SHOP NOI and grew Q3 same-store NOI mid-single digits on a continued strong rate growth. 
Also notable was a strong top and bottom line performance in the quarter of our Canadian portfolio, driven by very positive results from Atria's integration of the Canadian assets we acquired in 2014 and from our high-quality Sunrise Canada portfolio. Throughout 2016, we have consistently discussed our framework in regards to the impact of new supply on performance. This framework continues to be valid through the third quarter. Our NOI exposure and markets with a new supply surplus continues to represent 30% of our SHOP portfolio. And consistent with the framework and the initial guidance range we established at the start of the year, our same-store NOI in Q3 in these communities declined mid-single digits in aggregate. When combined with the mid-single-digit growth from the 70% of our portfolio in high barrier markets, we blend to the 2% overall same-store NOI growth in the quarter. 
We also continue to see the positive growth impact of redevelopments, overall, on our results. As a reminder, virtually all of our SHOP assets are in the same-store pool, including redevelopment properties, which can both suppress as well as increase same-store performance over time depending on stage of completion of the redevelopment. This is evident in the performance of the small pool of assets in the tertiary markets in the quarter, where the disruption from a full-scale redevelopment in Cape Cod impacted growth. 
For the full year 2016, we are trending toward the midpoint of our full year SHOP guidance range of 1.5% to 3% same-store NOI growth for the full year same-store pool. Looking ahead to 2017, we are working in close collaboration with our operator partners as they set the annual rate increases for existing residents for next year. We're encouraged by the continued pricing power in our portfolio and the clear value proposition of senior housing, as Hurricane Matthew demonstrated. Further, we continue to believe strongly that the leading operators and the best assets will continue to outperform and we like our position. 
We're excited to round out the segment review with our newly renamed office operations reporting segment, which now includes our medical office business as well as our newly acquired life science and innovation centers. Taken together, these new assets now represent approximately 25% of Ventas' annualized NOI. In our supplemental reporting this quarter, you will be able to find further details behind the office operations segments. 
We're pleased with the early performance of our life science acquisition, which closed in September. The 23 operating assets are performing well and in line with underwriting. The 2 development assets underway are on schedule, and we see exciting growth potential in the pipeline of future new developments. In our medical office business, cash NOI in the 354 property quarterly same-store pool increased modestly in the third quarter consistent with our expectations. Third quarter results were driven by rate growth from in-place rent escalations, mostly offset by lower year-over-year occupancy resulting from expected move outs as well as the timing of repair and maintenance spend. We continue to make progress on filling the leasing pipeline. Therefore, for the full year 2016, we expect the MOB business will also trend toward the midpoint of our 1% to 2% same-store growth guidance range for the full year asset pool. 
Turning to our overall financial results. In the third quarter, we delivered superior earnings growth and balance sheet strength supported by terrific capital markets execution. First, our earnings growth. Third quarter 2016 normalized FFO totaled $1.03 per fully diluted share, representing 5% growth on a comparable basis over the third quarter of 2015. The strong year-over-year growth was driven by accretive investments together with third quarter same-store NOI growth. Ventas made over $1.5 billion in new investments in the third quarter of 2016, principally, for the 25 life science and innovation centers managed by Wexford. 
During and following the quarter, in order to fund Wexford, we issued over $900 million in equity at an average gross price exceeding $73 per share. This included a block issuance in July for approximately $750 million as well as over $175 million of new ATM issuance in the quarter. We also made progress in our capital recycling program, realizing nearly $200 million in aggregate gross proceeds during and immediately after the quarter, principally, from loan repayments. The company's normalized FFO results in the third quarter benefited by $0.02 per share from receipt of a net fee associated with the repayment of loans in the quarter. Our year-to-date share of proceeds from asset sales and loan repayments now totals nearly $275 million, and we have line of sight for the $500 million of full year gross proceeds included in previous and current guidance. 
To round out the capital activity in the quarter, we also issued our best 10-year bond in the company's history, raising $450 million of 10-year senior notes and an all-in effective yield of 3.22%. This represented the lowest spread to treasuries and the lowest all-in 10-year rate in Ventas' history. In addition, the issuance was in very high demand demonstrating strong investor confidence in Ventas' financial strength. The outstanding capital markets activity during the quarter ensure that our balance sheet and liquidity grew even stronger. The company's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio held steady at 5.8x at the end of the third quarter. Our fixed charge coverage grew to an exceptional 4.7x. Our debt to gross asset value improved to 39% and our secured debt to total indebtedness reached 6%. 
Let me close out the prepared remarks with a revised full year guidance for the company. We're updating and improving our full year 2016 normalized FFO per share guidance to now range from $4.10 to $4.13, up from previous guidance of $4.05 to $4.13, an increase of nearly $0.03 at the midpoint. The new guidance represents 4% to 5% growth in normalized FFO over 2015 on a comparable basis. Our improved guidance range is a result of solid year-to-date portfolio performance, closed accretive acquisitions and excellent capital markets execution. 
On the heels of positive year-to-date portfolio performance trends, we are also raising the lower end of our total 2016 same-store NOI guidance range by 50 basis points. 2016 same-store NOI is now estimated to grow in the range of 2.5% to 3%, up from the company's previous range of 2% to 3%. Our guidance continued to assume 2016 asset dispositions of approximately $500 million. We assume the loan to Ardent to fund the LHP acquisition closes in Q1 of 2017 and therefore, is not included in our 2016 guidance. No further unannounced material acquisitions, dispositions or capital activity are assumed in guidance. 
In summary, the entire Ventas team is pleased with our highly productive third quarter, and our track record of sustained excellence throughout 2016. With that, I will ask the operator to please open the call for questions."

So we are inclined to be the leading premier capital provider to the best health care senior housing and research companies in the world. And what we do to do that is to customize capital solutions for specific circumstances and help our customers achieve their objectives. And in this particular case, that involves the secured loan which has, of course, been part of our business from time immemorial. So the beauty of our business, again, is we have multiple verticals, 6 of them. We have -- we're doing business with the consolidators. We're in a gigantic sector and we can invest at different parts of the capital structure, whether it was the BMR Mezz that we did or the secured loan or sale leasebacks, et cetera. And that is part of the formula that we've used to deliver reliable growth and income to investors for so long, and so this fits in that pattern. It was a customized solution. It enabled -- our willingness to step up with this capital enabled Ardent to get this deal with certainty because we provided certainty. And so that's why we did it, and I think it provides great optionality down the road and so we feel very happy about it."

We are delighted to report on our strong financial results brought to you courtesy of the Ventas Advantage, our excellent people, platforms and properties. Today, I'll also discuss our closed and pending major transactions and provide an overview of economic and market conditions. Because we've been so productive, there's a lot to cover. Following my remarks, Bob Probst will review our segment performance, financial results and full year expectations. After that, we will welcome your questions. 
Leading with results. This quarter, we delivered $1.03 in normalized FFO per share representing 5% year-over-year comparable growth. We also demonstrated capital markets excellence and positive trends in our credit profile. As a result, we are also pleased to improve our full year normalized FFO per share and same-store NOI guidance. Our strong and consistent performance is fueled by our market position at the exciting intersection of health care and real estate to large and dynamic industries with powerful fundamentals and growth prospect. Recent activities continue to demonstrate that we are executing on our strategy, allocating capital wisely and doing what we say, a Ventas hallmark. We have built an exceptional enterprise that continues to deliver reliable growth and income from a high-quality, diverse portfolio on a strong balance sheet. 
Our innovations over the years, and especially the spin-off of most of our skilled nursing assets and other developments since the third quarter of 2015, have produced a differentiated business mix and put us in a great position for continued success. Let me highlight just a few of the platforms and properties that are driving our positive outlook. First, during the quarter, we closed on our exciting and accretive $1.5 billion acquisition of institutional quality life science, innovation and medical real estate leased by top universities, academic medical centers and research companies. Our new tenants include Yale, U Penn Medicine and Wash U. Like other areas of our business, our tenants are market leaders accounting for fully 10% of all university life science, research and development spending in the U.S. 
This investment represents a great entry into the large and growing health care-related R&D space. It adds an adjacent business line to Ventas that further diversifies our portfolio and cash flows. At a 6.8% going in cash yield for the 23 Class A operating properties, we are delighted with the Wexford investment. We are also benefiting from an exclusive development pipeline with Wexford. There are 2 assets already under development in the portfolio anchored by Duke and Wake Forest and 9 development sites for future growth. We are already making progress on a high profile, potential new development project adjacent to U Penn Medical. This demonstrates the attractive growth opportunities that should flow from combining Ventas' capital with best-in-class developer, Wexford. 
Likewise, our investment in Ardent has proven to be a channel for growth. Last year, during the third quarter, we closed our acquisition of Ardent's hospital real estate and articulated a vision for building a formidable, high-quality hospital business in this large, dynamic space. We chose Ardent as our beachhead investment because it is a winner and potential consolidator with its good hospitals, significant market presence, attractive payer mix, good quality of care and strong margins. We also designed a growth strategy that focused on scaling Ardent's experienced management team and strong infrastructure. At that time, we identified some desirable acquisition targets, and Legacy Hospital Partners, or LHP, was at the top of the list because it shared these desirable characteristics. We're now happy to say that Ardent has inked a deal to acquire LHP, just like we drew it up on the board. 
As health care's premier capital provider, Ventas is fueling Ardent's growth by providing a $700 million secured loan enabling Ardent to acquire LHP. This deal is attractive both financially and strategically for all Ardent partners, and shows our continued ability to align with market leaders to support their growth. Financially, the loan will be accretive to Ventas' 2017 earnings with a going in floating interest rate of approximately 8%. Ardent will remain financially strong and expects to achieve significant synergies. We're happy to say that Ardent continues to perform very well on it's based business through the third quarter. 
Strategically, the LHP acquisition expands Ardent's existing business by 50% making it the second-largest privately owned hospital company in the U.S. with annual pro forma revenues of $3 billion and major market share in its diversified locations. It also provides Ardent with very valuable partnerships with top not-for-profit health systems and academic medical centers. As a result, the LHP hospitals enjoy strong brand recognition, clinical integration, good markets and favorable payer relationships. We expect the Ardent-LHP deal and our loan to close in the first quarter of 2017 subject to customary, regulatory and other conditions. 
Ventas is committed to being a positive influence in our industry to maintaining strong relationships with the nation's leading providers of care and to working collaboratively with them to create value. Recently, across our business lines, we've made good progress advancing our customers' interests in areas important to them. Here are a few examples. First, we recently reached mutually beneficial agreements to modify our decade-long agreements with Sunrise Senior Living. In short, we provided long-term stability and the management contracts with Sunrise, and Sunrise agreed to reduce the management fees we pay under those agreements on a permanent basis. Other changes to the agreements align the companies toward profitable growth and enable Sunrise and its dedicated on-site employees to focus on providing superior services to seniors and their families. We also entered into a new multi-year pipeline agreement with Sunrise, giving Ventas the right to fund a pool of new Sunrise ground-up developments. 
Second, we have also reached agreements with various customers to cooperate with them on modest asset sales or asset buybacks. These included the recently completed sale of 7 long-term acute care hospitals, or LTACs, with Kindred to a new operator and a pending disposition of 11 nonstrategic senior living assets with Brookdale. This approach can give the care providers operating flexibility and higher cash flow and also enable Ventas to recycle capital into attractive development, redevelopment or acquisition opportunities. We are committed to finding ways to support our customers' efforts to improve their own results and performance in ways that also benefit our portfolio and protect Ventas shareholders. As a result of our portfolio performance and accretive acquisitions, we drove good cash flow from operations this quarter 2, enabling us to pay our investors a strong and secure dividend of over 4%. We expect our board to increase our dividend in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
When we look at the investment market, we continue to see attractive opportunities, but we remain highly selective. We focus on deals that will generate reliable cash flow and cash flow growth at an appropriate risk-adjusted return. Our capital allocation is also strategic emphasizing sectors with upside and situations like Lillibridge, Atria, Wexford and Ardent, where significant future growth potential exists from consolidation and/or development. Our ability to invest capital across cycles to deliver value to our investors comes from the combination of our advantaged position within 6 asset classes or verticals, our strong relationships with market-leading customers and platforms and our teams' hard-earned experience and skills. 
The macro environment, on balance, continues to be favorable including GDP growth in the 2% to 3% range and a global thirst for yield that is accelerating foreign investment into U.S. real estate. While the expectation of higher interest rates can initially dampen enthusiasm for REITs and real estate, we are still enjoying the benefit of incredibly low long-term borrowing rates, reasonable job growth, rising household incomes, low inflation and improving corporate confidence, as expressed in surging M&A activity. Hopefully, we will also have certainty about the election soon. All of these conditions should be positive for commercial real estate fundamentals and growth. 
At Ventas, with our needs-based, demographically-driven business, a superb track record of consistent reliable growth, external investment opportunities, a terrific credit profile and an advantaged business mix, we should continue to thrive. Finally, the third quarter marked the anniversary of our Ardent deal and the successful spin-off of most of our skilled nursing facilities. When I reflect on the tremendous improvement in our enterprise since then, I really like what I see. Compared to the third quarter of 2015, we still generate over $2 billion in annualized NOI. Our assets are higher quality. Our business is more diverse. Our cash flow is robust and even more reliable, and most of our business is with the nation's leading care providers and research institutions, and we enjoy multiple channels for growth. We are also lucky to have a best-in-class team that truly enjoys working together for the benefit of shareholders. 
Now to talk about our positive quarter, I'm happy to turn the call over to our CFO, Bob Probst."
398549,404354004,1066674,"Ventas, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2016",2016-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Ventas, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Debbie. The third quarter was representative of the hallmark of Ventas' performance for over a decade, strong earnings growth on an even stronger balance sheet. And on the back of that performance, we are pleased to update and improve our guida",1797,"Thank you, Debbie. The third quarter was representative of the hallmark of Ventas' performance for over a decade, strong earnings growth on an even stronger balance sheet. And on the back of that performance, we are pleased to update and improve our guidance for both FFO and same-store NOI for the full year 2016. 
Before I get to our overall financial results and guidance, let me start by reviewing the performance of our high-quality health care and senior housing properties which, together, delivered same-store cash NOI growth of 2.4% for the nearly 1,200 assets in the company's quarterly same-store total portfolio. Performance in the quarter was led by our triple-net leased portfolio, which accounts for 42% of our NOI. Triple-net reported same-store cash NOI growth was 4.2% in Q3 versus the prior year, driven principally by strong in place lease escalations. Cash flow coverage in our overall stabilized triple-net leased portfolio for the second quarter of 2016, the latest available quarterly information, was strong and consistent with prior quarter at 1.7x reflecting the quality of our triple-net leased properties and of our operators. Coverage in our triple-net same-store senior housing portfolio remained at 1.3x. Coverage trends were driven by low single-digit EBITDARM growth at the asset level for the trailing 12 months. 
Our shareholders continue to benefit from our decision to spin off the majority of our post-acute portfolio in 2015, and this now represent only 4% of Ventas' NOI. Cash flow coverage in our stabilized post-acute portfolio is 1.9x. This rent coverage level, though a decline of 10 basis points sequentially, is still best-in-class among peers as skilled nursing operators remain under pressure. Finally, Ardent continues to go from strength to strength delivering continued positive momentum in top and bottom line key performance indicators. Adjusted admissions, revenue and EBITDA have continued to trend favorably through the third quarter. With solid year-to-date performance, we expect our triple-net segment to deliver toward the midpoint of our 3.5% to 4% full year 2016 same-store NOI range. 
Moving to our SHOP portfolio. Before we jump in to results, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on the value of senior housing through the lens of Hurricane Matthew in the Southeast United States. Our leading operators took every precaution and ensured the seniors in our communities were safe and secure as the hurricane approached, including stockpiling food, supplies and fuel for generators. Staff members went above and beyond to make the residents' safety their #1 priority, often staying overnight and supporting sister communities in the area. The support that our seniors received before, during and after the hurricane highlights the value of senior housing, dedicated staff and resources, peace of mind, safety and security and a sense of community even in the most challenging situations. All of us at Ventas thank our senior housing operator teams for their continued skill and commitment to seniors and their families. 
Let's turn to the Q3 SHOP results. The framework by which we established our SHOP guidance range for the year continues to hold up well. Our SHOP portfolio delivered a solid quarter generating Q3 same-store cash NOI growth of 2% versus the prior year. Rate showed continued strength growing 3.6% in the quarter versus 2015. Additionally, same-store occupancy grew 60 basis points sequentially, while the year-over-year occupancy shortfall narrowed to 30 basis points. Operating expenses rose nearly 5% driven by upward wage pressures, tempered by the lower fees from the new Sunrise agreement. The positive impact specifically of the permanent reduction in Sunrise management fees is approximately $1 million per quarter effective July 1, 2016, and therefore, benefited third quarter results. Our key coastal markets such as New York, L.A. and Boston continue to be the engine room of our overall SHOP portfolio growth in the third quarter. Our high barrier-to-entry infill communities, overall, represent approximately 70% of our SHOP NOI and grew Q3 same-store NOI mid-single digits on a continued strong rate growth. 
Also notable was a strong top and bottom line performance in the quarter of our Canadian portfolio, driven by very positive results from Atria's integration of the Canadian assets we acquired in 2014 and from our high-quality Sunrise Canada portfolio. Throughout 2016, we have consistently discussed our framework in regards to the impact of new supply on performance. This framework continues to be valid through the third quarter. Our NOI exposure and markets with a new supply surplus continues to represent 30% of our SHOP portfolio. And consistent with the framework and the initial guidance range we established at the start of the year, our same-store NOI in Q3 in these communities declined mid-single digits in aggregate. When combined with the mid-single-digit growth from the 70% of our portfolio in high barrier markets, we blend to the 2% overall same-store NOI growth in the quarter. 
We also continue to see the positive growth impact of redevelopments, overall, on our results. As a reminder, virtually all of our SHOP assets are in the same-store pool, including redevelopment properties, which can both suppress as well as increase same-store performance over time depending on stage of completion of the redevelopment. This is evident in the performance of the small pool of assets in the tertiary markets in the quarter, where the disruption from a full-scale redevelopment in Cape Cod impacted growth. 
For the full year 2016, we are trending toward the midpoint of our full year SHOP guidance range of 1.5% to 3% same-store NOI growth for the full year same-store pool. Looking ahead to 2017, we are working in close collaboration with our operator partners as they set the annual rate increases for existing residents for next year. We're encouraged by the continued pricing power in our portfolio and the clear value proposition of senior housing, as Hurricane Matthew demonstrated. Further, we continue to believe strongly that the leading operators and the best assets will continue to outperform and we like our position. 
We're excited to round out the segment review with our newly renamed office operations reporting segment, which now includes our medical office business as well as our newly acquired life science and innovation centers. Taken together, these new assets now represent approximately 25% of Ventas' annualized NOI. In our supplemental reporting this quarter, you will be able to find further details behind the office operations segments. 
We're pleased with the early performance of our life science acquisition, which closed in September. The 23 operating assets are performing well and in line with underwriting. The 2 development assets underway are on schedule, and we see exciting growth potential in the pipeline of future new developments. In our medical office business, cash NOI in the 354 property quarterly same-store pool increased modestly in the third quarter consistent with our expectations. Third quarter results were driven by rate growth from in-place rent escalations, mostly offset by lower year-over-year occupancy resulting from expected move outs as well as the timing of repair and maintenance spend. We continue to make progress on filling the leasing pipeline. Therefore, for the full year 2016, we expect the MOB business will also trend toward the midpoint of our 1% to 2% same-store growth guidance range for the full year asset pool. 
Turning to our overall financial results. In the third quarter, we delivered superior earnings growth and balance sheet strength supported by terrific capital markets execution. First, our earnings growth. Third quarter 2016 normalized FFO totaled $1.03 per fully diluted share, representing 5% growth on a comparable basis over the third quarter of 2015. The strong year-over-year growth was driven by accretive investments together with third quarter same-store NOI growth. Ventas made over $1.5 billion in new investments in the third quarter of 2016, principally, for the 25 life science and innovation centers managed by Wexford. 
During and following the quarter, in order to fund Wexford, we issued over $900 million in equity at an average gross price exceeding $73 per share. This included a block issuance in July for approximately $750 million as well as over $175 million of new ATM issuance in the quarter. We also made progress in our capital recycling program, realizing nearly $200 million in aggregate gross proceeds during and immediately after the quarter, principally, from loan repayments. The company's normalized FFO results in the third quarter benefited by $0.02 per share from receipt of a net fee associated with the repayment of loans in the quarter. Our year-to-date share of proceeds from asset sales and loan repayments now totals nearly $275 million, and we have line of sight for the $500 million of full year gross proceeds included in previous and current guidance. 
To round out the capital activity in the quarter, we also issued our best 10-year bond in the company's history, raising $450 million of 10-year senior notes and an all-in effective yield of 3.22%. This represented the lowest spread to treasuries and the lowest all-in 10-year rate in Ventas' history. In addition, the issuance was in very high demand demonstrating strong investor confidence in Ventas' financial strength. The outstanding capital markets activity during the quarter ensure that our balance sheet and liquidity grew even stronger. The company's net debt-to-EBITDA ratio held steady at 5.8x at the end of the third quarter. Our fixed charge coverage grew to an exceptional 4.7x. Our debt to gross asset value improved to 39% and our secured debt to total indebtedness reached 6%. 
Let me close out the prepared remarks with a revised full year guidance for the company. We're updating and improving our full year 2016 normalized FFO per share guidance to now range from $4.10 to $4.13, up from previous guidance of $4.05 to $4.13, an increase of nearly $0.03 at the midpoint. The new guidance represents 4% to 5% growth in normalized FFO over 2015 on a comparable basis. Our improved guidance range is a result of solid year-to-date portfolio performance, closed accretive acquisitions and excellent capital markets execution. 
On the heels of positive year-to-date portfolio performance trends, we are also raising the lower end of our total 2016 same-store NOI guidance range by 50 basis points. 2016 same-store NOI is now estimated to grow in the range of 2.5% to 3%, up from the company's previous range of 2% to 3%. Our guidance continued to assume 2016 asset dispositions of approximately $500 million. We assume the loan to Ardent to fund the LHP acquisition closes in Q1 of 2017 and therefore, is not included in our 2016 guidance. No further unannounced material acquisitions, dispositions or capital activity are assumed in guidance. 
In summary, the entire Ventas team is pleased with our highly productive third quarter, and our track record of sustained excellence throughout 2016. With that, I will ask the operator to please open the call for questions."

We're in a gigantic sector and we can invest at different parts of the capital structure, whether it was the BMR Mezz that we did or the secured loan or sale leasebacks, et cetera. And that is part of the formula that we've used to deliver reliable growth and income to investors for so long, and so this fits in that pattern. It was a customized solution. It enabled -- our willingness to step up with this capital enabled Ardent to get this deal with certainty because we provided certainty.
