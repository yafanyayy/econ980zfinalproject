We've delivered another strong quarter results and have terrific momentum on our business. In that context, this morning, we reaffirm the 2016 full year guidance we provided on our last earnings call. Before we get into the results, let me comment on 3 strategic initiatives. First, in late October, we completed the acquisition of Elmer's products. Elmer's Krazy Glue and X-Acto represent terrific new additions to our great portfolio and will provide dry-period synergies in Back-to-School, great cross-sell potential across our channels. And together with our very fast growing Prismacolor Paper Mate Flair and Mr. Sketch brands, strengthen our position in drawing and crafts. Elmer's sales will not contribute to core sales until the first anniversary of the completion of the acquisition. 
This morning, we shared our decision to deconsolidate Venezuela. We took this decision after significant deliberation. We concluded that the increasingly restricted nature of regulations in Venezuela and the limited and infrequent access to U.S. dollars has resulted in a loss of the company's ability to make key operational decision. We've taken a charge to reported earnings in Q4. And starting in Q1, we will no longer consolidated the performance of our Venezuelan operations. We've been doing business in Venezuela for many decades, and we expect to continue to manufacture and sell our products to Venezuelan consumers despite this accounting change. 
Lastly, in December, we announced a definitive agreement to combine Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden Corporation. We've secured committed financing to ensure deal closure, begun the process with the regulatory agencies and have a clear and deliberate path to secure permanent financing. The process will play out over the next few months, and we expect the transaction to be completed in Q2. 
We've taken these actions from a position of strength, having just finished one of the best years in our history with outstanding growth, margin and earnings delivery. 
So with that, let's get into our fourth quarter and full year results. In Q4, core sales grew 6.2%, the strongest quarterly core sales growth in years. Excluding Venezuela, core sales grew 4.4%. Normalized gross margin increased 80 basis points to 38.5%, driven by pricing, productivity and lower input costs, which were partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency. The increase in gross margin enabled us 70 basis point increase in advertising and promotion investment, 5.5% of sales, and when coupled with the 10 basis point reduction in overheads, resulted in a normalized operating margin increase, up 30 basis points, to 13.7%. Normalized EPS was $0.56, 14.3% ahead of prior year, despite having to overcome a $0.06 negative impact from foreign currency. Our fourth quarter core sales growth was broad-based with growth in all 5 segments. Combined, our Win Bigger businesses grew core sales 11.3%. 
Our full year results were strong as well. Core sales increased 5.5%. And excluding Venezuela, core sales grew 3.9%. Our Win Bigger businesses grew 9.4%. And our acquisitions, when coupled with the core sales growth, have offset the negative impact of currency and divestitures to yield 3.3% net sales growth. 
Despite currency pressure on cost, we expanded normalized gross margin 40 basis points to 39.2%. Importantly, for the full year, we increased A&P investment by over 17% to 4.9% of sales. And while spending more behind our brands, we simultaneously increased normalized operating margin 50 basis points, enabled by our efforts to make Newell leaner and more efficient through Project Renewal. All these together yielded 9% normalized EPS growth, despite having to absorb a negative $0.39 impact from foreign currency. 
Obviously, we're pleased with our results in 2015, and we have clear momentum in our business, and our operating model is working. 
Let me hand the call over to John to go through our results in more detail. John will also walk through the next steps in the Jarden transaction. I'll return to provide perspective and our latest view of 2016 and some thoughts on the creation of Newell brands."

The bubba, Baby Jogger and Elmer's acquisitions contributed 350 basis points to reported net sales. Core sales, which exclude the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and the 540 basis point negative impact of foreign currency, increased 6.2%, and all 5 of our segments grew in the quarter. 
Reported gross margin was 38.3%, up 70 basis points to last year, and normalized gross margin was 38.5%, up 80 basis points. This improvement was driven by pricing, productivity and favorable commodities, which more than offset unfavorable currency. 
Normalized SG&A expense was $387.3 million or 24.8% of sales, up 50 basis point versus the prior year. We continued our progress on overheads but significantly increased our investment in advertising and promotion by 70 basis points as a percentage of sales. We invested in major campaigns for Writing, including our Fine Writing business and Mr. Sketch, as well as Calphalon sharp pen self-sharpening color resets. We also invested in advertising for our Food Storage business and across a number of commercial products platforms. It's worth noting that for the full year we reduced overheads by 70 [ph] basis points as a percentage of sales, plowing those savings into the 60 basis points increased investment in A&P. 
Normalized operating margin was 13.7%, up 30 basis points, reflecting the benefits of Project Renewal and other cost-savings initiatives, pricing and productivity, partially offset by a significant increase in strategic investment. Reported operating margin was 6.5%, down from 7.4% in the prior year, due in part to higher restructuring charges and acquisition and integration costs. 
Interest expense increased $8.4 million year-over-year, including expenses associated with the Elmer's and pending Jarden transactions. During the fourth quarter, we issued $600 million in medium-term notes, the proceeds of which were used to provide permanent financing for Elmer's. 
Our normalized tax rate was 23.2% compared with 26.5% a year ago, and our full year normalized 2015 tax rate landed at 23.4%, about 10 basis points down from prior year. 
Normalized EPS, which excludes restructuring, restructuring-related and other project costs and certain other onetime items, was $0.56, a 14.3% increase to last year. On a reported basis, fourth quarter EPS was $0.05 compared with $0.19 last year, mostly driven by the gain on the sale of the indicia business, being more than offset by the noncash charge associated with deconsolidating Venezuela. 
I'll now move on to our segment results, and starting with Writing. Reported Q4 net sales were $466.3 million, up 11.5% with Elmer's contributing about $37 million. Core sales were up 12.5%. Our North American Writing business delivered high single-digit growth, again fueled by strong innovation, marketing and merchandising. In Latin America, Writing core sales showed significant growth, in part due to volume and pricing in Venezuela. For the full year, core sales grew 10.9% led by a great Back-to-School pricing and new product launches. Core sales growth in drawing and coloring, which includes Mr. Sketch, Prismacolor and Flair were up over 40% in 2015. 
Q4 normalized operating margin in our Writing segment was 22.7%, a 200 basis point decline versus prior year, and significant increased A&P investment and challenging foreign exchange more than offset productivity, pricing and cost management. 
Net sales in our Home Solutions segment declined 3.7% to $441.8 million. Core sales increased 0.1%, driven primarily by growth in our Food Storage and Beverage business, offsetting our continued exit of some low-margin Rubbermaid Consumer Storage business, as well as transition of product lines in culinary. For the full year, Home Solutions core sales grew 0.8%. The segment's normalized operating margin was 12.9% for the quarter, a 30 basis point decrease, reflecting significantly increased advertising, funded in part by productivity and input cost deflation. 
Our Tools segment delivered net sales of $207.7 million, an 8.6% decline. Core sales grew 1.4%. Tools delivered high single-digit growth in EMEA with modest growth in North America, while Latin America declined mid-single digits, reflecting challenges in Brazil macros and the impact on volumes as a result of pricing to cover foreign exchange. For the full year, core sales grew 2.2% in the Tools segment. Q4 normalized operating margin in the segment was 9.4%, a 10 basis point decline versus last year. The decline was driven by foreign exchange challenges in Europe and inflation in Brazil, more than offsetting productivity and disciplined overhead management. Reported net sales in our Commercial Products segment declined 2.8% to $207.1 million, driven by foreign exchange and the sale of our medical cards business earlier in the year. Core sales increased 5.8%, driven by pricing and strong volume growth in North America as well as growth in Latin America. For the full year, Commercial Products grew core sales 4.8%. Normalized operating margin in the fourth quarter was 13.3%, a 190 basis point increase to last year, thanks to pricing, productivity and input cost benefits, partially offset by higher investment in A&P. 
Our Baby segment reported $237.9 million in net sales, a 13.9% increase compared to 2014. Core sales grew a very strong 10.2%. Double-digit growth from Graco North America, driven by strong innovation and previous advertising and promotion investments more than offset declines in EMEA and APAC. For the full year, the segment's core sales grew 6.4%. Baby's Q4 normalized operating margin was 11.7%, up 340 basis points to last year, largely due to contributions from Baby Jogger and new product development as well as the comparison against the A&P investment we made last year to stimulate growth. 
Looking at Q4 sales by geography. North America core sales grew 5.7% with strong results from Writing, Commercial Products and Baby. EMEA declined 0.3% with growth from -- in Tools offset by modest declines in our other EMEA businesses. In Latin America, core sales grew 29.7% with pricing and volume gains in Writing and Commercial Products, more than offsetting challenges in Tools related primarily to the Brazilian economy. And finally, Asia-Pacific, core sales grew 0.2% with growth from Writing and Tools, offset by declines in Baby. 
Operating cash flow for the full year 2015 came in at $565.8 million compared to $634.1 million prior year, though recall, in 2015, we made a $70 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. pension plan, and we incurred higher restructuring and Project Renewal-related cash payments in 2015. Adjusting for these, our operating cash flow was up about 2% year-over-year. You'll note also that we recognized a significant gain associated with the sale of Endicia in the fourth quarter, and we have about $60 million in taxes we'll need to pay on the gain, which will due in the first quarter and which will be reflected in our first quarter operating cash flow. 
We returned $65 million to shareholders in Q4, including $50.9 million in dividends and $14.1 million to repurchase 337,000 shares. For the full year 2015, we distributed $206.3 million in dividends and $180.4 million to buy back 4.53 million shares. We suspended the repurchase of shares midway through the fourth quarter in light of the Jarden transaction. 
With respect to the transaction, we continue to make great progress towards the closing of the combination. Now this week, we finalized our $1.5 billion 3-year term loan, which will fund a portion of the purchase price. We also finalized the amendment of our revolving credit facility, including increasing the facility from $800 million to $1.25 billion to accommodate the increased seasonal working capital needs associated with adding Jarden to the family. We continue to work on the mechanics. We're assuming 2 tranches of Jarden notes, the 3.75% coupon notes and the 5% coupon notes, which we plan to retain after the merger. We're well underway on the works to go to public debt markets as we get closer to the anticipated closing in order to secure the balance of funds for the transaction, and we don't anticipate any challenges associated with the upcoming debt offer or with maintaining our committed investment-grade rating. 
Over the past several weeks, we've executed treasury rate lots for a little over $2 billion of the anticipated debt offering. In addition, recall that we have a fully committed bridge loan facility in place, which is available for us to utilize if we encounter any unforeseen challenges with issuing debt at attractive rates. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike."
291703,322157557,923533,"Newell Rubbermaid Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Newell Brands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Let's now turn to a quick discussion of 2016 and then to some comments on the Jarden combination. This morning, we reaffirmed our 2016 full year guidance for core sales growth and normalized EPS, excluding our Venezuelan operations. Our 2016",1467,"Thanks, John. Let's now turn to a quick discussion of 2016 and then to some comments on the Jarden combination. This morning, we reaffirmed our 2016 full year guidance for core sales growth and normalized EPS, excluding our Venezuelan operations. Our 2016 full year guidance is for core sales growth of 4% to 5% and normalized EPS of $2.21 to $2.30. Our best estimate for delivery is at the midpoints of these ranges. Excluding Venezuela for both 2016 and 2015 results, the midpoint of the normalized EPS range represents double-digit growth. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, the exclusion of Venezuela will negatively impact our Q1 2016 normalized EPS by about $0.03 to $0.04. 
There are 2 key factors that will influence where we fall in the 2016 full year guidance ranges. The first being the performance of Tools business, and the second, the impact of foreign currency. Our Tools segment had a challenging 2015 as the industrial products and services business slowed from high single-digit growth in 2014 to slight growth in 2015. This contraction in our growth rate was most pronounced in Brazil and China. Our 2016 outlook assumes better performance, driven by building IPNS momentum in the U.S. and Europe, partly offset by the continued sluggishness in Brazil. Our 2016 full year core sales guidance assumes low to mid-single-digit growth in our Tools segment. 
The second factor influencing our results will be foreign currency. Our 2016 full year guidance assumes a $0.26 to $0.28 negative impact of foreign exchange, $0.04 to $0.05 worse than our last estimate, driven by the late Q4 strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We've taken broad-based actions to deal with the expected negative ForEx impact with the most pricing actions already in the market. We expect that the combination of pricing, gross-to-net optimization, productivity and Project Renewal-driven overhead reductions to cover the ForEx headwinds, while simultaneously enabling increased investment and capabilities and brand support. 
In 2016, we're planning to increase A&P funding by about 20% to 5.5% of sales and continue to strengthen our insights and e-commerce capabilities with further investments. These investments are yielding strong growth dividends. In the U.S., in 2015, we increased value market share in 10 of the 13 product categories that IRI measures. In 9 of those product categories, our IRI dollars sell-out or POS grew by over 8%. The strong U.S. market share increases drove U.S. core sales growth of 4.1%, and when coupled with acquisitions, drove net sales growth of 8.8%. The strategic choice to reposition the company from a holding company to an operating company, releasing costs through Project Renewal, such that we increase spending behind our brands and invest in an advanced set of capabilities, is clearly working. Our track record of delivery and the value-creation story derived from our accelerating growth and margin development sets the stage for the next very exciting period of transformation as we combine our company with Jarden to create Newell brands. This combination will create a $16 billion consumer goods company of leading brands that compete in large, growing unconsolidated global markets. The combination scales the company in key geographies, customers and channels, more than doubling the business in the U.S., Canada, U.K., France, Germany, Mexico, Brazil, Japan and China. The combined portfolio is complementary and quite focused with over 80% of revenue concentrated in just 30 brands. And there are a number of intuitive combinations of brands and categories like Graco and as well as Rubbermaid, Food Storage and Food Saver that will yield greater consumer and customer impact for accelerated growth in category development. The combined portfolio is quite profitable with 80% of the combined revenue having a gross margin over 39% and operating margin over 15% before synergies. So there is plenty of gross margin to work with and with overheads focused, and in some cases, reoriented to the activities that drive growth, there will be significant potential for margin development and growth beyond what we expect to deliver through the synergies already identified. 
Our ambition is to bring together and leverage the best talent and capabilities from both companies to drive strong growth, increase margins and increase cash flow through superior insights and product design, leading innovation and brand development, strategic category management and selling, delivery of the cost synergies to margin, achievement of savings beyond those assumed in the acquisition model to fund increased brand investment and enterprise-wide capabilities for growth. And after paying down debt to our target leverage ratio of 3x to 3.5x, active portfolio management that strengthens our positions in key categories. We will deploy the best aspects of the playbooks from both companies to drive a highly competitive set of outcomes. We'll respect the differences in each category, channel and business model, yet simultaneously establish a set of enterprise-wide capabilities. We will scale and strengthen our selling capabilities to provide broadened access and reach for our categories and brands into new channels and customers. We will quickly adapt both companies rapidly developing e-commerce strengths to establish a leading capability in direct-to-consumer e-com, which is a differentiated Jarden capability and bricks-and-mortar and pure-play e-com, where both companies have excellent momentum. We will immediately play for procurement savings as the combined companies buy over $9 billion in source-finished goods, commodities and other services. We will leverage our scale for distribution savings in areas like ocean freight, where combined, we ship over 65,000 40-foot ocean containers a year from Asia. And of course, we'll quickly convert to savings associated with bringing 2 public companies together, establishing a lean and agile corporate infrastructure, very similar to what's in place today at Jarden. So we'll deliver these outcomes in a structured way, extending the scope of the Newell transformation office, which is in place to ensure the delivery of Project Renewal savings to the total enterprise, including the work of integration. We're roughly 30 days into planning, and we expect to find far more opportunities once the 2 teams are able to fully engage with each other. 
We've been conservative in our assumptions, but we'll pursue every opportunity we uncover. We have no revenue synergies, no working capital benefits and no tax synergies in our deal economics and have a very clear line of sight to a minimum $500 million of cost synergies. But first $500 million in synergies is expected to create a company with EBITDA margins of over 20% and annual EBITDA of over $3 billion, giving us the firepower to produce the leverage ratio to 3x to 3.5x within 2 to 3 years and then subsequently to deploy capital to create further value beyond our organic agenda. As John stated in his comments, we've secured committed financing to enable deal closure and expect to maintain our investment-grade rating. We're in the process of seeking the next regulatory approvals and expect to secure permanent financing sometime after both companies file their 10-Ks. With the current assumptions and despite widened credit spreads, we expect the deal will deliver high single-digit accretion in year 1, mid to high teens accretion by year 2 and strong double-digit accretion by year 3. 
So let me close now by reiterating that we've had an outstanding 2015, delivering strong competitive results. Growth continues to accelerate. And despite unprecedented foreign currency pressure, we've increased margins and delivered very strong normalized EPS growth. Our building momentum is a function of the sharp choices we've made. We're investing to create advantage brand development and innovation capabilities. And as a result, our innovation funnel has more than doubled since 2013 with project value up 160%. [ph] These innovations leverage a new product design capability we've invested to create at our purpose-built design center, and we are backing our growth ideas with industry-leading marketing investment. This investment has been enabled by our determination to make Newell leaner and more efficient and to unlock the trapped capacity for growth. Coupled with the actions we've taken to strengthen our portfolio, these choices are yielding some of the strongest results Newell has ever experienced. We're on a path to completely transform Newell Rubbermaid delivering highly competitive and differentiated results. Our operating model is extendable to more categories, more brands and more geographies. This is the core logic that underpins the Jarden combination. The creation of Newell brands will now allow the best talent at both companies to apply the best of what is working at both companies across a broader, more compelling and more diversified landscape of opportunity and brands. We will build one of the most exciting companies in our industry, a destination for talent, while simultaneously unlocking an incredible amount of value for our shareholders. 
That is the Growth Game Plan into action. That is the future Newell brands. Let me now pass the line to the operator for questions."

But if you remember, we changed our whole model back in the middle of '13, and I said that the gestation period of new ideas that were coming through our brand development organization was 18 to 24 months. And the way these projects work is they sort of layer into the market. And so as we progress through '16 and into '17, we get some of the strongest innovation ideas we've really ever had hitting the marketplace. An example of that is, in the first quarter, we'll launch new Paper Mate Gels with 3x faster drying ink versus the leading gel pen for an advantaged performance, less smearing. We'll launch Rubbermaid Fresh Works, which is -- which leverages our Food Storage business but applies the filtration of membrane to prevent oxidation from occurring on fresh fruits and vegetables, which should extend the produce life by -- we expect to extend the produce life by nearly 80%. So you've got a whole series of innovations. John mentioned the Sharp-end knives where Calphalon's got these ceramic sharpeners in the butcher block. So every time you withdraw the knife, you have the perfectly honed blade. So these are the examples of the kind of innovations that has started to filter into our business in late '15 and really hits its stride in 2016. So you've got the combination of increased spending. We've really sequential increased spending since we've been here. We tripled the amount of advertising we're spending on these brands. If you look at the number of GRPs we're delivering, we've actually increased it by 5x since we started because we've gotten so much efficiency in buying by going into one buying agency. So we've got all of these things converging in the marketplace, which gives us the confidence that when coupled with what's he building -- selling system with respect to commercial execution and strength and selling execution, those things all converge to give us confidence that 4% to 5% is deliverable, and Q4 is good evidence of that at 4.4% of growth, excluding Venezuela."

The teams presenting the final plans to me",439,"Yes, let me answer the first question. The answer simply is no, but we didn't have a lot built into our plans for 2016 for China. Remember, we'll launch it late in Q4 to get to market in maybe 1 or 2 big cities. The teams presenting the final plans to me shortly, but 1 or 2 big cities for Back-to-School '17, which is in February-ish in China. So we don't get a lot of benefit in the revenue line from China this year, but we will get some nice growth in Writing in 2017. But no, it should not impact anything we're doing on Newell Rubbermaid. In fact, one of the most important things that both companies can do in the transition is to execute their 2016 plans flawlessly. And while there will be a lot of work going on in the center to organize the delivery of the synergies, it is really critical that each set of operating units stays focused on the plans they built for 2016. So I wouldn't envision really anything materially changing for the company in terms of their core plans. On financing, yes, credit spreads have widened since we announced the deal in December, but there's all kinds of levers we can pull to mitigate that issue. And quite frankly, the interest rate sensitivity in the overall deal is the least meaningful variable as we've looked at sensitivity. So we don't know where it will all end. I think it will come down to the difference in tenor we could choose to place on the new debt, and we'll make that decision based on the best economic choice for the company. And if we have to accept slightly higher interest rates for the sake of making the right economic choice, we'll do that, we'll cover it someplace else in the algorithm. And obviously, one of the big levers we have is the balance of fixed and floating rate of debt we choose to deploy. But look, we're relatively relaxed. Of course, we would have preferred to not see credit spreads widen. The widening of credit spreads for BBB- debt -- our spreads don't look any different than the market at this point, so we're moving -- while we may have moved a little earlier than the market, we're in line with the market today. And we'll just have to see how that plays out. We're not going to compromise the right long-term choice for the sake of managing to an interest rate assumption because we have so many other levers in the P&L to compensate for that in the very near term."

All I would say, though, is, if you look at the numbers through the middle of -- through the third quarter, their organic growth was 5 -- year-to-date was 5.9%. So they had terrific momentum in their business. They have an incredibly strong year-ago performance in Q4 that they need to lap. And I know -- I'm sure you all know this, but their organic growth in Q4 of 2014 was 11.4%. So big hurdle to cross. No matter what way you cut it, with 5.9% bank through the end of Q3, they're going to have a very good year. And if you look at the combination of the 2 companies and look at their performance, once you get the data, the combination is going to be pretty darn strong relative to anybody else in our industry. With them having 5.9% growth bank through Q3 and us having now 5.5% bank in the full year, that's a strong set of numbers. And so I think -- our eyes set on the future. As I've said before, I don't get kind of luck in of any kind of 90-day performance cycles. Our view is set on what's going to happen over the next 3 years and how to unlock the value in this combination. So hopefully, I expressed that in a compelling way in my script. But obviously, we're very, very excited about leveraging what is terrific momentum in their business and terrific momentum in ours to bring the best of both companies together to build a set of assets and businesses that perform better than either of us would have been able to do our own. With respect to the design of the company, what I need our teams to do and what -- what I know Jim, Lily at Jarden is encouraging his team to do is to just focus to focus on delivery in 2016. Our energy and our synergies will be focused on the things I've spoken about previously and not on big sweeping design changes. Really important to keep our eye on the ball with respect to the demand-creation activities in both businesses, to preserve the momentum that I was referring to earlier. We'll figure out, as we get to know the business over time. We'll figure out what the right model is for the overall company. We'll do that quickly as we did when we joined Newell Rubbermaid. It's important to articulate a set of portfolio priorities in resources, human capital and money needs to flow to the businesses with the greatest opportunities. And so we will do all of that work, but we're not going to walk in with a preconceived notion of that. We will do that work over time and that will help shape our approach to how we organize. What is clear is that we will build a set of enterprise-wide capability to cut across both businesses in the areas of insight and design and innovation that our businesses can tap into and e-commerce, for example. So those are really obvious opportunities, and we will obviously combine 2 public companies into one, and there will be changes associated with that reality. But in the operating units, we want at -- everybody's head down focused on execution of plans that they got in place. Both companies have a very compelling set of plans for 2016. It's really important that we execute those with excellence."

I quoted some numbers of our U.S. POS, as mentioned by IRI. 10 of 13 categories, increasing market share, a sellout up over 8% in 9 of those 13 categories. So I've always had this point of view that ideas come from the macros, that it's our responsibility as a consumer brand company to bring the ideas to market and leverage our brands with the right kind of support behind them to trump whatever environment we're in, and our growth of 4.1% in the U.S. and 8.8% in the U.S., including acquisition, should be good testimony to that. I don't see any impact in -- from a consumer perspective in the growth of our categories, where we can measure that through IRI, I just don't see any impact at this point. The only business in our portfolio that has been sensitive to this has been the industrial products and services business, where, as I said, we went from high single-digit growth in 2014 to essentially slight growth in 2015. And I've previously commented on that trend began in about October of 2014. And so we see that's probably the only piece of our portfolio that is cyclical as our businesses evolved over the last number of years. We are far less cyclical than we were when we started. We are more consumer-driven than we were then, and we have way more brand support behind our brands such that they can absorb the macro cycles a lot better than they could in the past. But at the moment, I don't see a slowdown in markets or in the macros, and I don't see our customers really behaving in particularly defensive way like they did in 2009 during the recession. So you don't hear us talking about a macro issue, with the exception of Brazil, where it's a combination of GDP slowdown and the currency impact in the business and the need for us to price to protect margins to cover the transaction for us for its effect and the intersection of that with a slower economy creating pressure on volumes. So that's most important to our Tools business. It's certainly afactor that's influenced our Tools performance in 2015 and the most sensitive portion of our Tools business to that type of environment is the industrial products and services segment of that business."

We've delivered those savings on a base revenue stream that started at $5.5 billion. So do the math on 700 divided by 5.5 and then ask yourself whether 500 on the base of 10, which is the pro forma size of Jarden, is conservative or not conservative. So we've made a commitment to $500 million. We believe there probably is more. If we find more, which I expect we will likely do over time, as we did with Project Renewal, remember it was a sequential series of unpacking of the cost structure at Newell Rubbermaid. But if we do find more, a portion of that money will be invested back into the business for accelerated performance, either capabilities or in brand support on the Jarden businesses. And some will flow to margin beyond the $500 million committed to as part of the deal. The first 500 million is going to flow to margin. What happens after that? We will leverage any cost savings beyond that, that we can find to put the work to set up a different strategic future for the company while also passing some back to investors so come along for the ride."

We're not engaging customers with one voice at this point because that would be inappropriate as 2 separate companies, but the general feedback on the day the deal was announced, and I know Martin got some of this feedback as well from customers on the announcement date, and we subsequently have them in our conversations with retailers, has been very, very positive. As you know, the combination significantly scales our presence in a number of retailers in the U.S. We put that into the web deck that we put together when we announced the deal. We'll have over $2 billion of revenue at Wal-Mart, and they -- I think we'll end up being probably a top 8 or ninth position in terms of their overall suppliers. And on the general merchandise side, we'll be at the top, if not near the top. I think that's very exciting. That will lead to a really strategic set of conversations with all of our retailers where we scale. And the other thing about the combination of the companies is it opens up access to new channels for some categories. So Jarden has real strength in mass sporting goods with the Coleman brand and with some of their action sports businesses. That opens up opportunities for brand like Contigo and Avex, where we probably never would've gotten to investing the SG&A and selling expense to access those markets, which we can now access. And the reverse is true for Jarden. We have tremendous scale in home centers and in hardware and in the distributed trade in the U.S. through Commercial Products and Tools, which can provide the Jarden businesses access the channels. And so it's going to be very exciting to unlock all those opportunities. I don't view scaling customers being a leverage point would respect to negotiating. Our -- some people think, ""We're going to be yield a bigger stick at these customers."" That's not how we think about engagement with the retail partners. We think about building our business collaboratively. We have a responsibility as leaders in our categories to own the development of those categories at those retailers. And of course, we leverage our branded assets to do that. So we build share when we do that effectively, but we share accountability with our retail partners for developing the size of the pie, the size of the categories. And that's how we approach our relationships, and we expect combinations, and I'll be able to do that across a broader landscape of categories for our retail partners and through that become more of a strategic supplier to them. So unbelievable set of opportunities connected to the selling and the potential for strengthened strategic capability in that space."

Either -- if you look at our numbers, you probably haven't had time to plow through them all. We've got EBITDA of around $900 million in -- for Newell and Jarden is -- you can figure what Jarden is. And with synergies coming perhaps a little bit quicker than what was modeled, we'll be very quickly approaching $3 billion of EBITDA. And so we're going to have lots of flexibility to pay down the debt quickly, and we will -- we will want to do that. That's a commitment we made to get back into the range of 3 to 3.5x within 2 to 3 years, but I'm hoping we can do that closer to the 2 than to the 3. With respect to the other issues on potential derail that could undermine that, really don't see them make us we get so conservative in the assumptions we've made on the timing of synergies, the growth rate that we built into the model. So the tax opportunities, the working capital opportunities, we should have some quick wins there that are not built into the deal economics. And just going to take a little bit of time to get our arms around that, once we're able to more openly engage with each other, but not much time. We want to go for that type of stuff quite quickly. The other thing to recognize is that the leverage ratios look high at the beginning in part because the timing of the year we're doing this deal, right? So Q1 is probably the worst moment to try to convert a deal like this, given the flow of cash flow from of companies. So the optics of our leverage ratios are pretty high, probably half a click high at the end of the first quarter versus what they will quickly be over the next few quarters. So there's all those dynamics in place. We've made a commitment to get down to 3 to 3.5x. We're going to do that in a focused way. We are prioritizing capital allocation to that outcome. And the only exception to that is the CapEx assumptions regarding the business, which we have not compromised on CapEx investment on either business. We blended the base plans, and we won't pull back on that front and you should expect in the Newell Rubbermaid site for us to be spending around $200 million in CapEx this year, maybe slightly above that. And then on the dividend. We've assumed that we maintain Newell's current dividend of $0.76 per share. Obviously, across a higher share count, which means more cash out for that in the combination, but we believe that's an important element of our capital allocation strategy that will be and should be preserved."

You should expect Baby to have a very good year as well. We've got terrific momentum there with great innovation coming. Commercial Products, I think, you should expect another year of good progress. And you'll see probably the most change in our solutions, where Rubbermaid has a whole series of innovations that are coming to market like Fresh Works, like Fasten +Go, which is effectively taking our LunchBlox concept and executing an adult version of a lunchbox for work. And so that will come. And then in the back half of the year, we got another exciting Food Storage innovation that I won't disclose now that really will be very, very cool and fun to see how consumers respond to. So you've got 3 big innovations in Rubbermaid coming this year. You've got a big year on beverages as we continue to develop and build the Contigo AVAX, bubba and Rubbermaid brands in the space. And Calphalon is going to [indiscernible] he will go through complete relaunches. We saw some weakness in Calphalon in the fourth quarter as we're transitioning out of product lines and into new product lines, which start flowing in the year in the middle of Q1. So we've got a full facelift going on in Calphalon. And we've got the Goody brand relaunch, which is set for the second quarter of this year. So I think Home Solutions will probably be the place where you see the most change. We will continue in the -- to continue to optimize the Rubbermaid consumer business by continuing to pull back on consumer storage, the less profitable end of that business. So some of the positives that I was just referring to would be partially offset by continued contraction in that portion of the business as we look to reposition the Rubbermaid brand to play in areas where the brand can be differentiated and through differentiation comes higher gross margins, through margins comes higher affordability to invest and really create the renaissance in Rubbermaid that we hope to deliver over the next couple of years."

I guess first, and Mike, you sort of touched on this earlier. In terms of the need to invest behind the Jarden brand, it sounds like you don't see a big catch-up period here given that the first $500 million of cost saves will drop to the bottom exactly.

So yes, let me take the second part of the question first. The acquisition will not impact our drive to get to Newell Rubbermaid portfolio to 7% of sales.

The acquisition will not impact our drive to get to Newell Rubbermaid portfolio to 7% of sales. As I said in 2016, we'll get that ratio up to 5%, probably around 5.5%. And so we continue on that journey to the 7% threshold, and we think that happens in 2018, maybe a little bit of a bleed over into 2019, depending on how the renewal cost savings flow through to the P&L. So we don't see any interruption in that drive. On the Jarden businesses, we're just getting to know these businesses. I will tell you, all you have to do to understand the Jarden business and whether they have the algorithm right is look at 5.9% core sales through the 9-month period in 2015. That would suggest that there are a lot of things going right in these businesses. Of course, we believe in brands. And if we can find the flexibility beyond the first $500 million to find savings, we're going to want to invest back into brands. We believe that our design capability, which is enabling the step-up in innovation on the Newell Rubbermaid side of the family, is applicable, more broadly across more categories. In order to fund that, we'll have to invest some money to extend the shoulders of that capability, to be able to potentially help some of the Jarden businesses. But -- and of course, if we're going to -- if we can strengthen innovation in these businesses through that design capability, we're going to want to put advertising and promotion money behind it to stimulate awareness and trial of the new ideas. But I think if there was a place where you could or should expect us to explore investing, it's in that area. And we, of course, across the total landscape, are going to continue to invest in e-commerce. For Newell Rubbermaid, in the fourth -- in the full year, our e-commerce contribution in the U.S. to our POS growth was something close to 14%, which, if you go all the way back to our Analyst Day in May of 2012, you can look at what we quoted there as the contribution to revenue. You see this big step-up. That's in part and function of the investments we've made. We expect to make investments across the total enterprise in e-commerce. We'll fund that through any savings that comes beyond the $500 million. Now unlike what we did with Project Renewal, where the first couple of tranches of savings went fully back into the business, you should not expect us to do that with anything beyond the $500 million that we find. Some of this is going to flow back to investors for margin development beyond what we've committed to with the first $500 million, and some of it will flow back into the business. How that ratio breaks down? Yet to be determined. We have a lot of work to do to understand the opportunities. I had the opportunity to meet Hope and her team at the Yankee last week just to say hello and get to know them. They've got all kinds of really interesting things going on there. And so I suspect, as we get into these businesses, we will see and find all kinds of opportunities that, hopefully, by bringing the companies together will be able to plus up, just like Jarden has historically done as it has bought businesses and integrated it into the company. Look at the progress on Yankee. I used to be on the board there in 2005, 2006. They've got a big dynamic business in Europe that didn't exist when I was there. And that's happened since the Jarden acquisition. So there's plenty of evidence that, that work is already underway. And the question is can you overlay more funds to really unlock the upside in any of those areas that are particularly attractive. And again, too early to say where you place those bets or whether you can find the money beyond the 500, although our judgment tells us there's more to be found there and that we should go get that money so we can put it back in the business for growth acceleration."

We said we spent more money in A&P than we were planning on spending in the quarter, and Writing was the beneficiary of that, which it almost always is. The -- but we don't have a target margin for businesses. I mean anything over 20 in my experience is a really exciting place to be, because if you grow, you really created a ton of value. So I don't -- but I don't envision us drifting down to that level. But I also don't want to target and peg 25% operating income margin as a target margin for the Writing business because I feel like we might constrain the opportunities for growth. As we move Writing into new geographies, there's sort of an SG&A bubble you have to set in front of the -- ahead of the revenue stream. And our ambition is to deploy this portfolio as broadly as it is relevant to deploy it over the next 5 to 10 years. So there will be periods where there's a cost of growth associated with that choice that will be covered by some other business, just like you saw some of the businesses cover Tools investment in 2014. You see other businesses covered Baby investments at the beginning of this year. We'll now see Baby margins come back to fund other investments in Home Solutions. And so we manage this money very dynamically. And we don't let it get trapped in any particular segment. The leadership team allocates resource. And at any given period, operating -- you should expect operating margins to flex up and down, depending on what investment we're making."

So if you grow Writing -- when you grow Baby, you create a ton of value for investor to the ROIC [indiscernible] asset so high, just shy of Writing's levels. And Writing's levels or margin-driven. Baby's levels are driven by the absence of fixed assets in a very short value chain because most of our retail partners, many of them DI, direct import from the point of departure in Asia so we have very short value chain, inventory chain. So this is a great business. We expect to grow it. I think if I were building a model for the next number of years, I'd be building sort of mid-single-digit growth. There will be a moment in time when China opens up as a huge market. There are now car seat legislation. There is now car seat legislation in place, not yet being enforced, but that will create a car seat market over time. And when that happens want to be right in the middle of the growth that will come with baby gear. Our business is sourced from China. So we've got great presence there. So that if and when that markets opens, we will be in a position to participate in a more material away than we do today, but that will -- when that moment comes, that will trigger a different level of growth for the company in that segment. But I think the right planning stands at mid-singles."

In terms of focus on cash going forward, the model was built without any working capital improvements, but there are plenty of working capital improvements for the transaction as well as on our side. As we've talked about before, our inventories, we can do a little better job on. Overall, we built some inventories this year for growth and so forth, but we know we can do a better job managing inventories as well as managing the other pieces of working capital. So that will be a focus. It will be part of our incentive plan next year. We've talked about -- because of the importance of delivering on cash overall for us in terms of getting our leverage ratio down, as Mike said, as quickly as we reasonably kind to the 3 to 3.5x ratio.

We have the Dymo business, which gets consolidated in our Writing segment, and then what we call Writing and Creative Expression. Writing and creative expression is growing very, very well. This is where Sharpie and Paper Mate and and Prismacolor, they all live in that cluster. Fine Writing's been less positive to growth rate, and your observation is accurate. Growth in Europe was not as strong as we believe it can be over time, in part because [indiscernible] growth or Writing and growth was offset by Fine Writing declines. And so we're in the midst of repositioning our Fine Writing portfolio in Europe, pulling back on some of the low-end portions of that portfolio so that we focus brands like Parker and Waterman on the high-end portions of that portfolio. So that is what contributed to Europe's sort of modest writing results, terrific growth on writing and creative expression in markets like the U.K. and in France, offset by Fine Writing contraction in the same geographies. Over time, you should expect our Writing business to become more dominant and present in the core, which is writing and creative expression.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. We've delivered another strong quarter of results and have terrific momentum on our business.

We've delivered another strong quarter of results and have terrific momentum on our business. In that context, this morning, we reaffirm the 2016 full year guidance we provided on our last earnings call. Before we get into the results, let me comment on 3 strategic initiatives. First, in late October, we completed the acquisition of Elmer's products. Elmer's Krazy Glue and X-acto represent terrific additions to our great portfolio and will provide dry-period synergies in Back-to-School, great cross-sell potential across our channels. And together with our very fast growing Prismacolor, Paper Mate, Flair and Mr. Sketch brands, strengthen our position in drawing and crafts. Elmer's sales will not contribute to core sales until the first anniversary of the completion of the acquisition. 
This morning, we shared our decision to deconsolidate Venezuela. We took this decision after significant deliberation. We have concluded that the increasingly restricted nature of regulations in Venezuela and the limited and infrequent access to U.S. dollars has resulted in a loss of the company's ability to make key operational decisions. We've taken a charge to reported earnings in Q4. And starting in Q1, we will no longer consolidate the performance of our Venezuelan operations. We've been doing business in Venezuela for many decades, and we expect to continue to manufacture and sell our products to Venezuelan consumers despite this accounting change. 
Lastly, in December, we announced a definitive agreement to combine Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden Corporation. We've secured committed financing to ensure deal closure, begun the process with the regulatory agencies and have a clear and deliberate path to secure permanent financing. The process will play out over the next few months, and we expect the transaction to be completed in Q2. 
We've taken these actions from a position of strength, having just finished one of the best years in our history with outstanding growth, margin and earnings delivery.   
So with that, let's get into our fourth quarter and full year results. In Q4, core sales grew 6.2%, the strongest quarterly core sales growth in years. Excluding Venezuela, core sales grew 4.4%. Normalized gross margin increased 80 basis points to 38.5%, driven by pricing, productivity and lower input costs, which were partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency. The increase in gross margin enabled a 70 basis point increase in advertising and promotion investment, up 5.5% to sales, and when coupled with the 10 basis point reduction in overheads, resulted in a normalized operating margin increase, up 30 basis points, to 13.7%. Normalized EPS was $0.56, 14.3% ahead of prior year, despite having to overcome a $0.06 negative impact from foreign currency. Our fourth quarter core sales growth was broad-based, with growth in all 5 segments. Combined, our Win Bigger businesses grew core sales 11.3%. 
Our full year results were strong as well. Core sales increased 5.5%. And excluding Venezuela, core sales grew 3.9%. Our Win Bigger businesses grew 9.4%. And our acquisitions, when coupled with the core sales growth, have offset the negative impact of currency and divestitures to yield 3.3% net sales growth. 
Despite currency pressure on costs, we expanded normalized gross margin 40 basis points to 39.2%. Importantly, for the full year, we increased A&P investment by over 17% to 4.9% of sales. And while spending more behind our brands, we simultaneously increased normalized operating margin 50 basis points, enabled by our efforts to make Newell leaner and more efficient through Project Renewal. All these together yielded 9% normalized EPS growth, despite having to absorb a negative $0.39 impact from foreign currency. 
Obviously, we're pleased with our results in 2015, and we have clear momentum in our business, and our operating model is working. 
Let me hand the call over to John to go through our results in more detail. John will also walk through the next steps in the Jarden transaction. I'll return to provide perspective on our latest view of 2016 and some thoughts on the creation of Newell brands."

The bubba, Baby Jogger and Elmer's acquisitions contributed 350 basis points to reported net sales. Core sales, which exclude the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and the 540 basis point negative impact of foreign currency, increased 6.2% and all 5 of our segments grew in the quarter. 
Reported gross margin was 38.3%, up 70 basis points to last year, and normalized gross margin was 38.5%, up 80 basis points. This improvement was driven by pricing, productivity and favorable commodities, which more than offset unfavorable currency. 
Normalized SG&A expense was $387.3 million or 24.8% of sales, up 50 basis points versus the prior year. We continued our progress on overheads but significantly increased our investment in advertising and promotion by 70 basis points as a percentage of sales. We invested in major campaigns for Writing, including our Fine Writing business and Mr. Sketch as well as Calphalon sharpened self-sharpening color resets. We also invested in advertising for our Food Storage business and across a number of commercial products platforms. It's worth noting that for the full year we reduced overheads by 70 basis points as a percentage of sales, plowing those savings into the 60 basis point increased investment in A&P. 
Normalized operating margin was 13.7%, up 30 basis points, reflecting the benefits of Project Renewal and other cost-savings initiatives, pricing and productivity, partially offset by a significant increase in strategic investment. Reported operating margin was 6.5%, down from 7.4% in the prior year, due in part to higher restructuring charges and acquisition and integration costs. 
Interest expense increased $8.4 million year-over-year, including expenses associated with the Elmer's and pending Jarden transactions. During the fourth quarter, we issued $600 million in medium-term notes, the proceeds of which were used to provide permanent financing for Elmer's. 
Our normalized tax rate was 23.2% compared with 26.5% a year ago, and our full year normalized 2015 tax rate landed at 23.4%, about 10 basis points down from prior year. 
Normalized EPS, which excludes restructuring, restructuring-related and other project costs and certain other onetime items was $0.56, a 14.3% increase to last year. On a reported basis, fourth quarter EPS was $0.05 compared with $0.19 last year, mostly driven by the gain on the sale of the Endicia business, being more than offset by the noncash charge associated with deconsolidating Venezuela. 
I'll now move on to our segment results, and starting with Writing. Reported Q4 net sales were $466.3 million, up 11.5% with Elmer's contributing about $37 million. Core sales were up 12.5%. Our North American Writing business delivered high single-digit growth, again fueled by strong innovation, marketing and merchandising. In Latin America, Writing core sales showed significant growth, in part due to volume and pricing in Venezuela. For the full year, core sales grew 10.9% led by a great Back-to-School pricing and new product launches. Core sales growth in drawing and coloring, which includes Mr. Sketch, Prismacolor and Flair were up over 40% in 2015. 
Q4 normalized operating margin in our Writing segment was 22.7%, a 200 basis point decline versus prior year, and significant increased the A&P investment and challenging foreign exchange more than offset productivity, pricing and cost management. 
Net sales on our Home Solutions segment declined 3.7% to $441.8 million. Core sales increased 0.1%, driven primarily by growth in our Food Storage and Beverage ware business, offsetting our continued exit of some low-margin Rubbermaid Consumer Storage business as well as transition of product lines in culinary. For the full year, Home Solutions core sales grew 0.8%. The segment's normalized operating margin was 12.9% for the quarter, a 30 basis point increase, reflecting significantly increased advertising, funded in part by productivity and input cost deflation. 
Our Tools segment delivered net sales of $207.7 million, an 8.6% decline. Core sales grew 1.4%. Tools delivered high single-digit growth in EMEA, with modest growth in North America, while Latin America declined mid-single digits, reflecting challenges in Brazil macros and the impact on volumes as a result of pricing to cover foreign exchange. For the full year, core sales grew 2.2% in the Tools segment. Q4 normalized operating margin in the segment was 9.4%, a 10 basis point decline versus last year. The decline was driven by foreign exchange challenges in Europe and inflation in Brazil, more than offsetting productivity and disciplined overhead management. Reported net sales in our Commercial Product segment declined 2.8% to $207.1 million, driven by foreign exchange and the sale of our medical cards business earlier in the year. Core sales increased 5.8%, driven by pricing and strong volume growth in North America as well as growth in Latin America. For the full year, Commercial Products grew core sales 4.8%. Normalized operating margin in the fourth quarter was 13.3%, a 190 basis point increase to last year, thanks to pricing, productivity and input cost benefits, partially offset by higher investment in A&P. 
Our Baby segment reported $237.9 million in net sales, a 13.9% increase compared to 2014. Core sales grew a very strong 10.2%. Double-digit growth from Graco North America, driven by strong innovation and previous advertising and promotion investments more than offset declines in EMEA and APAC. For the full year, the segment's core sales grew 6.4%. Baby's Q4 normalized operating margin was 11.7%, up 340 basis points to last year, largely due to contributions from Baby Jogger and new product development as well as the comparison against the A&P investment we made last year to stimulate growth. 
Looking at Q4 sales by geography. North America core sales grew 5.7% with strong results from Writing, Commercial Products and Baby. EMEA declined 0.3% with growth from -- in Tools offset by modest declines in our other EMEA businesses. In Latin America, core sales grew 29.7% with pricing and volume gains in Writing and Commercial Products, more than offsetting challenges in Tools related primarily to the Brazilian economy. And finally, Asia-Pacific, core sales grew 0.2% with growth from Writing and Tools, offset by declines in Baby. 
Operating cash flow for the full year 2015 came in at $565.8 million compared to $634.1 million prior year, though recall, in 2015, we made a $70 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. pension plan, and we incurred higher restructuring and Project Renewal-related cash payments in 2015. Adjusting for these, our operating cash flow is up about 2% year-over-year. You'll note also that we recognized a significant gain associated with the sale of Endicia in the fourth quarter, and we have about $60 million in taxes we'll need to pay on the gain, which we'll do in the first quarter and which will be reflected in our first quarter operating cash flow. 
We returned $65 million to shareholders in Q4, including $50.9 million in dividends and $14.1 million to repurchase 337,000 shares. For the full year 2015, we distributed $206.3 million in dividends and $180.4 million to buy back 4.53 million shares. We suspended the repurchase of shares midway through the fourth quarter in light of the Jarden transaction. 
With respect to the transaction, we continue to make great progress towards the closing of the combination. Now this week, we finalized our $1.5 billion 3-year term loan, which will fund a portion of the purchase price. We also finalized the amendment of our revolving credit facility, including increasing the facility from $800 million to $1.25 billion to accommodate the increased seasonal working capital needs associated with adding Jarden to the family. We continue to work in the mechanics. We're assuming 2 tranches of Jarden notes, the 3.75% coupon notes and the 5% coupon notes, which we plan to retain after the merger. We're well underway and the works seems to go to the public debt markets as we get closer to the anticipated closing in order to secure the balance of funds for the transaction, and we don't anticipate any challenges associated with the upcoming debt offer or with maintaining our committed investment-grade rating. 
Over the past several weeks, we've executed treasury rate locks for a little over $2 billion of the anticipated debt offering. And in addition, recall that we have a fully committed bridge loan facility in place, which is available for us to utilize if we encounter any unforeseen challenges with issuing debt at attractive rates. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike."
291703,322157557,923696,"Newell Rubbermaid Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Newell Brands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Let's now turn to a quick discussion of 2016 and then to some comments on the Jarden combination. This morning, we reaffirmed our 2016 full year guidance for core sales growth and normalized EPS, excluding our Venezuelan operations. Our 2016",1465,"Thanks, John. Let's now turn to a quick discussion of 2016 and then to some comments on the Jarden combination. This morning, we reaffirmed our 2016 full year guidance for core sales growth and normalized EPS, excluding our Venezuelan operations. Our 2016 full year guidance is for core sales growth of 4% to 5% and normalized EPS of $2.21 to $2.30. Our best estimate for delivery is at the midpoints of these ranges. Excluding Venezuela for both 2016 and 2015 results, the midpoint of the normalized EPS range represents double-digit growth. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, the exclusion of Venezuela will negatively impact our Q1 2016 normalized EPS by about $0.03 to $0.04. 
There are 2 key factors that will influence where we fall in the 2016 full year guidance ranges. The first being the performance of our Tools business, and the second, the impact of foreign currency. Our Tools segment had a challenging 2015 as the industrial products and services business slowed from high single-digit growth in 2014 to slight growth in 2015. This contraction in our growth rate was most pronounced in Brazil and China. Our 2016 outlook assumes better performance, driven by building IP&S momentum in the U.S. and Europe, partially offset by continued sluggishness in Brazil. Our 2016 full year core sales guidance assumes low to mid-single-digit growth in our Tools segment. 
The second factor influencing our results will be foreign currency. Our 2016 full year guidance assumes a $0.26 to $0.28 negative impact of foreign exchange, $0.04 to $0.05 worse than our last estimate, driven by the late Q4 strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We've taken broad-based actions to deal with the expected negative ForEx impact, with the most pricing actions already in the market. We expect the combination of pricing, gross-to-net optimization, productivity and Project Renewal-driven overhead reductions to cover the ForEx headwinds, while simultaneously enabling increased investment and capabilities and brand support. 
In 2016, we're planning to increase A&P funding by about 20% to 5.5% of sales and continue to strengthen our insights and e-commerce capabilities with further investments. These investments are yielding strong growth dividends. In the U.S., in 2015, we increased value market share in 10 of the 13 product categories that IRI measures. In 9 of those product categories, our IRI dollars sell-out or POS grew by over 8%. These strong U.S. market share increases drove U.S. core sales growth of 4.1%, and when coupled with acquisitions, drove net sales growth of 8.8%. The strategic choice to reposition the company from a holding company to an operating company, releasing costs through Project Renewal, such that we increase spending behind our brands and invest in an advanced set of capabilities, is clearly working. Our track record of delivery and the value-creation story derived from our accelerating growth and margin development sets the stage for the next very exciting period of transformation as we combine our company with Jarden to create Newell brands. This combination will create a $16 billion consumer goods company of leading brands that compete in large, growing unconsolidated global markets. The combination scales the company in key geographies, customers and channels, more than doubling the business in the U.S., Canada, U.K., France, Germany, Mexico, Brazil, Japan and China. The combined portfolio is complementary and quite focused, with over 80% of revenue concentrated in just 30 brands. And there are a number of intuitive combinations of brands and categories like Graco in that as well as Rubbermaid, Food Storage and FoodSaver that will yield greater consumer and customer impact for accelerated growth in category development. The combined portfolio is quite profitable, with 80% of the combined revenue having a gross margin over 39% and operating margin over 15% before synergies. So there is plenty of gross margin to work with and with overheads focused, and in some cases, reoriented to the activities that drive growth, there will be significant potential for margin development and growth beyond what we expect to deliver through the synergies already identified. 
Our ambition is to bring together and leverage the best talent and capabilities from both companies to drive strong growth, increase margins and increase cash flow through superior insights and product design, leading innovation and brand development, strategic category management and selling, delivery of the cost synergies to margin, achievement of savings beyond those assumed in the acquisition model to fund increased brand investment and enterprise-wide capabilities for growth. And after paying down debt to our target leverage ratio of 3 to 3.5x, active portfolio management that strengthens our positions in key categories. We will deploy the best aspects of the playbooks from both companies to drive a highly competitive set of outcomes. We'll respect the differences in each category, channel and business model, yet simultaneously establish a set of enterprise-wide capabilities. We will scale and strengthen our selling capabilities to provide broadened access and reach for our categories and brands into new channels and customers. We will quickly adapt both companies, rapidly developing e-commerce strengths to establish a leading capability in direct-to-consumer e-com, which is a differentiated Jarden capability and bricks-and-mortar and pure-play e-com, where both companies have excellent momentum. We will immediately play for procurement savings as the combined companies buy over $9 billion in source-finished goods, commodities and other services. We will leverage our scale for distribution savings in areas like ocean freight, where combined, we ship over 65,000 40-foot ocean containers a year from Asia. And of course, we'll quickly convert to savings associated with bringing 2 public companies together, establishing a lean and agile corporate infrastructure, very similar to what's in place today at Jarden. So we'll deliver these outcomes in a structured way, extending the scope of the Newell transformation office, which is in place to ensure the delivery of Project Renewal savings to the total enterprise, including the work of integration. We're roughly 30 days into planning, and we expect to find far more opportunities once the 2 teams are able to fully engage with each other. 
We've been conservative in our assumptions, but we'll pursue every opportunity we uncover. We have no revenue synergies, no working capital benefits and no tax synergies in our deal economics and have a very clear line of sight to a minimum $500 million of cost synergies. The first $500 million in synergies is expected to create a company with EBITDA margins of over 20% and annual EBITDA of over $3 billion, giving us the firepower to produce the leverage ratio to 3 to 3.5x within 2 to 3 years and then subsequently to deploy capital to create further value beyond our organic agenda. As John stated in his comments, we've secured committed financing to enable deal closure and expect to maintain our investment-grade rating. We're in the process of seeking the necessary regulatory approvals and expect to secure permanent financing sometime after both companies file their 10-Ks. With the current assumptions and despite widened credit spreads, we expect the deal will deliver high single-digit accretion in year 1, mid- to high teens accretion by year 2 and strong double-digit accretion by year 3. 
So let me close now by reiterating that we've had an outstanding 2015, delivering strong competitive results. Growth continues to accelerate. And despite unprecedented foreign currency pressure, we've increased margins and delivered very strong normalized EPS growth. Our building momentum is a function of the sharp choices we'd made. We're investing to create advantaged brand development and innovation capabilities. And as a result, our innovation funnel has more than doubled since 2013 with project value up 160%. These innovations leverage a new product design capability we've invested to create at our purpose-built design center, and we are backing our growth ideas with industry-leading marketing investment. This investment has been enabled by our determination to make Newell leaner and more efficient and to unlock the trapped capacity for growth. Coupled with the actions we've taken to strengthen our portfolio, these choices are yielding some of the strongest results Newell has ever experienced. We're on a path to completely transform Newell Rubbermaid, delivering highly competitive and differentiated results. Our operating model is extendable to more categories, more brands and more geographies. This is the core logic that underpins the Jarden combination. The creation of Newell brands will now allow the best talent at both companies to apply the best of what is working at both companies across a broader, more compelling and more diversified landscape of opportunity and brands. We will build one of the most exciting companies in our industry, a destination for talent, while simultaneously unlocking an incredible amount of value for our shareholders. 
That is the Growth Game Plan into action. That is the future Newell brands. Let me now pass the line to the operator for questions."

If you remember, we changed our whole model back in the middle of '13, and I've said that the gestation period of new ideas that were coming through our brand development organization was 18 to 24 months. And the way these projects work is they sort of layer into the market. And so as we progress through '16 and into '17, we get some of the strongest innovation ideas we've really ever had hitting the marketplace. Example of that is, in the first quarter, we'll launch new Paper Mate InkJoy Gels, with 3x faster drying ink versus the leading gel pen for an advantaged performance, less smearing. We'll launch Rubbermaid Fresh Works, which is -- which leverages our Food Storage business but applies a filtration, a membrane to prevent oxidation from occurring on fresh fruits and vegetables, which should extend the produce life by -- we expect to extend the produce life by nearly 80%. So you've got a whole series of innovations. John mentioned the sharpened knives, where Calphalon's got these ceramic sharpeners in the butcher block. So every time you would draw the knife, you have the perfectly honed blade. And so these are the examples of the kind of innovation that has started to filter into our business in late '15 and really hits its stride in 2016. So you've got the combination of increased spending. We've really sequentially increased spending since we've been here. We tripled the amount of advertising we're spending on these brands. If you look at the number of GRPs we're delivering. We've actually increased it by 5x since we started because we've gotten so much efficiency in buying by going to one buying agency. So we've got all of these things converging in the marketplace, which gives us the confidence that when coupled with what's building -- selling system with respect to commercial execution and strength in selling execution, those things all converge to give us confidence that 4% to 5% is deliverable, and Q4 is good evidence of that at 4.4% growth, excluding Venezuela."

Remember, we'll launch late in Q4 to get to market in maybe 1 or 2 big cities. The teams presenting their final plans to me shortly, but 1 or 2 big cities for Back-to-School '17, which is in February-ish in China. So we don't get a lot of benefit in the revenue line from China this year, but we will get some nice growth in Writing in 2017. But no, it should not impact anything we're doing on Newell Rubbermaid. In fact, one of the most important things that both companies can do in the transition is to execute their 2016 plans flawlessly. And while there will be a lot of work going on in the center to organize the delivery of the synergies, it's really critical that each set of operating units stays focused on the plans they've built for 2016. So I wouldn't envision really anything materially changing for either company in terms of their core plans. On financing, yes, credit spreads have widened since we announced the deal in December, but there's all kinds of levers we can pull to mitigate that issue. And quite frankly, the interest rate sensitivity in the overall deal is the least meaningful variable as we've looked at sensitivity. So we don't know where it'll all end. I think it will come down to the difference in tenor we could choose to place on the new debt, and we'll make that decision based on the best economic choice for the company. And if we have to accept slightly higher interest rates for the sake of making the right economic choice, we'll do that. We'll cover it someplace else in the algorithm. And obviously, one of the big levers we have is the balance of fixed and floating rate of debt we choose to deploy. But look, we're relatively relaxed. Of course, we would have preferred to not see credit spreads widen. The widening of credit spreads for BBB- debt is -- our spreads don't look any different than the market at this point, so we're moving. While we may have moved a little earlier than the market, we're in line with the market today. And we'll just have to see how that plays out. We're not going to compromise the right long-term choice for the sake of managing to an interest rate assumption because we have so many other levers in the P&L to compensate for that in the very near term."

And I actually don't have access to their performance data. They're the ones that have to communicate that. All I would say, though, is, if you look at their numbers through the middle -- through the third quarter, their organic growth was 5 -- year-to-date was 5.9%. So they have terrific momentum in their business. They have an incredibly strong year-ago performance in Q4 that they need to lap. And I know -- I'm sure you all know this, but their organic growth in Q4 of 2014 was 11.4%. So big hurdle to cross. No matter what way you cut it, with 5.9% banked through the end of Q3, they're going to have a very good year. And if you look at the combination of the 2 companies and look at their performance, once you get their data, the combination is going to be pretty darn strong relative to anybody else in our industry. With them having 5.9% growth bank through Q3 and us having, now 5.5% bank in the full year, that's a strong set of numbers. And -- so I think our eyes are set on the future. As I've said before, I don't get kind of locked in on any kind of 90-day performance cycles. Our view is set on what's going to happen over the next 3 years and how to unlock the value in this combination. So hopefully, I expressed that in a compelling way in my script. But obviously, we're very, very excited about leveraging what is terrific momentum in their business and terrific momentum in ours to bring the best of both companies together to build a set of assets and businesses that perform better than either of us would have been able to do our own. With respect to the design of the company, what I need our teams to do and what I -- what I know Jim Lillie at Jarden is encouraging his team to do is to just focus to focus on delivery in 2016. Our energy and our synergies will be focused on the things I spoke about previously and not on big sweeping or design changes. Really important to keep our eye on the ball with respect to the demand-creation activities in both businesses, to preserve the momentum that I was referring to earlier. We'll figure out, as we get to know the business over time. We'll figure out what the right model is for the overall company. We'll do that quickly as we did when we joined Newell Rubbermaid. And it's important to articulate a set of portfolio priorities in resources, human capital and money needs to flow to the businesses with the greatest opportunities. And so we will do all of that work, but we're not going to walk in with a preconceived notion of that. We will do that work over time and that will help shape our approach to how we organize. What is clear is that we will build a set of enterprise-wide capabilities that cut across both businesses that -- in the areas of insight and design and innovation that our businesses can tap into e-commerce, for example. So those are really obvious opportunities, and we will obviously combine 2 public companies into one, and there will be changes associated with that reality. But in the operating units, we want to head -- everybody's head down focused on execution of the plans that they got in place. Both companies have a very compelling set of plans for 2016. It's really important that we execute those with excellence."

I quoted some numbers on our U.S. POS, as measured by IRI. 10 of 13 categories, increasing market share, a sell-out up over 8% in 9 of those 13 categories. So I've always had this point of view that ideas trump the macros. That it's our responsibility as a consumer brand company to bring the ideas to market and leverage our brands with the right kind of support behind them to trump whatever environment we're in, and our growth of 4.1% in the U.S. and 8.8% in the U.S., including acquisition, should be good testimony to that. I don't see any impact in -- from a consumer perspective in the growth of our categories, where we can measure that through IRI. I just don't see an impact at this point. The only business in our portfolio that has been sensitive to this has been the industrial products and services business, where, as I've said, we went from high single-digit growth in 2014 to essentially slight growth in 2015. And I've previously commented that that trend began in about October of 2014. And so we see -- that's probably the only piece of our portfolio that is cyclical as our businesses evolved over the last number of years. We are far less cyclical than we were when we started. And we are more consumer-driven than we were then, and we have way more brand support behind our brands such that they can absorb the macro cycles a lot better than they could in the past. But at the moment, I don't see the slowdown in markets or in the macros, and I don't see our customers really behaving in particularly, defensive way like they did in 2009 during the recession. So you don't hear us talking about the macro issue, with the exception of Brazil, where it's a combination of GDP slowdown and the currency impact on the business and the need for us to price to protect margins to cover the transaction for its effect and the intersection of that with a slower economy creating pressure on volumes. So that's most important to our Tools business. It's certainly a factor that's influenced our Tools performance in 2015 and the most sensitive portion of our Tools business to that type of environment is the industrial products and services segment of that business."

I mean, the way I'd answer that is, when we look at Project Renewal and what that will generate by the end of 2017, we'll be somewhere around $700 million of annualized savings from Project Renewal. We've delivered those savings on a base revenue stream that started at $5.5 billion. So do the math on 700 divided by $5.5 billion and then ask yourself whether $500 million on the base of 10, which is the pro forma size of Jarden, is conservative or not conservative. So we've made a commitment to $500 million. We believe there probably is more. If we find more, which I expect we will likely do over time, as we did with Project Renewal, remember it was a sequential series of unpacking of the cost structure at Newell Rubbermaid. But if we do find more, a portion of that money will be invested back into the business for accelerated performance, either in capabilities or in brand support on the Jarden businesses. And some will flow to margin beyond the $500 million committed to as part of the deal. The first 500 million is going to flow to margin. What happens after that? We will leverage any cost savings beyond that that we can find to put the work to set up a different strategic future for the company, while also passing some back to investors so that you come along for the ride."

We're not engaging customers with one voice at this point, because that would be inappropriate as 2 separate companies, but the general feedback on the day the deal was announced, and I know Martin got some of this feedback as well from customers from -- on the announcement date, and we subsequently had them in our conversations with retailers. It has been very, very positive. As you know, the combination significantly scales our presence in a number of retailers in the U.S. We put that into the web deck that we put together when we announced the deal. We'll have over $2 billion of revenue at Wal-Mart, and they -- I think we'll end up being probably a top -- in the eighth or ninth position in terms of their overall suppliers. And on the general merchandise side, we'll be at the top, if not near the top. I think that's very exciting. That will lead to a really strategic set of conversations with all of our retailers where we scale. And the other thing about the combination of the companies is it opens up access to new channels for some categories. So Jarden has real strength in mass sporting goods with the Coleman brand and with some of their action sports businesses. That opens up opportunities for brands like Contigo and Avex, where we probably never would've gotten to investing the SG&A and selling expense to access those markets, which we can now access. And the reverse is true for Jarden. We have tremendous scale in home centers and in hardware and in the distributed trade in the U.S. through Commercial Products and Tools, which can provide the Jarden businesses access the channels. And so it's going to be very exciting to unlock all those opportunities. I don't view scaling customers being a leverage point with respect to negotiating. Some people think, ""We're going to be able to yield a bigger stick at these customers."" That's not how we think about engagement with our retail partners. We think about building our business collaboratively. We have a responsibility as leaders in our categories to own the development of those categories at those retailers. And of course, we leverage our branded assets to do that. So we build share when we do that effectively, but we share accountability with our retail partners for developing the size of the pie, the size of the categories. And that's how we approach our relationships and we expect combinations, and I'll be able to do that across a broader landscape of categories for our retail partners and through that become more of a strategic supplier to them. So unbelievable set of opportunities connected to the selling and the potential for strengthened strategic capabilities in that space."

InkJoy gels go in the first quarter. We had good performance last year. Very, very good sellout performance, though we don't enter the year -- you can see in our receivables numbers. You didn't see tremendous movement in our receivables numbers a year-over-year. So that's a good sign that inventories have come down in the fourth quarter. Retail inventories have come down in the fourth quarter. That's true in a number of places, I suspect. And the kind of POS and sellout that we've got going on is really encouraging. We should have very good -- with good sell-through, comes good sell-in, and that set up well. We will spend more in Q1 than we did year ago from an A&P perspective with stronger innovation. And so we -- we're set up for a good first quarter, I think. And obviously, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and it's only -- not even really the end of January yet.

So we're very comfortable that 2.5 years from now, we'll be back in that range, give or take, absent some massive change in the underlying economic culture of the world overall. So we have good shape in terms of that. So with respect to the tax right now, obviously, I think the easiest thing to do is model just the blended tax rate between the 2 companies, but there is opportunity. And I know that's reflected, as Mike said, in the synergy numbers that he's talked about and so forth. And we're excited about bringing Jarden in together with us in terms of what we can do with some of our tax structures and so forth. So we definitely see upside on that, but it will take some time, obviously, to get the 2 companies together and into one tax system."

If you look at our numbers, you probably haven't even had time to kind of plow through them all. We've got EBITDA of around $900 million in -- for Newell and Jarden is -- you can figure out what Jarden is. And with synergies coming, perhaps, a little bit quicker than what was modeled, we'll be very quickly approaching $3 billion of EBITDA. And so we're going to have lots of flexibility to pay down the debt quickly, and we will -- we want to do that. That's the commitment we made to get back into the range of 3 to 3.5x within 2 to 3 years, but I'm hoping we can do that closer to the 2 than to the 3. With respect to the other issues on potential derailers that could undermine that, I really don't see them, because we get so conservative in the assumptions we've made on the timing of synergies, the growth rate that we built into the model. So the tax opportunities, the working capital opportunities. We should have some quick wins there that are not built into the deal economics. And just going to take a little bit of time to get our arms around that, once we're able to more openly engage with each other, but not much time. We want to go for that type of stuff quite quickly. The other thing to recognize is that the leverage ratios look high at the beginning, in part, because the timing of the year we're doing this deal, right? So Q1 is probably the worst moment to try to convert a deal like this, with given the flow of cash flow for both companies. So the optics of our leverage ratios are pretty high, probably half a click high, in the -- at the end of the first quarter versus what they will quickly be over the next few quarters. So with all those dynamics in place, we've made a commitment to get down to 3 to 3.5x. We're going to do that in a focused way. We are prioritizing capital allocation to that outcome. And the only exception to that is the CapEx assumptions we've got in the business, which we have not compromised on CapEx investment on either business. We blended the base plans, and we won't pull back on that front, and you should expect in the Newell Rubbermaid site for us to be spending around $200 million in CapEx this year, maybe slightly above that. And then on the dividend, we've assumed that we maintain Newell's current dividend of $0.76 per share, obviously across a higher share count, which means more cash out for that in the combination, but we believe that's an important element of our capital allocation strategy that will be and should be preserved."

And so that will come. And then in the back half of the year, we got another exciting Food Storage innovation that I won't disclose now, that really will be very, very cool and fun to see how consumers respond to. So you've got 3 big innovations in Rubbermaid coming this year. You've got a big year on beverages, as we continue to develop and build the Contigo, Avex, Bubba and Rubbermaid brands in this space. And Calphalon is going -- Calphalon and Goody will go through complete relaunches. We saw some weakness in Calphalon in the fourth quarter, as we're transitioning out of product lines and into new product lines, which start flowing in here in the year in the middle of Q1. So we've got a full facelift going on in Calphalon. And we've got the Goody brand relaunch, which is set for the second quarter of this year. So I think Home Solutions will probably be the place where you will see the most change. We will continue in the -- to continue to optimize the Rubbermaid consumer business by continuing to pull back on consumer storage, the less profitable end of that business. So some of the positives that I was just referring to will be partially offset by continued contraction in that portion of the business as we look to reposition the Rubbermaid brand to play in areas, where the brand can be differentiated and through differentiation, comes higher gross margins, through margins, comes higher affordability to invest and really create the renaissance in Rubbermaid that we hope to deliver over the next couple of years."

I guess first, and Mike, you sort of touched on this earlier. In terms of the need to invest behind the Jarden brand, it sounds like you don't see a big catch-up period here given that the first $500 million of cost saves will drop to the bottom exactly. But how do you think about your need to invest behind the Jarden brands? And secondly, how does the acquisition impact your goal of getting to A&P spend of about 7% of sales?"

So yes, let me take the second part of the question first. The acquisition will not impact our drive to get the Newell Rubbermaid portfolio to 7% of sales. As I said in 2016, we'll get that ratio up to 5%, probably around 5.5%. And so we continue on",720,"Yes. So yes, let me take the second part of the question first. The acquisition will not impact our drive to get the Newell Rubbermaid portfolio to 7% of sales. As I said in 2016, we'll get that ratio up to 5%, probably around 5.5%. And so we continue on that journey to the 7% threshold, and we think that happens in 2018, maybe a little bit of a bleed over into 2019, depending on how the renewal cost savings flow through to the P&L. So we don't see any interruption in that drive. On the Jarden businesses, we're just getting to know these businesses. I will tell you, all you have to do to understand the Jarden businesses and whether they have the algorithm right is to look at 5.9% core sales growth through the 9-month period in 2015. That would suggest that there are a lot of things going right in these businesses. Of course, we believe in brands. And if we can find the flexibility beyond the first $500 million to find savings, we're going to want to invest back into brands. We believe that our design capability, which is enabling the step-up in innovation on the Newell Rubbermaid side of the family, is applicable, more broadly across more categories. In order to fund that, we'll have to invest some money to extend the shoulders of that capability, to be able to potentially help some of the Jarden businesses. But -- and of course, if we're going to -- if we can strengthen innovation in these businesses through that design capability, we're going to want to put advertising and promotion money behind it to stimulate awareness and trial of the new ideas. But I think if there was a place where you could or should expect us to explore investing, it's in that area. And we, of course, across the total landscape, are going to continue to invest in e-commerce. For Newell Rubbermaid, in the fourth -- in the full year, our e-commerce contribution in the U.S. to our POS growth was something close to 14%, which if you go all the way back to our Analyst Day in May of 2012, you can look at what we quoted there as the contribution to revenue. And you see this big step-up. That's, in part, a function of the investments we've made. We expect to make investments across the total enterprise in e-commerce. We'll fund that through any savings that comes beyond the $500 million. Now unlike what we did with Project Renewal, where the first couple of tranches of savings went fully back into the business, you should not expect us to do that with anything beyond the $500 million that we find. Some of this is going to flow back to investors for margin development beyond what we've committed to with the first $500 million, and some of it will flow back into the business. How that ratio breaks down? Yet to be determined. We have a lot of work to do to understand the opportunities. I had the opportunity to meet Hope Margala and her team up at the Yankee last week, just to say hello and get to know them. They've got all kinds of really interesting things going on there. And so I suspect, as we get into these businesses, we will see and find all kinds of opportunities that, hopefully, by bringing the companies together will be able to plus up, just like Jarden has historically done, as it has bought businesses and integrated into the company. Look at the progress on Yankee. I used to be on the board there in 2005, 2006. They've got a big dynamic business in Europe that didn't exist when I was there. And that's happened since the Jarden acquisition. So there's plenty of evidence that, that work is already underway. And the question is, can you overlay more funds to really unlock the upside in any of those areas that are particularly attractive. And again, too early to say where you would place those bets or whether you can find the money beyond the 500, although our judgment tells us there's more to be found there. And we should go get that money, so we can put it back into the business for growth acceleration."

I know you talked about both foreign exchange and the higher investment spending pressuring the op margin in the fourth quarter, but it's been a while since we've seen margins go down to the tune of 200 bps. So -- and I know it's only one quarter and still for the year, they were up. But I'm just wondering kind of where we are with your commitment to higher spending going forward, with the China launch and all that kind of good stuff. Just on that business specifically, do you think 25% is kind of the right flush peak operating margin? Or do you still think there's room for margin expansion ahead?"

We said we spent more money in A&P than we were planning on spending in the quarter, and Writing was the beneficiary of that, which it almost always is. The -- but we don't have a target margin for businesses. I mean, anything over 20 in my experience is a really exciting place to be, because if you grow, you really create a ton of value. So I don't -- but I don't envision us drifting down to that level. But I also don't want to target and peg 25% operating income margin as a target margin for the Writing business, because I feel like we might constrain the opportunities for growth. As we move Writing into new geographies, there's sort of an SG&A bubble you have to accept in front of the -- ahead of the revenue stream. And our ambition is to deploy this portfolio as broadly as it is relevant to deploy it over the next 5 to 10 years. So there will be periods where there's a cost of growth associated with that choice that will be covered by some other business, just like you saw some of the businesses cover Tools investment in 2014. You see other businesses covered Baby investments at the beginning of this year. We'll now see Baby margins come back to fund other investments in Home Solutions. And so we manage this money very dynamically. And we don't let it get trapped in any particular segment. The leadership team allocates resource. And at any given period, operating -- you should expect operating income margins to flex up and down, depending on what investment paths we're making."

All right, so you guys are really excited to work with them and certainly, I think we can give them some perspective on things that had worked well for us. As Mike said, it's really consistent with taking the best of both companies. So we also had some things, I'm sure, we can learn about them and get a little bit more leverage out of our systems overall. So comfortable we'll get our arms around the business fairly quickly. And certainly in our meetings with them, they clearly have their arms around the business. So we're very comfortable with that. In terms of the excitement, certainly, it's not something, I think, that many of the employees expected, but we're excited, we're excited about the progress that certainly Mike and the team has made over the past 5 years to put us in this position to be able to rewrite the future for this company. And that's what the people are most excited about now. We look at the opportunity now with Jarden and things that we think we can do as we broaden our set of capabilities across a number of different new categories and new brands, and as Mike said, as well as the synergies, places where Jarden has been very successful, and we haven't been as successful in certain channels. So there's a lot of excitement. We know it's going to be a lot of work. It's been a lot of work for a number of people for the past 3 to 4 months, but it's going to be a great combination overall.

And so the opportunity is to bring this combination together and create the value of the lease that will naturally occur, but more importantly, strategically to create one of the leading consumer branded companies in the world, and certainly, a leader in the durable space, where nobody is going to be able to have the capabilities we have. We'll have the affordability to invest in a really advantaged set of brand development capabilities that should enable us to trump the competition. We'll compete in category country sells and get lesser competition, it's quite small. So if we want -- if we -- as we set this company up to be managed the way we manage things today, where we -- a senior group of people, leaders from each of the businesses come together every year to allocate resource, as we allocate those against the businesses with the greatest right to win, we should see really tremendous release of value and growth. And that will create a very, very exciting story going forward. We are on a risk-on scenario and a risk-off environment at the moment because of the leverage that we need to raise to bring these 2 companies together. And that is why we have the clarity, the security, and the sense of what will happen next to give us the confidence that what we said about maintaining investment great, getting the deal financed, getting the deal -- having the deal deliver a high single-digit accretion in year 1, and mid-teens to high-teens in year 2 and strong double-digit accretion in year 3. We have the confidence and line of sight to all the moving parts in that algorithm, to give us the security that the risk-on increase is appropriate for our company. The market doesn't have access to everything that we've got access to, and we don't have the opportunity to talk as explicit as we would like to, to the market until the transaction is consummated. So we're in that period where there's uncertainty and a risk-off environment, and I'm sure that's creating pressure. We will, over time, in a very deliberate way, articulate our vision for the company and what we believe is going to be possible through the combination, and I am certain we'll find more opportunity, the more time we have to engage with the partners and we -- on the Jarden side. And we intend to bring the best of both together to bear on this collection of categories that are really quite strategic. The opportunity is quite strategic. These are large, growing categories with unconsolidated markets, and the brand portfolio is powerful because we have leading positions in those categories. And so there's so much roll-up potential, either organically or through a combination of organic and external development, that it -- you just sort of feel like a kid in a candy store in terms of the potential opportunities ahead. We're going to do this deliberately. We're going to do this -- with putting the best people on the field that we can to unlock the upside, and we couldn't be more excited by what's ahead. But our line of sight goes beyond the next 90 or 30 days. It's the next 3 years. And it's putting in motion the set of choices that I think we will illuminate over time for the market, but we are certain will unlock the value we are -- we have represented to you, if not more."

With a combination actually potentially brings together some really exciting opportunities, particularly with milk and Baby Jogger, and there are a couple of European soothing businesses as well that Jarden has. So we've got some tremendous opportunity here. We love our Baby business. It's a different business than the rest in that on our side of the family, we've outsourced the manufacturing to a strategic partner. So our gross margins are dilutive to the total company performance. But because we don't own the assets, our return on the investment capital is quite high. It's just next to Writing in terms of its value-creation potential that we grow. So when you grow Writing -- when you grow Baby, you create a ton of value for investors to the ROIC [indiscernible] asset is so high, just shy of Writing's levels. And Writing's levels are margin-driven. Baby's levels are driven by the absence of fixed assets in a very short value chain, because most of our retail partners, many of them DI, direct import, from the point of departure in Asia. So we have a very short value chain, inventory chain. So this is a great business. We expect to grow it. I think if you -- if I were building a model for the next number of years, I'd be building sort of mid-single-digit growth. There will be a moment in time when China opens up as a huge market. There are now car seat legislation. There is now car seat legislation in place, not yet being enforced, but that will create a car seat market over time. And when that happens, we want to be right in the middle of the growth that will come with Baby gear. Our business is sourced from China. So we've got great presence there. So that if and when that markets opens, we will be in a position to participate in a more material way than we do today, but that will -- when that moment comes, that will trigger a different level of growth for the company in that segment. But I think the right planning stands at mid-singles."

And so we're in the midst of repositioning our Fine Writing portfolio in Europe, pulling back on some of the low-end portions of that portfolio, so that we focus brands like Parker and Waterman on the high-end portions of that portfolio. So that is what contributed to Europe's sort of modest writing results, terrific growth on writing and creative expression in markets like the U.K, and in France, offset by Fine Writing contraction in the same geographies. Over time, you should expect our Writing business to become more dominant and present in the core, which is writing and creative expression. We've got a terrific plan in place for our Writing business in 2016. I think you should plan for like performance in your models for '16 as we delivered in '15, ex Venezuela. And while we haven't quoted a specific number for writing ex Venezuela, and you shouldn't expect us to, you're in the general ballpark with your analysis."

We've delivered another strong quarter of results and have terrific momentum on our business. In that context, this morning, we reaffirm the 2016 full year guidance we provided on our last earnings call. 
Before we get into the results, let me comment on 3 strategic initiatives. First, in late October, we completed the acquisition of Elmer's products. Elmer's Krazy Glue and X-acto represent terrific additions to our great portfolio and will provide dry-period synergies at Back-to-School, great cross-sell potential across our channels and together with our very fast-growing Prismacolor, Paper Mate, Flair and Mr. Sketch brands, strengthen our position in drawing and crafts. Elmer's sales will not contribute to core sales until the first anniversary of the completion of the acquisition. 
This morning, we shared our decision to deconsolidate Venezuela. We took this decision after significant deliberation. We have concluded that the increasingly restricted nature of regulations in Venezuela and the limited and infrequent access to U.S. dollars has resulted in a loss of the company's ability to make key operational decisions. We've taken a charge to reported earnings in Q4. And starting in Q1, we will no longer consolidate the performance of our Venezuelan operations. We've been doing business in Venezuela for many decades, and we expect to continue to manufacture and sell our products to Venezuelan consumers despite this accounting change. 
Lastly, in December, we announced a definitive agreement to combine Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden Corporation. We've secured committed financing to ensure deal closure, begun the process with the regulatory agencies and have a clear and deliberate path to secure permanent financing. The process will play out over the next few months, and we expect the transaction to be completed in Q2. 
We've taken these actions from a position of strength, having just finished one of the best years in our history with outstanding growth, margin and earnings delivery.   
So with that, let's get into our fourth quarter and full year results. In Q4, core sales grew 6.2%, the strongest quarterly core sales growth in years. Excluding Venezuela, core sales grew 4.4%. Normalized gross margin increased 80 basis points to 38.5%, driven by pricing, productivity and lower input costs, which were partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency. The increase in gross margin enabled a 70-basis-point increase in advertising and promotion investment, to 5.5% of sales, and when coupled with the 10-basis-point reduction in overheads, resulted in a normalized operating margin increase of 30 basis points, to 13.7%. Normalized EPS was $0.56, 14.3% ahead of prior year, despite having to overcome a $0.06 negative impact from foreign currency. Our fourth quarter core sales growth was broad-based, with growth in all 5 segments. Combined, our Win Bigger businesses grew core sales 11.3%. 
Our full year results were strong as well. Core sales increased 5.5%. And excluding Venezuela, core sales grew 3.9%. Our Win Bigger businesses grew 9.4%. And our acquisitions, when coupled with the core sales growth, have offset the negative impact of currency and divestitures to yield 3.3% net sales growth. 
Despite currency pressure on costs, we expanded normalized gross margin 40 basis points to 39.2%. Importantly, for the full year, we increased A&P investment by over 17% to 4.9% of sales. And while spending more behind our brands, we simultaneously increased normalized operating margin 50 basis points, enabled by our efforts to make Newell leaner and more efficient through Project Renewal. 
All this together yielded 9% normalized EPS growth, despite having to absorb a negative $0.39 impact from foreign currency. Obviously, we're pleased with our results in 2015, and we have clear momentum in our business, and our operating model is working. 
Let me hand the call over to John to go through our results in more detail. John will also walk through the next steps in the Jarden transaction. I'll return to provide perspective on our latest view of 2016 and some thoughts on the creation of Newell Brands."

The bubba, Baby Jogger and Elmer's acquisitions contributed 350 basis points to reported net sales. Core sales, which exclude the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and the 540-basis-point negative impact of foreign currency, increased 6.2% and all 5 of our segments grew in the quarter. 
Reported gross margin was 38.3%, up 70 basis points to last year, and normalized gross margin was 38.5%, up 80 basis points. This improvement was driven by pricing, productivity and favorable commodities, which more than offset unfavorable currency. 
Normalized SG&A expense was $387.3 million or 24.8% of sales, up 50 basis points versus the prior year. We continued our progress on overheads but significantly increased our investment in advertising and promotion by 70 basis points as a percentage of sales. We invested in major campaigns for Writing, including our Fine Writing business and Mr. Sketch, as well as Calphalon SharpIN self-sharpening color resets. We also invested in advertising for our Food Storage business and across a number of commercial products platforms. It's worth noting that for the full year, we reduced overheads by 70 basis points as a percentage of sales, plowing those savings into the 60-basis-point increased investment in A&P. 
Normalized operating margin was 13.7%, up 30 basis points, reflecting the benefits of Project Renewal and other cost-savings initiatives, pricing and productivity, partially offset by a significant increase in strategic investment. Reported operating margin was 6.5%, down from 7.4% in the prior year, due in part to higher restructuring charges and acquisition and integration costs. 
Interest expense increased $8.4 million year-over-year, including expenses associated with the Elmer's and pending Jarden transactions. During the fourth quarter, we issued $600 million in medium-term notes, the proceeds of which were used to provide permanent financing for Elmer's. 
Our normalized tax rate was 23.2% compared with 26.5% a year ago, and our full year normalized 2015 tax rate landed at 23.4%, about 10 basis points down from prior year. 
Normalized EPS, which excludes restructuring, restructuring-related and other project costs and certain other onetime items, was $0.56, a 14.3% increase to last year. On a reported basis, fourth quarter EPS was $0.05 compared with $0.19 last year, mostly driven by the gain on the sale of the Endicia business, being more than offset by the noncash charge associated with deconsolidating Venezuela. 
I'll now move on to our segment results, and starting with Writing. Reported Q4 net sales were $466.3 million, up 11.5% with Elmer's contributing about $37 million. Core sales were up 12.5%. Our North American Writing business delivered high single-digit growth, again fueled by strong innovation, marketing and merchandising. In Latin America, Writing core sales showed significant growth, in part due to volume and pricing in Venezuela. For the full year, core sales grew 10.9% led by a great Back-to-School pricing and new product launches. Core sales growth in drawing and coloring, which includes Mr. Sketch, Prismacolor and Flair were up over 40% in 2015. 
Q4 normalized operating margin in our Writing segment was 22.7%, a 200-basis-point decline versus prior year as significant increased A&P investment and challenging foreign exchange more than offset productivity, pricing and cost management. 
Net sales on our Home Solutions segment declined 3.7% to $441.8 million. Core sales increased 0.1%, driven primarily by growth in our Food Storage and Beverage ware business, offsetting our continued exit of some low-margin Rubbermaid Consumer Storage business, as well as transition of product lines in culinary. For the full year, Home Solutions' core sales grew 0.8%. The segment's normalized operating margin was 12.9% for the quarter, a 30-basis-point increase, reflecting significantly increased advertising, funded in part by productivity and input cost deflation. 
Our Tools segment delivered net sales of $207.7 million, an 8.6% decline. Core sales grew 1.4%. Tools delivered high single-digit growth in EMEA, with modest growth in North America, while Latin America declined mid-single digits, reflecting challenges in Brazil macros and the impact on volumes as a result of pricing to cover foreign exchange. For the full year, core sales grew 2.2% in the Tools segment. 
Q4 normalized operating margin in the segment was 9.4%, a 10-basis-point decline versus last year. The decline was driven by foreign exchange challenges in Europe and inflation in Brazil, more than offsetting productivity and disciplined overhead management. 
Reported net sales in our Commercial Product segment declined 2.8% to $207.1 million, driven by foreign exchange and the sale of our medical cards business earlier in the year. Core sales increased 5.8%, driven by pricing and strong volume growth in North America, as well as growth in Latin America. For the full year, Commercial Products grew core sales 4.8%. 
Normalized operating margin in the fourth quarter was 13.3%, a 190-basis-point increase to last year, thanks to pricing, productivity and input cost benefits, partially offset by higher investment in A&P. 
Our Baby segment reported $237.9 million in net sales, a 13.9% increase compared to 2014. Core sales grew a very strong 10.2%. Double-digit growth from Graco North America, driven by strong innovation and previous advertising and promotion investments, more than offset declines in EMEA and APAC. For the full year, the segment's core sales grew 6.4%. 
Baby's Q4 normalized operating margin was 11.7%, up 340 basis points to last year, largely due to contributions from Baby Jogger and new product development, as well as the comparison against the A&P investment we made last year to stimulate growth. 
Looking at Q4 sales by geography. North America core sales grew 5.7%, with strong results from Writing, Commercial Products and Baby. EMEA declined 0.3% with growth from -- in Tools offset by modest declines in our other EMEA businesses. In Latin America, core sales grew 29.7%, with pricing and volume gains in Writing and Commercial Products more than offsetting challenges in Tools related primarily to the Brazilian economy. And finally, Asia-Pacific core sales grew 0.2%, with growth from Writing and Tools offset by declines in Baby. 
Operating cash flow for the full year 2015 came in at $565.8 million compared to $634.1 million prior year, though recall, in 2015, we made a $70 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. pension plan, and we incurred higher restructuring and Project Renewal-related cash payments in 2015. Adjusting for these, our operating cash flow is up about 2% year-over-year. 
You'll note also that we recognized a significant gain associated with the sale of Endicia in the fourth quarter, and we have about $60 million in taxes we'll need to pay on the gain, which we'll do in the first quarter and which will be reflected in our first quarter operating cash flow. 
We returned $65 million to shareholders in Q4, including $50.9 million in dividends and $14.1 million to repurchase 337,000 shares. For the full year 2015, we distributed $206.3 million in dividends and $180.4 million to buy back 4.53 million shares. We suspended the repurchase of shares midway through the fourth quarter in light of the Jarden transaction. 
With respect to the transaction, we continue to make great progress toward the closing of the combination. This week, we finalized our $1.5 billion 3-year term loan, which will fund a portion of the purchase price. We also finalized the amendment of our revolving credit facility, including increasing the facility from $800 million to $1.25 billion to accommodate the increased seasonal working capital needs associated with adding Jarden to the family. 
We continue to work on the mechanics. We're assuming 2 tranches of Jarden notes, the 3.75% coupon notes and the 5% coupon notes, which we plan to retain after the merger. We're well underway and the word seems to go to the public debt markets as we get closer to the anticipated closing in order to secure the balance of funds for the transaction, and we don't anticipate any challenges associated with the upcoming debt offer or with maintaining our committed investment-grade rating. 
Over the past several weeks, we've executed treasury rate locks for a little over $2 billion of the anticipated debt offering. And in addition, recall that we have a fully committed bridge loan facility in place, which is available for us to utilize if we encounter any unforeseen challenges with issuing debt at attractive rates. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike."
291703,322157557,923817,"Newell Rubbermaid Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Newell Brands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Let's now turn to a quick discussion of 2016 and then to some comments on the Jarden combination. This morning, we reaffirmed our 2016 full year guidance for core sales growth and normalized EPS, excluding our Venezuelan operations. Our 2016",1466,"Thanks, John. Let's now turn to a quick discussion of 2016 and then to some comments on the Jarden combination. This morning, we reaffirmed our 2016 full year guidance for core sales growth and normalized EPS, excluding our Venezuelan operations. Our 2016 full year guidance is for core sales growth of 4% to 5% and normalized EPS of $2.21 to $2.30. Our best estimate for delivery is at the midpoints of these ranges. Excluding Venezuela for both 2016 and 2015 results, the midpoint of the normalized EPS range represents double-digit growth. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, the exclusion of Venezuela will negatively impact our Q1 2016 normalized EPS by about $0.03 to $0.04. 
There are 2 key factors that will influence where we fall in the 2016 full year guidance ranges. The first being the performance of our Tools business, and the second, the impact of foreign currency. Our Tools segment had a challenging 2015 as the industrial products and services business slowed from high single-digit growth in 2014 to slight growth in 2015. This contraction in our growth rate was most pronounced in Brazil and China. Our 2016 outlook assumes better performance, driven by building IP&S momentum in the U.S. and Europe, partially offset by continued sluggishness in Brazil. Our 2016 full year core sales guidance assumes low- to mid-single-digit growth in our Tools segment. 
The second factor influencing our results will be foreign currency. Our 2016 full year guidance assumes a $0.26 to $0.28 negative impact of foreign exchange, $0.04 to $0.05 worse than our last estimate, driven by the late Q4 strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We've taken broad-based actions to deal with the expected negative ForEx impact, with the most pricing actions already in the market. We expect the combination of pricing, gross-to-net optimization, productivity and Project Renewal-driven overhead reductions to cover the ForEx headwinds, while simultaneously enabling increased investment in capabilities and brand support. 
In 2016, we're planning to increase A&P funding by about 20% to 5.5% of sales and continue to strengthen our insights and e-commerce capabilities with further investments. These investments are yielding strong growth dividends. In the U.S., in 2015, we increased value market share in 10 of the 13 product categories that IRI measures. In 9 of those product categories, our IRI dollars sell-out or POS grew by over 8%. These strong U.S. market share increases drove U.S. core sales growth of 4.1%, and when coupled with acquisitions, drove net sales growth of 8.8%. 
The strategic choice to reposition the company from a holding company to an operating company, releasing costs through Project Renewal, such that we increase spending behind our brands and invest in an advanced set of capabilities, is clearly working. Our track record of delivery and the value-creation story derived from our accelerating growth and margin development sets the stage for the next very exciting period of transformation as we combine our company with Jarden to create Newell Brands. 
This combination will create a $16 billion consumer goods company of leading brands that compete in large, growing unconsolidated global markets. The combination scales the company in key geographies, customers and channels, more than doubling the business in the U.S., Canada, U.K., France, Germany, Mexico, Brazil, Japan and China. The combined portfolio is complementary and quite focused, with over 80% of revenue concentrated in just 30 brands. And there are a number of intuitive combinations of brands and categories like Graco and Nook, as well as Rubbermaid, Food Storage and FoodSaver that will yield greater consumer and customer impact for accelerated growth in category development. 
The combined portfolio is quite profitable, with 80% of the combined revenue having a gross margin over 39% and operating margin over 15% before synergies. So there is plenty of gross margin to work with and with overheads focused, and in some cases, reoriented to the activities that drive growth, there will be significant potential for margin development and growth beyond what we expect to deliver through the synergies already identified. 
Our ambition is to bring together and leverage the best talent and capabilities from both companies to drive strong growth, increased margins and increased cash flow through superior insights and product design, leading innovation and brand development, strategic category management and selling, delivery of the cost synergies to margin, achievement of savings beyond those assumed in the acquisition model to fund increased brand investment and enterprise-wide capabilities for growth, and after paying down debt to our target leverage ratio of 3 to 3.5x, active portfolio management that strengthens our positions in key categories. 
We will deploy the best aspects of the playbooks from both companies to drive a highly competitive set of outcomes. We'll respect the differences in each category, channel and business model, yet simultaneously establish a set of enterprise-wide capabilities. We will scale and strengthen our selling capabilities to provide broadened access and reach for our categories and brands into new channels and customers. 
We will quickly adapt both companies' rapidly developing e-commerce strengths to establish a leading capability in direct-to-consumer e-com, which is a differentiated Jarden capability, and bricks-and-mortar and pure-play e-com, where both companies have excellent momentum. 
We will immediately play for procurement savings as the combined companies buy over $9 billion in source-finished goods, commodities and other services. We will leverage our scale for distribution savings in areas like ocean freight, where combined, we ship over 65,000 40-foot ocean containers a year from Asia. And of course, we'll quickly convert to savings associated with bringing 2 public companies together, establishing a lean and agile corporate infrastructure, very similar to what's in place today at Jarden. 
So we'll deliver these outcomes in a structured way, extending the scope of the Newell transformation office, which is in place to ensure the delivery of Project Renewal savings to the total enterprise, including the work of integration. We're roughly 30 days into planning, and we expect to find far more opportunities once the 2 teams are able to fully engage with each other. 
We've been conservative in our assumptions, but we'll pursue every opportunity we uncover. We have no revenue synergies, no working capital benefits and no tax synergies in our deal economics and have a very clear line of sight to, at a minimum, $500 million of cost synergies. 
The first $500 million in synergies is expected to create a company with EBITDA margins of over 20% and annual EBITDA of over $3 billion, giving us the firepower to produce the leverage ratio to 3 to 3.5x within 2 to 3 years and then subsequently, to deploy capital to create further value beyond our organic agenda. 
As John stated in his comments, we've secured committed financing to enable deal closure and expect to maintain our investment-grade rating. We're in the process of seeking the necessary regulatory approvals and expect to secure permanent financing sometime after both companies file their 10-Ks. With the current assumptions and despite widened credit spreads, we expect the deal will deliver high single-digit accretion in year 1, mid- to high teens accretion by year 2 and strong double-digit accretion by year 3. 
So let me close now by reiterating that we've had an outstanding 2015, delivering strong competitive results. Growth continues to accelerate. And despite unprecedented foreign currency pressure, we've increased margins and delivered very strong normalized EPS growth. Our building momentum is a function of the sharp choices we'd made. We're investing to create advantaged brand development and innovation capabilities. And as a result, our innovation funnel has more than doubled since 2013 with project value up 160%. These innovations leverage a new product design capability we've invested to create at our purpose-built design center, and we are backing our growth ideas with industry-leading marketing investment. This investment has been enabled by our determination to make Newell leaner and more efficient and to unlock the trapped capacity for growth. 
Coupled with the actions we've taken to strengthen our portfolio, these choices are yielding some of the strongest results Newell has ever experienced. We're on a path to completely transform Newell Rubbermaid, delivering highly competitive and differentiated results. Our operating model is extendable to more categories, more brands and more geographies. This is the core logic that underpins the Jarden combination. 
The creation of Newell Brands will now allow the best talent at both companies to apply the best of what is working at both companies across a broader, more compelling and more diversified landscape of opportunity and brands.

If you remember, we changed our whole model back in the middle of '13, and I've said that the gestation period on new ideas that were coming through our brand development organization was 18 to 24 months. And the way these projects work is they sort of layer into the market. And so as we progress through '16 and into '17, we get some of the strongest innovation ideas we've really ever had hitting the marketplace. An example of that is in the first quarter, we'll launch new Paper Mate InkJoy Gels, with 3x faster drying ink versus the leading gel pen for an advantaged performance, less smearing. We'll launch Rubbermaid FRESHWORKS, which is -- which leverages our Food Storage business, but applies a filtration, a membrane to prevent oxidation from occurring on fresh fruits and vegetables, which should extend the produce life by -- we expect to extend the produce life by nearly 80%. So you've got a whole series of innovations. John mentioned the SharpIN knives, where Calphalon's got these ceramic sharpeners in the butcher block. So every time you withdraw the knife, you have the perfectly honed blade. And so these are the examples of the kind of innovation that had started to filter into our business in late '15 and really hits its stride in 2016. So you've got the combination of increased spending. We've really sequentially increased spending since we've been here. We tripled the amount of advertising we're spending on these brands. If you look at the number of GRPs we're delivering, we've actually increased it by 5x since we started because we've gotten so much efficiency in buying by going to one buying agency. So we've got all of these things converging in the marketplace, which gives us the confidence that when coupled with what's a building -- a selling system with respect to commercial execution and strength in selling execution, those things all converge to give us confidence that 4% to 5% is deliverable, and Q4 is good evidence of that at 4.4% growth, excluding Venezuela."

Remember, we'll launch late in Q4 to get to market in maybe 1 or 2 big cities. The team's presenting their final plans to me shortly, but 1 or 2 big cities for Back-to-School '17, which is in February-ish in China. So we don't get a lot of benefit in the revenue line from China this year, but we will get some nice growth in Writing in 2017. But no, it should not impact anything we're doing on Newell Rubbermaid. In fact, one of the most important things that both companies can do in the transition is to execute their 2016 plans flawlessly. And while there'll be a lot of work going on in the center to organize the delivery of the synergies, it's really critical that each set of operating units stays focused on the plans they've built for 2016. So I wouldn't envision really anything materially changing for either company in terms of their core plans. On financing, yes, credit spreads have widened since we announced the deal in December, but there's all kinds of levers we can pull to mitigate that issue. And quite frankly, the interest rate sensitivity in the overall deal is the least meaningful variable as we've looked at sensitivities. So we don't know where it'll all end. I think it will come down to the difference in tenor we could choose to place on the new debt, and we'll make that decision based on the best economic choice for the company. And if we have to accept slightly higher interest rates for the sake of making the right economic choice, we'll do that. We'll cover it someplace else in the algorithm. And obviously, one of the big levers we have is the balance of fixed or floating rate debt we choose to deploy. But look, we're relatively relaxed. Of course, we would have preferred to not see credit spreads widen. The widening of credit spreads for BBB- debt is -- our spreads don't look any different than the market at this point, so we're moving. While we may have moved a little earlier than the market, we're in line with the market today. And we'll just have to see how that plays out. We're not going to compromise the right long-term choice for the sake of managing to an interest rate assumption because we have so many other levers in the P&L to compensate for that in the very near term."

In Q4, we made the first in a series of investments we'll make in shopper insights, to ensure that we're driving leading levels of category management. Jo Arcuri and his team are really focused on taking our selling capabilities sort of the next level, bringing the best of what fast-moving consumer goods have and category management capabilities to the consumer durables space. And part of putting the fundamentals in place is establishing a good foundation of shopper insights. So we made an investment in Q4 in that as well. We had the flexibility to do that. And as you know, with the Q3 -- on the Q3 call, I mentioned that if we had the room to do more, we would invest more. And that's, in fact, what we did. It's a strategic investment in A&P.

And I actually don't have access to their performance data as they're the ones that have to communicate that. All I would say, though, is if you look at their numbers through the middle -- through the third quarter, their organic growth was 5 -- year-to-date was 5.9%. So they have terrific momentum in their business. They have an incredibly strong year-ago performance in Q4 that they need to lap. And I know -- I'm sure you all know this, but their organic growth in Q4 of 2014 was 11.4%. So a big hurdle to cross. No matter what way you cut it, with 5.9% banked through the end of Q3, they're going to have a very good year. And if you look at the combination of the 2 companies and look at their performance once you get their data, the combination is going to be pretty darn strong relative to anybody else in our industry. With them having 5.9% growth banked through Q3 and us having, now 5.5% banked on the full year, that's a strong set of numbers. And so I think our eyes are set on the future. As I've said before, I don't get kind of locked in on any kind of 90-day performance cycles. Our view is set on what's going to happen over the next 3 years and how to unlock the value in this combination. So hopefully, I expressed that in a compelling way in my script. But obviously, we're very, very excited about leveraging what is terrific momentum in their business and terrific momentum in ours to bring the best of both companies together, to build a set of assets and businesses that perform better than either of us would have been able to do our own. With respect to the design of the company, what I need our teams to do and what I -- what I know Jim Lillie at Jarden is encouraging his team to do is to just focus on delivery in 2016. Our energy and our synergies will be focused on the things I spoke about previously and not on big sweeping or design changes. Really important to keep our eye on the ball with respect to the demand-creation activities in both businesses, to preserve the momentum that I was referring to earlier. We'll figure out -- as we get to know the business over time, we'll figure out what the right model is for the overall company. We'll do that quickly as we did when we joined Newell Rubbermaid. And it's important to articulate a set of portfolio of priorities in resources, human capital and money needs to flow to the businesses with the greatest opportunities. And so we will do all of that work, but we're not going to walk in with a preconceived notion of that. We will do that work over time and that'll help shape our approach to how we organize. What is clear is that we will build a set of enterprise-wide capabilities that cut across both businesses that -- in the areas of insight and design and innovation that our businesses can tap into -- and e-commerce, for example. So those are really obvious opportunities, and we will obviously combine 2 public companies into one, and there will be changes associated with that reality. But in the operating units, we want to head -- everybody's head down focused on execution of the plans that they got in place. Both companies have a very compelling set of plans for 2016. It's really important that we execute those with excellence."

I quoted some numbers on our U.S. POS, as measured by IRI. 10 of 13 categories, increasing market share, a sell-out up over 8% in 9 of those 13 categories. So I've always had this point of view that ideas trump the macros. That it's our responsibility as a consumer brand company to bring the ideas to market and leverage our brands with the right kind of support behind them to trump whatever environment we're in, and our growth of 4.1% in the U.S. and 8.8% in the U.S., including acquisition, should be good testimony to that. I don't see any impact in -- from a consumer perspective in the growth of our categories. Where we can measure that through IRI, I just don't see an impact at this point. The only business in our portfolio that has been sensitive to this has been the industrial products and services business, where, as I said, we went from high single-digit growth in 2014 to essentially, slight growth in 2015. And I've previously commented that that trend began in about October of 2014. And so we see -- that's probably the only piece of our portfolio that is cyclical as our businesses evolved over the last number of years. We are far less cyclical than we were when we started. And we are more consumer-driven than we were then, and we have way more brand support behind our brands such that they can absorb the macro cycles a lot better than they could in the past. But at the moment, I don't see the slowdown in markets or in the macros, and I don't see our customers really behaving in a particularly defensive way like they did in 2009 during the recession. So you don't hear us talking about the macro issue, with the exception of Brazil, where it's a combination of GDP slowdown and the currency impact on the business and the need for us to price to protect margins to cover the transaction ForEx effect and the intersection of that with a slower economy creating pressure on volumes. So that's most important to our Tools business. It's certainly a factor that's influenced our Tools performance in 2015 and the most sensitive portion of our Tools business to that type of environment is the industrial products and services segment of that business."

We've delivered those savings on a base revenue stream that started at $5.5 billion. So do the math on $700 million divided by $5.5 billion and then ask yourself whether $500 million on the base of $10 million, which is the pro forma size of Jarden, is conservative or not conservative. So we've made a commitment to $500 million. We believe there probably is more. If we find more, which I expect we will likely do over time, as we did with Project Renewal, remember it was a sequential series of unpacking of the cost structure at Newell Rubbermaid, but if we do find more, a portion of that money will be invested back into the business for accelerated performance, either in capabilities or in brand support on the Jarden businesses. And some will flow to margin beyond the $500 million committed to as part of the deal. The first $500 million is going to flow to margin. What happens after that? We will leverage any cost savings beyond that that we can find to put the work to set up a different strategic future for the company, while also passing some back to investors so that you come along for the ride."

We're not engaging customers with 1 voice at this point, because that would be inappropriate as 2 separate companies, but the general feedback on the day the deal was announced, and I know Martin got some of this feedback as well from customers from -- on the announcement date, and we've subsequently had them in our conversations with retailers, it's been very, very positive. As you know, the combination significantly scales our presence in a number of retailers in the U.S. We put that into the web deck that we put together when we announced the deal. We'll have over $2 billion of revenue at Wal-Mart, and they -- I think we'll end up being probably a top -- in the eighth or ninth position in terms of their overall suppliers. And on the general merchandise side, we'll be at the top, if not near the top. I think that's very exciting. That'll lead to a really strategic set of conversations with all of our retailers where we scale. And the other thing about the combination of the companies is it opens up access to new channels for some categories. So Jarden has real strength in mass sporting goods with the Coleman brand and with some of their action sports businesses. That opens up opportunities for brands like Contigo and Avex, where we probably never would have gotten to investing the SG&A and selling expense to access those markets, which we can now access. And the reverse is true for Jarden. We have tremendous scale in home centers and in hardware and in the distributed trade in the U.S. through Commercial Products and Tools, which can provide the Jarden businesses access to channels. And so it's going to be very exciting to unlock all those opportunities. I don't view ""scale the customer"" as being a leverage point with respect to negotiating. Some people think, ""Oh, we're going to be able to yield a bigger stick at these customers."" That's not how we think about engagement with our retail partners. We think about building our business collaboratively. We have a responsibility as leaders in our categories to own the development of those categories at those retailers. And of course, we leverage our branded assets to do that. So we build share when we do that effectively, but we share accountability with our retail partners for developing the size of the pie, the size of the categories. And that's how we approach our relationships and we expect in combination, to now be able to do that across a broader landscape of categories for our retail partners and through that, become more of a strategic supplier to them.

We're pretty bullish on our -- on what the first half of the year has to offer because a lot of our new items ship in the first half of the year. So Rubbermaid's FRESHWORKS goes. InkJoy gels go in the first quarter. We had good performance last year. Very, very good sellout performance, though we don't enter the year -- you can see it in our receivables numbers. You didn't see tremendous movement in our receivables numbers year-over-year. So that's a good sign that inventories have come down in the fourth quarter. Retail inventories have come down in the fourth quarter. That's true in a number of places, I suspect. And the kind of POS and sellout that we've got going on is really encouraging. We should have very good -- with good sell-through comes good sell-in, and that's set up well. We will spend more in Q1 than we did year ago from an A&P perspective with stronger innovation. And so we -- we're set up for a good first quarter, I think. And obviously, the proof of the pudding's in the eating, and it's only -- not even really the end of January yet. But green lights in the engine room. So there are always things that you've got challenges that you got to overcome. And undoubtedly, we will have those to deal with this year."

So we're very comfortable that 2.5 years from now, we will be back in that range, give or take, absent some massive change in the underlying economic culture of the world overall. So we have good shape in terms of that. With respect to the tax right now, obviously, I think the easiest thing to do is model just the blended tax rate between the 2 companies, but there is opportunity. Now none of that's reflected, as Mike said, in the synergy numbers that he's talked about and so forth. And we're excited about bringing Jarden in together with us in terms of what we can do with some of our tax structures and so forth.

If you look at our numbers, you probably haven't had time to kind of plow through them all. We've got EBITDA of around $900 million in for Newell and Jarden is -- you can figure out what Jarden is. And with synergies coming perhaps a little bit quicker than what was modeled, we'll be very quickly approaching $3 billion of EBITDA. And so we're going to have lots of flexibility to pay down the debt quickly, and we will -- we'll want to do that. That's the commitment we've made to get back into the range of 3 to 3.5x within 2 to 3 years, but I'm hoping we can do that closer to the 2 than to the 3. With respect to the other issues on potential derailers that could undermine that, I really don't see them, because we've been so conservative in the assumptions we've made on the timing of synergies, the growth rate that we've built into the model, so the tax opportunities, the working capital opportunities. We should have some quick wins there that are not built into the deal economics. And just going to take a little bit of time to get our arms around that, once we're able to more openly engage with each other, but not much time. We want to go for that type of stuff quite quickly. The other thing to recognize is that the leverage ratios look high at the beginning, in part, because of the timing of the year we're doing this deal, right. So Q1 is probably the worst moment to try to convert a deal like this, with -- given the flow of cash flow for both companies. So the optics of our leverage ratios are pretty high, probably half a click high, in the -- at the end of the first quarter versus what they will quickly be over the next few quarters. So there's all those dynamics that plays. We've made a commitment to get down to 3 to 3.5x. We're going to do that in a focused way. We are prioritizing capital allocation to that outcome. And the only exception to that is the CapEx assumptions we've got in the business, which we have not compromised on CapEx investment on either business. We blended the base plans, and we won't pull back on that front, and you should expect in the Newell Rubbermaid side for us to be spending around $200 million in CapEx this year, maybe slightly above that. And then on the dividend, we've assumed that we maintain Newell's current dividend of $0.76 per share, obviously across a higher share count, which means more cash out for that in the combination, but we believe that's an important element of our capital allocation strategy that'll be and should be preserved."

We typically don't guide core sales by segment, but I think you should expect Writing to have another very good year, albeit without the benefit of Venezuela. You should expect Baby to have a very good year as well. We've got terrific momentum there with great innovation coming. Commercial Products, I think, should expect another year of good progress. And you'll see probably the most change in Home Solutions, where Rubbermaid has a whole series of innovations that are coming to market, like FRESHWORKS, like Fasten + Go, which is effectively taking our LunchBlox concept and executing an adult version of a lunchbox for work. And so that'll come. And then in the back half of the year, we got another exciting Food Storage innovation that I won't disclose now, that really will be very, very cool and fun to see how consumers respond to. So you've got 3 big innovations in Rubbermaid coming this year. You've got a big year on beverages, as we continue to develop and build the Contigo, Avex, bubba and Rubbermaid brands in this space, so -- and Calphalon is going -- Calphalon and Goody will go through complete relaunches. We saw some weakness in Calphalon in the fourth quarter, as we're transitioning out of product lines and into new product lines, which start flowing in here in the year in the middle of Q1. So we've got a full facelift going on in Calphalon. And we've got the Goody brand relaunch, which is set for the second quarter of this year. So I think Home Solutions will probably be the place where you see the most change. We will continue in the -- to continue to optimize the Rubbermaid consumer business by continuing to pull back on consumer storage, the less profitable end of that business. So some of the positives that I was just referring to will be partially offset by continued contraction in that portion of the business as we look to reposition the Rubbermaid brand to play in areas where the brand can be differentiated. And through differentiation comes higher gross margins; through margins, comes higher affordability to invest and really create the renaissance in Rubbermaid that we hope to deliver over the next couple of years."

In terms of the need to invest behind the Jarden brand, it sounds like you don't see a big catch-up period here given that the first $500 million of cost saves will drop to the bottom line effectively. But how do you think about your need to invest behind the Jarden brands? And secondly, how does the acquisition impact your goal of getting to A&P spend of about 7% of sales?"

So yes, let me take the second part of the question first. The acquisition will not impact our drive to get the Newell Rubbermaid portfolio to 7% of sales. As I said, in 2016, we'll get that ratio up to 5%, probably around 5.5%. And so we continue on",721,"Yes. So yes, let me take the second part of the question first. The acquisition will not impact our drive to get the Newell Rubbermaid portfolio to 7% of sales. As I said, in 2016, we'll get that ratio up to 5%, probably around 5.5%. And so we continue on that journey to the 7% threshold, and we think that happens in 2018, maybe a little bit of a bleed over into 2019, depending on how the renewal cost savings flow through to the P&L. So we don't see any interruption in that drive. On the Jarden businesses, we're just getting to know these businesses. I will tell you, all you have to do to understand the Jarden businesses and whether they have the algorithm right is to look at 5.9% core sales growth through the 9-month period in 2015. That would suggest that there are a lot of things going right in these businesses. Of course, we believe in brands. And if we can find the flexibility beyond the first $500 million to find savings, we're going to want to invest back into brands. We believe that our design capability, which is enabling the step-up in innovation on the Newell Rubbermaid side of the family, is applicable, more broadly across more categories. In order to fund that, we'll have to invest some money to extend the shoulders of that capability, to be able to potentially help some of the Jarden businesses. But -- and of course, if we're going to -- if we can strengthen innovation in these businesses through that design capability, we're going to want to put advertising and promotion money behind it to stimulate awareness and trial of the new ideas. But I think if there was a place where you could or should expect us to explore investing, it's in that area. And we, of course, across the total landscape, are going to continue to invest in e-commerce. For Newell Rubbermaid, in the fourth -- in the full year, our e-commerce contribution in the U.S. to our POS growth was something close to 14%, which, if you go all the way back to our Analyst Day in May of 2012, you can look at what we quoted there as the contribution to revenue. And you see this big step-up. That's, in part, a function of the investments we've made. We expect to make investments across the total enterprise in e-commerce. We'll fund that through any savings that comes beyond the $500 million. Now, unlike what we did with Project Renewal, where the first couple of tranches of savings went fully back into the business, you should not expect us to do that with anything beyond the $500 million that we find. Some of this is going to flow back to investors for margin development beyond what we've committed to with the first $500 million, and some of it will flow back into the business. How that ratio breaks down? Yet to be determined. We have a lot of work to do to understand the opportunities. I had the opportunity to meet Hope Margala and her team up at the Yankee last week, just to say hello and get to know them. They've got all kinds of really interesting things going on there. And so I suspect, as we get into these businesses, we will see and find all kinds of opportunities that, hopefully, by bringing the companies together, we'll be able to plus up, just like Jarden has historically done, as it has bought businesses and integrated into the company. Look at the progress on Yankee. I used to be on the board there in 2005, 2006. They've got a big dynamic business in Europe that didn't exist when I was there. And that's happened since the Jarden acquisition. So there's plenty of evidence that, that work is already underway. And the question is, can you overlay more funds to really unlock the upside in any of those areas that are particularly attractive. And again, too early to say where you would place those bets or whether you can find the money beyond the $500 million, although our judgment tells us there's more to be found there. And we should go get that money, so we can put it back into the business for growth acceleration."

We said we spent more money in A&P than we were planning on spending in the quarter, and Writing was the beneficiary of that, which it almost always is. The -- but we don't have a target margin for businesses. I mean, anything over 20% in my experience is a really exciting place to be, because if you grow, you really create a ton of value. So I don't -- but I don't envision us drifting down to that level. But I also don't want to target and peg 25% operating income margin as a target margin for the Writing business, because I feel like we might constrain the opportunities for growth. As we move Writing into new geographies, there's sort of the SG&A bubble you have to accept in front of the -- ahead of the revenue stream. And our ambition is to deploy this portfolio as broadly as it is relevant to deploy it over the next 5 to 10 years. So there will be periods where there's a cost of growth associated with that choice that'll be covered by some other business, just like you saw some of the businesses cover Tools' investment in 2014. You see other businesses covered Baby investment the beginning of this year. We'll now see Baby margins come back to fund other investments in Home Solutions. And so we manage this money very dynamically. And we don't let it get trapped in any particular segment. The leadership team allocates resource. And at any given period, operating -- you should expect operating income margins to flex up and down, depending on what investment bets we're making."

I think people are really energized by this, because they've seen what's happened here and they now -- most people are probably thinking, gosh, there's all kinds of opportunity for me personally to go work in different types of businesses over time. And I get the sense there's a lot of excitement about this. The group's been through a ton of change, so they understand how to -- and their resilience is all pack to be able to absorb the rhythm of change that we've had over the last number of years. But there's a lot of excitement. There's pride in the fact that we're creating something big and special that could really be very, very exciting. But maybe, John, you should answer that last part rather than me."

With respect to the system, so part of Jarden is on a version of SAP, but we're fairly comfortable that we'll be able to get them and get our arms around their systems relatively quickly. Obviously, they have a great business, and they've run their business extremely well. So they certainly understand their numbers, and we're encouraged coming in that we can kind of get to a common nomenclature and common vocabulary relatively quickly. Our IT guys are really excited to work with them and certainly, I think we can give them some perspective on things that have worked well for us. As Mike said, it's really consistent with taking the best of both companies. So we also have some things I'm sure we can learn about them and get a little bit more leverage out of our systems overall. So comfortable we'll get our arms around the business fairly quickly. And certainly, in our meetings with them, they clearly have their arms around the business. So we're very comfortable with that. In terms of the excitement, certainly, it's not something, I think, that many of the employees expected, but we're excited. We're excited about the progress that certainly Mike and the team has made over the past 5 years to put us in this position to be able to rewrite the future for this company. And that's what people are most excited about now. We look at the opportunity now with Jarden and things that we think we can do as we've broadened our set of capabilities across a number of different new categories and new brands, and as Mike said, as well as the synergies, places where Jarden has been very successful, and we haven't been as successful in certain channels. So there's a lot of excitement. We know it's going to be a lot of work. It's been a lot of work for a number of people for the past 3 to 4 months, but it's going to be a great combination overall. So it's a -- we're a little bit disappointed maybe some people don't see it that way, but for us, we only see upside."

I think the market's reaction, I'm not even going to focus on it, to be honest with you, because the opportunity is in front of us. It's not in the moment. And so the opportunity is to bring this combination together and create the value, a release that will naturally occur, but more importantly, strategically to create one of the leading consumer branded companies in the world, and certainly, a leader in the durable space, where nobody is going to be able to have the capabilities we have. We'll have the affordability to invest in a really advantaged set of brand development capabilities that should enable us to trump the competition. We'll compete in category country sells against lesser competition; it's quite small. So if we want -- if we -- as we set this company up to be managed the way we manage things today, where we -- a senior group of people, leaders from each of the businesses come together every year to allocate resource, as we allocate those against the businesses with the greatest right to win, we should see really tremendous release of value and growth. And that'll create a very, very exciting story going forward. We're a risk-on scenario and a risk-off environment at the moment because of the leverage that we need to raise to bring these 2 companies together. And that is fine. We have the clarity, the security and the sense of what will happen next to give us the confidence that what we've said about maintaining investment grade, getting the deal financed, getting the deal -- having the deal deliver a high single-digit accretion in year 1, and mid-teens to high-teens in year 2 and strong double-digit accretion in year 3, we have the confidence and line of sight to all the moving parts in that algorithm, to give us the security that the risk-on increase is appropriate for our company. The market doesn't have access to everything that we've got access to, and we don't have the opportunity to talk as explicitly as we'd like to, to the market until the transaction's consummated. So we're in that period where there's uncertainty in a risk-off environment, and I'm sure that's creating pressure. We will, over time, in a very deliberate way, articulate our vision for the company and what we believe is going to be possible through the combination, and I am certain we'll find more opportunity, the more time we have to engage with the partners and we -- on the Jarden side. And we intend to bring the best of both together to bear on this collection of categories that are really quite strategic. The opportunity is quite strategic. These are large, growing categories with unconsolidated markets, and the brand portfolio is powerful because we have leading positions in those categories. And so there's so much roll-up potential, either organically or through a combination of organic and external development, that it -- you just sort of feel like a kid in a candy store in terms of the potential opportunities ahead. We're going to do this deliberately. We're going to do this with putting the best people on the field that we can to unlock the upside, and we couldn't be more excited by what's ahead. But our line of sight goes beyond the next 90 or 30 days. It's the next 3 years. And it's putting in motion the set of choices that I think we will illuminate over time for the market, but we are certain will unlock the value we are -- we have represented to you, if not more."

I wouldn't count on the 10% type of growth levels as being something that's sustainable every quarter, but we've got a lot of innovation coming in Baby. We're excited about Baby. The combination actually potentially brings together some really exciting opportunities, particularly with Nook and Baby Jogger, and there are a couple of European soothing businesses as well that Jarden has. So we've got some tremendous opportunity here. We love our Baby business. It's a different business than the rest, in that on our side of the family, we've outsourced the manufacturing to a strategic partner. So our gross margins are dilutive to the total company performance. But because we don't own the assets, our return on the investment capital is quite high. It's just next to Writing in terms of its value-creation potential if we grow. So when you grow Writing -- when you grow Baby, you create a ton of value for investors to the ROIC of RONA [ph] [indiscernible] asset is so high, just shy of Writing's levels. And Writing's levels are margin-driven. Baby's levels are driven by the absence of fixed assets in a very short value chain, because most of our retail partners, many of them DI, direct import from the point of departure in Asia. So we have a very short value chain, inventory chain. So this is a great business. We expect to grow it. I think if you -- if I were building a model for the next number of years, I'd be building sort of mid-single-digit growth. There will be a moment in time when China opens up as a huge market. There are now car seat legislation -- there is now car seat legislation in place, not yet being enforced, but that will create a car seat market over time. And when that happens, we want to be right in the middle of the growth that will come with Baby gear. Our business is sourced from China. So we've got great presence there, so that if and when that markets opens, we will be in a position to participate in a more material way than we do today. But that will -- when that moment comes, that will trigger a different level of growth for the company in that segment. But I think the right planning stance is mid-singles."

We generally don't guide with respect to cash flow -- operating cash flow, overall. So we won't give you any guidance numbers for '16 or '15.

Essentially, we were up about 2% if you take out the $70 million pension payment that we made in 2015, to get our pension plan up to about a 93% funded status. And then we had a little more cash spend on Project Renewal and some other restructuring costs overall. In terms of focus on cash going forward, the model was built without any working capital improvements, but there are plenty of working capital improvements for the transaction as well as on our side. As we've talked about before, our inventories, we can do a little better job on. Overall, we built some inventories this year for growth and so forth, but we know we can do a better job managing inventories as well as managing the other pieces of working capital. So that will be a focus. It'll be part of our incentive plan next year we've talked about because of the importance of delivering on cash overall for us in terms of getting our leverage ratio down, as Mike said, as quickly as we reasonably can to the 3 to 3.5x ratio. But again, good focus on cash, but we made good progress in Q4 as well on inventory so I'm relatively comfortable that we have line of sight to a strong -- another strong year for 2016."

This is where Sharpie and Paper Mate and Expo and Prismacolor, they all live in that cluster. Fine Writing's been less positive to growth rate, and your observation is accurate. Growth in Europe was not as strong as we believe it can be over time, in part because WACE growth, or Writing & Creative Expression growth, was offset by Fine Writing declines. And so we're in the midst of repositioning our Fine Writing portfolio in Europe, pulling back on some of the low-end portions of that portfolio, so that we focus brands like Parker and Waterman on the high-end portions of that portfolio. So that is what contributed to Europe's sort of modest Writing results, terrific growth on Writing & Creative Expression in markets like the U.K, and in France, offset by Fine Writing contraction in the same geographies. Over time, you should expect our Writing business to become more dominant and present in the core, which is Writing & Creative Expression.

Elmer's Krazy Glue and X-acto represent terrific additions to our great portfolio and will provide dry-period synergies at Back-to-School, great cross-sell potential across our channels and together with our very fast-growing  Prismacolor, Paper Mate, Flair and Mr. Sketch brands, strengthen our position in drawing and crafts. Elmer's sales will not contribute to core sales until the first anniversary of the completion of the acquisition. 
This morning, we shared our decision to deconsolidate Venezuela. We took this decision after significant deliberation. We have concluded that the increasingly restricted nature of regulations in Venezuela and the limited and infrequent access to U.S. dollars has resulted in a loss of the company's ability to make key operational decisions. We've taken a charge to reported earnings in Q4. And starting in Q1, we will no longer consolidate the performance of our Venezuelan operations. We've been doing business in Venezuela for many decades, and we expect to continue to manufacture and sell our products to Venezuelan consumers despite this accounting change. 
Lastly, in December, we announced a definitive agreement to combine Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden Corporation. We've secured committed financing to ensure deal closure, begun the process with the regulatory agencies and have a clear and deliberate path to secure permanent financing. The process will play out over the next few months, and we expect the transaction to be completed in Q2. 
We've taken these actions from a position of strength, having just finished one of the best years in our history with outstanding growth, margin and earnings delivery.   
So with that, let's get into our fourth quarter and full year results. In Q4, core sales grew 6.2%, the strongest quarterly core sales growth in years. Excluding Venezuela, core sales grew 4.4%. Normalized gross margin increased 80 basis points to 38.5%, driven by pricing, productivity and lower input costs, which were partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency. The increase in gross margin enabled a 70-basis-point  increase in advertising and promotion investment, to 5.5% of sales, and when coupled with the 10-basis-point  reduction in overheads, resulted in a normalized operating margin increase of 30 basis points, to 13.7%. Normalized EPS was $0.56, 14.3% ahead of prior year, despite having to overcome a $0.06 negative impact from foreign currency. Our fourth quarter core sales growth was broad-based, with growth in all 5 segments. Combined, our Win Bigger businesses grew core sales 11.3%. 
Our full year results were strong as well. Core sales increased 5.5%. And excluding Venezuela, core sales grew 3.9%. Our Win Bigger businesses grew 9.4%. And our acquisitions, when coupled with the core sales growth, have offset the negative impact of currency and divestitures to yield 3.3% net sales growth. 
Despite currency pressure on costs, we expanded normalized gross margin 40 basis points to 39.2%. Importantly, for the full year, we increased A&P investment by over 17% to 4.9% of sales. And while spending more behind our brands, we simultaneously increased normalized operating margin 50 basis points, enabled by our efforts to make Newell leaner and more efficient through Project Renewal. 
 All this together yielded 9% normalized EPS growth, despite having to absorb a negative $0.39 impact from foreign currency.  Obviously, we're pleased with our results in 2015, and we have clear momentum in our business, and our operating model is working. 
Let me hand the call over to John to go through our results in more detail. John will also walk through the next steps in the Jarden transaction. I'll return to provide perspective on our latest view of 2016 and some thoughts on the creation of Newell Brands."

The bubba, Baby Jogger and Elmer's acquisitions contributed 350 basis points to reported net sales. Core sales, which exclude the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and the 540-basis-point  negative impact of foreign currency, increased 6.2% and all 5 of our segments grew in the quarter. 
Reported gross margin was 38.3%, up 70 basis points to last year, and normalized gross margin was 38.5%, up 80 basis points. This improvement was driven by pricing, productivity and favorable commodities, which more than offset unfavorable currency. 
Normalized SG&A expense was $387.3 million or 24.8% of sales, up 50 basis points versus the prior year. We continued our progress on overheads but significantly increased our investment in advertising and promotion by 70 basis points as a percentage of sales. We invested in major campaigns for Writing, including our Fine Writing business and Mr. Sketch, as well as Calphalon SharpIN self-sharpening color resets. We also invested in advertising for our Food Storage business and across a number of commercial products platforms. It's worth noting that for the full year, we reduced overheads by 70 basis points as a percentage of sales, plowing those savings into the 60-basis-point  increased investment in A&P. 
Normalized operating margin was 13.7%, up 30 basis points, reflecting the benefits of Project Renewal and other cost-savings initiatives, pricing and productivity, partially offset by a significant increase in strategic investment. Reported operating margin was 6.5%, down from 7.4% in the prior year, due in part to higher restructuring charges and acquisition and integration costs. 
Interest expense increased $8.4 million year-over-year, including expenses associated with the Elmer's and pending Jarden transactions. During the fourth quarter, we issued $600 million in medium-term notes, the proceeds of which were used to provide permanent financing for Elmer's. 
Our normalized tax rate was 23.2% compared with 26.5% a year ago, and our full year normalized 2015 tax rate landed at 23.4%, about 10 basis points down from prior year. 
Normalized EPS, which excludes restructuring, restructuring-related and other project costs and certain other onetime items, was $0.56, a 14.3% increase to last year. On a reported basis, fourth quarter EPS was $0.05 compared with $0.19 last year, mostly driven by the gain on the sale of the Endicia business, being more than offset by the noncash charge associated with deconsolidating Venezuela. 
I'll now move on to our segment results, and starting with Writing. Reported Q4 net sales were $466.3 million, up 11.5% with Elmer's contributing about $37 million. Core sales were up 12.5%. Our North American Writing business delivered high single-digit growth, again fueled by strong innovation, marketing and merchandising. In Latin America, Writing core sales showed significant growth, in part due to volume and pricing in Venezuela. For the full year, core sales grew 10.9% led by a great Back-to-School pricing and new product launches. Core sales growth in drawing and coloring, which includes Mr. Sketch, Prismacolor and Flair were up over 40% in 2015. 
Q4 normalized operating margin in our Writing segment was 22.7%, a 200-basis-point  decline versus prior year as significant increased  A&P investment and challenging foreign exchange more than offset productivity, pricing and cost management. 
Net sales on our Home Solutions segment declined 3.7% to $441.8 million. Core sales increased 0.1%, driven primarily by growth in our Food Storage and Beverage ware business, offsetting our continued exit of some low-margin Rubbermaid Consumer Storage business, as well as transition of product lines in culinary. For the full year, Home Solutions' core sales grew 0.8%. The segment's normalized operating margin was 12.9% for the quarter, a 30-basis-point  increase, reflecting significantly increased advertising, funded in part by productivity and input cost deflation. 
Our Tools segment delivered net sales of $207.7 million, an 8.6% decline. Core sales grew 1.4%. Tools delivered high single-digit growth in EMEA, with modest growth in North America, while Latin America declined mid-single digits, reflecting challenges in Brazil macros and the impact on volumes as a result of pricing to cover foreign exchange. For the full year, core sales grew 2.2% in the Tools segment. 
 Q4 normalized operating margin in the segment was 9.4%, a 10-basis-point  decline versus last year. The decline was driven by foreign exchange challenges in Europe and inflation in Brazil, more than offsetting productivity and disciplined overhead management. 
 Reported net sales in our Commercial Product segment declined 2.8% to $207.1 million, driven by foreign exchange and the sale of our medical cards business earlier in the year. Core sales increased 5.8%, driven by pricing and strong volume growth in North America, as well as growth in Latin America. For the full year, Commercial Products grew core sales 4.8%. 
 Normalized operating margin in the fourth quarter was 13.3%, a 190-basis-point  increase to last year, thanks to pricing, productivity and input cost benefits, partially offset by higher investment in A&P. 
Our Baby segment reported $237.9 million in net sales, a 13.9% increase compared to 2014. Core sales grew a very strong 10.2%. Double-digit growth from Graco North America, driven by strong innovation and previous advertising and promotion investments, more than offset declines in EMEA and APAC. For the full year, the segment's core sales grew 6.4%. 
 Baby's Q4 normalized operating margin was 11.7%, up 340 basis points to last year, largely due to contributions from Baby Jogger and new product development, as well as the comparison against the A&P investment we made last year to stimulate growth. 
Looking at Q4 sales by geography. North America core sales grew 5.7%, with strong results from Writing, Commercial Products and Baby. EMEA declined 0.3% with growth from -- in Tools offset by modest declines in our other EMEA businesses. In Latin America, core sales grew 29.7%, with pricing and volume gains in Writing and Commercial Products more than offsetting challenges in Tools related primarily to the Brazilian economy. And finally, Asia-Pacific core sales grew 0.2%, with growth from Writing and Tools offset by declines in Baby. 
Operating cash flow for the full year 2015 came in at $565.8 million compared to $634.1 million prior year, though recall, in 2015, we made a $70 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. pension plan, and we incurred higher restructuring and Project Renewal-related cash payments in 2015. Adjusting for these, our operating cash flow is up about 2% year-over-year. 
 You'll note also that we recognized a significant gain associated with the sale of Endicia in the fourth quarter, and we have about $60 million in taxes we'll need to pay on the gain, which we'll do in the first quarter and which will be reflected in our first quarter operating cash flow. 
We returned $65 million to shareholders in Q4, including $50.9 million in dividends and $14.1 million to repurchase 337,000 shares. For the full year 2015, we distributed $206.3 million in dividends and $180.4 million to buy back 4.53 million shares. We suspended the repurchase of shares midway through the fourth quarter in light of the Jarden transaction. 
With respect to the transaction, we continue to make great progress toward the closing of the combination.  This week, we finalized our $1.5 billion 3-year term loan, which will fund a portion of the purchase price. We also finalized the amendment of our revolving credit facility, including increasing the facility from $800 million to $1.25 billion to accommodate the increased seasonal working capital needs associated with adding Jarden to the family. 
 We continue to work on the mechanics. We're assuming 2 tranches of Jarden notes, the 3.75% coupon notes and the 5% coupon notes, which we plan to retain after the merger. We're well underway and the word seems to go to the public debt markets as we get closer to the anticipated closing in order to secure the balance of funds for the transaction, and we don't anticipate any challenges associated with the upcoming debt offer or with maintaining our committed investment-grade rating. 
Over the past several weeks, we've executed treasury rate locks for a little over $2 billion of the anticipated debt offering. And in addition, recall that we have a fully committed bridge loan facility in place, which is available for us to utilize if we encounter any unforeseen challenges with issuing debt at attractive rates. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike."
291703,322157557,924209,"Newell Rubbermaid Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Newell Brands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Let's now turn to a quick discussion of 2016 and then to some comments on the Jarden combination. This morning, we reaffirmed our 2016 full year guidance for core sales growth and normalized EPS, excluding our Venezuelan operations. Our 2016",1466,"Thanks, John. Let's now turn to a quick discussion of 2016 and then to some comments on the Jarden combination. This morning, we reaffirmed our 2016 full year guidance for core sales growth and normalized EPS, excluding our Venezuelan operations. Our 2016 full year guidance is for core sales growth of 4% to 5% and normalized EPS of $2.21 to $2.30. Our best estimate for delivery is at the midpoints of these ranges. Excluding Venezuela for both 2016 and 2015 results, the midpoint of the normalized EPS range represents double-digit growth. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, the exclusion of Venezuela will negatively impact our Q1 2016 normalized EPS by about $0.03 to $0.04. 
There are 2 key factors that will influence where we fall in the 2016 full year guidance ranges. The first being the performance of our Tools business, and the second, the impact of foreign currency. Our Tools segment had a challenging 2015 as the industrial products and services business slowed from high single-digit growth in 2014 to slight growth in 2015. This contraction in our growth rate was most pronounced in Brazil and China. Our 2016 outlook assumes better performance, driven by building IP&S momentum in the U.S. and Europe, partially offset by continued sluggishness in Brazil. Our 2016 full year core sales guidance assumes low- to mid-single-digit growth in our Tools segment. 
The second factor influencing our results will be foreign currency. Our 2016 full year guidance assumes a $0.26 to $0.28 negative impact of foreign exchange, $0.04 to $0.05 worse than our last estimate, driven by the late Q4 strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We've taken broad-based actions to deal with the expected negative ForEx impact, with the most pricing actions already in the market. We expect the combination of pricing, gross-to-net optimization, productivity and Project Renewal-driven overhead reductions to cover the ForEx headwinds, while simultaneously enabling increased investment in capabilities and brand support. 
In 2016, we're planning to increase A&P funding by about 20% to 5.5% of sales and continue to strengthen our insights and e-commerce capabilities with further investments. These investments are yielding strong growth dividends. In the U.S., in 2015, we increased value market share in 10 of the 13 product categories that IRI measures. In 9 of those product categories, our IRI dollars sell-out or POS grew by over 8%. These strong U.S. market share increases drove U.S. core sales growth of 4.1%, and when coupled with acquisitions, drove net sales growth of 8.8%. 
 The strategic choice to reposition the company from a holding company to an operating company, releasing costs through Project Renewal, such that we increase spending behind our brands and invest in an advanced set of capabilities, is clearly working. Our track record of delivery and the value-creation story derived from our accelerating growth and margin development sets the stage for the next very exciting period of transformation as we combine our company with Jarden to create Newell Brands. 
 This combination will create a $16 billion consumer goods company of leading brands that compete in large, growing unconsolidated global markets. The combination scales the company in key geographies, customers and channels, more than doubling the business in the U.S., Canada, U.K., France, Germany, Mexico, Brazil, Japan and China. The combined portfolio is complementary and quite focused, with over 80% of revenue concentrated in just 30 brands. And there are a number of intuitive combinations of brands and categories like Graco and Nook, as well as Rubbermaid, Food Storage and FoodSaver that will yield greater consumer and customer impact for accelerated growth in category development. 
 The combined portfolio is quite profitable, with 80% of the combined revenue having a gross margin over 39% and operating margin over 15% before synergies. So there is plenty of gross margin to work with and with overheads focused, and in some cases, reoriented to the activities that drive growth, there will be significant potential for margin development and growth beyond what we expect to deliver through the synergies already identified. 
Our ambition is to bring together and leverage the best talent and capabilities from both companies to drive strong growth, increased margins and increased cash flow through superior insights and product design, leading innovation and brand development, strategic category management and selling, delivery of the cost synergies to margin, achievement of savings beyond those assumed in the acquisition model to fund increased brand investment and enterprise-wide capabilities for growth, and after paying down debt to our target leverage ratio of 3 to 3.5x, active portfolio management that strengthens our positions in key categories. 
 We will deploy the best aspects of the playbooks from both companies to drive a highly competitive set of outcomes. We'll respect the differences in each category, channel and business model, yet simultaneously establish a set of enterprise-wide capabilities. We will scale and strengthen our selling capabilities to provide broadened access and reach for our categories and brands into new channels and customers. 
 We will quickly adapt both companies' rapidly developing e-commerce strengths to establish a leading capability in direct-to-consumer e-com, which is a differentiated Jarden capability, and bricks-and-mortar and pure-play e-com, where both companies have excellent momentum. 
 We will immediately play for procurement savings as the combined companies buy over $9 billion in source-finished goods, commodities and other services. We will leverage our scale for distribution savings in areas like ocean freight, where combined, we ship over 65,000 40-foot ocean containers a year from Asia. And of course, we'll quickly convert to savings associated with bringing 2 public companies together, establishing a lean and agile corporate infrastructure, very similar to what's in place today at Jarden. 
 So we'll deliver these outcomes in a structured way, extending the scope of the Newell transformation office, which is in place to ensure the delivery of Project Renewal savings to the total enterprise, including the work of integration. We're roughly 30 days into planning, and we expect to find far more opportunities once the 2 teams are able to fully engage with each other. 
We've been conservative in our assumptions, but we'll pursue every opportunity we uncover. We have no revenue synergies, no working capital benefits and no tax synergies in our deal economics and have a very clear line of sight to, at a minimum, $500 million of cost synergies. 
 The first $500 million in synergies is expected to create a company with EBITDA margins of over 20% and annual EBITDA of over $3 billion, giving us the firepower to produce the leverage ratio to 3 to 3.5x within 2 to 3 years and then subsequently, to deploy capital to create further value beyond our organic agenda. 
 As John stated in his comments, we've secured committed financing to enable deal closure and expect to maintain our investment-grade rating. We're in the process of seeking the necessary regulatory approvals and expect to secure permanent financing sometime after both companies file their 10-Ks. With the current assumptions and despite widened credit spreads, we expect the deal will deliver high single-digit accretion in year 1, mid- to high teens accretion by year 2 and strong double-digit accretion by year 3. 
So let me close now by reiterating that we've had an outstanding 2015, delivering strong competitive results. Growth continues to accelerate. And despite unprecedented foreign currency pressure, we've increased margins and delivered very strong normalized EPS growth. Our building momentum is a function of the sharp choices we'd made. We're investing to create advantaged brand development and innovation capabilities. And as a result, our innovation funnel has more than doubled since 2013 with project value up 160%. These innovations leverage a new product design capability we've invested to create at our purpose-built design center, and we are backing our growth ideas with industry-leading marketing investment. This investment has been enabled by our determination to make Newell leaner and more efficient and to unlock the trapped capacity for growth. 
 Coupled with the actions we've taken to strengthen our portfolio, these choices are yielding some of the strongest results Newell has ever experienced. We're on a path to completely transform Newell Rubbermaid, delivering highly competitive and differentiated results. Our operating model is extendable to more categories, more brands and more geographies. This is the core logic that underpins the Jarden combination. 
 The creation of Newell Brands will now allow the best talent at both companies to apply the best of what is working at both companies across a broader, more compelling and more diversified landscape of opportunity and brands. We will build one of the most exciting companies in our industry, a destination for talent, while simultaneously unlocking an incredible amount of value for our shareholders. 
That is the Growth Game Plan into action. That is the future Newell Brands. Let me now pass the line to the operator for questions."

If you remember, we changed our whole model back in the middle of '13, and I've said that the gestation period on new ideas that were coming through our brand development organization was 18 to 24 months. And the way these projects work is they sort of layer into the market. And so as we progress through '16 and into '17, we get some of the strongest innovation ideas we've really ever had hitting the marketplace. An example of that is in the first quarter, we'll launch new Paper Mate InkJoy Gels, with 3x faster drying ink versus the leading gel pen for an advantaged performance, less smearing. We'll launch Rubbermaid FRESHWORKS,  which is -- which leverages our Food Storage business, but applies a filtration, a membrane to prevent oxidation from occurring on fresh fruits and vegetables, which should extend the produce life by -- we expect to extend the produce life by nearly 80%. So you've got a whole series of innovations. John mentioned the SharpIN knives, where Calphalon's got these ceramic sharpeners in the butcher block. So every time you withdraw  the knife, you have the perfectly honed blade. And so these are the examples of the kind of innovation that had started to filter into our business in late '15 and really hits its stride in 2016. So you've got the combination of increased spending. We've really sequentially increased spending since we've been here. We tripled the amount of advertising we're spending on these brands. If you look at the number of GRPs we're delivering, we've actually increased it by 5x since we started because we've gotten so much efficiency in buying by going to one buying agency. So we've got all of these things converging in the marketplace, which gives us the confidence that when coupled with what's a building -- a selling system with respect to commercial execution and strength in selling execution, those things all converge to give us confidence that 4% to 5% is deliverable, and Q4 is good evidence of that at 4.4% growth, excluding Venezuela."

The answer simply is no, but we didn't have a lot built into our plans in 2016 for China. Remember, we'll launch late in Q4 to get to market in maybe 1 or 2 big cities.

Remember, we'll launch late in Q4 to get to market in maybe 1 or 2 big cities. The team's presenting their final plans to me shortly, but 1 or 2 big cities for Back-to-School '17, which is in February-ish in China. So we don't get a lot of benefit in the revenue line from China this year, but we will get some nice growth in Writing in 2017. But no, it should not impact anything we're doing on Newell Rubbermaid. In fact, one of the most important things that both companies can do in the transition is to execute their 2016 plans flawlessly. And while there'll  be a lot of work going on in the center to organize the delivery of the synergies, it's really critical that each set of operating units stays focused on the plans they've built for 2016. So I wouldn't envision really anything materially changing for either company in terms of their core plans. On financing, yes, credit spreads have widened since we announced the deal in December, but there's all kinds of levers we can pull to mitigate that issue. And quite frankly, the interest rate sensitivity in the overall deal is the least meaningful variable as we've looked at sensitivities. So we don't know where it'll all end. I think it will come down to the difference in tenor we could choose to place on the new debt, and we'll make that decision based on the best economic choice for the company. And if we have to accept slightly higher interest rates for the sake of making the right economic choice, we'll do that. We'll cover it someplace else in the algorithm. And obviously, one of the big levers we have is the balance of fixed or floating rate  debt we choose to deploy. But look, we're relatively relaxed. Of course, we would have preferred to not see credit spreads widen. The widening of credit spreads for BBB- debt is -- our spreads don't look any different than the market at this point, so we're moving. While we may have moved a little earlier than the market, we're in line with the market today. And we'll just have to see how that plays out. We're not going to compromise the right long-term choice for the sake of managing to an interest rate assumption because we have so many other levers in the P&L to compensate for that in the very near term."

And actually, the size of the team's up by 50% since we started in 2011. But where we haven't done as much research is in the area of shopper insights because we wanted to get the fundamental consumer insight work done to support the innovation and brand agenda. In Q4, we made the first in a series of investments we'll make in shopper insights, to ensure that we're driving leading levels of category management. Jo Arcuri and his team are really focused on taking our selling capabilities sort of the next level, bringing the best of what fast-moving consumer goods have and category management capabilities to the consumer durables space. And part of putting the fundamentals in place is establishing a good foundation of shopper insights. So we made an investment in Q4 in that as well. We had the flexibility to do that. And as you know, with the Q3 -- on the Q3 call, I mentioned that if we had the room to do more, we would invest more. And that's, in fact, what we did. It's a strategic investment in A&P. It's strategic investment in structural costs, in the e-com and insights, coupled with, as John said, we had a really terrific year from a performance standpoint and truing up a bonus."

I'm assuming it was the 2% to 3% rate just with the weather being warm. But maybe  some color there. And then also, Mike, as you look forward, any kind of idea of how this works in terms of number of divisions? I mean, Jarden has 3 divisions, but kind of 25 different key divisions. And you have 5.

And I actually don't have access to their performance data as they're the ones that have to communicate that. All I would say, though, is if you look at their numbers through the middle -- through the third quarter, their organic growth was 5 -- year-to-date was 5.9%. So they have terrific momentum in their business. They have an incredibly strong year-ago performance in Q4 that they need to lap. And I know -- I'm sure you all know this, but their organic growth in Q4 of 2014 was 11.4%. So a big hurdle to cross. No matter what way you cut it, with 5.9% banked through the end of Q3, they're going to have a very good year. And if you look at the combination of the 2 companies and look at their performance once you get their data, the combination is going to be pretty darn strong relative to anybody else in our industry. With them having 5.9% growth banked through Q3 and us having, now 5.5% banked on the full year, that's a strong set of numbers. And  so I think our eyes are set on the future. As I've said before, I don't get kind of locked in on any kind of 90-day performance cycles. Our view is set on what's going to happen over the next 3 years and how to unlock the value in this combination. So hopefully, I expressed that in a compelling way in my script. But obviously, we're very, very excited about leveraging what is terrific momentum in their business and terrific momentum in ours to bring the best of both companies together, to build a set of assets and businesses that perform better than either of us would have been able to do our own. With respect to the design of the company, what I need our teams to do and what I -- what I know Jim Lillie at Jarden is encouraging his team to do is to just  focus on delivery in 2016. Our energy and our synergies will be focused on the things I spoke about previously and not on big sweeping or design changes. Really important to keep our eye on the ball with respect to the demand-creation activities in both businesses, to preserve the momentum that I was referring to earlier. We'll figure out -- as we get to know the business over time, we'll figure out what the right model is for the overall company. We'll do that quickly as we did when we joined Newell Rubbermaid. And it's important to articulate a set of portfolio of priorities in resources, human capital and money needs to flow to the businesses with the greatest opportunities. And so we will do all of that work, but we're not going to walk in with a preconceived notion of that. We will do that work over time and that'll  help shape our approach to how we organize. What is clear is that we will build a set of enterprise-wide capabilities that cut across both businesses that -- in the areas of insight and design and innovation that our businesses can tap into -- and e-commerce, for example. So those are really obvious opportunities, and we will obviously combine 2 public companies into one, and there will be changes associated with that reality. But in the operating units, we want to head -- everybody's head down focused on execution of the plans that they got in place. Both companies have a very compelling set of plans for 2016. It's really important that we execute those with excellence."

I quoted some numbers on our U.S. POS, as measured by IRI. 10 of 13 categories, increasing market share, a sell-out up over 8% in 9 of those 13 categories. So I've always had this point of view that ideas trump the macros. That it's our responsibility as a consumer brand company to bring the ideas to market and leverage our brands with the right kind of support behind them to trump whatever environment we're in, and our growth of 4.1% in the U.S. and 8.8% in the U.S., including acquisition, should be good testimony to that. I don't see any impact in -- from a consumer perspective in the growth of our categories. Where we can measure that through IRI, I just don't see an impact at this point. The only business in our portfolio that has been sensitive to this has been the industrial products and services business, where, as I said, we went from high single-digit growth in 2014 to essentially, slight growth in 2015. And I've previously commented that that trend began in about October of 2014. And so we see -- that's probably the only piece of our portfolio that is cyclical as our businesses evolved over the last number of years. We are far less cyclical than we were when we started. And we are more consumer-driven than we were then, and we have way more brand support behind our brands such that they can absorb the macro cycles a lot better than they could in the past. But at the moment, I don't see the slowdown in markets or in the macros, and I don't see our customers really behaving in a particularly defensive way like they did in 2009 during the recession. So you don't hear us talking about the macro issue, with the exception of Brazil, where it's a combination of GDP slowdown and the currency impact on the business and the need for us to price to protect margins to cover the transaction ForEx  effect and the intersection of that with a slower economy creating pressure on volumes. So that's most important to our Tools business. It's certainly a factor that's influenced our Tools performance in 2015 and the most sensitive portion of our Tools business to that type of environment is the industrial products and services segment of that business."

We've delivered those savings on a base revenue stream that started at $5.5 billion. So do the math on $700 million divided by $5.5 billion and then ask yourself whether $500 million on the base of $10 million, which is the pro forma size of Jarden, is conservative or not conservative. So we've made a commitment to $500 million. We believe there probably is more. If we find more, which I expect we will likely do over time, as we did with Project Renewal, remember it was a sequential series of unpacking of the cost structure at Newell Rubbermaid, but if we do find more, a portion of that money will be invested back into the business for accelerated performance, either in capabilities or in brand support on the Jarden businesses. And some will flow to margin beyond the $500 million committed to as part of the deal. The first $500 million is going to flow to margin. What happens after that? We will leverage any cost savings beyond that that we can find to put the work to set up a different strategic future for the company, while also passing some back to investors so that you come along for the ride."

We're not engaging customers with one voice at this point, because that would be inappropriate as 2 separate companies, but the general feedback on the day the deal was announced, and I know Martin got some of this feedback as well from customers from -- on the announcement date, and we've subsequently had them in our conversations with retailers, it's  been very, very positive. As you know, the combination significantly scales our presence in a number of retailers in the U.S. We put that into the web deck that we put together when we announced the deal. We'll have over $2 billion of revenue at Wal-Mart, and they -- I think we'll end up being probably a top -- in the eighth or ninth position in terms of their overall suppliers. And on the general merchandise side, we'll be at the top, if not near the top. I think that's very exciting. That'll  lead to a really strategic set of conversations with all of our retailers where we scale. And the other thing about the combination of the companies is it opens up access to new channels for some categories. So Jarden has real strength in mass sporting goods with the Coleman brand and with some of their action sports businesses. That opens up opportunities for brands like Contigo and Avex, where we probably never would have gotten to investing the SG&A and selling expense to access those markets, which we can now access. And the reverse is true for Jarden. We have tremendous scale in home centers and in hardware and in the distributed trade in the U.S. through Commercial Products and Tools, which can provide the Jarden businesses access to channels. And so it's going to be very exciting to unlock all those opportunities. I don't view ""scale the customer"" as being a leverage point with respect to negotiating. Some people think, ""Oh, we're going to be able to yield a bigger stick at these customers."" That's not how we think about engagement with our retail partners. We think about building our business collaboratively. We have a responsibility as leaders in our categories to own the development of those categories at those retailers. And of course, we leverage our branded assets to do that. So we build share when we do that effectively, but we share accountability with our retail partners for developing the size of the pie, the size of the categories. And that's how we approach our relationships and we expect in combination, to now be able to do that across a broader landscape of categories for our retail partners and through that, become more of a strategic supplier to them. So unbelievable set of opportunities connected to the selling and the potential for strengthened strategic capabilities in that space."

If you look at our numbers, you probably haven't  had time to kind of plow through them all. We've got EBITDA of around $900 million in  for Newell and Jarden is -- you can figure out what Jarden is.

And so we're going to have lots of flexibility to pay down the debt quickly, and we will -- we'll want to do that. That's the commitment we've made to get back into the range of 3 to 3.5x within 2 to 3 years, but I'm hoping we can do that closer to the 2 than to the 3. With respect to the other issues on potential derailers that could undermine that, I really don't see them, because we've been so conservative in the assumptions we've made on the timing of synergies, the growth rate that we've built into the model, so the tax opportunities, the working capital opportunities. We should have some quick wins there that are not built into the deal economics. And just going to take a little bit of time to get our arms around that, once we're able to more openly engage with each other, but not much time. We want to go for that type of stuff quite quickly. The other thing to recognize is that the leverage ratios look high at the beginning, in part, because of the timing of the year we're doing this deal, right. So Q1 is probably the worst moment to try to convert a deal like this, with -- given the flow of cash flow for both companies. So the optics of our leverage ratios are pretty high, probably half a click high, in the -- at the end of the first quarter versus what they will quickly be over the next few quarters. So there's all those dynamics that plays. We've made a commitment to get down to 3 to 3.5x. We're going to do that in a focused way. We are prioritizing capital allocation to that outcome. And the only exception to that is the CapEx assumptions we've got in the business, which we have not compromised on CapEx investment on either business. We blended the base plans, and we won't pull back on that front, and you should expect in the Newell Rubbermaid side for us to be spending around $200 million in CapEx this year, maybe slightly above that. And then on the dividend, we've assumed that we maintain Newell's current dividend of $0.76 per share, obviously across a higher share count, which means more cash out for that in the combination, but we believe that's an important element of our capital allocation strategy that'll  be and should be preserved."

We typically don't guide core sales by segment, but I think you should expect Writing to have another very good year, albeit without the benefit of Venezuela. You should expect Baby to have a very good year as well. We've got terrific momentum there with great innovation coming. Commercial Products, I think,  should expect another year of good progress. And you'll see probably the most change in Home Solutions, where Rubbermaid has a whole series of innovations that are coming to market, like FRESHWORKS,  like Fasten + Go, which is effectively taking our LunchBlox concept and executing an adult version of a lunchbox for work. And so that'll  come. And then in the back half of the year, we got another exciting Food Storage innovation that I won't disclose now, that really will be very, very cool and fun to see how consumers respond to. So you've got 3 big innovations in Rubbermaid coming this year. You've got a big year on beverages, as we continue to develop and build the Contigo, Avex, bubba and Rubbermaid brands in this space, so -- and Calphalon is going -- Calphalon and Goody will go through complete relaunches. We saw some weakness in Calphalon in the fourth quarter, as we're transitioning out of product lines and into new product lines, which start flowing in here in the year in the middle of Q1. So we've got a full facelift going on in Calphalon. And we've got the Goody brand relaunch, which is set for the second quarter of this year. So I think Home Solutions will probably be the place where you  see the most change. We will continue in the -- to continue to optimize the Rubbermaid consumer business by continuing to pull back on consumer storage, the less profitable end of that business. So some of the positives that I was just referring to will be partially offset by continued contraction in that portion of the business as we look to reposition the Rubbermaid brand to play in areas where the brand can be differentiated. And through differentiation comes higher gross margins; through margins, comes higher affordability to invest and really create the renaissance in Rubbermaid that we hope to deliver over the next couple of years."

I guess first, and, Mike, you sort of touched on this earlier. In terms of the need to invest behind the Jarden brand, it sounds like you don't see a big catch-up period here given that the first $500 million of cost saves will drop to the bottom line effectively. But how do you think about your need to invest behind the Jarden brands? And secondly, how does the acquisition impact your goal of getting to A&P spend of about 7% of sales?"

So yes, let me take the second part of the question first. The acquisition will not impact our drive to get the Newell Rubbermaid portfolio to 7% of sales. As I said, in 2016, we'll get that ratio up to 5%, probably around 5.5%. And so we continue on",721,"Yes. So yes, let me take the second part of the question first. The acquisition will not impact our drive to get the Newell Rubbermaid portfolio to 7% of sales. As I said, in 2016, we'll get that ratio up to 5%, probably around 5.5%. And so we continue on that journey to the 7% threshold, and we think that happens in 2018, maybe a little bit of a bleed over into 2019, depending on how the renewal cost savings flow through to the P&L. So we don't see any interruption in that drive. On the Jarden businesses, we're just getting to know these businesses. I will tell you, all you have to do to understand the Jarden businesses and whether they have the algorithm right is to look at 5.9% core sales growth through the 9-month period in 2015. That would suggest that there are a lot of things going right in these businesses. Of course, we believe in brands. And if we can find the flexibility beyond the first $500 million to find savings, we're going to want to invest back into brands. We believe that our design capability, which is enabling the step-up in innovation on the Newell Rubbermaid side of the family, is applicable, more broadly across more categories. In order to fund that, we'll have to invest some money to extend the shoulders of that capability, to be able to potentially help some of the Jarden businesses. But -- and of course, if we're going to -- if we can strengthen innovation in these businesses through that design capability, we're going to want to put advertising and promotion money behind it to stimulate awareness and trial of the new ideas. But I think if there was a place where you could or should expect us to explore investing, it's in that area. And we, of course, across the total landscape, are going to continue to invest in e-commerce. For Newell Rubbermaid, in the fourth -- in the full year, our e-commerce contribution in the U.S. to our POS growth was something close to 14%, which, if you go all the way back to our Analyst Day in May of 2012, you can look at what we quoted there as the contribution to revenue. And you see this big step-up. That's, in part, a function of the investments we've made. We expect to make investments across the total enterprise in e-commerce. We'll fund that through any savings that comes beyond the $500 million. Now, unlike what we did with Project Renewal, where the first couple of tranches of savings went fully back into the business, you should not expect us to do that with anything beyond the $500 million that we find. Some of this is going to flow back to investors for margin development beyond what we've committed to with the first $500 million, and some of it will flow back into the business. How that ratio breaks down? Yet to be determined. We have a lot of work to do to understand the opportunities. I had the opportunity to meet Hope Margala and her team up at the Yankee last week, just to say hello and get to know them. They've got all kinds of really interesting things going on there. And so I suspect, as we get into these businesses, we will see and find all kinds of opportunities that, hopefully, by bringing the companies together, we'll be able to plus up, just like Jarden has historically done, as it has bought businesses and integrated into the company. Look at the progress on Yankee. I used to be on the board there in 2005, 2006. They've got a big dynamic business in Europe that didn't exist when I was there. And that's happened since the Jarden acquisition. So there's plenty of evidence that, that work is already underway. And the question is, can you overlay more funds to really unlock the upside in any of those areas that are particularly attractive. And again, too early to say where you would place those bets or whether you can find the money beyond the $500 million, although our judgment tells us there's more to be found there. And we should go get that money, so we can put it back into the business for growth acceleration."

So -- and I know it's only one quarter and still for the year, they were up, but I'm just wondering kind of where we are with your commitment to higher spending going forward, with the China launch and all that kind of good stuff.

We said we spent more money in A&P than we were planning on spending in the quarter, and Writing was the beneficiary of that, which it almost always is. The -- but we don't have a target margin for businesses. I mean, anything over 20% in my experience is a really exciting place to be, because if you grow, you really create a ton of value. So I don't -- but I don't envision us drifting down to that level. But I also don't want to target and peg 25% operating income margin as a target margin for the Writing business, because I feel like we might constrain the opportunities for growth. As we move Writing into new geographies, there's sort of the SG&A bubble you have to accept in front of the -- ahead of the revenue stream. And our ambition is to deploy this portfolio as broadly as it is relevant to deploy it over the next 5 to 10 years. So there will be periods where there's a cost of growth associated with that choice that'll  be covered by some other business, just like you saw some of the businesses cover Tools' investment in 2014. You see other businesses covered Baby investment  the beginning of this year. We'll now see Baby margins come back to fund other investments in Home Solutions. And so we manage this money very dynamically. And we don't let it get trapped in any particular segment. The leadership team allocates resource. And at any given period, operating -- you should expect operating income margins to flex up and down, depending on what investment bets we're making."

And so the opportunity is to bring this combination together and create the value, a release  that will naturally occur, but more importantly, strategically to create one of the leading consumer branded companies in the world, and certainly, a leader in the durable space, where nobody is going to be able to have the capabilities we have. We'll have the affordability to invest in a really advantaged set of brand development capabilities that should enable us to trump the competition. We'll compete in category country sells against  lesser competition; it's quite small. So if we want -- if we -- as we set this company up to be managed the way we manage things today, where we -- a senior group of people, leaders from each of the businesses come together every year to allocate resource, as we allocate those against the businesses with the greatest right to win, we should see really tremendous release of value and growth. And that'll  create a very, very exciting story going forward. We're  a risk-on scenario and a risk-off environment at the moment because of the leverage that we need to raise to bring these 2 companies together. And that is fine. We have the clarity, the security and the sense of what will happen next to give us the confidence that what we've said about maintaining investment grade, getting the deal financed, getting the deal -- having the deal deliver a high single-digit accretion in year 1, and mid-teens to high-teens in year 2 and strong double-digit accretion in year 3, we have the confidence and line of sight to all the moving parts in that algorithm, to give us the security that the risk-on increase is appropriate for our company. The market doesn't have access to everything that we've got access to, and we don't have the opportunity to talk as explicitly as we'd  like to, to the market until the transaction's  consummated. So we're in that period where there's uncertainty in a risk-off environment, and I'm sure that's creating pressure. We will, over time, in a very deliberate way, articulate our vision for the company and what we believe is going to be possible through the combination, and I am certain we'll find more opportunity, the more time we have to engage with the partners and we -- on the Jarden side. And we intend to bring the best of both together to bear on this collection of categories that are really quite strategic. The opportunity is quite strategic. These are large, growing categories with unconsolidated markets, and the brand portfolio is powerful because we have leading positions in those categories. And so there's so much roll-up potential, either organically or through a combination of organic and external development, that it -- you just sort of feel like a kid in a candy store in terms of the potential opportunities ahead. We're going to do this deliberately. We're going to do this  with putting the best people on the field that we can to unlock the upside, and we couldn't be more excited by what's ahead. But our line of sight goes beyond the next 90 or 30 days. It's the next 3 years. And it's putting in motion the set of choices that I think we will illuminate over time for the market, but we are certain will unlock the value we are -- we have represented to you, if not more."

The  combination actually potentially brings together some really exciting opportunities, particularly with Nook and Baby Jogger, and there are a couple of European soothing businesses as well that Jarden has. So we've got some tremendous opportunity here. We love our Baby business. It's a different business than the rest, in that on our side of the family, we've outsourced the manufacturing to a strategic partner. So our gross margins are dilutive to the total company performance. But because we don't own the assets, our return on the investment capital is quite high. It's just next to Writing in terms of its value-creation potential if we grow. So when you grow Writing -- when you grow Baby, you create a ton of value for investors to the ROIC of RONA [ph] [indiscernible] asset is so high, just shy of Writing's levels. And Writing's levels are margin-driven. Baby's levels are driven by the absence of fixed assets in a very short value chain, because most of our retail partners, many of them DI, direct import from the point of departure in Asia. So we have a very short value chain, inventory chain. So this is a great business. We expect to grow it. I think if you -- if I were building a model for the next number of years, I'd be building sort of mid-single-digit growth. There will be a moment in time when China opens up as a huge market.

And when that happens, we want to be right in the middle of the growth that will come with Baby gear. Our business is sourced from China. So we've got great presence there, so that if and when that markets opens, we will be in a position to participate in a more material way than we do today. But that will -- when that moment comes, that will trigger a different level of growth for the company in that segment. But I think the right planning stance is mid-singles."

We generally don't guide with respect to cash flow -- operating cash flow, overall. So we won't give you any guidance numbers for '16 or '15.

Essentially, we were up about 2% if you take out the $70 million pension payment that we made in 2015, to get our pension plan up to about a 93% funded status. And then we had a little more cash spend on Project Renewal and some other restructuring costs overall. In terms of focus on cash going forward, the model was built without any working capital improvements, but there are plenty of working capital improvements for the transaction as well as on our side. As we've talked about before, our inventories, we can do a little better job on. Overall, we built some inventories this year for growth and so forth, but we know we can do a better job managing inventories as well as managing the other pieces of working capital. So that will be a focus. It'll  be part of our incentive plan next year we've talked about  because of the importance of delivering on cash overall for us in terms of getting our leverage ratio down, as Mike said, as quickly as we reasonably can to the 3 to 3.5x ratio. But again, good focus on cash, but we made good progress in Q4 as well on inventory so I'm relatively comfortable that we have line of sight to a strong -- another strong year for 2016."

This is where Sharpie and Paper Mate and Expo and Prismacolor, they all live in that cluster. Fine Writing's been less positive to growth rate, and your observation is accurate. Growth in Europe was not as strong as we believe it can be over time, in part because WACE growth, or Writing & Creative Expression growth, was offset by Fine Writing declines. And so we're in the midst of repositioning our Fine Writing portfolio in Europe, pulling back on some of the low-end portions of that portfolio, so that we focus brands like Parker and Waterman on the high-end portions of that portfolio. So that is what contributed to Europe's sort of modest Writing results, terrific growth on Writing & Creative Expression in markets like the U.K, and in France, offset by Fine Writing contraction in the same geographies. Over time, you should expect our Writing business to become more dominant and present in the core, which is Writing & Creative Expression.

This morning, we reported a very strong set of first quarter results. Before getting into the numbers, I want to make sure you're clear on a few things. Our Q1 results include only the legacy Newell Rubbermaid business. Our normalized EPS results were not impacted by any Jarden transaction-related costs. Our financial results exclude contributions from our Venezuelan operations in the current year, but include the contribution of our Venezuelan operations in the year ago period. 
With that as context, let's get into the Q1 highlights. We've had an outstanding start to the year. Core sales grew 5.6%, net sales grew 4%. Our growth was driven by strength in innovation and increased brand support with advertising and promotion investment up nearly 15% or 40 basis points. 
Despite the increase in brand support, normalized operating margin increased 100 basis points, driven by 160 basis point reduction in overheads related to Project Renewal. 
Normalized EPS was $0.40, $0.02 ahead of consensus and 11.1% ahead of the prior year. We achieved double-digit earnings growth despite having to overcome about a $0.04 negative impact related to foreign currency. 
On a currency-neutral basis, normalized earnings per share increased $0.08 or 25%. Excluding the roughly $0.02 contribution from our Venezuelan operations to year ago earnings, 2016 Q1 normalized EPS increased 17.6%. 
Our first quarter growth was broad-based, with core sales growth in all 5 segments in all 4 regions.  We have particularly strong results in North America, where core sales grew 5.8% as a result of exceptional results on Writing, Tools and Baby. 
Globally, our Win Bigger businesses grew core sales 7.4%, driven by strong double-digit growth in our Writing & Creative Expression business and over 8% core sales growth on our Food and Beverage business. 
While not considered in Newell Brands' first quarter results, Jarden's organic growth was in line with their fourth quarter performance of about 2% and in line with our expectations for the first quarter. 
Jarden's net sales grew over 16%, and as expected, the businesses delivered strong adjusted EBITDA growth related to the Jostens and Waddington acquisitions. So a strong start to the year, and we have clear momentum in our business as we come together to create Newell Brands. 
Let me hand the call over to John to go through the Newell Brands results in more detail and then I'll turn to provide perspective on our revised outlook for 2016."

Core sales, which exclude acquisitions, divestiture and foreign currency increased 5.6%. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures contributed 240 basis points to reported net sales. Foreign currency cost us 230 basis points and the deconsolidation of Venezuela had a negative impact of 170 basis points. 
Our strong core sales performance was led by Baby, Writing and Tools, with all 5 of our segments growing core sales in the quarter. 
Reported gross margin was 38.5% and normalized gross margin was 38.6%, down 20 basis points over last year. The decline was primarily the result of unfavorable currency, the deconsolidation of Venezuela, and the negative mixed impact from the gross margin structure of our Elmer's acquisition, which more than offset productivity and lower input costs. 
Normalized G&A expense was $335.9 million or 25.5% of sales, down 120 basis points versus prior year. Our 160 basis point reduction of overhead fueled a 40 basis point increase in advertising and promotion with the balance of the overhead savings flowing to the bottomline. We invested incremental A&P In writing, Home Solutions, Tools and Commercial Products. We continued heavy media campaigns to support Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens, Sharpee markers and the Graco Forever and Aprica car seats with a noticeable step up in Home Solutions that support the launch of Rubbermaid FreshWorks, our latest food storage innovation. 
Normalized operating margin was a 13.1%, up 100 basis points from last year, reflecting the benefits of Project Renewal and other cost savings initiatives, partially offset by an increase in strategic investment and continuing the moderating FX headwinds. 
Reported operating margin was 9.5% compared with 7.8% in the prior year. Interest expense of $29.4 million increased $10.2 million year-over-year. 
In addition, we recorded a loss of $45.9 million related to termination of the bridge loan associated with backup financing for the Jarden acquisition. The $10.2 million increase in interest expense includes $4 million of incremental net interest expense we incurred a long term debt and other financing arrangements to fund the transaction. Because of the unique nonrecurring nature of these 2 charges, we removed them from our operating -- from our normalized results. 
The remaining $6.2 million of incremental interest expense primarily relates to the financing for acquisitions of Elmer's, which we completed last fall. 
Our normalized tax rate was 27.2% effectively flat to last year's rate. Normalized EPS which excludes restructuring and other project costs was $0.40 and 11.1% increase to last year despite the loss of a little under $0.02 contribution from Venezuela last year. 
As Mike mentioned, backing out last year's Venezuela earnings contribution, normalized EPS grew 17.6% in the quarter. 
On a reported basis, first quarter EPS was $0.15 compared to $0.20 last year, with the largest driver of the decline being that Jarden transaction and financing cost, which I mentioned a few minutes ago. 
Looking at our segment results, starting with writing. Reported first quarter net sales increased 10.8% to $378.8 million. Core sales increased 8.8%, with double-digit growth in North America as well as in Latin America. 
We continue to provide strong POS in the U.S., thanks to the combined impact of increased A&P and robust merchandising efforts. 
Q1 normalized operating margin in our Writing segment was 22.8%, a 150 basis points decline from last year, which was mostly the result of the seasonality of Elmer's with its relatively low sales contribution in the first quarter compared with incremental fixed cost contribution. 
Net sales in our Home Solutions segment grew 2.1% to $372.1 million. Core sales increased 3.6% due to strong growth in the Rubbermaid Food Storage and Beverage wear businesses. 
This more than offset our continued exit of portions of the low margin continued storage business. Home Solutions normalized operating margin was 10.2%, a 40 basis points decline from 2015 as our step up in advertising and promotion more than offset the benefits of productivity and lower input costs. 
Our Tools segment delivered net sales of $179.7 million, a 40 basis point decline. Core sales grew 4%. [indiscernible] solid performance in North America, Asia and EMEA, partially offset by continuing challenges in Brazil. 
Normalized operating margin in the Tool segment was 10.8%, a 150 basis point decline, which is driven by an increased investments in advertising and promotion and continuing FX challenges in Brazil, more than offsetting productivity and pricing. 
Reported net sales in our Commercial Products segment declined 5.8% to $174.5 million. Core sales increased 90 basis points, driven by pricing and volume growth in EMEA and Asia, with relatively flat performance in North America and Latin America, primarily due to the timing of sales. 
Recall that Commercial Products turned in almost 10% core growth in the first quarter of '15, making this a challenging comp. Commercial Products normalized operating margin was 13%, a 350 basis points increase to last year due to pricing, productivity and input cost benefits in overhead savings from Project Renewal. 
Finally, our Baby segment reported $209.8 million in net sales, a 9.2% increase compared to last year. Core sales grew 9.3%. And we continue to benefit from positive momentum in the U.S. and Japan driven by new innovative products. 
Baby's normalized operating margin was 11%, up 460 basis points to last year, largely due to improvements in gross margin attributable to productivity, together with lower investment in advertising and promotion as a result of timing of spend. 
Looking at our Q1 core sales by geography. As Mike mentioned, all 4 of all regions grew core sales, with North America leading the pack at 5.8%. 
In EMEA, core sales grew 3.6%. Latin America core sales grew 5.5% with our Writing business delivering double-digit growth, more than overcoming challenges in the Tools business in Brazil. And finally, Asia Pacific, core sales grew 7.4%. 
With respect to cash, we used $270.9 million in operating cash last quarter compared with the use of $154.3 million in the prior year.  Now we had a number of unique items in the first quarter including a $58 million tax payment associated with our gain on the sale of Endicia last year, about $92 million of payment associated with locking benchmark treasury rates late last year and early this year in connection with our $8 billion public debt issuance last month and about $32 million of higher incentive compensation paid in March relating to our performance in 2015. 
We returned $53.3 million to shareholders in Q1 in the form of dividends and our share repurchases were limited to restricted stock vesting as we suspended the repurchase of shares midway through the fourth quarter of last year in light of the Jarden transaction. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike."

Newell Brands more than doubles our size and key strategic retailers in geographies and we expect scale to enable strong sustained growth through broadened channel cross-sell, accelerated international deployment and strengthen category leadership as we extend the best capabilities from both companies across the whole portfolio. 
Our growth will be fueled by making the new company leaner and more efficient and by focusing our investments on the businesses with the greatest potential. 
Over the next 3 to 4 years, we expect to unlock the financial capacity for growth, margin development and cash flow yield through the delivery of at least $500 million in cost synergies and $300 million in Project Renewal savings. 
Over 80% the combined $800 million in cost synergies and savings will flow to margin, with the balance being reinvested in capabilities and brand support. 
By 2018, we expect to have built a very profitable company with annual EBITDA of nearly $3.5 billion and EBITDA margins of over 20%. The company will be very cash generative. Between 2016 and 2018, we expect to generate $5.5 billion to $6 billion in cumulative operating cash flow. 
After capital investment in dividends, we expect to have about $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion of unallocated free cash flow available for debt repayment. This assumes no material improvement of working capital, reduction in the blended tax rate or any divestitures. 
Our first priority for capital allocation will be to put the cash to work deleveraging the company to our target leverage ratio range of 3 to 3.5x. 
By the end of 2018, we expect to have used about $2 billion to $2.4 billion of the available unallocated free cash flow to pay down our $1.5 billion term loan and most of the $900 million of fixed debt maturities available in that time period. 
Assuming run rate synergies of $500 million, we expect to enter our leverage ratio range by the end of 2017. Assuming phased synergies, we expect to enter our target leverage ratio range by the middle of 2018. This Q1 deleveraging, of course, is contingent upon the delivery of our underlying business plans. 
This morning, we established Newell Brands' guidance for 2016. We expect full year core sales growth in 2016 of 3% to 4%. We define core sales to include the negative impact of product line exits, but exclude the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions until their first anniversary and divestitures from the point of decision to sell the asset. 
Our guidance assumes legacy Jarden core sales are counted as part of Newell Brands' core sales from April 15, 2016 forward and are also in the same year ago comparison period. 
Our guidance also assumes that the Waddington Group and Jostens become part of core sales starting in August 2016 and November 2016, respectively. 
Our Newell Brands' full year guidance assumes 2% to 4% core sales growth in the legacy Jarden businesses for quarters 2 through 4 and 4% to 5% core sales growth on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid businesses for the full year. 
The core sales growth guidance on the legacy Jarden business is roughly equivalent to the Jarden long-standing organic growth guidance of 3% to 5%.  Since their definition of organic sales excluded the negative impact of product line exits and included the positive impact of tuck-in acquisitions. 
Over the next 2 to 3 years, we expect to exit product lines with roughly $250 million to $300 million of revenue across both businesses. 
Our Newell Brands 2016 core sales growth guidance contemplates some portion of these product line exits occurring in 2016. We expect to cover any loss normalized operating income, which we expect to be minimal within our normalized EPS guidance. 
We expect 2016 full year normalized EPS of $2.75 to $2.90. This guidance assumes a weighted average annual share count of 430 million shares, roughly 270 million shares for the first 15 weeks of the year and 497 million shares for the balance of the year. 
Importantly, because of the share count differential by quarter, with Q1 and Q2 lower than our run rate, our full year normalized EPS guidance will be greater than the sum of the normalized EPS for each quarter. 
Our 2016 normalized EPS guidance range is the following assumptions built in: $50 million to $80 million of cost synergies; a blended effective tax rate of 29% to 30% and beginning in the second quarter of 2016, Newell Brands will exclude the amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions including the Jarden acquisition for more calculation of normalized EPS. 
There are 2 key factors that could influence delivery in 2016 full year guidance. The first is business unit execution of their business plans. Both companies are on track to deliver at the midpoint of the legacy ranges that underpin the Newell Brands' full year core sales growth guidance. That means legacy Jarden at 3% core sales growth and legacy Newell Rubbermaid at 4.5% core sales growth. 
The second factor that could influence full year guidance is the Project Renewal savings built into the legacy Newell Rubbermaid plans and the delivery of cost synergies associated with the combination. 
Through the end of the first quarter, Project Renewal program today cost savings totaled $395 million and we delivered $35 million in savings in the first quarter. We're on full flight on Project Renewal and are well on our way to deliver over $100 million in savings that are built into our 2016 business plans. 
Our work on cost synergies related to the combination is also in full flight. We have a clear line of sight in the 2016 cost synergies of $50 million to $80 million assumed in our normalized EPS guidance range. 
While you should not expect us to provide quarterly guidance going forward, I will provide some detail today that should help you think through the math on normalized EPS for Q2 2016 and Q1 2017. 
In the second quarter of 2016, the share count will not reflect the run rate for the balance of the year. The Q2 share count will be a blend of 270 million shares for the first 15 days of the quarter and 497 million shares for the balance of the quarter then to a weighted average share count of approximately 460 million shares. 
In the first quarter of 2017, while there will be a step up in our year-over-year income related to legacy Jarden, growth on legacy Newell, cost synergies and Project Renewal savings, these benefits will be more than offset by a substantial year-over-year interest expense increase related to the transaction, the dilutive effect of nearly 230 million shares increase in share count versus the prior year and about the fact that Q1 is a seasonally smaller quarter for the legacy Jarden business. 
Despite the Q1 2017 dilution of normalized EPS versus Q1 2016, we expect the creation of Newell Brands to deliver at least high single-digit accretion over the company's first 12 months. 
So to close, we had a great start to the year, 5.6% core sales growth, 11.1% normalized earnings per share growth, 25% earnings per share growth on a currency neutral basis and we start 2016 right where we expected to be on both businesses in the first quarter. 
We've established new guidance for Newell Brands with core sales growth of between 3% to 4% and normalized earnings per share of $2.75 to $2.90. 
This earning range represents strong double-digit accretion in 2016 and at least high single-digit accretion on a forward-looking 12-month basis. 
We've established clear capital allocation priorities, with debt repayment as our most important priority after capital investment and dividend. We have a clear line of sight to achieving our stated leverage ratio targets within 2 to 3 years at the latest. 
And after we get back into our target leverage range, our highly cash generative business will be put to work, complementing what is a strong organic agenda with value creating investments of unallocated capital. 
Our 2 organizations are coming together quite well, I look forward to next week when the leaders from across Newell Brands will meet to start the journey toward unleashing the power of our new company. 
We're a $16 billion consumer goods companies, with leading brands that reach consumers everyday where they live, learn, work and play. Brands that compete in large, growing global categories that are unconsolidated. And as a result, offer tremendous market share consolidation potential. The creation of Newell Brands more than doubles our scale in key retailers and geographies and scale will enable sustained, strong levels of growth, especially when coupled with a broader application of our brand development, design and innovation capabilities. 
$800 million in savings and cost synergies will provide the fuel for top line and earnings growth and for further investment in our capabilities and our people. 
As I've said since the announcement of the transaction in December, we were 2 strong companies with very competitive performance and value creation track record that have now come together to create one great company. Together, we'll be stronger. Together, we'll be bigger and grow faster than our competitors, together, we're Newell Brands. 
And with that, I'd like to open it up to questions."

We've hit the ground running on the corporate duplicate [indiscernible]work obviously with Mark and Jim moving into new roles and we began the work in other corporate roles as well with changes happening very quickly and more changes to come over the next number of weeks.

This is an ongoing struggle, it's all built into our guidance, but I think this is going to be a tough year for our Tools business in Brazil. We've had light challenges on the Jarden side of our business. That said, both companies have done well in Latin America in the first quarter despite -- in the case of legacy Newell, the absence of Venezuela and the numbers and the challenges in Brazil. Newell's core growth in Brazil was actually down materially in the first quarter. So despite that, delivered 5.5% growth and Jarden had some similar challenges there. I will say, within the Jarden numbers, one of the standout performances in the first quarter was JCS, so despite having a footprint that intersects with those dynamics that I was describing in Brazil, the business, in aggregate, did quite well."

So we've been, obviously, as you can imagine, we've been engaged, Bill and Mark, in particular, Rez, Rick, really engaged in getting up to speed on the Jarden businesses over the last number of months to the degree that we could and since the 15th, with much greater depth. And the teams -- in fact, all the teams from across Newell and legacy Newell and legacy Jarden are together next week for the week and we're really going to dive on each other's businesses so we're going to share, we're going to learn, we're going to connect, we're going to get into this and a lot greater detail as we try to build out one integrated company leadership team. So that's very exciting it will be fun on the social side, but more importantly, we'll get into the details of the business. Jarden have good momentum. As I mentioned JCS had good growth in the first quarter, on great growth year-ago period, double-digit growth a year ago and very good growth in the first quarter on top of that. Yankee, again, double-digit growth a year-ago period. Great growth in the first quarter on top of that. So we've got some decent momentum in some of the most important assets that are in the Jarden portfolio and as you can tell from our numbers, you got similar momentum in our most strategically critical businesses like writing. So we feel terrific. We're right where we expected to be in the combination and we're excited by the possibilities. Now we're going go through the work over the summer of establishing portfolio priorities just like we did when we got to Newell Rubbermaid and obviously, JCS and Yankee will be priority businesses for us going forward with writing and with food and beverage and likely suspects that you're familiar with from the former Newell businesses. But we'll go through that rigorous process of establishing portfolio of priorities through the summer. Now we've got the board meeting in a couple of weeks where we'll expose our approach to the board. And by the August board meeting, we'll be ready to lock in our portfolio, prioritization choices in that you should expect resources to align to those priorities and we'll invest heavily on the businesses with the greatest potential, the greatest right to win and we'll add the other businesses to win differently, to win in a different ways than by leveraging the big investments in brand development and design and an innovation that we'll place in our priority business. So you should expect that logic that drove the choices within Newell Rubbermaid to drive the choices in the combined Newell Brands. Now that said, all businesses have to grow, all businesses have to grow ahead of the markets, growth is the engine that powers the company, and it's really critical for our teams to embrace that. Based on what I've seen, I think that's going to be a really easy thing for us to land as an integrated company. The values of the operational intensity that underpins things that we've done over the last few years are clearly in place on the Jarden businesses. So I'm quite optimistic about their not being and a cultural or social issues without getting aligned on how we intend to operate. With respect to synergies, obviously, synergy is going to flow to margin. The work on Rubbermaid, there's still left to do, the $300 million savings we hope to get roughly $300 million. Half of that will flow into investment. Where we put those investment's debts -- I'm quite agnostic about that. The fact that the savings are coming from -- that we would invest back are coming from legacy Newell Rubbermaid, doesn't mean that the spending will happen there. So we're going to make sure that our strategy yields set of outcomes are greater than some of the parts. So we're going to take money and put it on the businesses with the greatest right to win. So I feel great about where we are these really early stages. Everybody's sprinting. We're excited by the possibilities and energized by the work ahead."

So as you know, our inclination is to get into these businesses and choose to fix them rather than either sell them or exit them. In certain cases within our last 5-year history at Newell Rubbermaid, we've made the choice to exit as we did in Europe with a critical enabler that the exits we took on in Europe were critical enablers that is getting the cost structure down, particularly in our distribution transportation networks. And so as you know, the profitability went from less than $10 million in Europe in 2019 to over $100 million in Europe as a result of some of those choices. Now, of course, those savings come out because of those integrated choices on exits on reprioritizing portfolio of choices. We're going to likely phase into similar dynamics within the Jarden business and while it's premature to specifically call out businesses that we would exit because our inclination is to first build fix, over the summer as we get more opportunity to connect with you, we'll bring, in China, broader light on the specifics that underpin the headline. It was important for us to lay that out for you so that you understood the core sales growth guidance and didn't misread the dynamics that are embedded within it. So we'll see how this all plays out. There certainly are some assets on the Newell Rubbermaid side that we consider exiting as well. And if we got some point where we made the choice, the first question we'd ask is, could we sell them rather than exit them. But given that it's early and we wanted to set course guidance expectations, we probably appropriate to articulate the boundaries around the product line exits that we may choose to implement."

On Commercial Products, we pulled back the spending to roughly 3%, 3.5% of revenue and I think that's where you should expect us to keep it unless we have some big news there that we want to punctuate. As you know, we've learned that doing mathematics advertising didn't work that we were better to advertise new items in the news, and that's where our advertising on Tools has been focused as we've launched new items in the back half of 2015 that have flowed into 2016. But we're going to continue to ask questions about this because particularly in the light of the broader portfolio because there's businesses like Yankee, there are businesses like the appliance business, there's some other aspects of the Jarden portfolio that we feel could benefit from increased A&P support. So as we go through the process of making the portfolio choices across the total portfolio, some of those priorities that we had placed in legacy Newell may change as we take out a broader -- we broaden our perspective on the businesses with the greatest potential. And so some of that money that might have historically been spent on Tools could very well these leads -- find their way to being spent on Yankee or on appliance launches or on any number of other businesses that have interesting things going on. So I thank you should keep an open mind as to how we go through the process over the next few weeks and months towards probably a late summer articulation of those priorities to the broader market.

So Steve, there's 3 kind of questions there and I'll deal with the first one, which is on I think your question was focused on the Jarden business so I'll give you my perspective on both with respect to the flow of growth through the year. And then I'll let John answer the questions on amortization, and then I'll come back on the process. So as you know, Jarden's Q1 are really -- is really a pretty light quarter with respect to its overall impact, the total trajectory of the business. The year-ago numbers, if you look at the year-ago numbers, they're bridging first quarter year ago, I think, at 4.8% organic growth; second quarter, 6%, third -- 6% or 7%, 7%. And 6% in the third quarter and about 2% in the fourth quarter. And so the year-ago comparators are tougher in the first3 quarters than they are in the balance of the year. That said, growth on the Jarden business should pick up through the year as it historically have. And as I've said, we've got good momentum and obviously, a little bit of an easier comp in Q4 than we do in the early part of the year. Q4 obviously, most important quarter for Jarden and I think we're well positioned and the teams are well positioned to now -- the activities that have to be hit excluded at the window to deliver the outcomes. Of course, where there's always a variable in the fourth quarter for their businesses, so we wont count on anything other than normal weather conditions. But I think we're in a good position to land right in the middle of the guidance range we've articulated. On the Newell side, we got terrific momentum. I think we particularly in the Writing business, where ex-Venezuela a year ago, our growth was probably around 6.5-ish percent and to nail 88 in the first quarter without the benefit of Venezuela is a sign of building momentum. We've launched all of our new items earlier in the year than we did last year. We've got interesting momentum now building on the Rubbermaid brand behind the launch of FRESHWORKS and Fasten + Go, we've got a great launch coming to the back half of the year. So the year has the potential to be the Renaissance year for the Rubbermaid brand so we're excited about that. We've got ongoing momentum in beverages. Baby put it another terrific quarter with 9% -- over 9% core growth. And Tools came in stronger quite frankly than expected. Commercial was probably a little softer than we expected. It's timing related. But in aggregate, a 5.6% growth in the first quarter is great, probably our first quarter in a long, long time and given the underlying momentum being driven by new products and strengthened investment beyond the brands, we're  encourage that, that should be able to continue. We've guided to the middle of the guidance range on Newell Rubbermaid and we'll see if things continue as they did in Q1, maybe there's some upside to that. But we'll have to see how the full year plays out, it's a little too early to get too excited although I'd much rather start the way we did than not. So in aggregate, we're feeling pretty darn good about where we're at. We -- our expectations for the Jarden performance in the first quarter were virtually right in line with them. The complexion obviously, within in any of these businesses by business how the numbers aggregate out is always a little bit different than you expect, but that's sort of the normal natural flow. Now with respect to amortization."

That information that work, that thinking will all inform the portfolio of choice activities that we'll go through the summer. This is an analytic process. It's not subjective, so we're going to look at market mapping globally, we're going to look at we began this work, we're going to look at market in category growth rates globally, we'll look at the strength of brands by geography. We've got that research in flight already to understand where brands have leverage and the intersection of people's thinking on the businesses with the broad analytic macro view of geography, category and channel dynamics, plus brand strength will inform -- and the competitive strength will inform where we place our bets.

Maybe our business models are quite different, but when you engage when I engage with Jarden folks, we went out last night after getting ready for this call to little pop around the corner, we're watching the draft and there was a group of Newell people and group of Jarden people there. And they were -- there was a same dynamic as if this group have been together for a long time. This is a pretty operationally intense group of leaders that I've met so far, and so I don't think that's going to be the issue. The business models are different, so I think socializing the changes associated with that in the places where we choose to make change, I think, we'll be -- shouldn't be underestimated, but it won't be governed by culture. Our performance expectations -- our expectations are high for the combined entity. And so we all have to raise the bar. The performance that we delivered over the last number of the year well it has been pretty darn good relative to the industry and if you look at Martin and Tim's track record of value creation, we're way on the top of the league table. But the combination, we've said that we're going to be stronger together than either of us work apart, that's the rational for the deal. So expectations are high. Our performance needs to rise. Our expectations of each other need to be really high. And we will -- we need to align around that. I think that probably one of the most important mix of change management that have to happen quickly that looking backwards and judging performance cannot be forward-looking basis for what great looks like. Great has to look better than what we've done as individual companies in the past. And so we're going to raise the bar on each other and we're going to establish great clarity around what outcomes we're looking for. Growth is the engine that powers this company, and it has to be going forward. We're going to great great margin development through the synergies and by maximizing the mix through portfolio, the portfolio choices we work. But growth is undoubtedly the engine that's going to fire this company going forward. And we've guided 3% to 4%, which I think will be competitive results given the exits we'll likely embrace. But going forward, I think we can consistently deliver at the high end of that range once we get through this transitional period. And we need to put the building blocks in place as a company to deliver that, to sustain that, and maybe even beyond that going forward. And so, that's the change management piece of work that needs to happen, that's the social -- that's the messaging that needs to be embraced and people need to make the choice as to whether they are ready to enlist and line up behind that ambition which, I think based on what I see is going to be no problem. It's going to be very exciting, it's going to be also a lot of fun."

We talked about some of them outside. Depending on the rate of exit, some of that maybe get masked in those numbers, but we haven't built really any of that into the guidance we've provided at this point. So to the degree that we can get that quickly, we'll get some upside to the numbers, so maybe we get to the high end of the range if we get the revenue synergies to start to crack. If you think about the revenue synergy, there are 3 buckets. Cross sell, the opportunity for cross-sell, the opportunity for accelerated international deployment and the opportunity to lead at the category level by applying the best of both companies capabilities to the category growth agenda. Those 3 are listed in the relative speed with which they are accessible. So channel cross sells accessible to us pretty much immediately just a question of getting customer alignment around taking assets from 1 business and putting them into channels than other businesses have access to. We've been divesting the most telegraphic example of that is the commentary we've shared on beverages taking Contigo, and Avex and Rubbermaid and thinking what portion of that portfolio is more relevant to the outdoor channel and leveraging Coleman selling systems to get -- and getting Coleman credit for selling the assets quite frankly. But letting them sell down there vertical brands like -- particularly Avex and Contigo, I would guess, and maybe bubba. And so that's an example of one thing that is available to us and there are many, many others like that. Those things come early. International cross sell probably takes us 6 to 9 months, maybe a little longer to get activated. And then just like the work that happened at Newell Rubbermaid, it took us 18 to 24 months to get a growth yield on the application of Newell's brand development design and innovation model. And where we apply that model within the Jarden portfolio, I would expect it takes that long to get impact as well. So there's a sequence of these 3 different buckets of revenue synergies with channel cross-sell offering the greatest opportunity in the near term."

So you're right, the Q4 growth rate that they had to comp, Q4 '14 [ph] growth rate was about 11.4% Q1 growth rate that the legacy Jarden business had to comp was about 4.7%. One of the big reasons this gets easier going forward is because of the uncertainty, the veil of uncertainty that comes with the transaction like this that was overhanging the Jarden team in the first quarter goes away. We become human, accessible and involved. And so don't underestimate the impact of that on a business' ability to execute. So that's certainly an overhang in Q1 and that's why we were quite conservative and both business is quite conservative in the way they thought about the underlying performance. We've got momentum where it counts in the Jarden business number. You've got momentum in Yankee, you got momentum in JCS. Within some of the other segments or groups, you've got businesses that are looking quite interesting at the moment. You have some other factors that overhang the first quarter like the impact of a different kind of weather experience in the winter sports area and that's just the reality of mother nature that we've got to deal with, and so that clearly has some impact on some of the businesses. And while I won't get into very specific business unit numbers today, you can expect us going forward as we get into this to punctuate the specifics for you on a forward-looking basis. So why do things accelerate going forward? Things accelerate going forward because the uncertainty and the overhang on the organization connected to the combination of Newell and Jarden is behind us. We build enthusiasm behind the combination of the potential for Newell Brands. We engage and get into the details of the business and think about how we optimize the deployment of resources across the total portfolio that we plus up the winners and keep leaning our shoulders into them with more resource. We don't give up much, I don't think in certain other areas within Newell Rubbermaid, if we were to ship resources around and lean our shoulder into a couple of Jarden businesses. And then we get on with fixing some of the businesses that are underperforming. And while I won't get into the specifics within the Jarden portfolio, that is just a little bit premature to be talking about that sort of stuff publicly. We're going to get in. We do profit interventions when they are required. We did it in Baby,we did it on Europe with the Newell Rubbermaid, we're very public that we were doing it and you can count on us to articulate those when we're ready to. But think about the Baby business, Baby business was declining 10% in the first half of 2011 and then it was flat on the full year and we get that business back to 10% compounded growth in 2012, 2013. Last year, we grew 6-plus percent in that business. Last 2 quarters, around 9%. So when you get involved and get into the details and you unpack issues, you can fix them. And so there's a couple of businesses like that, that requires some intervention on the Jarden side and there are a couple of businesses on the Newell side that we're involved it. We talked about Tools and is starting to yield the outcomes we hope. And we'll keep our eye and apply the pressure and get involved and helped resolve some of the issues wherever they exist. And so it's a combination of those things that give us the confidence that we can get the right smacked up in the middle of the guidance range for the full year."

"" There is a structural difference so cannot benchmark companies that stores finished goods against companies that are 100% salt manufactured. You'll never going to get the inventory days to kind of matchup. So you're naturally going to be longer and the reason that obviously makes sense is you don't have to fix the assets on your manufacturing base. So you accept a longer working capital ahead on inventory days for the sake of avoiding a fixed asset base. So they're always going to be longer. Do they need to be as long as they are? Absolutely not. There's absolutely no reason that we can't do better than we have up until now in the Newell Rubbermaid side, forecasting our business and having the confidence to call the upside and managing the flow of product along the entire value chain into inventories. So we've got work going on with respect to complexity reduction which will be an enabler to getting inventories down, but we haven't really lean our shoulder into that yet. I think we have an opportunity to extend the payables as well, both sides and we're going to focus on that as part of our procurement work. So we have a lot of leverage to pull on working capital. Cash matters a ton. It always has, but it really does over the next couple of years and it always should because cash going forward, once you get delevered, becomes the complementary investment tool we've got to strengthen our aggregate performance on top of what we hope to be a very strong organic performance. And so it matters a ton. We're going to do this. This is the bit that we haven't focused on as much as we could and we're going to get it right.

Let me deal with the second question first. So China is on track for a Q4 launch, start of marketing around Back-to-School, which is in February 2017, but the pipeline and route to market work in the fourth quarter of '16 which is where we've always had it planned and very excited about the prospects. Sharpie and Paper Mate into 1 big market, which is in Shanghai. So really looking forward to that and we're excited about the potential of our Writing business in China over time. So that's fine and progressing and Christie and Vick who are the -- Christie who is President of the Writing segment. And Vic Masala, who is the SVP of the writing brand development, are working hand-in-hand to get the launch to occur. So that's right on track. With respect to writing margins, we're going to continue to invest in writing. The Elmer's, I'll make sure Nancy gets back to you on what exactly the Elmer's impact has been on margin for the Writing segment. It's pretty material. And other thing that you have to remember is that in our public numbers, we have Venezuela in the year-ago period. And in the current period, we don't. The Venezuelan margins were higher than fleet average margins. So I wouldn't want you to think about this us being willing to accept margin decline. These are structural mix related issues in the year-over-year numbers. We help people accountable for margin development on a peg rate basis so while we reported actual rates, people's incentive structures are based on constant currency and we're doing fine in that respect although I would tell you that as we extend the shoulders of the business into new geographies, there's going to be a E& investment requirement that will dilute operating margins for a period of time. But you know how we operate. We're happy to do that for a period of time if we get the growth yield and we'll pull that money out. Move it somewhere else at some point in the future. You saw that on the Baby business in terms of the operating margins development in Baby in the first quarter. There's also a currency related impact given how we source componentry related to the yen dollar that's impacting gross margins. We don't want to price for that. So we've got the some inside baseball thing that contributed to that that are sort of external factor related that we don't always choose the price to recover. So I'm not stressed about Writing margins at all. We've got a big project going on and writing complexity that will enhance margins going forward -- gross margins going forward and I think that's probably something that we should eliminate for you guys going -- over the next 6 to 9 months when we talk about writing capacity. But to understand the manufacturing footprint, the changes we're making there, that might bring some color to the margin development forward-looking story."

I'd say the majority will be on the Jarden side, but it's not unsubstantial amount that potentially could be on the Newell Rubbermaid side. So you know we're  continuing to do the work on Consumer Storage. We're not done with that yet. There are some aspects of our Baby business that could benefit us to pull back on. So there's bits and pieces. There's some things in consumer cleaning within the Rubbermaid brand as we get Rubbermaid more focused around food, storage, food preservation, food on the go where the margins -- we have to go through the full work of understanding how cost get allocated the business to understand the real underlying profitability of cash impact of these businesses. But those are all areas that we're going to intensely focus on to understand whether certain aspects of the Rubbermaid business might be better served exiting and Baby as well. So still some opportunity in Baby Europe in particular. So these are things we go after. Now on the Jarden side, just don't want to declare too early until we get into this a little bit more deeply with them, but there are perspectives we've got coming out of the first couple of weeks and a couple of months prior to that, that are worth reflecting on."

So I'm a little surprised that you would tell us a number at all at this point because I would think that if anything that number let's call it $200 million product line exits from Jarden, is it a risk of going up significantly? And I was curious as to why you chose to give us that number today? Because I would imagine the product line impact up in the second quarter is going to be relatively minimal and it just seems like it's a number that's -- could be awfully premature."

So as you undoubtedly know about us, we don't just sort of pull numbers out, we build them from bottom-up. And so we have a pretty clear sense of what we do. I just think it would be premature to declare that. These are businesses that are probably unsellable. That doesn't mean there are other businesses that you might think about from a portfolio management perspective going forward. So it's just 1 piece of the puzzle. And then as I said, our inclination to try to fix businesses. So this doesn't mean these are the only businesses that are margin challenged. So then the question becomes why share that this early? Because I want to set guidance expectations on core sales growth and because how we define core sales growth versus how organic sales growth was defined, it's important for us to pivot from the 3% to 5% organic guidance to the 2% to 4% core guidance on the Jarden businesses and explain that and give you the reasons why we're doing that, and that's because organic sales excluded the impact of product line exits and core sales includes the impact of product line exits. So being explicit in saying that we we're exiting $250 million to $300 million of business over the next 2 to 3 years gives you some ability to understand -- a better ability to understand the core sales assumptions and not get freaked out about the fact that we might be guiding down on Jarden. We're not at all doing that. What we're doing is, we're going to -- saying we're going to get one approach, the guiding underlying performance in the business which is the core sales number. And that's the mechanism by which we do it. So fair question though, Wendy, and I appreciate it, respect it and you can count on us to get quite specific shortly."

So you got a different scenario where you got both Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden legacy businesses growing nicely. So the context is a little bit different.",814,"It's a little bit different in that the Newell Rubbermaid business wasn't growing when we started. So you got a different scenario where you got both Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden legacy businesses growing nicely. So the context is a little bit different. The application of the capability agenda is going to be really exciting. I think the work -- the legacy Jarden folks have done on direct-to-consumer e-commerce is really exciting. I just got an e-mail from Paul's team on Yankee Candle and I called my daughters right away because you can customize Yankee candle jar with pictures of your family for Mother's Day. I was like, ""Girls, we go tit -- if we want to get it delivered by Mother's day, we got to do it this weekend. "" That's just brilliant and we don't do that. We we're thinking that creatively under direct-to-consumer e-commerce front. And so there's some stuff on that side that's so applicable. I just got -- I ordered one of the first things I did was order a built online, a customized rolling baseball. And I just got it 2 weeks ago. And it's so exciting. My wife saw it. My wife don't even know anything about baseball wants a baseball mitt customized for her. So there's some really thing Jarden has done but we haven't been that creative about on the Newell Rubbermaid side. We have tremendous opportunity to apply that capability. On the other side, we have a terrific design and innovation machine going now on Newell Rubbermaid. 5.6 core sales growth is a big number when 75% of your revenues in the U.S., in U.S. GDP growth is 0.5%. Now why are we growing 5.6% ? is because we've got these innovations that are coming through the funnel and hanging I the marketplace with impact. We can apply that capability to many aspects of the Jarden portfolio and you should expect us to apply that. Now that's the Newell playbook working for Jarden and the Jarden playbook working for Newell. So the best of both capabilities, applied across the total portfolio is what we're going to go do with a real passion around brands and growth. This idea that growth is the engine that fires this company is really important for people to embrace. And we mean growth through brilliant commercial execution and to brilliant brand development and we're going to do both of those. And I think when we're done and we look back for the benefit of the 3, or 4, or 5 to 6, 7 years, we'll say, man, we really didn't do what they said by taking the best of both talent pools and the best of both capabilities and applying them as broadly as they are relevant across the portfolio. It doesn't mean and we're more sophisticated than this. It does not mean that every capability is applicable to every business, and that's fine. And it doesn't disable the scale leverage that we've got through the combination when you accept that. It's just smart management. And so, you should expect us to push hard to make the company leaner and meaner, to scale functions for efficiency in the business partnering areas and to scale functions for impact across the total enterprise for growth. But we're going to maintain intimacy at the point of demand creation which is where the selling happens and where the consumer engages with our brands. And if you step back from all design type of concepts and focus on principles, that's the type of thing that will inform choices, on specific design choices and that's what's going to drive us. This is a company -- when we get the brand search back for the summer, I suspect and we exposed it to you, you're going to be blown away by the quality of the brands in this portfolio. I was within the Newell Rubbermaid relative to brands I've worked on before and I've worked on great brands. Worked on Oreo, I've worked on Dove, I've worked on Axe, I've worked on Ritz, I've worked on Maxwell House, I worked on great brands, Kraft. But these brands are really way stronger than people perceive them to be and I suspect that when we get the brand equity work back on brands like Oster and brands like Yankee and brands like Rawlings, brands like for Coleman, you'll see these great assets. Some of them perhaps latent and underleveraged but great assets just like we saw on Newell Rubbermaid, Graco. Graco by far the highest equity score of any brand I've worked on, higher than Dove.  So my energy level is really high because I'm so excited by unlocking the possibilities here with the teams. And I'm really excited about the prospects of us applying the best of what both companies have to offer across the total portfolio."

So yes the answer to that piece of the question. Your question in 2017 guidance, we haven't guided 2017 growth. I will tell you though that the $250 million to $300 million of exits that we've talked about were over 2 to 3 years. And if you do the math on that, you see those exits will cover the opportunity to break out on the high end, probably through 2017. So what is the right long term guidance? We haven't gotten to that yet. I want to go through the work over the summer. We'll pull together an integrated forward-looking model that gives you that long-term guidance. You can capture some of that through the comments I was making through 2018 on cash and cash capital allocation. You back into some of the numbers that we chose to.

This morning, we reported a very strong set of first quarter results. Before getting into the numbers, I want to make sure you're clear on a few things. Our Q1 results include only the legacy Newell Rubbermaid business. Our normalized EPS results were not impacted by any Jarden transaction-related costs. Our financial results exclude contributions from our Venezuelan operations in the current year, but include the contribution of our Venezuelan operations in the year ago period. 
With that as context, let's get into the Q1 highlights. We've had an outstanding start to the year. Core sales grew 5.6%, net sales grew 4%. Our growth was driven by strength in innovation and increased brand support, with advertising and promotion investment up nearly 15% or 40 basis points. 
Despite the increase in brand support, normalized operating margin increased 100 basis points, driven by 160 basis point reduction in overheads related to Project Renewal. 
Normalized EPS was $0.40, $0.02 ahead of consensus and 11.1% ahead of prior year. We achieved double-digit earnings growth despite having to overcome about a $0.04 negative impact related to foreign currency. 
On a currency-neutral basis, normalized earnings per share increased $0.08 or 25%. Excluding the roughly $0.02 contribution from our Venezuelan operations to year ago earnings, 2016 Q1 normalized EPS increased 17.6%. 
Our first quarter growth was broad-based, with core sales growth in all 5 segments in all 4 regions. We had particularly strong results in North America, where core sales grew 5.8% as a result of exceptional results on Writing, Tools and Baby. 
Globally, our Win Bigger businesses grew core sales 7.4%, driven by strong double-digit growth in our Writing & Creative Expression business and over 8% core sales growth on our Food & Beverage business. 
While not considered in Newell Brands' first quarter results, Jarden's organic growth was in line with their fourth quarter performance of about 2% and in line with our expectations for the first quarter. 
Jarden's net sales grew over 16%, and as expected, the businesses delivered strong adjusted EBITDA growth related to the Jostens and Waddington acquisitions. So a strong start to the year, and we have clear momentum in our business as we come together to create Newell Brands. 
Let me hand the call over to John to go through the Newell Brands results in more detail, and then I'll return to provide perspective on our revised outlook for 2016."

First quarter reported net sales were $1.31 billion, a 4% increase versus last year. Core sales, which exclude acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency increased 5.6%. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures",1130,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. First quarter reported net sales were $1.31 billion, a 4% increase versus last year. Core sales, which exclude acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency increased 5.6%. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures contributed 240 basis points to reported net sales. Foreign currency cost us 230 basis points and the deconsolidation of Venezuela had a negative impact of 170 basis points. 
Our strong core sales performance was led by Baby, Writing and Tools, with all 5 of our segments growing core sales in the quarter. 
Reported gross margin was 38.5% and normalized gross margin was 38.6%, down 20 basis points over last year. The decline was primarily the result of unfavorable currency, the deconsolidation of Venezuela, and the negative mix impact from the gross margin structure of our Elmer's acquisition, which more than offset productivity and lower input costs. 
Normalized SG&A expense was $335.9 million or 25.5% of sales, down 120 basis points versus prior year. Our 160 basis point reduction of overhead fueled a 40 basis point increase in advertising and promotion, with the balance of the overhead savings flowing to the bottom line. We invested incremental A&P in Writing, Home Solutions, Tools and Commercial Products. We continued heavy media campaigns to support Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens, Sharpie markers and the Graco 4Ever and Aprica Fladea car seats with a noticeable step up in Home Solutions that support the launch of Rubbermaid FreshWorks, our latest food storage innovation. 
Normalized operating margin was 13.1%, up 100 basis points from last year, reflecting the benefits of Project Renewal and other cost-savings initiatives, partially offset by an increase in strategic investment and continuing the moderating FX headwinds. 
Reported operating margin was 9.5% compared with 7.8% in the prior year. Interest expense of $29.4 million increased $10.2 million year-over-year. 
In addition, we recorded a loss of $45.9 million related to termination of the bridge loan associated with backup financing for the Jarden acquisition. The $10.2 million increase in interest expense includes $4 million of incremental net interest expense we incurred a long-term debt and other financing arrangements to fund the transaction. Because of the unique nonrecurring nature of these 2 charges, we removed them from our operating -- from our normalized results. 
The remaining $6.2 million of incremental interest expense primarily relates to the financing for the acquisition of Elmer's, which we completed last fall. 
Our normalized tax rate was 27.2%, effectively flat to last year's rate. Normalized EPS, which excludes restructuring and other project costs, was $0.40, an 11.1% increase to last year despite the loss of a little under $0.02 contribution from Venezuela last year. 
As Mike mentioned, backing out last year's Venezuela earnings contribution, normalized EPS grew 17.6% in the quarter. 
On a reported basis, first quarter EPS was $0.15 compared to $0.20 last year, with the largest driver of the decline being that Jarden transaction and financing costs, which I mentioned a few minutes ago. 
Looking at our segment results, starting with Writing. Reported first quarter net sales increased 10.8% to $378.8 million. Core sales increased 8.8%, with double-digit growth in North America as well as in Latin America. We continue to drive strong POS in the U.S., thanks to the combined impact of increased A&P and robust merchandising efforts. 
Q1 normalized operating margin in our Writing segment was 22.8%, a 150 basis point decline from last year, which was mostly the result of the seasonality of Elmer's with its relatively low sales contribution in the first quarter compared with incremental fixed cost contribution. 
Net sales in our Home Solutions segment grew 2.1% to $372.1 million. Core sales increased 3.6% due to strong growth in the Rubbermaid Food Storage and Beverage wear [ph] businesses. This more than offset our continued exit of portions of the low margin Consumer Storage business. Home Solutions normalized operating margin was 10.2%, a 40 basis point decline from 2015 as our step-up in advertising and promotion more than offset the benefits of productivity and lower input costs. 
Our Tools segment delivered net sales of $179.7 million, a 40 basis point decline. Core sales grew 4%. Tools turned in solid performance in North America, Asia and EMEA, partially offset by continuing challenges in Brazil. Normalized operating margin in the Tools segment was 10.8%, a 150 basis point decline, which is driven by increased investments in advertising and promotion and continuing FX challenges in Brazil, more than offsetting productivity and pricing. 
Reported net sales in our Commercial Products segment declined 5.8% to $174.5 million. Core sales increased 90 basis points, driven by pricing and volume growth in EMEA and Asia, with relatively flat performance in North America and Latin America, primarily due to the timing of sales. 
Recall that Commercial Products turned in almost 10% core growth in the first quarter of '15, making this a challenging comp. Commercial Products normalized operating margin was 13%, a 350 basis point increase to last year due to pricing, productivity and input cost benefits in overhead savings from Project Renewal. 
Finally, our Baby segment reported $209.8 million in net sales, a 9.2% increase compared to last year. Core sales grew 9.3%. And we continue to benefit from positive momentum in the U.S. and Japan, driven by new innovative products. 
Baby's normalized operating margin was 11%, up 460 basis points to last year, largely due to improvements in gross margin attributable to productivity, together with lower investment in advertising and promotion as a result of timing of spend. 
Looking at our Q1 core sales by geography. As Mike mentioned, all 4 of all regions grew core sales, with North America leading the pack at 5.8%. In EMEA, core sales grew 3.6%. Latin America core sales grew 5.5%, with our Writing business delivering double-digit growth, more than overcoming challenges in the Tools business in Brazil. And finally, Asia Pacific, core sales grew 7.4%. 
With respect to cash, we used $270.9 million in operating cash last quarter compared with the use of $154.3 million in the prior year. Now we had a number of unique items in the first quarter, including a $58 million tax payment associated with our gain on the sale of Endicia last year, about $92 million of payment associated with locking benchmark treasury rates late last year and early this year in connection with our $8 billion public debt issuance last month, and about $32 million of higher incentive compensation paid in March relating to our performance in 2015. 
We returned $53.3 million to shareholders in Q1 in the form of dividends and our share repurchases were limited to restricted stock vesting as we suspended the repurchase of shares midway through the fourth quarter of last year in light of the Jarden transaction. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike."
291703,331121983,967498,"Newell Rubbermaid Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2016",2016-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Newell Brands Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John.

We delivered these strong results while si",1636,"Thanks, John. Let's now turn to the balance of 2016. As you know, Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden came together as Newell Brands on April 15, 2016. Both companies entered into the transaction with terrific momentum. We delivered these strong results while simultaneously completing the most transformative transaction in our respective histories. 
Newell Brands will be the one of the leading consumer goods companies in the world with pro forma 2016 revenue of about $16 billion. We have a strong portfolio of household brands that reach consumer every day, where they live, learn, work and play. 
Newell Brands more than doubles our size and key strategic retailers in geographies and we expect scale to enable strong sustained growth through broadened channel cross-sell, accelerated international deployment and strengthened category leadership as we extend the best capabilities from both companies across the full [ph] portfolio. 
Our growth will be fueled by making the new company leaner and more efficient and by focusing our investments on the businesses with the greatest potential. Over the next 3 to 4 years, we expect to unlock the financial capacity for growth, margin development and cash flow yield through the delivery of at least $500 million in cost synergies and $300 million in Project Renewal savings. Over 80% the combined $800 million in cost synergies and savings will flow to margin, with the balance being reinvested in capabilities and brand support. 
By 2018, we expect to have built a very profitable company with annual EBITDA of nearly $3.5 billion and EBITDA margins of over 20%. The company will be very cash generative. Between 2016 and 2018, we expect to generate $5.5 billion to $6 billion in cumulative operating cash flow. After capital investment in dividends, we expect to have about $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion of unallocated free cash flow available for debt repayment. This assumes no material improvement of working capital, reduction in the blended tax rate or any divestitures. 
Our first priority for capital allocation will be to put the cash to work, deleveraging the company to our target leverage ratio range of 3x to 3.5x. By the end of 2018, we expect to have used about $2 billion to $2.4 billion of the available unallocated free cash flow to pay down our $1.5 billion term loan and most of the $900 million of fixed debt maturities available in that time period. 
Assuming run rate synergies of $500 million, we expect to enter our leverage ratio range by the end of 2017. Assuming phased synergies, we expect to enter our target leverage ratio range by the middle of 2018. This fuel [ph] on deleveraging, of course, is contingent upon our delivery of our underlying business plans. 
This morning, we established Newell Brands' guidance for 2016. We expect full year core sales growth in 2016 of 3% to 4%. We define core sales to include the negative impact of product line exits, but exclude the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions until their first anniversary and divestitures from the point of decision to sell the asset. 
Our guidance assumes legacy Jarden core sales are counted as part of Newell Brands' core sales from April 15, 2016 forward and are also in the same year ago comparison period. Our guidance also assumes that the Waddington Group and Jostens become part of core sales, starting in August 2016 and November 2016, respectively. 
Our Newell Brands' full year guidance assumes 2% to 4% core sales growth in the legacy Jarden businesses for quarters 2 through 4 and 4% to 5% core sales growth on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid businesses for the full year. The core sales growth guidance on the legacy Jarden business is roughly equivalent to the Jarden long-standing organic growth guidance of 3% to 5% since their definition of organic sales excluded the negative impact of product line exits and included the positive impact of tuck-in acquisitions. Over the next 2 to 3 years, we expect to exit product lines with roughly $250 million to $300 million of revenue across both businesses. 
Our Newell Brands 2016 core sales growth guidance contemplates some portion of these product line exits occurring in 2016. We expect to cover any lost normalized operating income, which we expect to be minimal, within our normalized EPS guidance. 
We expect 2016 full year normalized EPS of $2.75 to $2.90. This guidance assumes a weighted average annual share count of 430 million shares, roughly 270 million shares for the first 15 weeks of the year and 497 million shares for the balance of the year. 
Importantly, because of the share count differential by quarter, with Q1 and Q2 lower than our run rate, our full year normalized EPS guidance will be greater than the sum of the normalized EPS for each quarter. 
Our 2016 normalized EPS guidance range is the following assumptions built in: $50 million to $80 million of cost synergies; a blended effective tax rate of 29% to 30%, and beginning in the second quarter of 2016, Newell Brands will exclude the amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisitions, including the Jarden acquisition for marked calculation of normalized EPS. 
There are 2 key factors that could influence the delivery of the 2016 full year guidance. The first is business unit execution of their business plans. Both companies are on track to deliver at the midpoint of the legacy ranges that underpin the Newell Brands' full year core sales growth guidance. That means legacy Jarden at 3% core sales growth and legacy Newell Rubbermaid at 4.5% core sales growth. 
The second factor that could influence full year guidance is the Project Renewal savings built into the legacy Newell Rubbermaid plans and the delivery of cost synergies associated with the combination. 
Through the end of the first quarter, Project Renewal program today cost savings totaled $395 million and we delivered $35 million in savings in the first quarter. We're in full flight on Project Renewal and are well on our way to deliver over $100 million in savings that are built into our 2016 business plans. 
Our work on cost synergies related to the combination is also in full flight. We have a clear line of sight in the 2016 cost synergies of $50 million to $80 million assumed in our normalized EPS guidance range. 
While you should not expect us to provide quarterly guidance going forward, I will provide some detail today that should help you think through the math on normalized EPS for Q2 2016 and Q1 2017. 
In the second quarter of 2016, the share count will not reflect the run rate for the balance of the year. The Q2 share count will be a blend of 270 million shares for the first 15 days of the quarter and 497 million shares for the balance of the quarter, leading [ph] to a weighted average share count of approximately 460 million shares. 
In the first quarter of 2017, while there will be a step-up in our year-over-year income related to legacy Jarden, growth on legacy Newell, cost synergies and Project Renewal savings, these benefits will be more than offset by a substantial year-over-year interest expense increase related to the transaction, the dilutive effect of nearly 230 million share increase in share count versus the prior year and by the fact that Q1 is a seasonally smaller quarter for the legacy Jarden business. 
Despite the Q1 2017 dilution of normalized EPS versus Q1 2016, we expect the creation of Newell Brands to deliver at least high single-digit accretion over the company's first 12 months. 
So to close, we had a great start to the year, 5.6% core sales growth, 11.1% normalized earnings per share growth, 25% earnings per share growth on a currency-neutral basis and we start 2016 right where we expected to be on both businesses in the first quarter. 
We've established new guidance for Newell Brands with core sales growth of between 3% to 4% and normalized earnings per share of $2.75 to $2.90. This earning range represents strong double-digit accretion in 2016 and at least high single-digit accretion on a forward-looking 12-month basis. 
We've established clear capital allocation priorities, with debt repayment as our most important priority after capital investment and dividend. We have a clear line of sight to achieving our stated leverage ratio targets within 2 to 3 years at the latest. And after we get back into our target leverage range, our highly cash generative business will be put to work, complementing what is a strong organic agenda with value creating investment of unallocated capital. 
Our 2 organizations are coming together quite well, and I look forward to next week when the leaders from across Newell Brands will meet to start the journey toward unleashing the power of our new company. We're a $16 billion consumer goods companies, with leading brands that reach consumers every day where they live, learn, work and play. Brands that compete in large, growing global categories that are unconsolidated. And as a result, offer tremendous market share consolidation potential. The creation of Newell Brands more than doubles our scale in key retailers and geographies and scale will enable sustained, strong levels of growth, especially when coupled with a broader application of our brand development, design and innovation capabilities. $800 million in savings and cost synergies will provide the fuel for top line and earnings growth and for further investment in our capabilities and our people. 
As I've said since the announcement of the transaction in December, we were 2 strong companies with very competitive performance and value creation track records that have now come together to create one great company. Together, we'll be stronger. Together, we'll be bigger and grow faster than our competitors. Together, we are Newell Brands. 
And with that, I'd like to open it up to questions."

We've hit the ground running on the corporate duplicate [Audio Gap] work obviously with Martin, Ian and Jim moving into new roles. And we began the work in other corporate roles as well, with changes happening very quickly and more changes to come over the next number of weeks. The procurement teams are geared up and running.

So we priced significantly in Brazil and have lost volume momentum there. So this is an ongoing struggle. It's all built into our guidance, but I think this is going to be a tough year for our Tools business in Brazil. We've had light challenges on the Jarden side of our business. That said, both companies have done well in Latin America in the first quarter despite, in the case of legacy Newell, the absence of Venezuela and the numbers and the challenges in Brazil. Newell's core growth in Brazil was actually down materially in the first quarter. So despite that, delivered 5.5% growth and Jarden had some similar challenges there. I will say, within the Jarden numbers, one of the standout performances in the first quarter was JCS. So despite having a footprint that intersects with those dynamics that I was describing in Brazil, the business, in aggregate, did quite well."

So we've been, obviously, as you would imagine, we've been engaged, Bill and Mark, in particular, Russ Torres, Rich Samson [ph], really engaged in getting up to speed on the Jarden businesses over the last number of months to the degree that we could, and since the 15th, in much greater depth. And the teams -- in fact, all the teams from across Newell and legacy Newell and legacy Jarden are together next week for the week. And we're really going to dive on each other's businesses. So we're going to share, we're going to learn, we're going to connect. We're going to get into this in a lot greater detail as we try to build out one integrated company leadership team. So that's very exciting. It will be fun on the social side, but more importantly, we'll get into the details of the business. Jarden had some really good momentum. As I mentioned, JCS had good growth in the first quarter, on great growth year-ago period, double-digit growth a year ago and very good growth in the first quarter on top of that. Yankee, again, double-digit growth a year ago period. Great growth in the first quarter on top of that. So we've got some decent momentum in some of the most important assets that are in the Jarden portfolio. And as you can tell from our numbers, we've got similar momentum in our most strategically critical businesses like Writing. So we feel terrific. We're right where we expected to be in the combination and we're excited by the possibilities. And we're going go through the work over the summer of establishing portfolio priorities, just like we did when we got to Newell Rubbermaid. And obviously, JCS and Yankee will be priority businesses for us going forward with Writing and with Food & Beverage and the likely suspects that you're familiar with from the former Newell businesses. But we'll go through that rigorous process of establishing portfolio of priorities through the summer. We've got a board meeting in a couple of weeks where we'll expose our approach to the board. And then by the August board meeting, we'll be ready to lock in our portfolio, prioritization choices and you should expect resources to align to those priorities. And we'll invest heavily on the businesses with the greatest potential, the greatest right to win, and we'll ask the other businesses to win differently, to win in a different ways than by leveraging the big investments in brand development and design and in innovation that we'll place in our priority businesses. So you should expect that logic that drove the choices within Newell Rubbermaid to drive the choices in the combined Newell Brands. That said, all businesses have to grow, all businesses have to grow ahead of the markets, growth is the engine that powers the company, and it's really critical for our teams to embrace that. And I -- based on what I've seen, I think that's going to be a really easy thing for us to land as an integrated company. The values of the operational intensity that underpins things that we've done over the last few years are clearly in place on the Jarden businesses. So I'm quite optimistic about their not being and a cultural or social issues without getting aligned on how we intend to operate. With respect to synergies, obviously, synergy is going to flow to margin. The work on Rubbermaid that's still left to do, the $300 million savings we hope to get roughly $300 million. Half of that will flow into investment. Where we put those investment debts -- I'm quite agnostic about that. The fact that the savings are coming from -- that we would invest back are coming from legacy Newell Rubbermaid doesn't mean that the spending will happen there. So we're going to make sure that our strategy yields a set of outcomes that are greater than some of the parts. So we're going to take money and put it on the businesses with the greatest right to win. So I feel great about where we are these really early stages. Everybody is sprinting. We're excited by the possibilities and energized by the work ahead."

So as you know, our inclination is to get into these businesses and choose to fix them rather than either sell them or exit them.

So as you know, our inclination is to get into these businesses and choose to fix them rather than either sell them or exit them. In certain cases within our last 5-year history at Newell Rubbermaid, we've made the choice to exit as we did in Europe with a critical enabler that the exits we took on in Europe were critical enablers that's getting the cost structure down, particularly in our distribution transportation networks. And so, as you know, the profitability went from less than $10 million in Europe in 2019 to over $100 million in Europe as a result of some of those choices. Now, of course, those savings come out because of those integrated choices on exits on reprioritizing portfolio of choices. We're going to likely phase into similar dynamics within the Jarden business. And while it's premature to specifically call out businesses that we would exit because our inclination is to, first, go fix, over the summer as we get more opportunity to connect with you, we'll bring, in China, broader light on the specifics that underpin the headline. It was important for us to lay that out for you so that you understood the core sales growth guidance and didn't misread the dynamics that are embedded within it. So we'll see how this all plays out. There certainly are some assets on the Newell Rubbermaid side that we consider exiting as well. And if we got to the point where we made that choice, the first question we'd ask is, could we sell them rather than exit them? But given that it's early and that we wanted to set course our guidance expectations, we felt it appropriate to articulate the boundaries around the product line exits that we may choose to implement."

On Commercial Products, we pulled back the spending to roughly 3%, 3.5% of revenue and I think that's where you should expect us to keep it unless we have some big news there that we want to punctuate. As you know, we've learned that doing mathematics advertising didn't work that we were better to advertise new items in the news, and that's where our advertising on Tools has been focused as we've launched new items in the back half of 2015 that have flowed into 2016. But we're going to continue to ask questions about this because particularly in the light of the broader portfolio, because there's businesses like Yankee, there are businesses like the appliance business, there's some other aspects of the Jarden portfolio that we feel could benefit from increased A&P support. So as we go through the process of making the portfolio choices across the total portfolio, some of those priorities that we had placed in legacy Newell may change as we take out a broader -- we broaden our perspective on the businesses with the greatest potential. And so some of that money that might have historically been spent on Tools could very well find their way to being spent on Yankee or on appliance launches or on any number of other businesses that have interesting things going on. So -- and I think you should keep an open mind as to how we go through the process over the next few weeks and months towards probably a late summer articulation of those priorities to the broader market. And you will see us reallocate resources based on them, both human capital and money."

And so the year ago comparators are tougher in the first3 quarters than they are in the balance of the year. That said, growth on the Jarden businesses should pick up through the year as they historically have. And as I've said, we've got good momentum, and obviously a little bit of an easier comp in Q4 than we do in the early part of the year. Q4, obviously, most important quarter for Jarden. And I think we're well positioned and the teams are well positioned to nail the activities that have to be hit, executed in that window to deliver the outcomes. Of course, where there's always a variable in the fourth quarter for their businesses, and so we won't count on anything other than normal weather conditions. But I think we're in a good position to land right in the middle of that guidance range we've articulated. On the Newell side, we got terrific momentum. I think we -- particularly in the Writing business where ex-Venezuela a year ago our growth was probably around 6.5-ish percent and to nail 8.8% [ph] in the first quarter without the benefit of Venezuela is a sign of building momentum. We've launched all of our new items earlier in the year than we did last year. We've got interesting momentum now building on the Rubbermaid brand behind the launch of FreshWorks and Fasten&Go, we've got a great launch coming in the back half of the year. So the year has the potential to be the Renaissance year for the Rubbermaid brand. So we're excited about that. We've got ongoing momentum on beverages. Baby put in another terrific quarter with 9% -- over 9% core growth. And Tools came in stronger quite frankly than we expected. Commercial was probably a little softer than we expected. It's timing related. But in aggregate, a 5.6% growth in the first quarter is great, probably one of our strongest quarters in a long, long time. And given the underlying momentum being driven by new products and strengthened investment beyond the brands, we're  encouraged that, that should be able to continue. We've guided to the middle of the guidance range on Newell Rubbermaid and we'll see if things continue as they did in Q1, maybe there's some upside to that. But we'll have to see how the full year plays out. It's a little too early to get too excited, although I'd much rather start the way we did than not. So in aggregate, we're feeling pretty darn good about where we're at. We -- our expectations for the Jarden performance in the first quarter were virtually right in line with them. The complexion, obviously, within in any of these businesses by business how the numbers aggregate out is always a little bit different than you expect, but that's sort of the normal natural flow.

That information, that work, that thinking will all inform the portfolio choice activities that we'll go through, through the summer. This is an analytic process. It's not subjective, so we're going to look at market mapping globally. We're going to look at -- we've begun this work. We're going to look at market and category growth rates globally. We'll look at the strength of brands by geography. We've got that research in flight already to understand where the brands have leverage. And the intersection of people's thinking on the businesses with the broad analytic macro view of geography, category and channel dynamics, plus brand strength will inform -- and the competitive strength will inform where we place our bets. And obviously, margins and financial attractiveness contribute to that whole bit of analysis. So there'll be lots of folks inputting. There'll be a few folks that are doing the analytical rigor. Through the summer, end of June, my team will get together for a week, my direct team, to talk about the results, talk about the path forward. And that strategic work will be refined through July to the August board meeting, and then we'll probably come public with bits of that in early September.

Maybe our business models are -- our business models are quite different. But when you -- when I engage with Jarden folks -- we went out last night after getting ready for this call to -- there's a little pub around the corner. We were watching the draft. And there was a group of Newell people and a group of Jarden people there. And they were -- there was the same dynamic as if this group had been together for a long time. This is a pretty operationally intense group of leaders that I've met so far, and so I don't think that's going to be the issue. The business models are different. So I think socializing the changes associated with that in the places where we choose to make change, I think will be -- shouldn't be underestimated, but it won't be governed by culture. Our performance expectations -- expectations are high for the combined entity. And so we all have to raise the bar. The performance that we've delivered over the last number of the years, well, it's been pretty darn good relative to the industry. And if you look at Martin's and team's track record on value creations, way at the top of the league table. But the combination, we've said that we're going to be stronger together than either of us were apart, and that's the rationale for the deal. So expectations are high. Our performance needs to rise. Our expectations of each other need to be really high. And we will -- we need to align around that. I think that's probably one of the most important bits of change management that has to happen quickly that looking backwards and judging performances cannot be a forward-looking basis for what great looks like. Great has to look better than what we've done as individual companies in the past. And so we're going to raise the bar on each other, and we're going to establish great clarity around what outcomes we're looking for. Growth is the engine that powers this company, and it has to be going forward. We're going to get great margin development through the synergies and by maximizing the mix through portfolio -- the portfolio choices we work. But growth is undoubtedly the engine that's going to fire this company going forward. And we've guided 3% to 4%, which I think will be competitive results given the exits we'll likely embrace. But going forward, I think we can consistently deliver at the high end of that range once we get through this transitional period. And we need to put the building blocks in place as a company to deliver that, to sustain that and maybe even beyond that going forward. And so that's the change management piece of work that needs to happen. That's the social -- that's the messaging that needs to be embraced, and people need to make the choice as to whether they're ready to enlist and line up behind that ambition, which I think, based on what I see, it's going to be no problem. It's going to be very exciting. It's going to be also a lot of fun."

We talked about some of them outside. Depending on the rate of exits, some of that maybe -- may get masked in those numbers, but we haven't built really any of that into the guidance we've provided at this point. So to the degree that we can get that quickly, we'll get some upsides to the numbers or maybe we get to the high end of the range if we get the revenue synergies to start to crack. You think about the revenue synergy, there are 3 buckets: cross-sell, the opportunity for cross-sell, the opportunity for accelerated international deployment and the opportunity to lead at the category level by applying the best of both companies' capabilities to the category growth agenda. Those 3 are listed in the relative speed with which they are accessible. So channel cross-sell is accessible to us pretty much immediately. It's just a question of getting customer alignment around taking assets from one business and putting them into channels that other businesses have access to. We're divesting -- the most telegraphic example of that is the commentary we shared on beverages, taking Contigo, and Avex and Rubbermaid and thinking about which portions of that portfolio are most relevant to the outdoor channel and leveraging Coleman's selling systems to get -- and giving Coleman credit for selling the assets, quite frankly. But letting them sell down their vertical brands like -- particularly Avex and Contigo, I would guess, and maybe bubba. And so that's an example of one thing that's available to us. And there are many, many, many others like that. Those things come early. International cross-sell probably takes us 6 to 9 months, maybe a little longer to get activated. And then just like the work that happened at Newell Rubbermaid, it took us 18 to 24 months to get a growth yield on the application of Newell's brand development design and innovation model. And where we apply that model within the Jarden portfolio, I would expect it takes that long to get impact as well. So there's a sequence to these 3 different buckets of revenue synergies, with channel cross-sell offering the greatest opportunity in the near term."

One of the big reasons this gets easier going forward is because of the uncertainty, the veil of uncertainty that comes with a transaction like this that was overhanging the Jarden team in the first quarter goes away. We become human, accessible and involved. And so don't underestimate the impact of that on a business' ability to execute. So that's certainly an overhang in Q1, and that's why we were quite conservative and both business is quite conservative in the way they thought about underlying performance. We've got momentum where it counts on the Jarden business right now. You've got momentum in Yankee, got momentum in JCS. Within some of the other segments or groups, you've got businesses that are looking quite interesting at the moment. You have some other factors that overhang the first quarter, like the impact of a different kind of weather experience in the winter sports area. And that's just the reality of mother nature that we've got to deal with. And so that clearly has some impact on some of the businesses. And while I won't get into very specific business unit numbers today, you can expect us going forward as we get into this to punctuate the specifics for you on a forward-looking basis. So why do things accelerate going forward? Things accelerate going forward because the uncertainty and the overhang on the organization connected to the combination of Newell and Jarden is behind us. We build enthusiasm behind the combination and the potential for Newell Brands. We engage and get into the details of the business and think about how we optimize the deployment of resources across the total portfolio, that we plus up the winners and keep leaning our shoulders into them with more resource. We don't give up much, I don't think, in certain other areas within Newell Rubbermaid, if we were to shift resources around and lean our shoulder into a couple of Jarden businesses. And then we get on with fixing some of the businesses that are underperforming. And while I won't get into the specifics within the Jarden portfolio, that is just a little bit premature to be talking about that sort of stuff publicly. We're going to get in. We do profit interventions when they're required. We did it on Baby. We did it on Europe within Newell Rubbermaid. We're very public that we were doing it. And you can count on us to articulate those when we're ready to. But those -- think about the Baby business, the Baby business was declining 10% in the first half of 2011 and then it was flat on the full year, and we got that business back to 10% compounded growth in 2012, 2013. Last year, we grew 6-plus percent in that business, last 2 quarters around 9%. So when you get involved and get into the details and you unpack issues, you can fix them. And so there's a couple of businesses like that, that requires some intervention on the Jarden side, and there are a couple businesses on the Newell side that we're involved with. We've talked about Tools and it's starting to yield the outcomes we hoped. And we'll keep our eye and apply the pressure and get involved and help resolve some of the issues wherever they exist. And so it's the combination of those things that give us the confidence that we can get right smacked up in the middle of the guidance range for the full year."

You look at the inventory days you say, ""Man, there's an opportunity in both companies."" There is a structural difference, so you cannot benchmark companies that stores finished goods against companies that are 100% self-manufactured. You're never going to get the inventory days to kind of match up. So you're naturally going to be longer. And the reason that obviously makes sense is you don't have to fix the assets in your manufacturing base. So you accept a longer working capital, a hit on inventory days for the sake of avoiding a fixed asset base. So they're always going to be longer. Do they need to be as long as they are? Absolutely not. There's absolutely no reason that we can't do better than we have up until now on the Newell Rubbermaid side forecasting our business and having the confidence to call the upside and managing the flow of product along the entire value chain into inventories. So we've got work going on with respect to complexity reduction, which will be an enabler to getting inventories down. But we haven't really leaned our shoulder into that yet. I think we have an opportunity to extend payables as well on both sides, and we're going to focus on that as part of our procurement work. So we have a lot of leverage to pull on working capital. Cash matters a ton. It always has, but it really does over the next couple of years and it always should. Because cash going forward, once we get delevered, becomes the complementary investment tool we've got to strengthen our aggregate performance on top of what we hope to be a very strong organic performance.

So I think you should not expect us to move over the summer on choices like that. Top leadership team coming together -- there was a question before on supply chain. We're in the market looking for a supply chain leader for the total company. We hope to get that done over the next couple of months. And we're forming and storming the teams now. With respect to our business unit leaders, I feel pretty good about their engagement, so I don't think there's huge risk there. And with respect to the org design, again, it will flow from the portfolio choices, which will come out of the August board meeting and then we'll make some decisions on how exactly we wanted -- how exactly we apply the agreements we get there and what choices we make. I wouldn't expect us to do it all in one swing. I think you should think about us applying some of the work, getting experience with what our set of pretty intuitive combinations you would expect from us and then learning from that and moving sequentially. I think one of the most important things we've got to do is leverage our scale and channels and geographies, and so that will inform -- and customers.

And we very successfully did that at Newell. And we are now -- we went live on SAP in Asia Pacific in the first quarter -- actually in April and released to 4 or 5 countries in Asia Pacific, and we'll sequentially fill out the rest of the map over the balance of this year. And Newell will effectively be done, Russia and Turkey, 2 outliers. But on balance, 99% on the same ERP systems. So we'll begin to take that one on as well as part of our agenda. We have not counted on any cost synergies yet from that work and this will be an area that likely falls into the second tranche of savings beyond the first $500 million."

And you just have to accept that there are differences. Over time, we'll figure out how to bring the companies together. Our principles are going to be very simple. We're going to pay people at the median of the pay -- at the 50th percentile pay, and we're going to -- when we need extraordinary talent in key roles, critical roles tend to get paid more. And that's fine. I don't have any issues with that. But our principles are that we pay at the -- pay at the 50th percentile. And for extraordinary talent and critical roles, we'll go higher than that. But of course, you can make a lot of money here if you perform. And the whole comp philosophy for the company is that you can double up, basically, if you just outperform your objectives. And so people can make a lot of money in Newell Rubbermaid side if they nail their numbers, and that's the philosophy we'll embed. We want to embed a pay-for-performance culture. I don't think it's really that dissimilar because there has certainly been a pay-for-performance culture on the Jarden side as well.

Start the marketing around Back-to-School, which is in February 2017, but the pipeline and route to market work in the fourth quarter of '16, which is where we've always had it planned. And very excited about the prospects, Sharpie and Paper Mate into one big market, which is in Shanghai. So really looking forward to that and excited about the potential of our Writing business in China over time. So that's fine and progressing and Kristie and Vic who are the -- Kristie Juster, who is the President of Writing segment; and Vic Misawa, who's the SVP of Writing Brand Development, are working hand in hand to get that -- to get the launch to occur. So that's right on track. With respect to Writing margins, we're going to continue to invest in Writing. The Elmer's, I'll have to make sure Nancy gets back to you on what exactly the Elmer's impact has been on margin for the Writing segment. It's pretty material. And the other thing that you have to remember is that in our public numbers, we have Venezuela in the year-ago period. And in the current period, we don't. The Venezuelan margins were higher than fleet average margins. So I wouldn't want you to think about this as us being willing to accept margin decline. These are structural mix-related issues in the year-over-year numbers. We hold people accountable for margin development on a pegged rate basis. So while we report at actual rates, we -- people's incentive structures are based in constant currency, and we're doing fine in that respect. Although I would tell you that as we extend the shoulders of the business into new geographies, there's going to be an A&P investment requirement that will dilute operating margins for a period of time. But you know how we operate. We're happy to do that for a period of time if we're getting the growth yield. And we'll pull that money out, move it somewhere else at some point in the future. You saw that on the Baby business in terms of the operating margin development of Baby in the first quarter. There's also a currency-related impact given how we source componentry related to the yen dollar that's impacting gross margins. We don't want to price for that. So we've got -- there are some inside baseball things that contributed to that, that are sort of external factor related that we don't always choose to price to recover. So I'm not stressed about Writing margins at all. We've got a big project going on in Writing complexity that will enhance margins going forward -- gross margins going forward. And I think that's probably something that we should illuminate for you guys going -- over the next 6 to 9 months when we talk about Writing complexity. But to understand the manufacturing footprint, the changes we're making there might bring some color to the margin development forward-looking story."

So there's bits and pieces. There's some things in consumer cleaning within the Rubbermaid brand. As we get Rubbermaid more focused around food, storage, food preservation, food on the go where the margins -- we have to go through the full work of understanding how costs get allocated in the business to understand the real underlying profitability and the cash impact of these businesses. But those are all areas that we're going to intensely focus on to understand whether certain aspects of the Rubbermaid business might be better served exiting and Baby as well. So still some opportunity in Baby Europe in particular. So these are things we'd go after. And on the Jarden side, I just don't want to declare too early until we get into this a little bit more deeply with them. But there are perspectives we've got coming out of the first couple of weeks and a couple of months prior to that, that are worth reflecting on."

So I'm a little surprised that you would tell us a number at all at this point because I would think that if anything that number, let's call it, $200 million product line exits from Jarden, is it risk of going up significantly? And I'm curious as to why you chose to give us that number today because I would imagine the product line impact in the second quarter is going to be relatively minimal.

We build them from bottom-up. And so we have a pretty clear sense of what we do. I just think it would be premature to declare that. These are businesses that are probably unsellable. That doesn't mean there aren't other businesses that you might think about from a portfolio management perspective going forward. So it's just one piece of the puzzle. And then as I said, our inclinations to try to fix businesses, so this doesn't mean this is -- these are the only businesses that are margin challenged. So then the question becomes why share that this early? Because I want to set guidance expectations on core sales growth and because of how we define core sales growth versus how organic sales growth was defined. It's important for us to pivot from the 3% to 5% organic guidance to the 2% to 4% core guidance on the Jarden businesses and explain that and give you the reasons why we're doing that, and that's because organic sales -- excluded the impact of product line exits and core sales includes the impact of product line exits. So being explicit in saying that we were exiting $250 million to $300 million of business over the next 2 to 3 years gives you some ability to understand -- a better ability to understand the core sales assumptions and not get freaked out about the fact that we might be guiding down on Jarden. We're not at all doing that. What we're doing is we're going to -- saying we're going to get to one approach to guiding underlying performance in the business which is the core sales number. And that's the mechanism by which we do it. So fair question though, Wendy, and I appreciate it, respect it and you can count on us to get quite specific shortly."

So you've got a different scenario where you've got both Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden legacy businesses growing nicely. So the context is a little bit different. The application of the capability agenda is going to be really exciting. I think the work that the legacy Jarden folks have done on direct-to-consumer e-commerce is really exciting. I just got an email from Hope Margala's team on Yankee Candle, and I called my daughters right away because you can customize Yankee Candle jar with pictures of your family for Mother's Day. I was like, ""Girls, we got to -- if we want to get it delivered by Mother's Day, we got to do it this weekend."" And that's just brilliant, and we don't do that. We weren't thinking that creatively on a direct-to-consumer e-commerce front. And so there's some stuff on that side that's so applicable. I just got -- I ordered -- one of the first things I did was order a built online -- a customized Rawlings baseball mitt, and I just got it 2 weeks ago. And it's so exciting. My wife saw it. My wife doesn't even know anything about baseball wants a baseball mitt customized for her. So I mean, there's some really exciting things that Jarden has done that we haven't been that creative about on the Newell Rubbermaid side. So we have tremendous opportunity to apply that capability. On the other side, we have a terrific design and innovation machine going now on Newell Rubbermaid. 5.6% core sales growth is a big number when 75% of your revenues in the U.S. -- in U.S. GDP growth is 0.5%. Now why are we growing 5.6%? It's because we've got these innovations that are coming through the funnel and hitting the marketplace with impact. We can apply that capability to many aspects of the Jarden portfolio, and you should expect us to apply that. Now that's the Newell playbook working for Jarden and the Jarden playbook working for Newell. So the best of both capabilities applied across the total portfolio is what we're going to go do with a real passion around brands and growth. This idea that growth is the engine that fires this company is really important for people to embrace. And we mean growth through brilliant commercial execution and through brilliant brand development, and we're going to do both of those. And I think when we're done and we look back with the benefit of 3 or 4, 5, 6, 7 years, we'll say, man, we really did do what we said by taking the best of both talent pools and the best of both capabilities and applying them as broadly as they are relevant across the portfolio. It doesn't mean -- and we're more sophisticated than this. It does not mean that every capability is applicable to every business, and that's fine. And it doesn't disable the scale leverage that we've got through the combination when you accept that. It's just smart management. And so you should expect us to push hard to make the company leaner and meaner, to scale functions for efficiency in the business partnering areas and to scale functions for impact across the total enterprise for growth. And -- but we're going to maintain intimacy at the point of demand creation, which is where the selling happens and where the consumer engages with our brands. And if you step back from design types of concepts and focus on principles, that's the type of thing that will inform choices -- on specific design choices. And that's what's going to drive us. This is a company -- when we get the brand research back from this summer, I suspect -- and we expose it to you, you're going to be blown away by the quality of the brands in this portfolio. I was within Newell Rubbermaid relative to brands I've worked on before, and I've worked on great brands. Worked on Oreo, I worked on Dove, I worked on AXE, I worked on Ritz, I worked on Maxwell House. I worked on great brands, Kraft. So -- but these brands are really way stronger than people perceive them to be. And I suspect that when we get the brand equity work back on brands like Oster and brands like Yankee and brands like Rawlings, brands like for Coleman, you'll see these great assets. Some of them perhaps latent and underleveraged but great assets, just like we saw on Newell Rubbermaid, Graco. Graco is by far the highest equity score of any brand I've worked on, higher than Dove. So my energy level is really high because I'm so excited by unlocking the possibilities here with the teams. And I'm really excited about the prospects of us applying the best of what both companies have to offer across the total portfolio."

I will tell you, though, that the $250 million to $300 million of exits that we've talked about were over 2 to 3 years. And if you do the math on that, you'd see that those exits will govern the opportunity to break out on the high end probably through 2017. So what is the right long term guidance? We haven't gotten to that yet. I want to go through the work over the summer. We'll put together an integrated forward-looking model that gives you that long-term guidance. You can capture some of that through the comments I was making through 2018 on cash and cash capital allocation. You could back into some of the numbers if you chose to. But I wouldn't want to begin to start to articulate the acceleration stage metrics. It's just too early."

This morning, we reported a very strong set of first quarter results. Before getting into the numbers, I want to make sure you're clear on a few things. Our Q1 results include only the legacy Newell Rubbermaid business. Our normalized EPS results were not impacted by any Jarden transaction-related costs. Our financial results exclude contributions from our Venezuelan operations in the current year, but include the contribution of our Venezuelan operations in the year ago period. 
With that as context, let's get into the Q1 highlights. We've had an outstanding start to the year. Core sales grew 5.6%, net sales grew 4%. Our growth was driven by strength in innovation and increased brand support, with advertising and promotion investment up nearly 15% or 40 basis points. 
Despite the increase in brand support, normalized operating margin increased 100 basis points, driven by 160 basis point reduction in overheads related to Project Renewal. 
Normalized EPS was $0.40, $0.02 ahead of consensus and 11.1% ahead of prior year. We achieved double-digit earnings growth despite having to overcome about a $0.04 negative impact related to foreign currency. 
On a currency-neutral basis, normalized earnings per share increased $0.08 or 25%. Excluding the roughly $0.02 contribution from our Venezuelan operations to year ago earnings, 2016 Q1 normalized EPS increased 17.6%. 
Our first quarter growth was broad-based, with core sales growth in all 5 segments in all 4 regions. We had particularly strong results in North America, where core sales grew 5.8% as a result of exceptional results on Writing, Tools and Baby. 
Globally, our Win Bigger businesses grew core sales 7.4%, driven by strong double-digit growth in our Writing & Creative Expression business and over 8% core sales growth on our Food & Beverage business. 
While not considered in Newell Brands' first quarter results, Jarden's organic growth was in line with their fourth quarter performance of about 2% and in line with our expectations for the first quarter. 
Jarden's net sales grew over 16%, and as expected, the businesses delivered strong adjusted EBITDA growth related to the Jostens and Waddington acquisitions. So a strong start to the year, and we have clear momentum in our business as we come together to create Newell Brands. 
Let me hand the call over to John to go through the Newell Brands results in more detail, and then I'll return to provide perspective on our revised outlook for 2016."

First quarter reported net sales were $1.31 billion, a 4% increase versus last year. Core sales, which exclude acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency increased 5.6%. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures",1129,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. First quarter reported net sales were $1.31 billion, a 4% increase versus last year. Core sales, which exclude acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency increased 5.6%. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures contributed 240 basis points to reported net sales. Foreign currency cost us 230 basis points and the deconsolidation of Venezuela had a negative impact of 170 basis points. 
Our strong core sales performance was led by Baby, Writing and Tools, with all 5 of our segments growing core sales in the quarter. 
Reported gross margin was 38.5% and normalized gross margin was 38.6%, down 20 basis points over last year. The decline was primarily the result of unfavorable currency, the deconsolidation of Venezuela, and the negative mix impact from the gross margin structure of our Elmer's acquisition, which more than offset productivity and lower input costs. 
Normalized SG&A expense was $335.9 million or 25.5% of sales, down 120 basis points versus prior year. Our 160 basis point reduction of overhead fueled a 40 basis point increase in advertising and promotion, with the balance of the overhead savings flowing to the bottom line. We invested incremental A&P in Writing, Home Solutions, Tools and Commercial Products. We continued heavy media campaigns to support Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens, Sharpie markers and the Graco 4Ever and Aprica Fladea car seats with a noticeable step up in Home Solutions to support the launch of Rubbermaid FreshWorks, our latest food storage innovation. 
Normalized operating margin was 13.1%, up 100 basis points from last year, reflecting the benefits of Project Renewal and other cost-savings initiatives, partially offset by an increase in strategic investment and continuing, though moderating, FX headwinds. 
Reported operating margin was 9.5% compared with 7.8% in the prior year. Interest expense of $29.4 million increased $10.2 million year-over-year. 
In addition, we recorded a loss of $45.9 million related to termination of the bridge loan associated with backup financing for the Jarden acquisition. The $10.2 million increase in interest expense includes $4 million of incremental net interest expense we incurred on long-term debt and other financing arrangements to fund the transaction. Because of the unique nonrecurring nature of these 2 charges, we removed them from our operating -- from our normalized results. 
The remaining $6.2 million of incremental interest expense primarily relates to the financing for our acquisition of Elmer's, which we completed last fall. 
Our normalized tax rate was 27.2%, effectively flat to last year's rate. Normalized EPS, which excludes restructuring and other project costs, was $0.40, an 11.1% increase to last year despite the loss of a little under $0.02 contribution from Venezuela last year. 
As Mike mentioned, backing out last year's Venezuela earnings contribution, normalized EPS grew 17.6% in the quarter. 
On a reported basis, first quarter EPS was $0.15 compared to $0.20 last year, with the largest driver of the decline being the Jarden transaction and financing costs, which I mentioned a few minutes ago. 
Looking at our segment results, starting with Writing. Reported first quarter net sales increased 10.8% to $378.8 million. Core sales increased 8.8%, with double-digit growth in North America as well as in Latin America. We continue to drive strong POS in the U.S., thanks to the combined impact of increased A&P and robust merchandising efforts. 
Q1 normalized operating margin in our Writing segment was 22.8%, a 150 basis point decline from last year, which was mostly the result of the seasonality of Elmer's with its relatively low sales contribution in the first quarter compared with incremental fixed cost contribution. 
Net sales in our Home Solutions segment grew 2.1% to $372.1 million. Core sales increased 3.6% due to strong growth in the Rubbermaid Food Storage and Beverage Wear businesses. This more than offset our continued exit of portions of the low margin Consumer Storage business. Home Solutions normalized operating margin was 10.2%, a 40 basis point decline from 2015 as our step-up in advertising and promotion more than offset the benefits of productivity and lower input costs. 
Our Tools segment delivered net sales of $179.7 million, a 40 basis point decline. Core sales grew 4%. Tools turned in solid performance in North America, Asia and EMEA, partially offset by continuing challenges in Brazil. Normalized operating margin in the Tools segment was 10.8%, a 150 basis point decline, which is driven by increased investments in advertising and promotion and continuing FX challenges in Brazil, more than offsetting productivity and pricing. 
Reported net sales in our Commercial Products segment declined 5.8% to $174.5 million. Core sales increased 90 basis points, driven by pricing and volume growth in EMEA and Asia, with relatively flat performance in North America and Latin America, primarily due to the timing of sales. 
Recall that Commercial Products turned in almost 10% core growth in the first quarter of '15, making this a challenging comp. Commercial Products normalized operating margin was 13%, a 350 basis point increase to last year due to pricing, productivity and input cost benefits and overhead savings from Project Renewal. 
Finally, our Baby segment reported $209.8 million in net sales, a 9.2% increase compared to last year. Core sales grew 9.3%. And we continue to benefit from positive momentum in the U.S. and Japan, driven by new innovative products. 
Baby's normalized operating margin was 11%, up 460 basis points to last year, largely due to improvements in gross margin attributable to productivity, together with lower investment in advertising and promotion as a result of timing of spend. 
Looking at our Q1 core sales by geography. As Mike mentioned, all 4 of our regions grew core sales, with North America leading the pack at 5.8%. In EMEA, core sales grew 3.6%. Latin America core sales grew 5.5%, with our Writing business delivering double-digit growth, more than overcoming challenges in the Tools business in Brazil. And finally, Asia Pacific, core sales grew 7.4%. 
With respect to cash, we used $270.9 million in operating cash last quarter compared with a use of $154.3 million in the prior year. Now we had a number of unique items in the first quarter, including a $58 million tax payment associated with our gain on the sale of Endicia last year, about $92 million of payments associated with locking benchmark treasury rates late last year and early this year in connection with our $8 billion public debt issuance last month, and about $32 million of higher incentive compensation paid in March relating to our performance in 2015. 
We returned $53.3 million to shareholders in Q1 in the form of dividends and our share repurchases were limited to restricted stock vesting as we suspended the repurchase of shares midway through the fourth quarter of last year in light of the Jarden transaction. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike."

Both companies entered into the transaction with terrific momentum. We delivered these strong results while simultaneously completing the most transformative transaction in our respective histories. 
Newell Brands will be one of the leading consumer goods companies in the world with pro forma 2016 revenue of about $16 billion. We have a strong portfolio of household brands that reach consumers every day, where they live, learn, work and play. 
Newell Brands more than doubles our size in key strategic retailers and geographies. And we expect scale to enable strong sustained growth through broadened channel cross-sell, accelerated international deployment and strengthened category leadership as we extend the best capabilities from both companies across the full portfolio. 
Our growth will be fueled by making the new company leaner and more efficient and by focusing our investments on the businesses with the greatest potential. Over the next 3 to 4 years, we expect to unlock the financial capacity for growth, margin development and cash flow yield through the delivery of at least $500 million in cost synergies and $300 million in Project Renewal savings. Over 80% of the combined $800 million in cost synergies and savings will flow to margin, with the balance being reinvested in capabilities and brand support. 
By 2018, we expect to have built a very profitable company with annual EBITDA of nearly $3.5 billion and EBITDA margins of over 20%. The company will be very cash generative. Between 2016 and 2018, we expect to generate $5.5 billion to $6 billion in cumulative operating cash flow. After capital investment in dividends, we expect to have about $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion of unallocated free cash flow available for debt repayment. This assumes no material improvement of working capital, reduction in the blended tax rate or any divestitures. 
Our first priority for capital allocation will be to put the cash to work deleveraging the company to our target leverage ratio range of 3x to 3.5x. By the end of 2018, we expect to have used about $2 billion to $2.4 billion of the available unallocated free cash flow to pay down our $1.5 billion term loan and most of the $900 million of fixed debt maturities available in that time period. 
Assuming run rate synergies of $500 million, we expect to enter our leverage ratio range by the end of 2017. Assuming phased synergies, we expect to enter our target leverage ratio range by the middle of 2018. This view on deleveraging, of course, is contingent upon our delivery of our underlying business plans. 
This morning, we established Newell Brands' guidance for 2016. We expect full year core sales growth in 2016 of 3% to 4%. We define core sales to include the negative impact of product line exits, but exclude the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions until their first anniversary and divestitures from the point of decision to sell the asset. 
Our guidance assumes legacy Jarden core sales are counted as part of Newell Brands' core sales from April 15, 2016 forward and are also in the same year ago comparison period. Our guidance also assumes that the Waddington Group and Jostens become part of core sales, starting in August 2016 and November 2016, respectively. 
Our Newell Brands' full year guidance assumes 2% to 4% core sales growth on the legacy Jarden businesses for quarters 2 through 4 and 4% to 5% core sales growth on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid businesses for the full year. The core sales growth guidance on the legacy Jarden business is roughly equivalent to the Jarden long-standing organic growth guidance of 3% to 5% since their definition of organic sales excluded the negative impact of product line exits and included the positive impact of tuck-in acquisitions. Over the next 2 to 3 years, we expect to exit product lines with roughly $250 million to $300 million of revenue across both businesses. 
Our Newell Brands 2016 core sales growth guidance contemplates some portion of these product line exits occurring in 2016. We expect to cover any lost normalized operating income, which we expect to be minimal, within our normalized EPS guidance. 
We expect 2016 full year normalized EPS of $2.75 to $2.90. This guidance assumes a weighted average annual share count of 430 million shares, roughly 270 million shares for the first 15 weeks of the year and 497 million shares for the balance of the year. 
Importantly, because of the share count differential by quarter, with Q1 and Q2 lower than our run rate, our full year normalized EPS guidance will be greater than the sum of the normalized EPS for each quarter. 
Our 2016 normalized EPS guidance range is the following assumptions built in: $50 million to $80 million of cost synergies, a blended effective tax rate of 29% to 30%, and beginning in the second quarter of 2016, Newell Brands will exclude the amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisitions, including the Jarden acquisition from our calculation of normalized EPS. 
There are 2 key factors that could influence the delivery of the 2016 full year guidance. The first is business unit execution of their business plans. Both companies are on track to deliver at the midpoint of the legacy ranges that underpin the Newell Brands' full year core sales growth guidance. That means legacy Jarden at 3% core sales growth and legacy Newell Rubbermaid at 4.5% core sales growth. 
The second factor that could influence full year guidance is the Project Renewal savings built into the legacy Newell Rubbermaid plans and the delivery of cost synergies associated with the combination. 
Through the end of the first quarter, Project Renewal program today cost savings totaled $395 million and we delivered $35 million in savings in the first quarter. We're in full flight on Project Renewal and are well on our way to deliver over $100 million in savings that are built into our 2016 business plans. 
Our work on cost synergies related to the combination is also in full flight. We have a clear line of sight to the 2016 cost synergies of $50 million to $80 million assumed in our normalized EPS guidance range. 
While you should not expect us to provide quarterly guidance going forward, I will provide some detail today that should help you think through the math on normalized EPS for Q2 2016 and Q1 2017. 
In the second quarter of 2016, the share count will not reflect the run rate for the balance of the year. The Q2 share count will be a blend of 270 million shares for the first 15 days of the quarter and 497 million shares for the balance of the quarter, [indiscernible] to a weighted average share count of approximately 460 million shares. 
In the first quarter of 2017, while there will be a step-up in our year-over-year income related to legacy Jarden, growth on legacy Newell, cost synergies and Project Renewal savings, these benefits will be more than offset by a substantial year-over-year interest expense increase related to the transaction, the dilutive effect of nearly 230 million share increase in share count versus the prior year and by the fact that Q1 is a seasonally smaller quarter for the legacy Jarden business. 
Despite the Q1 2017 dilution of normalized EPS versus Q1 2016, we expect the creation of Newell Brands to deliver at least high single-digit accretion over the company's first 12 months. 
So to close, we've had a great start to the year, 5.6% core sales growth, 11.1% normalized earnings per share growth, 25% earnings per share growth on a currency-neutral basis and we start 2016 right where we expected to be on both businesses in the first quarter. 
We've established new guidance for Newell Brands with core sales growth of between 3% to 4% and normalized earnings per share of $2.75 to $2.90. This earnings range represents strong double-digit accretion in 2016 and at least high single-digit accretion on a forward-looking 12-month basis. 
We've established clear capital allocation priorities, with debt repayment as our most important priority after capital investment and dividends. We have a clear line of sight to achieving our stated leverage ratio targets within 2 to 3 years at the latest. And after we get back into our target leverage range, our highly cash generative business will be put to work, complementing what is a strong organic agenda with value creating investment of unallocated capital. 
Our 2 organizations are coming together quite well, and I look forward to next week when the leaders from across Newell Brands will meet to start the journey toward unleashing the power of our new company. We're a $16 billion consumer goods company with leading brands that reach consumers every day where they live, learn, work and play. Brands that compete in large, growing global categories that are unconsolidated. And as a result, offer tremendous market share consolidation potential. The creation of Newell Brands more than doubles our scale in key retailers and geographies and scale will enable sustained, strong levels of growth, especially when coupled with the broader application of our brand development, design and innovation capabilities. $800 million in savings and cost synergies will provide the fuel for top line and earnings growth and for further investment in our capabilities and our people. 
As I've said since the announcement of the transaction in December, we were 2 strong companies with very competitive performance and value creation track records that have now come together to create one great company. Together, we'll be stronger. Together, we'll be bigger and grow faster than our competitors. Together, we are Newell Brands. 
And with that, I'd like to open it up to questions."

We've hit the ground running on the corporate duplication work obviously with Martin, Ian and Jim moving into new roles. And we've begun the work in other corporate roles as well, with changes happening very quickly and more changes to come over the next number of weeks. The procurement teams are geared up and running.

You're talking about a business that's over $100 million there. And it's been a struggle, in particular, given currency movements, to maintain margins. So we priced significantly in Brazil and have lost volume momentum there. So this is an ongoing struggle. It's all built into our guidance, but I think this is going to be a tough year for our Tools business in Brazil. We've had light [ph] challenges on the Jarden side of our business. That said, both companies have done well in Latin America in the first quarter despite, in the case of legacy Newell, the absence of Venezuela in the numbers and the challenges in Brazil. Newell's core growth in Brazil was actually down materially in the first quarter. So despite that, delivered 5.5% growth and Jarden has had some similar challenges there. I will say, within the Jarden numbers, one of the standout performances in the first quarter was JCS. So despite having a footprint that intersects with those dynamics that I was describing in Brazil, the business, in aggregate, did quite well."

So we've been, obviously, as you would imagine, we've been engaged, Bill and Mark, in particular, Russ Torres, Rich Sansone, really engaged in getting up to speed on the Jarden businesses over the last number of months to the degree that we could, and since the 15th, in much greater depth. And the teams -- in fact, all the teams from across Newell and legacy Newell and legacy Jarden are together next week for the week. And we're really going to dive on each other's businesses. So we're going to share and we're going to learn, we're going to connect. We're going to get into this in a lot greater detail as we try to build out one integrated company leadership team. So that's very exciting. It will be fun on the social side, but more importantly, we'll get into the details of the business. Jarden has had some really good momentum. As I mentioned, JCS had good growth in the first quarter, on great growth year-ago period, double-digit growth year ago and very good growth in the first quarter on top of that. Yankee, again, double-digit growth the year ago period. Great growth in the first quarter on top of that. So we've got some decent momentum in some of the most important assets that are in the Jarden portfolio. And as you can tell from our numbers, we've got similar momentum in our most strategically critical businesses like Writing. So we feel terrific. We're right where we expected to be in the combination and we're excited by the possibilities. And we're going go through the work over the summer of establishing portfolio priorities, just like we did when we got to Newell Rubbermaid. And obviously, JCS and Yankee will be priority businesses for us going forward with Writing and with Food & Beverage and the likely suspects that you're familiar with from the former Newell businesses. But we'll go through that rigorous process of establishing portfolio of priorities through the summer. We've got a board meeting in a couple of weeks where we'll expose our approach to the board. And then by the August board meeting, we'll be ready to lock in our portfolio prioritization choices and you should expect resources to align to those priorities. And we'll invest heavily on the businesses with the greatest potential, the greatest right to win, and we'll ask the other businesses to win differently, to win in different ways than by leveraging the big investments in brand development and design and in innovation that we'll place in our priority businesses. So you should expect that logic that drove the choices within Newell Rubbermaid to drive the choices in the combined Newell Brands. That said, all businesses have to grow, all businesses have to grow ahead of their markets, growth is the engine that powers the company and it's really critical for our teams to embrace that. And I -- based on what I've seen, I think that's going to be a really easy thing for us to land as an integrated company. The values of the operational intensity that underpins things that we've done over the last few years are clearly in place on the Jarden businesses. So I'm quite optimistic about there not being any cultural or social issues with us getting aligned on how we intend to operate. With respect to synergies, obviously, synergies are going to flow to margin. The work on Rubbermaid that's still left to do, the $300 million of savings we hope to get roughly $300 million. Half of that will flow into investment. Where we put those investment bets, I'm quite agnostic about that. The fact that the savings are coming from -- that we would invest back are coming from legacy Newell Rubbermaid doesn't mean that the spending will happen there. So we're going to make sure that our strategy yields a set of outcomes that are greater than the sum of the parts. So we're going to take money and put it on the businesses with the greatest right to win. So I feel great about where we are in these really early stages. Everybody is sprinting. We're excited by the possibilities and energized by the work ahead."

So as you know, our inclination is to get into these businesses and choose to fix them rather than either sell them or exit them. In certain cases, within our last 5-year history at Newell Rubbermaid, we've made the choice to exit as we did in Europe. It was a critical enabler -- the exits we took on in Europe were critical enablers to us getting the cost structure down, particularly in our distribution and transportation networks. And so, and as you know, the profitability went from less than $10 million in Europe in 2009 to over $100 million in Europe as a result of some of those choices. Now, of course, those savings come out because of those integrated choices on exits and on reprioritizing portfolio choices. We're going to likely phase into similar dynamics within the Jarden business. And while it's premature to specifically call out businesses that we would exit because our inclination is to, first, go fix, over the summer as we get more opportunity to connect with you, we'll bring and shine a brighter light on the specifics that underpin the headline. It was important for us to lay that out for you so that you understood the core sales growth guidance and didn't misread the dynamics that are embedded within it. So we'll see how this all plays out. There certainly are some assets on the Newell Rubbermaid side that we'd consider exiting as well. And if we got to the point where we made that choice, the first question we'd ask is, could we sell them rather than exit them? But given that it's early and that we wanted to set course on [ph] guidance expectations, we felt it appropriate to articulate the boundaries around the product line exits that we may choose to implement."

On Commercial Products, we've pulled back the spending to roughly 3%, 3.5% of revenue and I think that's where you should expect us to keep it unless we have some big news there that we want to punctuate. As you know, we've learned that doing anthematic advertising didn't work, that we were better to advertise new items in the news, and that's where our advertising on Tools has been focused as we've launched new items in the back half of 2015 that have flowed into 2016. But we're going to continue to ask questions about this because particularly in the light of the broader portfolio, because they're businesses like Yankee, they're businesses like the appliance business, there's some other aspects of the Jarden portfolio that we feel could benefit from increased A&P support. So as we go through the process of making the portfolio choices across the total portfolio, some of those priorities that we had placed in legacy Newell may change as we take on a broader -- we broaden our perspective on the businesses with the greatest potential. And so some of that money that might have historically been spent on Tools could very well find their way to being spent on Yankee or on appliance launches or on any number of other businesses that have interesting things going on. So -- and I think you should keep an open mind as to how we go through the process over the next few weeks and months towards probably a late summer articulation of those priorities to the broader market. And you will see us reallocate resources based on them, both human capital and money."

So Steve, there's 3 kind of questions there. I'll deal with the first one, which is on -- I think your question was focused on the Jarden businesses, but I'll give you my perspective on both with respect to the flow of growth through the year. And then I'll let John answer the questions on amortization and then I'll come back on the process. So as you know, Jarden's Q1 are really -- is really a pretty light quarter with respect to its overall impact on the total trajectory of the business. The year ago numbers, if you look at the year ago numbers that they're bridging, first quarter a year ago, I think, had 4.8% organic growth; second quarter, 6%; third -- it was 6% or 7%? 7%. And then 6% in the third quarter; and about 2% in the fourth quarter. And so the year ago comparators are tougher in the first 3 quarters than they are in the balance of the year. That said, growth on the Jarden businesses should pick up through the year as they historically have. And as I've said, we've got good momentum, and obviously a little bit of an easier comp in Q4 than we do in the early part of the year. Q4, obviously, most important quarter for Jarden. And I think we're well positioned and the teams are well positioned to nail the activities that have to be hit -- executed in that window to deliver the outcomes. Of course, weather is always a variable in the fourth quarter for their businesses, and so we won't count on anything other than normal weather conditions. But I think we're in a good position to land right in the middle of that guidance range we've articulated. On the Newell side, we've got terrific momentum. I think we -- particularly in the Writing business where ex-Venezuela a year ago our growth was probably around 6.5-ish percent and to nail 8.8% in the first quarter, without the benefit of Venezuela, is a sign of building momentum. We've launched all of our new items earlier in the year than we did last year. We've got interesting momentum now building on the Rubbermaid brand behind the launch of FreshWorks and Fasten&Go, we've got a great launch coming in the back half of the year. So the year has the potential to be the Renaissance year for the Rubbermaid brand. So we're excited about that. We've got ongoing momentum on beverages. Baby put in another terrific quarter with 9% -- over 9% core growth. And Tools came in stronger quite frankly than we expected. Commercial was probably a little softer than we expected. It's timing related. But in aggregate, a 5.6% growth in the first quarter is great, probably one of our strongest quarters in a long, long time. And given the underlying momentum being driven by new products and strengthened investment behind the brands, we're encouraged that, that should be able to continue. We've guided to the middle of the guidance range on Newell Rubbermaid, and we'll see, if things continue as they did in Q1, maybe there's some upside to that. But we'll have to see how the full year plays out. It's a little too early to get too excited, although I'd much rather start the way we did than not. So in aggregate, we're feeling pretty darn good about where we're at. We -- our expectations for the Jarden performance in the first quarter were virtually right in line with them. The complexion, obviously, within in any of these businesses, by business, how the numbers aggregate out is always a little bit different than you expect, but that's sort of the normal and natural flow.

Maybe our business models are -- our business models were quite different. But when you -- when I engage with Jarden folks -- we went out last night after getting ready for this call to -- there's a little pub around the corner. We were watching the draft. And there was a group of Newell people and a group of Jarden people there. And they were -- there was the same dynamic as if this group had been together for a long time. This is a pretty operationally intense group of leaders that I've met so far, and so I don't think that's going to be the issue. The business models are different. So I think socializing the changes associated with that in the places where we choose to make change, I think will be -- shouldn't be underestimated, but it won't be governed by culture. Our performance expectations -- expectations are high for the combined entity. And so we all have to raise the bar. The performance that we've delivered over the last number of years, while it's been pretty darn good relative to the industry and if you look at Martin's and team's track record on value creations, way at the top of the league table. But the combination, we've said that we're going to be stronger together than either of us were apart and that's the rationale for the deal. So expectations are high. Our performance needs to rise. Our expectations of each other need to be really high. And we will -- we need to align around that. I think that's probably one of the most important bits of change management that has to happen quickly that looking backwards and judging performances cannot be a forward-looking basis for what great looks like. Great has to look better than what we've done as individual companies in the past. And so we're going to raise the bar on each other and we're going to establish great clarity around what outcomes we're looking for. Growth is the engine that powers this company, and it has to be going forward. We're going to get great margin development through the synergies and by maximizing the mix through portfolio -- the portfolio choices we work. But growth is undoubtedly the engine that's going to fire this company going forward. And we've guided 3% to 4%, which I think will be competitive results given the exits we'll likely embrace. But going forward, I think we can consistently deliver at the high end of that range once we get through this transitional period. And we need to put the building blocks in place as a company to deliver that, to sustain that and maybe even beyond that going forward. And so that's the change management piece of work that needs to happen. That's the social -- that's the messaging that needs to be embraced, and people need to make the choice as to whether they're ready to enlist and line up behind that ambition, which I think, based on what I see, it's going to be no problem. It's going to be very exciting. It's going to be also a lot of fun."

We talked about some of them outside. Depending on the rate of exits, some of that maybe -- may get masked in those numbers, but we haven't built really any of that into the guidance we've provided at this point. So to the degree that we can get that quickly, we'll get some upsides to the numbers or maybe we get to the high end of the range if we get the revenue synergies to start to track. You think about the revenue synergies, there are 3 buckets: cross-sell, the opportunity for cross-sell, the opportunity for accelerated international deployment and the opportunity to lead at the category level by applying the best of both companies' capabilities to the category growth agenda. Those 3 are listed in the relative speed with which they are accessible. So channel cross-sell is accessible to us pretty much immediately. It's just a question of getting customer alignment around taking assets from one business and putting them into channels that other businesses have access to. We're divesting -- the most telegraphic example of that is the commentary we've shared on beverages, taking Contigo, and Avex and Rubbermaid and thinking about which portions of that portfolio are most relevant to the outdoor channel and leveraging Coleman's selling systems to get -- and giving Coleman credit for selling the assets, quite frankly. But letting them sell down their vertical brands like -- particularly Avex and Contigo, I would guess, and maybe bubba. And so that's an example of one thing that's available to us. And there are many, many, many others like that. Those things come early. International cross-sell probably takes us 6 to 9 months, maybe a little longer to get activated. And then just like the work that happened at Newell Rubbermaid, it took us 18 to 24 months to get a growth yield on the application of Newell's brand development, design and innovation model. And where we apply that model within the Jarden portfolio, I would expect it takes that long to get impact as well. So there's a sequence to these 3 different buckets of revenue synergies, with channel cross-sell offering the greatest opportunity in the near term."

The Q1 growth rate that the legacy Jarden business had to comp was about 4.7%. One of the big reasons this gets easier going forward is because of the uncertainty, the veil of uncertainty that comes with a transaction like this that was overhanging the Jarden team in the first quarter goes away. We become human, accessible and involved. And so don't underestimate the impact of that on a business' ability to execute. So that's certainly an overhang in Q1, and that's why we were quite conservative and both businesses quite conservative in the way they thought about underlying performance. We've got momentum where it counts on the Jarden business right now. You've got momentum in Yankee. You've got momentum in JCS. Within some of the other segments or groups, you've got businesses that are looking quite interesting at the moment. You have some other factors that overhang the first quarter, like the impact of a different kind of weather experience in the winter sports area. And that's just the reality of mother nature that we've got to deal with. And so that clearly has some impact on some of the businesses. And while I won't get into very specific business unit numbers today, you can expect us going forward, as we get into this, to punctuate the specifics for you on a forward-looking basis. So why do things accelerate going forward? Things accelerate going forward because the uncertainty and the overhang on the organization connected to the combination of Newell and Jarden is behind us. We build enthusiasm behind the combination and the potential for Newell Brands. We engage and get into the details of their business and think about how we optimize the deployment of resources across the total portfolio, that we plus up the winners and keep leaning our shoulders into them with more resource. We don't give up much, I don't think, in certain other areas within Newell Rubbermaid, if we were to shift resources around and lean our shoulder into a couple of Jarden businesses. And then we get on with fixing some of the businesses that are underperforming. And while I won't get into the specifics within the Jarden portfolio, that is just a little bit premature to be talking about that sort of stuff publicly. We're going to get in. We do profit interventions when they're required. We did it on Baby. We did it on Europe within Newell Rubbermaid. We were very public that we were doing it. And you can count on us to articulate those when we're ready to. But those -- think about the Baby business, the Baby business was declining 10% in the first half of 2011 and then it was flat on the full year, and we got that business back to 10% compounded growth in 2012, 2013. Last year, we grew 6-plus percent in that business, last 2 quarters around 9%. So when you get involved and get into the details and you unpack issues, you can fix them. And so there's a couple of businesses like that, that require some intervention on the Jarden side, and there are a couple businesses on the Newell side that we're involved with. We've talked about Tools and it's starting to yield the outcomes we hoped. And we'll keep our eye and apply the pressure and get involved and help resolve some of the issues wherever they exist. And so it's the combination of those things that give us the confidence that we can get right smack dab in the middle of the guidance range for the full year."

You look at the inventory days you say, ""Man, there's an opportunity in both companies."" There is a structural difference, so you cannot benchmark companies that source finished goods against companies that are 100% self-manufactured. You're never going to get the inventory days to kind of match up. So you're naturally going to be longer. And the reason that obviously makes sense is you don't have to fix the assets in your manufacturing base. So you accept a longer working capital hit on inventory days for the sake of avoiding a fixed asset base. So they're always going to be longer. Do they need to be as long as they are? Absolutely not. There's absolutely no reason that we can't do better than we have up until now on the Newell Rubbermaid side forecasting our business and having the confidence to call the upside and managing the flow of product along the entire value chain into inventories. So we've got work going on with respect to complexity reduction, which will be an enabler to getting inventories down. But we haven't really leaned our shoulder into that yet. I think we have an opportunity to extend payables as well on both sides and we're going to focus on that as part of our procurement work. So we have a lot of leverage to pull on working capital. Cash matters a ton. It always has, but it really does over the next couple of years and it always should. Because cash going forward, once we get delevered, becomes the complementary investment tool we've got to strengthen our aggregate performance on top of what we hope to be a very strong organic performance. And so it matters a ton. We're going to do this. This is the bit that we haven't focused on as much as we could, and we're going to get it right.

And that's fine. I don't have any issues with that. But our principles are that we pay at the -- pay at the 50th percentile. And for extraordinary talent and critical roles, we'll go higher than that. But of course, you can make a lot of money here if you perform. And the whole comp philosophy for the company is that you can double up, basically, if you just outperform your objectives. And so people can make a lot of money on the Newell Rubbermaid side if they nail their numbers, and that's the philosophy we'll embed. We want to embed a pay-for-performance culture.

And very excited about the prospects, Sharpie and Paper Mate into one big market, which is in Shanghai. So really looking forward to that and excited about the potential of our Writing business in China over time. So that's fine and progressing and Kristie and Vic Misawa who are the -- Kristie Juster, who is the President of Writing segment; and Vic Misawa, who's the SVP of Writing Brand Development, are working hand in hand to get that -- to get the launch to occur. So that's right on track. With respect to Writing margins, we're going to continue to invest in Writing. The Elmer's, I'll have to make sure Nancy gets back to you on what exactly the Elmer's impact has been on margin for the Writing segment. It's pretty material. And the other thing that you have to remember is that in our public numbers, we have Venezuela in the year-ago period. And in the current period, we don't. The Venezuelan margins were higher than fleet average margins. So I wouldn't want you to think about this as us being willing to accept margin decline. These are structural mix-related issues in the year-over-year numbers. We hold people accountable for margin development on a pegged rate basis. So while we report at actual rates, we -- people's incentive structures are based in constant currency, and we're doing fine in that respect. Although I will tell you that as we extend the shoulders of the business into new geographies, there's going to be an A&P investment requirement that will dilute operating margins for a period of time. But you know how we operate. We're happy to do that for a period of time if we're getting the growth yield. And we'll pull that money out and move it somewhere else at some point in the future. You saw that on the Baby business in terms of the operating margin development of Baby in the first quarter. There's also a currency-related impact given how we source componentry related to the yen/dollar that's impacting gross margins. We don't want to price for that. So we've got -- there are some inside baseball things that contributed to that, that are sort of external factor related that we don't always choose to price to recover. So I'm not stressed about Writing margins at all. We've got a big project going on in Writing complexity that will enhance margins going forward -- gross margins going forward. And I think that's probably something that we should illuminate for you guys going -- over the next 6 to 9 months. But we've talk about Writing complexity, but to understand the manufacturing footprint, the changes we're making there might bring some color to the margin development forward-looking story."

That doesn't mean there aren't other businesses that you might think about from a portfolio management perspective going forward. So it's just one piece of the puzzle. And then as I said, our inclinations to try to fix businesses, so this doesn't mean this is -- these are the only businesses that are margin challenged. So then the question becomes why share that this early? Because I want to set guidance expectations on core sales growth and because of how we define core sales growth versus how organic sales growth was defined. It's important for us to pivot from the 3% to 5% organic guidance to the 2% to 4% core guidance on the Jarden businesses and explain that and give you the reasons why we're doing that, and that's because organic sales excluded the impact of product line exits and core sales includes the impact of product line exits. So being explicit in saying that we were exiting $250 million to $300 million of business over the next 2 to 3 years gives you some ability to understand -- a better ability to understand the core sales assumptions and not get freaked out about the fact that we might be guiding down on Jarden. We're not at all doing that. What we're doing is we're going to -- saying we're going to get to one approach to guiding underlying performance in the business which is the core sales number. And that's the mechanism by which we do it. So a fair question though, Wendy, and I appreciate it, respect it and you can count on us to get quite specific shortly."

So you've got a different scenario where you've got both Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden legacy businesses growing nicely. So the context is a little bit different. The application of the capability agenda is going to be really exciting. I think the work that the legacy Jarden folks have done on direct-to-consumer e-commerce is really exciting. I just got an email from Hope Margala's team on Yankee Candle, and I called my daughters right away because you can customize a Yankee Candle jar with pictures of your family for Mother's Day. I was like, ""Girls, we got to -- if we want to get it delivered by Mother's Day, we got to do it this weekend."" And that's just brilliant, and we don't do that. We weren't thinking that creatively on a direct-to-consumer e-commerce front. And so there's some stuff on that side that's so applicable. I just got -- I ordered -- one of the first things I did was order a built online -- a customized Rawlings baseball mitt, and I just got it 2 weeks ago. And it's so exciting. My wife saw it. My wife doesn't even know anything about baseball, wants a baseball mitt customized for her. So I mean, there's some really exciting things that Jarden has done that we haven't been that creative about on the Newell Rubbermaid side. So we have tremendous opportunity to apply that capability. On the other side, we have a terrific design and innovation machine going now on Newell Rubbermaid. 5.6% core sales growth is a big number when 75% of your revenue is in the U.S. and U.S. GDP growth is 0.5%. Now why are we growing 5.6%? It's because we've got these innovations that are coming through the funnel and hitting the marketplace with impact. We can apply that capability to many aspects of the Jarden portfolio and you should expect us to apply that. Now that's the Newell playbook working for Jarden and the Jarden playbook working for Newell. So the best of both capabilities applied across the total portfolio is what we're going to go do with a real passion around brands and growth. This idea that growth is the engine that fires this company is really important for people to embrace. And we mean growth through brilliant commercial execution and through brilliant brand development, and we're going to do both of those. And I think when we're done and we look back with the benefit of 3 or 4, 5, 6, 7 years, we'll say, man, we really did do what we said by taking the best of both talent pools and the best of both capabilities and applying them as broadly as they are relevant across the portfolio. It doesn't mean -- and we're more sophisticated than this. It does not mean that every capability is applicable to every business, and that's fine. And it doesn't disable the scale leverage that we've got through the combination when you accept that. It's just smart management. And so you should expect us to push hard to make the company leaner and meaner, to scale functions for efficiency in the business partnering areas and to scale functions for impact across the total enterprise for growth. And -- but we're going to maintain intimacy at the point of demand creation, which is where the selling happens and where the consumer engages with our brands. And if you step back from design types of concepts and focus on principles, that's the type of thing that will inform choices -- on specific design choices. And that's what's going to drive us. This is a company -- when we get the brand research back from this summer, I suspect -- and when we expose it to you, you're going to be blown away by the quality of the brands in this portfolio. I was within Newell Rubbermaid relative to brands I'd worked on before, and I've worked on great brands. I've worked on Oreo, I've worked on Dove, I worked on AXE, I worked on Ritz, I've worked on Maxwell House. I've worked on great brands, Kraft. So -- but these brands are really way stronger than people perceive them to be. And I suspect that when we get the brand equity work back on brands like Oster and brands like Yankee and brands like Rawlings, brands like Coleman, you'll see these great assets. Some of them perhaps latent and under-leveraged but great assets, just like we saw on Newell Rubbermaid, Graco. Graco is by far the highest equity score of any brand I've worked on, higher than Dove. So my energy level is really high because I'm so excited by unlocking the possibilities here with the teams. And I'm really excited by the prospects of us applying the best of what both companies have to offer across the total portfolio."

This is a whole new company for both sides, and so we'll brand it maybe a little bit differently. But it will be the same basic where-to-play choices. And we'll realign, obviously, the portfolio choices to the new portfolio. So yes is the answer on that piece of the question. Your question on 2017 guidance, we haven't guided 2017 growth. I will tell you, though, that the $250 million to $300 million of exits that we've talked about were over 2 to 3 years. And if you do the math on that, you'd see that those exits will govern the opportunity to break out on the high end probably through 2017. So what is the right long term guidance? We haven't gotten to that yet. I want to go through the work over the summer. We'll pull together an integrated forward-looking model that gives you that long-term guidance. You can capture some of that through the comments I was making through 2018 on cash and cash capital allocation. You could back into some numbers if you chose to. But I wouldn't want to begin to start to articulate the acceleration stage metrics. It's just too early."

This morning, we reported a very strong set of first quarter results. Before getting into the numbers, I want to make sure you're clear on a few things. Our Q1 results include only the legacy Newell Rubbermaid business. Our normalized EPS results were not impacted by any Jarden transaction-related costs. Our financial results exclude contributions from our Venezuelan operations in the current year, but include the contribution of our Venezuelan operations in the year ago period. 
With that as context, let's get into the Q1 highlights. We've had an outstanding start to the year. Core sales grew 5.6%, net sales grew 4%. Our growth was driven by strength in innovation and increased brand support, with advertising and promotion investment up nearly 15% or 40 basis points. 
Despite the increase in brand support, normalized operating margin increased 100 basis points, driven by 160 basis point reduction in overheads related to Project Renewal. 
Normalized EPS was $0.40, $0.02 ahead of consensus and 11.1% ahead of prior year. We achieved double-digit earnings growth despite having to overcome about a $0.04 negative impact related to foreign currency. 
On a currency-neutral basis, normalized earnings per share increased $0.08 or 25%. Excluding the roughly $0.02 contribution from our Venezuelan operations to year ago earnings, 2016 Q1 normalized EPS increased 17.6%. 
Our first quarter growth was broad-based, with core sales growth in all 5 segments in all 4 regions. We had particularly strong results in North America, where core sales grew 5.8% as a result of exceptional results on Writing, Tools and Baby. 
Globally, our Win Bigger businesses grew core sales 7.4%, driven by strong double-digit growth in our Writing & Creative Expression business and over 8% core sales growth on our Food & Beverage business. 
While not considered in Newell Brands' first quarter results, Jarden's organic growth was in line with their fourth quarter performance of about 2% and in line with our expectations for the first quarter. 
Jarden's net sales grew over 16%, and as expected, the businesses delivered strong adjusted EBITDA growth related to the Jostens and Waddington acquisitions. So a strong start to the year, and we have clear momentum in our business as we come together to create Newell Brands. 
Let me hand the call over to John to go through the Newell Brands results in more detail, and then I'll return to provide perspective on our revised outlook for 2016."

First quarter reported net sales were $1.31 billion, a 4% increase versus last year. Core sales, which exclude acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency increased 5.6%. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures",1129,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning. First quarter reported net sales were $1.31 billion, a 4% increase versus last year. Core sales, which exclude acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency increased 5.6%. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures contributed 240 basis points to reported net sales. Foreign currency cost us 230 basis points and the deconsolidation of Venezuela had a negative impact of 170 basis points. 
Our strong core sales performance was led by Baby, Writing and Tools, with all 5 of our segments growing core sales in the quarter. 
Reported gross margin was 38.5% and normalized gross margin was 38.6%, down 20 basis points over last year. The decline was primarily the result of unfavorable currency, the deconsolidation of Venezuela, and the negative mix impact from the gross margin structure of our Elmer's acquisition, which more than offset productivity and lower input costs. 
Normalized SG&A expense was $335.9 million or 25.5% of sales, down 120 basis points versus prior year. Our 160 basis point reduction of overhead fueled a 40 basis point increase in advertising and promotion, with the balance of the overhead savings flowing to the bottom line. We invested incremental A&P in Writing, Home Solutions, Tools and Commercial Products. We continued heavy media campaigns to support Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens, Sharpie markers and the Graco 4Ever and Aprica Fladea car seats with a noticeable step up in Home Solutions to support the launch of Rubbermaid FreshWorks, our latest food storage innovation. 
Normalized operating margin was 13.1%, up 100 basis points from last year, reflecting the benefits of Project Renewal and other cost-savings initiatives, partially offset by an increase in strategic investment and continuing, though moderating, FX headwinds. 
Reported operating margin was 9.5% compared with 7.8% in the prior year. Interest expense of $29.4 million increased $10.2 million year-over-year. 
In addition, we recorded a loss of $45.9 million related to termination of the bridge loan associated with backup financing for the Jarden acquisition. The $10.2 million increase in interest expense includes $4 million of incremental net interest expense we incurred on long-term debt and other financing arrangements to fund the transaction. Because of the unique nonrecurring nature of these 2 charges, we removed them from our operating -- from our normalized results. 
The remaining $6.2 million of incremental interest expense primarily relates to the financing for our acquisition of Elmer's, which we completed last fall. 
Our normalized tax rate was 27.2%, effectively flat to last year's rate. Normalized EPS, which excludes restructuring and other project costs, was $0.40, an 11.1% increase to last year despite the loss of a little under $0.02 contribution from Venezuela last year. 
As Mike mentioned, backing out last year's Venezuela earnings contribution, normalized EPS grew 17.6% in the quarter. 
On a reported basis, first quarter EPS was $0.15 compared to $0.20 last year, with the largest driver of the decline being the Jarden transaction and financing costs, which I mentioned a few minutes ago. 
Looking at our segment results, starting with Writing. Reported first quarter net sales increased 10.8% to $378.8 million. Core sales increased 8.8%, with double-digit growth in North America as well as in Latin America. We continue to drive strong POS in the U.S., thanks to the combined impact of increased A&P and robust merchandising efforts. 
Q1 normalized operating margin in our Writing segment was 22.8%, a 150 basis point decline from last year, which was mostly the result of the seasonality of Elmer's with its relatively low sales contribution in the first quarter compared with incremental fixed cost contribution. 
Net sales in our Home Solutions segment grew 2.1% to $372.1 million. Core sales increased 3.6% due to strong growth in the Rubbermaid Food Storage and Beverage Wear businesses. This more than offset our continued exit of portions of the low margin Consumer Storage business. Home Solutions normalized operating margin was 10.2%, a 40 basis point decline from 2015 as our step-up in advertising and promotion more than offset the benefits of productivity and lower input costs. 
Our Tools segment delivered net sales of $179.7 million, a 40 basis point decline. Core sales grew 4%. Tools turned in solid performance in North America, Asia and EMEA, partially offset by continuing challenges in Brazil. Normalized operating margin in the Tools segment was 10.8%, a 150 basis point decline, which is driven by increased investments in advertising and promotion and continuing FX challenges in Brazil, more than offsetting productivity and pricing. 
Reported net sales in our Commercial Products segment declined 5.8% to $174.5 million. Core sales increased 90 basis points, driven by pricing and volume growth in EMEA and Asia, with relatively flat performance in North America and Latin America, primarily due to the timing of sales. 
Recall that Commercial Products turned in almost 10% core growth in the first quarter of '15, making this a challenging comp. Commercial Products normalized operating margin was 13%, a 350 basis point increase to last year due to pricing, productivity and input cost benefits and overhead savings from Project Renewal. 
Finally, our Baby segment reported $209.8 million in net sales, a 9.2% increase compared to last year. Core sales grew 9.3%. And we continue to benefit from positive momentum in the U.S. and Japan, driven by new innovative products. 
Baby's normalized operating margin was 11%, up 460 basis points to last year, largely due to improvements in gross margin attributable to productivity, together with lower investment in advertising and promotion as a result of timing of spend. 
Looking at our Q1 core sales by geography. As Mike mentioned, all 4 of our regions grew core sales, with North America leading the pack at 5.8%. In EMEA, core sales grew 3.6%. Latin America core sales grew 5.5%, with our Writing business delivering double-digit growth, more than overcoming challenges in the Tools business in Brazil. And finally, Asia Pacific, core sales grew 7.4%. 
With respect to cash, we used $270.9 million in operating cash last quarter compared with a use of $154.3 million in the prior year. Now we had a number of unique items in the first quarter, including a $58 million tax payment associated with our gain on the sale of Endicia last year, about $92 million of payments associated with locking benchmark treasury rates late last year and early this year in connection with our $8 billion public debt issuance last month, and about $32 million of higher incentive compensation paid in March relating to our performance in 2015. 
We returned $53.3 million to shareholders in Q1 in the form of dividends and our share repurchases were limited to restricted stock vesting as we suspended the repurchase of shares midway through the fourth quarter of last year in light of the Jarden transaction. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Mike."

Both companies entered into the transaction with terrific momentum. We delivered these strong results while simultaneously completing the most transformative transaction in our respective histories. 
Newell Brands will be one of the leading consumer goods companies in the world with pro forma 2016 revenue of about $16 billion. We have a strong portfolio of household brands that reach consumers every day, where they live, learn, work and play. 
Newell Brands more than doubles our size in key strategic retailers and geographies. And we expect scale to enable strong sustained growth through broadened channel cross-sell, accelerated international deployment and strengthened category leadership as we extend the best capabilities from both companies across the full portfolio. 
Our growth will be fueled by making the new company leaner and more efficient and by focusing our investments on the businesses with the greatest potential. Over the next 3 to 4 years, we expect to unlock the financial capacity for growth, margin development and cash flow yield through the delivery of at least $500 million in cost synergies and $300 million in Project Renewal savings. Over 80% of the combined $800 million in cost synergies and savings will flow to margin, with the balance being reinvested in capabilities and brand support. 
By 2018, we expect to have built a very profitable company with annual EBITDA of nearly $3.5 billion and EBITDA margins of over 20%. The company will be very cash generative. Between 2016 and 2018, we expect to generate $5.5 billion to $6 billion in cumulative operating cash flow. After capital investment in dividends, we expect to have about $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion of unallocated free cash flow available for debt repayment. This assumes no material improvement of working capital, reduction in the blended tax rate or any divestitures. 
Our first priority for capital allocation will be to put the cash to work deleveraging the company to our target leverage ratio range of 3x to 3.5x. By the end of 2018, we expect to have used about $2 billion to $2.4 billion of the available unallocated free cash flow to pay down our $1.5 billion term loan and most of the $900 million of fixed debt maturities available in that time period. 
Assuming run rate synergies of $500 million, we expect to enter our leverage ratio range by the end of 2017. Assuming phased synergies, we expect to enter our target leverage ratio range by the middle of 2018. This view on deleveraging, of course, is contingent upon our delivery of our underlying business plans. 
This morning, we established Newell Brands' guidance for 2016. We expect full year core sales growth in 2016 of 3% to 4%. We define core sales to include the negative impact of product line exits, but exclude the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions until their first anniversary and divestitures from the point of decision to sell the asset. 
Our guidance assumes legacy Jarden core sales are counted as part of Newell Brands' core sales from April 15, 2016 forward and are also in the same year ago comparison period. Our guidance also assumes that the Waddington Group and Jostens become part of core sales, starting in August 2016 and November 2016, respectively. 
Our Newell Brands' full year guidance assumes 2% to 4% core sales growth on the legacy Jarden businesses for quarters 2 through 4 and 4% to 5% core sales growth on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid businesses for the full year. The core sales growth guidance on the legacy Jarden business is roughly equivalent to the Jarden long-standing organic growth guidance of 3% to 5% since their definition of organic sales excluded the negative impact of product line exits and included the positive impact of tuck-in acquisitions. Over the next 2 to 3 years, we expect to exit product lines with roughly $250 million to $300 million of revenue across both businesses. 
Our Newell Brands 2016 core sales growth guidance contemplates some portion of these product line exits occurring in 2016. We expect to cover any lost normalized operating income, which we expect to be minimal, within our normalized EPS guidance. 
We expect 2016 full year normalized EPS of $2.75 to $2.90. This guidance assumes a weighted average annual share count of 430 million shares, roughly 270 million shares for the first 15 weeks of the year and 497 million shares for the balance of the year. 
Importantly, because of the share count differential by quarter, with Q1 and Q2 lower than our run rate, our full year normalized EPS guidance will be greater than the sum of the normalized EPS for each quarter. 
Our 2016 normalized EPS guidance range is the following assumptions built in: $50 million to $80 million of cost synergies, a blended effective tax rate of 29% to 30%, and beginning in the second quarter of 2016, Newell Brands will exclude the amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisitions, including the Jarden acquisition from our calculation of normalized EPS. 
There are 2 key factors that could influence the delivery of the 2016 full year guidance. The first is business unit execution of their business plans. Both companies are on track to deliver at the midpoint of the legacy ranges that underpin the Newell Brands' full year core sales growth guidance. That means legacy Jarden at 3% core sales growth and legacy Newell Rubbermaid at 4.5% core sales growth. 
The second factor that could influence full year guidance is the Project Renewal savings built into the legacy Newell Rubbermaid plans and the delivery of cost synergies associated with the combination. 
Through the end of the first quarter, Project Renewal program today cost savings totaled $395 million and we delivered $35 million in savings in the first quarter. We're in full flight on Project Renewal and are well on our way to deliver over $100 million in savings that are built into our 2016 business plans. 
Our work on cost synergies related to the combination is also in full flight. We have a clear line of sight to the 2016 cost synergies of $50 million to $80 million assumed in our normalized EPS guidance range. 
While you should not expect us to provide quarterly guidance going forward, I will provide some detail today that should help you think through the math on normalized EPS for Q2 2016 and Q1 2017. 
In the second quarter of 2016, the share count will not reflect the run rate for the balance of the year. The Q2 share count will be a blend of 270 million shares for the first 15 days of the quarter and 497 million shares for the balance of the quarter, [indiscernible] to a weighted average share count of approximately 460 million shares. 
In the first quarter of 2017, while there will be a step-up in our year-over-year income related to legacy Jarden, growth on legacy Newell, cost synergies and Project Renewal savings, these benefits will be more than offset by a substantial year-over-year interest expense increase related to the transaction, the dilutive effect of nearly 230 million share increase in share count versus the prior year and by the fact that Q1 is a seasonally smaller quarter for the legacy Jarden business. 
Despite the Q1 2017 dilution of normalized EPS versus Q1 2016, we expect the creation of Newell Brands to deliver at least high single-digit accretion over the company's first 12 months. 
So to close, we've had a great start to the year, 5.6% core sales growth, 11.1% normalized earnings per share growth, 25% earnings per share growth on a currency-neutral basis and we start 2016 right where we expected to be on both businesses in the first quarter. 
We've established new guidance for Newell Brands with core sales growth of between 3% to 4% and normalized earnings per share of $2.75 to $2.90. This earnings range represents strong double-digit accretion in 2016 and at least high single-digit accretion on a forward-looking 12-month basis. 
We've established clear capital allocation priorities, with debt repayment as our most important priority after capital investment and dividends. We have a clear line of sight to achieving our stated leverage ratio targets within 2 to 3 years at the latest. And after we get back into our target leverage range, our highly cash generative business will be put to work, complementing what is a strong organic agenda with value creating investment of unallocated capital. 
Our 2 organizations are coming together quite well, and I look forward to next week when the leaders from across Newell Brands will meet to start the journey toward unleashing the power of our new company. We're a $16 billion consumer goods company with leading brands that reach consumers every day where they live, learn, work and play. Brands that compete in large, growing global categories that are unconsolidated. And as a result, offer tremendous market share consolidation potential. The creation of Newell Brands more than doubles our scale in key retailers and geographies and scale will enable sustained, strong levels of growth, especially when coupled with the broader application of our brand development, design and innovation capabilities. $800 million in savings and cost synergies will provide the fuel for top line and earnings growth and for further investment in our capabilities and our people. 
As I've said since the announcement of the transaction in December, we were 2 strong companies with very competitive performance and value creation track records that have now come together to create one great company. Together, we'll be stronger. Together, we'll be bigger and grow faster than our competitors. Together, we are Newell Brands. 
And with that, I'd like to open it up to questions."

We've hit the ground running on the corporate duplication work obviously with Martin, Ian and Jim moving into new roles. And we've begun the work in other corporate roles as well, with changes happening very quickly and more changes to come over the next number of weeks. The procurement teams are geared up and running.

It's all built into our guidance, but I think this is going to be a tough year for our Tools business in Brazil. We've had light [ph] challenges on the Jarden side of our business. That said, both companies have done well in Latin America in the first quarter despite, in the case of legacy Newell, the absence of Venezuela in the numbers and the challenges in Brazil. Newell's core growth in Brazil was actually down materially in the first quarter. So despite that, delivered 5.5% growth and Jarden has had some similar challenges there. I will say, within the Jarden numbers, one of the standout performances in the first quarter was JCS. So despite having a footprint that intersects with those dynamics that I was describing in Brazil, the business, in aggregate, did quite well."

So we've been, obviously, as you would imagine, we've been engaged, Bill and Mark, in particular, Russ Torres, Rich Sansone, really engaged in getting up to speed on the Jarden businesses over the last number of months to the degree that we could, and since the 15th, in much greater depth. And the teams -- in fact, all the teams from across Newell and legacy Newell and legacy Jarden are together next week for the week. And we're really going to dive on each other's businesses. So we're going to share and we're going to learn, we're going to connect. We're going to get into this in a lot greater detail as we try to build out one integrated company leadership team. So that's very exciting. It will be fun on the social side, but more importantly, we'll get into the details of the business. Jarden has had some really good momentum. As I mentioned, JCS had good growth in the first quarter, on great growth year-ago period, double-digit growth year ago and very good growth in the first quarter on top of that. Yankee, again, double-digit growth the year ago period. Great growth in the first quarter on top of that. So we've got some decent momentum in some of the most important assets that are in the Jarden portfolio. And as you can tell from our numbers, we've got similar momentum in our most strategically critical businesses like Writing. So we feel terrific. We're right where we expected to be in the combination and we're excited by the possibilities. And we're going go through the work over the summer of establishing portfolio priorities, just like we did when we got to Newell Rubbermaid. And obviously, JCS and Yankee will be priority businesses for us going forward with Writing and with Food & Beverage and the likely suspects that you're familiar with from the former Newell businesses. But we'll go through that rigorous process of establishing portfolio of priorities through the summer. We've got a board meeting in a couple of weeks where we'll expose our approach to the board. And then by the August board meeting, we'll be ready to lock in our portfolio prioritization choices and you should expect resources to align to those priorities. And we'll invest heavily on the businesses with the greatest potential, the greatest right to win, and we'll ask the other businesses to win differently, to win in different ways than by leveraging the big investments in brand development and design and in innovation that we'll place in our priority businesses. So you should expect that logic that drove the choices within Newell Rubbermaid to drive the choices in the combined Newell Brands. That said, all businesses have to grow, all businesses have to grow ahead of their markets, growth is the engine that powers the company and it's really critical for our teams to embrace that. And I -- based on what I've seen, I think that's going to be a really easy thing for us to land as an integrated company. The values of the operational intensity that underpins things that we've done over the last few years are clearly in place on the Jarden businesses. So I'm quite optimistic about there not being any cultural or social issues with us getting aligned on how we intend to operate. With respect to synergies, obviously, synergies are going to flow to margin. The work on Rubbermaid that's still left to do, the $300 million of savings we hope to get roughly $300 million. Half of that will flow into investment. Where we put those investment bets, I'm quite agnostic about that. The fact that the savings are coming from -- that we would invest back are coming from legacy Newell Rubbermaid doesn't mean that the spending will happen there. So we're going to make sure that our strategy yields a set of outcomes that are greater than the sum of the parts. So we're going to take money and put it on the businesses with the greatest right to win. So I feel great about where we are in these really early stages. Everybody is sprinting. We're excited by the possibilities and energized by the work ahead."

So as you know, our inclination is to get into these businesses and choose to fix them rather than either sell them or exit them. In certain cases, within our last 5-year history at Newell Rubbermaid, we've made the choice to exit as we did in Europe. It was a critical enabler -- the exits we took on in Europe were critical enablers to us getting the cost structure down, particularly in our distribution and transportation networks. And so and as you know, the profitability went from less than $10 million in Europe in 2009 to over $100 million in Europe as a result of some of those choices. Now of course, those savings come out because of those integrated choices on exits and on reprioritizing portfolio choices. We're going to likely phase into similar dynamics within the Jarden business. And while it's premature to specifically call out businesses that we would exit because our inclination is to, first, go fix, over the summer as we get more opportunity to connect with you, we'll bring and shine a brighter light on the specifics that underpin the headline. It was important for us to lay that out for you so that you understood the core sales growth guidance and didn't misread the dynamics that are embedded within it. So we'll see how this all plays out. There certainly are some assets on the Newell Rubbermaid side that we'd consider exiting as well. And if we got to the point where we made that choice, the first question we'd ask is, could we sell them rather than exit them? But given that it's early and that we wanted to set course on [ph] guidance expectations, we felt it appropriate to articulate the boundaries around the product line exits that we may choose to implement."

On Commercial Products, we've pulled back the spending to roughly 3%, 3.5% of revenue and I think that's where you should expect us to keep it unless we have some big news there that we want to punctuate. As you know, we've learned that doing anthematic advertising didn't work, that we were better to advertise new items in the news, and that's where our advertising on Tools has been focused as we've launched new items in the back half of 2015 that have flowed into 2016. But we're going to continue to ask questions about this because particularly in the light of the broader portfolio, because they're businesses like Yankee, they're businesses like the appliance business, there's some other aspects of the Jarden portfolio that we feel could benefit from increased A&P support. So as we go through the process of making the portfolio choices across the total portfolio, some of those priorities that we had placed in legacy Newell may change as we take on a broader -- we broaden our perspective on the businesses with the greatest potential. And so some of that money that might have historically been spent on Tools could very well find their way to being spent on Yankee or on appliance launches or on any number of other businesses that have interesting things going on. So -- and I think you should keep an open mind as to how we go through the process over the next few weeks and months towards probably a late summer articulation of those priorities to the broader market. And you will see us reallocate resources based on them, both human capital and money."

So Steve, there's 3 kind of questions there. I'll deal with the first one, which is on -- I think your question was focused on the Jarden businesses, but I'll give you my perspective on both with respect to the flow of growth through the year. And then I'll let John answer the questions on amortization and then I'll come back on the process. So as you know, Jarden's Q1 are really -- is really a pretty light quarter with respect to its overall impact on the total trajectory of the business. The year ago numbers, if you look at the year ago numbers that they're bridging, first quarter a year ago, I think, had 4.8% organic growth; second quarter, 6%; third -- it was 6% or 7%? 7%. And then 6% in the third quarter; and about 2% in the fourth quarter. And so the year ago comparators are tougher in the first 3 quarters than they are in the balance of the year. That said, growth on the Jarden businesses should pick up through the year as they historically have. And as I've said, we've got good momentum, and obviously a little bit of an easier comp in Q4 than we do in the early part of the year. Q4, obviously, most important quarter for Jarden. And I think we're well positioned and the teams are well positioned to nail the activities that have to be hit -- executed in that window to deliver the outcomes. Of course, weather is always a variable in the fourth quarter for their businesses, and so we won't count on anything other than normal weather conditions. But I think we're in a good position to land right in the middle of that guidance range we've articulated. On the Newell side, we've got terrific momentum. I think we -- particularly in the Writing business where ex-Venezuela a year ago our growth was probably around 6.5-ish percent and to nail 8.8% in the first quarter, without the benefit of Venezuela, is a sign of building momentum. We've launched all of our new items earlier in the year than we did last year. We've got interesting momentum now building on the Rubbermaid brand behind the launch of FreshWorks and Fasten&Go, we've got a great launch coming in the back half of the year. So the year has the potential to be the Renaissance year for the Rubbermaid brand. So we're excited about that. We've got ongoing momentum on beverages. Baby put in another terrific quarter with 9% -- over 9% core growth. And Tools came in stronger quite frankly than we expected. Commercial was probably a little softer than we expected. It's timing related. But in aggregate, a 5.6% growth in the first quarter is great, probably one of our strongest quarters in a long, long time. And given the underlying momentum being driven by new products and strengthened investment behind the brands, we're encouraged that, that should be able to continue. We've guided to the middle of the guidance range on Newell Rubbermaid, and we'll see, if things continue as they did in Q1, maybe there's some upside to that. But we'll have to see how the full year plays out. It's a little too early to get too excited, although I'd much rather start the way we did than not. So in aggregate, we're feeling pretty darn good about where we're at. We -- our expectations for the Jarden performance in the first quarter were virtually right in line with them. The complexion, obviously, within in any of these businesses, by business, how the numbers aggregate out is always a little bit different than you expect, but that's sort of the normal and natural flow.

That information, that work, that thinking will all inform the portfolio choice activities that we'll go through, through the summer. This is an analytic process. It's not subjective, so we're going to look at market mapping globally. We're going to look at -- we've begun this work. We're going to look at market and category growth rates globally. We'll look at the strength of brands by geography. We've got that research in flight already to understand where the brands have leverage. And the intersection of people's thinking on the businesses with the broad analytic macro view of geography, category and channel dynamics, plus brand strength will inform -- and the competitive strength will inform where we place our bets. And obviously, margins and financial attractiveness contribute to that whole bit of analysis. So there'll be lots of folks inputting. There'll be a few folks that are doing the analytical rigor through the summer. End of June, my team will get together for a week, my direct team, to talk about the results, talk about the path forward. And that strategic work will be refined through July to the August board meeting, and then we'll probably come public with bits of that in early September. And then all of our choices will be -- for '17 will be informed by that piece of work. So you should expect us to be reallocating resources to the businesses with the highest potential as part of our 2017 planning process."

Maybe our business models are -- our business models were quite different. But when you -- when I engage with Jarden folks -- we went out last night after getting ready for this call to -- there's a little pub around the corner. We were watching the draft. And there was a group of Newell people and a group of Jarden people there. And they were -- there was the same dynamic as if this group had been together for a long time. This is a pretty operationally intense group of leaders that I've met so far, and so I don't think that's going to be the issue. The business models are different. So I think socializing the changes associated with that in the places where we choose to make change, I think will be -- shouldn't be underestimated, but it won't be governed by culture. Our performance expectations -- expectations are high for the combined entity. And so we all have to raise the bar. The performance that we've delivered over the last number of years, while it's been pretty darn good relative to the industry and if you look at Martin's and team's track record on value creations, way at the top of the league table. But the combination, we've said that we're going to be stronger together than either of us were apart and that's the rationale for the deal. So expectations are high. Our performance needs to rise. Our expectations of each other need to be really high. And we will -- we need to align around that. I think that's probably one of the most important bits of change management that has to happen quickly that looking backwards and judging performances cannot be a forward-looking basis for what great looks like. Great has to look better than what we've done as individual companies in the past. And so we're going to raise the bar on each other and we're going to establish great clarity around what outcomes we're looking for. Growth is the engine that powers this company, and it has to be going forward. We're going to get great margin development through the synergies and by maximizing the mix through portfolio -- the portfolio choices we work. But growth is undoubtedly the engine that's going to fire this company going forward. And we've guided 3% to 4%, which I think will be competitive results given the exits we'll likely embrace. But going forward, I think we can consistently deliver at the high end of that range once we get through this transitional period. And we need to put the building blocks in place as a company to deliver that, to sustain that and maybe even beyond that going forward. And so that's the change management piece of work that needs to happen. That's the social -- that's the messaging that needs to be embraced, and people need to make the choice as to whether they're ready to enlist and line up behind that ambition, which I think, based on what I see, it's going to be no problem. It's going to be very exciting. It's going to be also a lot of fun."

We talked about some of them outside. Depending on the rate of exits, some of that maybe -- may get masked in those numbers, but we haven't built really any of that into the guidance we've provided at this point. So to the degree that we can get that quickly, we'll get some upsides to the numbers or maybe we get to the high end of the range if we get the revenue synergies to start to track. You think about the revenue synergies, there are 3 buckets: cross-sell, the opportunity for cross-sell, the opportunity for accelerated international deployment and the opportunity to lead at the category level by applying the best of both companies' capabilities to the category growth agenda. Those 3 are listed in the relative speed with which they are accessible. So channel cross-sell is accessible to us pretty much immediately. It's just a question of getting customer alignment around taking assets from one business and putting them into channels that other businesses have access to. We're divesting -- the most telegraphic example of that is the commentary we've shared on beverages, taking Contigo, and Avex and Rubbermaid and thinking about which portions of that portfolio are most relevant to the outdoor channel and leveraging Coleman's selling systems to get -- and giving Coleman credit for selling the assets, quite frankly. But letting them sell down their vertical brands like -- particularly Avex and Contigo, I would guess, and maybe bubba. And so that's an example of one thing that's available to us. And there are many, many, many others like that. Those things come early. International cross-sell probably takes us 6 to 9 months, maybe a little longer to get activated. And then just like the work that happened at Newell Rubbermaid, it took us 18 to 24 months to get a growth yield on the application of Newell's brand development, design and innovation model. And where we apply that model within the Jarden portfolio, I would expect it takes that long to get impact as well. So there's a sequence to these 3 different buckets of revenue synergies, with channel cross-sell offering the greatest opportunity in the near term."

The Q1 growth rate that the legacy Jarden business had to comp was about 4.7%. One of the big reasons this gets easier going forward is because of the uncertainty, the veil of uncertainty that comes with a transaction like this that was overhanging the Jarden team in the first quarter goes away. We become human, accessible and involved. And so don't underestimate the impact of that on a business' ability to execute. So that's certainly an overhang in Q1, and that's why we were quite conservative and both businesses quite conservative in the way they thought about underlying performance. We've got momentum where it counts on the Jarden business right now. You've got momentum in Yankee. You've got momentum in JCS. Within some of the other segments or groups, you've got businesses that are looking quite interesting at the moment. You have some other factors that overhang the first quarter, like the impact of a different kind of weather experience in the winter sports area. And that's just the reality of Mother Nature that we've got to deal with. And so that clearly has some impact on some of the businesses. And while I won't get into very specific business unit numbers today, you can expect us going forward, as we get into this, to punctuate the specifics for you on a forward-looking basis. So why do things accelerate going forward? Things accelerate going forward because the uncertainty and the overhang on the organization connected to the combination of Newell and Jarden is behind us. We build enthusiasm behind the combination and the potential for Newell Brands. We engage and get into the details of their business and think about how we optimize the deployment of resources across the total portfolio, that we plus up the winners and keep leaning our shoulders into them with more resource. We don't give up much, I don't think, in certain other areas within Newell Rubbermaid, if we were to shift resources around and lean our shoulder into a couple of Jarden businesses. And then we get on with fixing some of the businesses that are underperforming. And while I won't get into the specifics within the Jarden portfolio, that is just a little bit premature to be talking about that sort of stuff publicly. We're going to get in. We do profit interventions when they're required. We did it on Baby. We did it on Europe within Newell Rubbermaid. We were very public that we were doing it. And you can count on us to articulate those when we're ready to. But those -- think about the Baby business, the Baby business was declining 10% in the first half of 2011 and then it was flat on the full year, and we got that business back to 10% compounded growth in 2012, 2013. Last year, we grew 6-plus percent in that business, last 2 quarters around 9%. So when you get involved and get into the details and you unpack issues, you can fix them. And so there's a couple of businesses like that, that require some intervention on the Jarden side, and there are a couple businesses on the Newell side that we're involved with. We've talked about Tools and it's starting to yield the outcomes we hoped. And we'll keep our eye and apply the pressure and get involved and help resolve some of the issues wherever they exist. And so it's the combination of those things that give us the confidence that we can get right smack dab in the middle of the guidance range for the full year."

You look at the inventory days you say, ""Man, there's an opportunity in both companies."" There is a structural difference, so you cannot benchmark companies that source finished goods against companies that are 100% self-manufactured. You're never going to get the inventory days to kind of match up. So you're naturally going to be longer. And the reason that obviously makes sense is you don't have to fix the assets in your manufacturing base. So you accept a longer working capital hit on inventory days for the sake of avoiding a fixed asset base. So they're always going to be longer. Do they need to be as long as they are? Absolutely not. There's absolutely no reason that we can't do better than we have up until now on the Newell Rubbermaid side forecasting our business and having the confidence to call the upside and managing the flow of product along the entire value chain into inventories. So we've got work going on with respect to complexity reduction, which will be an enabler to getting inventories down. But we haven't really leaned our shoulder into that yet. I think we have an opportunity to extend payables as well on both sides and we're going to focus on that as part of our procurement work. So we have a lot of leverage to pull on working capital. Cash matters a ton. It always has, but it really does over the next couple of years and it always should. Because cash going forward, once we get delevered, becomes the complementary investment tool we've got to strengthen our aggregate performance on top of what we hope to be a very strong organic performance. And so it matters a ton. We're going to do this. This is the bit that we haven't focused on as much as we could, and we're going to get it right.

So that's fine and progressing and Kristie and Vic Misawa who are the -- Kristie Juster, who is the President of Writing segment; and Vic Misawa, who's the SVP of Writing Brand Development, are working hand in hand to get that -- to get the launch to occur. So that's right on track. With respect to Writing margins, we're going to continue to invest in Writing. The Elmer's, I'll have to make sure Nancy gets back to you on what exactly the Elmer's impact has been on margin for the Writing segment. It's pretty material. And the other thing that you have to remember is that in our public numbers, we have Venezuela in the year-ago period. And in the current period, we don't. The Venezuelan margins were higher than fleet average margins. So I wouldn't want you to think about this as us being willing to accept margin decline. These are structural mix-related issues in the year-over-year numbers. We hold people accountable for margin development on a pegged rate basis. So while we report at actual rates, we -- people's incentive structures are based in constant currency, and we're doing fine in that respect. Although I will tell you that as we extend the shoulders of the business into new geographies, there's going to be an A&P investment requirement that will dilute operating margins for a period of time. But you know how we operate. We're happy to do that for a period of time if we're getting the growth yield. And we'll pull that money out and move it somewhere else at some point in the future. You saw that on the Baby business in terms of the operating margin development of Baby in the first quarter. There's also a currency-related impact given how we source componentry related to the yen/dollar that's impacting gross margins. We don't want to price for that. So we've got -- there are some inside baseball things that contributed to that, that are sort of external factor related that we don't always choose to price to recover. So I'm not stressed about Writing margins at all. We've got a big project going on in Writing complexity that will enhance margins going forward -- gross margins going forward. And I think that's probably something that we should illuminate for you guys going -- over the next 6 to 9 months. But we've talk about Writing complexity, but to understand the manufacturing footprint, the changes we're making there might bring some color to the margin development forward-looking story."

I'd say the majority will be on the Jarden side, but it's not an unsubstantial amount that potentially could be on Newell Rubbermaid side. So you know we’re continuing to do the work on Consumer Storage. So we're not done with that yet. There are some aspects of our Baby business that could benefit us to pull back on. So there's bits and pieces. There's some things in consumer cleaning within the Rubbermaid brand. As we get Rubbermaid more focused around food storage, food preservation, food on the go where the margins -- we have to go through the full work of understanding how costs get allocated in the business to understand the real underlying profitability and the cash impact of these businesses. But those are all areas that we're going to intensely focus on to understand whether certain aspects of the Rubbermaid business might be better served exiting and Baby as well. So still some opportunity in Baby Europe in particular. So these are things we'd go after. And on the Jarden side, I just don't want to declare too early until we get into this a little bit more deeply with them. But there are perspectives we've got coming out of the first couple of weeks and a couple of months prior to that, that are worth reflecting on."

And it sounds like you've got specific plans and timing for completing that work and articulating it to us and all of that kind of stuff. So I'm a little surprised that you would tell us a number at all at this point because I would think that if anything that number, let's call it $200 million of product line exits from Jarden, is it risk of going up significantly? And I'm curious as to why you chose to give us that number today because I would imagine the product line impact in the second quarter is going to be relatively minimal. And it just seems like it's a number that's -- could be awfully premature."

We build them from bottom-up. And so we have a pretty clear sense of what we do. I just think it would be premature to declare that. These are businesses that are probably unsellable. That doesn't mean there aren't other businesses that you might think about from a portfolio management perspective going forward. So it's just one piece of the puzzle. And then as I said, our inclinations to try to fix businesses, so this doesn't mean this is -- these are the only businesses that are margin challenged. So then the question becomes why share that this early? Because I want to set guidance expectations on core sales growth and because of how we define core sales growth versus how organic sales growth was defined. It's important for us to pivot from the 3% to 5% organic guidance to the 2% to 4% core guidance on the Jarden businesses and explain that and give you the reasons why we're doing that, and that's because organic sales excluded the impact of product line exits and core sales includes the impact of product line exits. So being explicit in saying that we were exiting $250 million to $300 million of business over the next 2 to 3 years gives you some ability to understand -- a better ability to understand the core sales assumptions and not get freaked out about the fact that we might be guiding down on Jarden. We're not at all doing that. What we're doing is we're going to -- saying we're going to get to one approach to guiding underlying performance in the business which is the core sales number. And that's the mechanism by which we do it. So a fair question though, Wendy, and I appreciate it, respect it and you can count on us to get quite specific shortly."

So you've got a different scenario where you've got both Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden legacy businesses growing nicely. So the context is a little bit different. The application of the capability agenda is going to be really exciting. I think the work that the legacy Jarden folks have done on direct-to-consumer e-commerce is really exciting. I just got an email from Hope Margala's team on Yankee Candle, and I called my daughters right away because you can customize a Yankee Candle jar with pictures of your family for Mother's Day. I was like, ""Girls, we got to -- if we want to get it delivered by Mother's Day, we got to do it this weekend."" And that's just brilliant, and we don't do that. We weren't thinking that creatively on a direct-to-consumer e-commerce front. And so there's some stuff on that side that's so applicable. I just got -- I ordered -- one of the first things I did was order a built online -- a customized Rawlings baseball mitt, and I just got it 2 weeks ago. And it's so exciting. My wife saw it. My wife doesn't even know anything about baseball, wants a baseball mitt customized for her. So I mean, there's some really exciting things that Jarden has done that we haven't been that creative about on the Newell Rubbermaid side. So we have tremendous opportunity to apply that capability. On the other side, we have a terrific design and innovation machine going now on Newell Rubbermaid. 5.6% core sales growth is a big number when 75% of your revenue is in the U.S. and U.S. GDP growth is 0.5%. Now why are we growing 5.6%? It's because we've got these innovations that are coming through the funnel and hitting the marketplace with impact. We can apply that capability to many aspects of the Jarden portfolio and you should expect us to apply that. Now that's the Newell playbook working for Jarden and the Jarden playbook working for Newell. So the best of both capabilities applied across the total portfolio is what we're going to go do with a real passion around brands and growth. This idea that growth is the engine that fires this company is really important for people to embrace. And we mean growth through brilliant commercial execution and through brilliant brand development, and we're going to do both of those. And I think when we're done and we look back with the benefit of 3 or 4, 5, 6, 7 years, we'll say, man, we really did do what we said by taking the best of both talent pools and the best of both capabilities and applying them as broadly as they are relevant across the portfolio. It doesn't mean -- and we're more sophisticated than this. It does not mean that every capability is applicable to every business, and that's fine. And it doesn't disable the scale leverage that we've got through the combination when you accept that. It's just smart management. And so you should expect us to push hard to make the company leaner and meaner, to scale functions for efficiency in the business partnering areas and to scale functions for impact across the total enterprise for growth. And -- but we're going to maintain intimacy at the point of demand creation, which is where the selling happens and where the consumer engages with our brands. And if you step back from design types of concepts and focus on principles, that's the type of thing that will inform choices -- on specific design choices. And that's what's going to drive us. This is a company -- when we get the brand research back from this summer, I suspect -- and when we expose it to you, you're going to be blown away by the quality of the brands in this portfolio. I was within Newell Rubbermaid relative to brands I'd worked on before, and I've worked on great brands. I've worked on Oreo, I've worked on Dove, I worked on AXE, I worked on Ritz, I've worked on Maxwell House. I've worked on great brands, Kraft. So -- but these brands are really way stronger than people perceive them to be. And I suspect that when we get the brand equity work back on brands like Oster and brands like Yankee and brands like Rawlings, brands like Coleman, you'll see these great assets. Some of them perhaps latent and under-leveraged but great assets, just like we saw on Newell Rubbermaid, Graco. Graco is by far the highest equity score of any brand I've worked on, higher than Dove. So my energy level is really high because I'm so excited by unlocking the possibilities here with the teams. And I'm really excited by the prospects of us applying the best of what both companies have to offer across the total portfolio."

And we'll realign, obviously, the portfolio choices to the new portfolio. So yes is the answer on that piece of the question. Your question on 2017 guidance, we haven't guided 2017 growth. I will tell you, though, that the $250 million to $300 million of exits that we've talked about were over 2 to 3 years. And if you do the math on that, you'd see that those exits will govern the opportunity to break out on the high end probably through 2017. So what is the right long term guidance? We haven't gotten to that yet. I want to go through the work over the summer. We'll pull together an integrated forward-looking model that gives you that long-term guidance.

Newell undertakes no responsibility to update any forward-looking statements. 
Let me remind you also that we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures today, including those identified in the tables of the earnings press release. We provide these non-GAAP measures because management believes that providing insights on the measures discussed enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results. Specifically, the biggest differences between the GAAP and non-GAAP metrics this quarter are onetime charges and other expenses related to the Jarden transaction, including inventory step-up, acquisition-related amortization and other transaction costs. In addition, we're defining Newell Brands core sale as if the Jarden combination occurred at April 15 of last year, meaning we are including last year's Jarden results in our 2015 base. Waddington, Jostens and Elmer's are not included in core sales until their respective 1-year anniversaries. The reconciliations of these and other non-GAAP measures with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP are included in the earnings release and are available on our website.

I'm very pleased to report a strong set of second quarter results with positive momentum on the number of fronts. We drove very competitive levels of growth in the quarter, cost synergies and product renewal savings of ramping and right we expected them to be; and cash flow was strong, enabling us to pay down $750 million of our $1.5 billion term loan. So a strong start as Newell Brands, and as a consequence, we reaffirmed full year guidance this morning. 
The Q2 headlines are as follows: net sales have more than doubled as a result of the Jarden transaction to $3.86 billion. Core sales grew 5%, led by strong performances in Writing, Baby and Parenting, Food and Beverage, Yankee Candle and Appliances. On both a reported and normalized basis, gross margins and operating margins were right in line with our expectations. Reported EPS was $0.30 per diluted share. Normalized EPS was $0.78, up nearly 22% versus prior year. And operating cash flow was nearly $600 million. So all in, a very good set of second quarter results with continued momentum in our key businesses and a lot of energy and excitement around the opportunities ahead.

As Mike noted, we were pleased with our second quarter results, with strong reported end core sales growth. Gross and operating margin came in consistent with our expectations, and we are on track with our deleveraging plan. A strong operating cash flow allowed us to pay down about $0.75 billion in debt. Overall, a very good start. 
Turning to our detailed review. Second quarter reported net sales were $3.86 billion, 147% increase versus last year, largely contribution of the Jarden transaction. Core sales increased 5%. Reported gross margin was 28.4% compared with 39.8% in the prior year, largely due to a $334 million inventory step-up related to the Jarden transaction. There will be a similar step-up impact of around $130 million in Q3 as we expect substantially all of the remaining inventory to turn. 
Normalized gross margin was 37.2%, down 280 basis points versus last year. The decline is due to the negative mix effect from the Jarden acquisition and the consolidation of Venezuela as well as the impact of unfavorable currency, which more than offset productivity and pricing. 
Reported SG&A expense was $947 million or 24.5% of sales, down 70 basis points over last year. Normalized SG&A expense was $827 million or 21.4% of sales, down 260 basis points versus prior year, thanks to the mix impact from the inclusion of the Jarden legacy businesses, which have historically carried a lower SG&A spend rate, also benefiting from project renewable savings and early Jarden deal synergies. Advertising and promotion spending at the Newell Rubbermaid legacy businesses increased 50 basis points in the quarter, driven by incremental investments behind new products, including Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens, Mr. Sketch Scented Crayons, Rubbermaid FreshWorks Produce Saver and Graco Extend2Fit convertible car seats. 
Reported operating margin was 3.6% of sales compared with 13.8% in the prior year. The decrease was largely driven by the onetime inventory step-up, acquisition-related amortization costs and other expenses incurred in connection with a Jarden deal. Normalized operating margin declined 20 basis points to 15.8%. Interest expense of $127 million rose $109 million year-over-year, reflecting a $10 billion increase in debt, resulting from the financing of the Jarden and Elmer's transactions. 
Our reported tax rate was 20.3% compared with 22.7% in the prior year. The normalized tax rate was 29.2% compared with 24.5% in the prior year, attributable to the mix effect of the Jarden acquisition and geographic earnings. Reported EPS was $0.30 per share compared with $0.55 in the prior year due largely to a number of acquisition-related charges and expenses. We also had an increase -- an increased interest expense and a higher share count. These Jarden transaction charges were partially offset by the contribution from the Jarden and Elmer's acquisitions and a gain on the day sales of the Décor business. Normalized EPS, which excludes the transaction-related expenses, among other things, was $0.78, a 21.9% increase versus last year. The improvement was primarily driven by strong sales growth, the contribution from the Jarden and Elmer's acquisition and Project Renewal savings. These benefits more than offset increased advertising and promotion support, negative foreign currency, increased interest expense and increased shares outstanding. 
I will now move on to our segment results. Starting with Writing. Net sales increased 15.8%. Core sales increased 11.3%, driven by strong double-digit growth in North America. We had a very good start with the Back-to-School sell-in, thanks to innovation and increased advertising and promotion. 
Net sales in the Home Solutions segment decreased 1.1% as strong growth in our food and beverage business was more than offset by the negative impact of the divested Décor business and planned exits in the low-margin Consumer Storage business and unfavorable foreign currency. Core sales grew 1.7%. 
Tools net sales declined 3.8%, reflecting continued weakness in Brazil and negative foreign currency. Core sales declined 2.3% as growth in North America was offset by Brazil macro challenges and industrial sectors softness in China. 
Net sales in Commercial Products decline 7.9%, primarily due to the divestiture of the Rubbermaid Medical Cart business and unfavorable foreign currency. Core sales declined 1.4%, reflecting softness driven by complexity reduction initiatives in the North American distributor channel and in Brazil due to macro challenges in that country. 
Our Baby segment grew net sales 12.4%, thanks to continued strong momentum at Graco North America, driven by innovation and advertising and promotion. Core sales grew 11.1%. 
In my discussion of the legacy Jarden segments, I will refer to post transaction net and core sales compared against pro forma results for the same period in 2015. Post transaction net sales in branded consumables increased 36.8%, reflecting the Waddington acquisition. Core sales increased 7.8% due largely to strong growth in Yankee Candle and Home & Family in Europe. 
Net sales in Consumer Solutions increased 4.9%. Core sales increased 8.3%, driven by strong growth in kitchen appliances in North America, Europe and Latin America. Outdoor solutions net sales increased 53.6% due largely to the Jostens acquisition. Core sales increased 50 basis points, reflecting strong growth from Pure Fishing, offset by weather-related softness in its key businesses. Net sales in process solutions increased 20 basis points. Core sales increased 50 basis points. 
Let's now turn to Q2 core sales by geography. Importantly, North America, which represents 79% of total sales, delivered strong core growth of 6.7%. In EMEA, core sales grew 2.6%. Latin America core sales increased 1.9%, reflecting solid growth across the region with the exception of Brazil. Asia Pacific core sales declined 7.7% due primarily to softness in branded consumables in that region.
Moving on to cash flow. During Q2, we reported almost $600 million in operating cash flow compared with the $102 million in the prior year, reflecting the contribution from Jarden, including Jostens and Waddington, improved operating results and favorable working capital movements. We also generated $236 million from the sale of Décor. We returned $92 million in dividends to shareholders. We also paid down debt by $750 million, bringing our quarter-end debt balance down to $13 billion. We remain confident in our ability to reach our leverage goal of 3 to 3.5x in the next 2 to 3 years. So a very good start to the quarter and with progress on many important areas. 
With that, I'll now turn the call back to Mike."

Since coming together as Newell Brands, we've been hard at work getting to know each other and laying the groundwork for accelerated value-creation. Together, we have a strong portfolio of leading brands and significantly greater scale across a number of key channels, customers and geographies with the opportunity to leverage these assets in a bigger way for expanded reach, visibility, impact and growth. We've identified a number of new growth opportunities and put many into action that will materialize through channel cross-sell, accelerated international deployment and strengthened innovation delivery over time. 
We're also making very good progress on costs. As previously shared, we've committed to achieve an incremental $300 million in entrepreneurial savings over the next few years, and against that target, we've delivered $70 million in incremental savings in the first half of 2016.
We also have a clear line of sight to the $500 million of cost synergies, with significant upside potential. This synergy teams have hit the ground running and are now in full flight with early successes on procurement where we already realized $40 million in annualized savings. We're quite confident in our ability to deliver the targeted synergies given our track record of success on Project Renewal. 
We're also making good progress on developing the new strategy for Newell Brands. A few weeks ago, my leadership team spent time together discussing the choices ahead and the next steps in our transformation that will flow from that strategy. Critical decisions about portfolio roles and category and geographic priorities were at the center of our discussions. Mark Tarchetti and his team led by Russ Torres led the dialogue and much of the thinking. As you'd expect, if you're familiar with how we work, those discussions were underpinned by rigorous analysis. The insights generated will frame a set of sharp portfolio, resource allocation and organizational design choices. In early August, we'll solicit input from the Board of Directors, and with the benefit of the board's perspective incorporated, these new strategic framework will shape our activities and investment choices from 2017 forward.
Let me now turn back and take a look at the balance of 2016. This morning, we reaffirmed Newell Brands 2016 full year guidance. We continue to expect 2016 full year Newell Brands core sales growth of 3% to 4% and full year normalized EPS of $2.75 to $2.90. Despite a strong start to the year, we continued to believe that both full year guidance metrics appropriately bracket the most likely outcome for the full year, which is right in the middle of both guidance ranges. Where we actually fall in the full year guidance range will depend on 3 key factors. The first factor relates to the success of the second half 2016 prior periods of Back-to-School on Writing and the holidays on Yankee Candle. We are well positioned against both. Importantly, both businesses have leadership positions in large, growing global markets with tremendous opportunity to still capture market share both in their markets at home and in our markets abroad. Yankee and Writing also have above-fleet average margin structures, and so their performance can move the needle for Newell Brands in the meaningful way. 
On Writing, we have tremendous momentum. The latest 12-week U.S. value market share through the middle of July, as measured by IRI, is up over 140 basis points, with dollars sales growth of 7%. In Q2, Writing had an extraordinary sell-in for the Back-to-School season, delivering about $15 million more revenue in this key selling period that we anticipated. While the revenue and the associated income will reverse out in Q3, the strength of the sell-in and the programming and innovation in place bodes well for display activity and merchandising-driven sell-out in Q3. 
As we complete the Back-to-School dry period on Writing, we'll turn our attention to the holidays. The Yankee Candle team is gearing up for the holidays with strong merchandising plans and with new products under way to retail. We're pressing forward in a new effort to broaden distribution even further in the U.S. and Canada with incremental placements that leverage Newell Brands' route to market and adjacent channels that could potentially positively impact Q4 2016 and, more importantly, 2017. We're also exploring ways to enhance brand investment in the fourth quarter and certainly into 2017. Importantly, if we find ourselves with full year earnings upside beyond the midpoint of the full year normalized EPS guidance range, we will likely reinvest a substantial portion of that upside back into the Yankee Candle business for strength in consumer impact around the holidays and positive momentum into 2017. 
The second factor that could influence where we fall on the full year guidance range is the delivery of Project Renewal cost savings and the transaction cost synergies. We have a clear line of sight to the full year Project Renewal incremental savings, and as planned, we expect to deliver well over $100 million in incremental savings this year. With respect to the Jarden transaction cost synergies, we are well on our way to deliver our $50 million to $80 million full year synergy cost guidance, with a good probability of delivering towards the high end of that range. So we're on track and foresee no issues here and perhaps some opportunity. 
The third factor that could influence where we land in the full year guidance range is product line exits. To be clear, our full year guidance reflects our intention to actively manage the portfolio. In 2016, we expect to begin to exit certain product lines with roughly $250 million to $300 million of revenue over the next 2 to 3 years. These are businesses that have low to no likelihood of featuring our strategic priorities for the company. As we've stated, our goal would be to sell these assets, if possible, rather than exit, and we hope to be able to find a buyer for some. If we're unsuccessful at finding buyers, the process of exiting these businesses will begin as early as the third quarter. As mentioned previously, we do not expect a material financial impact related to potential product line exits. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, I do want to provide some context for the floor of our business in the second half. Given the likely Q3 reversal of the Writing incremental Q2 Back-to-School sell-in and the possible Q3 timing of product line exits, we expect Q3 core sales growth rate to be near the bottom of our 3% to 4% full year guidance range. In Q4, we expect growth rates to recover toward the midpoint of our full year range. We also expect normalized EPS to skew roughly 10% higher in Q4 relative to Q3 as a result of the holiday season peaking of the profitable Yankee Candle business. 
So in closing, we've had a strong start to the year on many fronts. We successfully completed the most transformative deal in the history of either Newell Rubbermaid or Jarden. Despite the potential for distraction and the transaction of this size could create, we grew core sales 5% and delivered normalized EPS growth of nearly 22% in the second quarter. We've made good early progress in the integration of the 2 companies while simultaneously taking a big step forward on Project Renewal. With the continued positive momentum in our business, we're well on our way to delivering our 2016 full year financial outlook. We've committed to reduce the leverage ratio to 3 to 3.5x over the next 2 to 3 years, and in the second quarter, we paid down $750 million of our $1.5 billion term loan. And our work to prioritize our investment choices and realigne resources against the capabilities that can differentiate us and the brands with the greatest potential is well underway, setting the stage for future acceleration of growth and value creation. 
I want to thank our people for their hard work and unwavering focus on delivery. Performance is an everyday thing, and I'm very proud of the determination and the drive for results, particularly in the midst of increasing change. Together, we're building a bigger, stronger, faster-growing and more profitable company, with a portfolio of leading brands to compete in large growing unconsolidated global categories that are responsive to innovation and brand support and also have a low cost of growth given the lack of market consolidation. Our confidence is high because our team has done this kind of work before. We are incredibly well positioned to build these brands and energized by the opportunity to simultaneously create a ton of value for our shareholders. And we're driven by the prospect of building one of the leading consumer goods companies in the world, a company that helps consumers live better every day where they live, learn, work and play. That is both the promise and the potential of Newell Brands. 
With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions and pass the call back to Ebony."

I've made this point before that the DNA of both organizations are really similar. This is a highly intense, operationally focused group of business unit leaders that I've had the opportunity to engage with. And in fact, we just came back from, I guess it was about the week ago now, maybe 1.5 weeks ago, we spent the whole week going through the 2016 [ph] back half plans and the outlook for 2017 business unit by business unit, and it was full on week, every day, 5 days worth of plowing through operating reviews. And I came away from those reviews really encouraged. There's some great brands here. If we do our job and deliver beyond the $500 million in synergies that we've committed to, we're going to release a lot of ability to invest back into the business. If I said -- if there was one observation I'd make, it's that while we've got the same level of operational intensity, the P&L on the Newell Rubbermaid side gives us much more flexibly to invest back into the business. So the combination we released a lot of cost that should enable us to extend some of the core capabilities that differentiate and have the potential to differentiate us like insights, design, innovation delivery, e-commerce across the total enterprise and also the ability to put more advertising and promotion investment by -- behind the businesses with the greatest potential to create value on the legacy Jarden side of the family. Obviously, I talk about Yankee Candle so I know it really well. This is obviously a crown jewel in the company. It's a great acquisitions that Mark and Ian did. There's tremendous opportunity to build our footprint there. We love our Writing business. Obviously, we're going to continue to invest across that. Food and beverage has done well. The combination of the assets between Newell and Jarden on Baby create a really powerful platform for growth going forward. And there's some in the appliance business, you can see how responsive the appliance business is to activity and merchandising. These are great brands, Mr. Coffee, Sunbeam, these are terrific assets, and some of them even stronger outside of the U.S. than in the U.S. And so I'm really encouraged by the possibilities here. All of our choices will drive off the strategic work that we're doing today. So we will establish a strategic framework that puts relative priorities in place on these businesses. Many of the Jarden businesses can benefit from the design capability we built out, and we intend to apply that design capability more broadly to help support innovation delivery over time. And then there's an entrepreneurial spirit in many of the Jarden businesses that I think we look to figure out to preserve within the context of the operating model we'll eventually build out. Businesses like Jostens are really interesting. They have their own ecosystem and culture. The Jostens business I like in terms of its scale, profitability and ability to spend of cash to fund other potential investments in other parts of the portfolio. So our choices will pivot off the portfolio prioritization work that's underway today. I'm encouraged by what I see. There's always opportunity to do work. I think we have work to do on Coleman to strengthen the brand. It's a great asset with a tremendous amount of equity, but I think the portfolio could be broadened and the innovation capability we have could be applied to premiumize certain assets of that business in a way that would give it more growth potential. We have to work our way through in all the winter weather-related businesses, the hangover from last winter which we've got baked into our guidance, so that would be just a matter of time and clearing of inventories in certain parts of the business to get ourselves through to a normal year. This won't be the normal year for any of the winter sensitive businesses. But all in all, my impression is incredibly positive. And I'm really excited, and I think the team is energized by the possibilities. It won't be simple. We've got a lot of change in the organization is going to go through over the next 6 months and into 2017. And we're going to have to do our best to deliver while simultaneously changing. And we've demonstrated the ability to do that. That will be the key kind of execution of issue that will have to the the organization through. But I'm confident because of the experience we have in doing things like this that people get through that purity of change and really come out a much stronger company on the backside of it with more growth potential and more potential to create value. That was a thrifty answer to a very straightforward question and probably my favorite question to answer."

And all of us, including me, have development opportunities. So we're going to invest in our people and help them grow. Growing company creates great opportunities for personal development, and we're going to ensure that our people have that opportunity. My team is set now. We talk about potentially one other job, which is a supply chain leadership role. And I think as we go forward, we'll be looking and exploring and figuring out whether there's somebody that can plug into our team dynamic, which I really love now. I'm impressed with the talent that I've got on both sides. I think areas for improvement, we're always going to want to strengthen our commercial operations and strengthen and broadening our customer reach and channel reach and our selling organization, so that will be an opportunity for investment. It's not because we're not happy with the people, I just want to broaden direct selling capabilities of the organization. And supply chain is probably the other area where we'll want to invest to strengthen our capabilities. We've managed to the supply chain in a very disaggregated way, and quite frankly, pretty well. But there are opportunities across the network that we're going to want to create a leadership catalyst to activate over time. And this isn't an urgent role to fill from my perspective, but it's an important area where we want to step up leadership. And Ralph, on IT?"

Dara, on the IT side, significant opportunities, a lot of focus in the very short term here is on building some of the infrastructure on the legacy Jarden businesses on just visibility to things like daily sales, point-of-sale information, those kinds of things. That information sort of exists across their group, but we need to develop it in a more systematic way to get this ability to that kind of across the company and in the center as well on the more daily basis. So that's a big effort going on now. Also, as we've developed and formulate the portfolio and the sets of choices that we make, we'll be leveraging what I think is a great platform on SAP that the legacy Newell business develop, and we'll begin to make some migration for the levers of that platform over time. That would be the second piece. And I would just say the third big effort that is really getting started now, it really relates to synergies. But there's IT infrastructure opportunity that we can really unlock some value on cost like harmonizing a lot of the, I call, back of the house support for running servers and telecommunications and all those kinds of things. So that's another piece of systems work that's going on."

The Writing benefit couple of things in the second quarter and this is an important point to register, we were very successful to sell-in, which I love because that -- at this time of year, that's a really constructive thing to do because you pour all this inventory to the floor in retailers, which is how you get the merchandising sell-out. So we're really excited about that we nailed Q2, the sell-in period. There are 2 things underlying the share gains we're experiencing around and the growth -- the underlying growth we're getting in the business. And one of them is the innovation agenda and the brand support agenda that goes with that. InkJoy Gel is going to be a huge hit. You can already see it in the consumption data. I'm really excited to see how it plays post Back-to-School and see how much of a step change we get because the product is beautiful. The ink system is unique and differentiated. For anybody who loves gel pens, it's beautiful, smooth write, but it doesn't smear because it's got an ink that dries 3x faster than the next meeting competitor, so it's got a really differentiated proposition. So I think the innovation agenda going really well. We've also extended the footprint of this business. As you know, our progress in Mexico in Writing is pretty extraordinary. Our progress in Canada where we are underdeveloped is really quite strong. Bob King, who runs the Canadian business, has done a great job in Writing over the last 18 months to build out our footprint and build the business. And as you know, we've invested to launch Sharpie in the U.K. about 1.5 years ago. That's going really well. We've got great presence in Tesco and Sainsbury's in the mass retailers in the U.K., and there's opportunity still to be had there. And we will leverage the Jarden business going forward to apply the same principles in France and Germany, leveraging their mass, retail footprint. But I think those -- the current reality is U.K. and Canada and Mexico, and it's obvious success we've had in the U.S. Part of the success is driven by this macro trend on adult coloring, which has helped Sharpie fine point; it's helped Flair; and obviously Prismacolor, which is right in the center of that big trend. And that trend continues at the tail into this business. That's probably worth 1.5, 2 points of growth that macro events, which typically has nothing to do with our marketing, but we're extremely well positioned to take advantage of it. So the real question there is, is this a sustainable trend or is this a fad that will ebb over time. That's why I always say to you guys, you should not play in Writing at double-digit core growth. You should build your models with Writing in this sort of 5% to 7% range, which I think is the right place to be. Now we've got all kinds of exciting things on Writing. I think if I was with you, Bill, I'd give you the Chinese product. We set to launch both InkJoy, regular InkJoy, InkJoy Gel and Sharpie in Shanghai in the fourth quarter. And the product looks great. I've seen the videos of the sell-in discussions with distributors. That went great so we're excited about the prospects for broadening the footprint over time both in France and Germany most likely, leveraging Jarden's mass retail footprint; and obviously, in China, where we've made the commitment. So there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic ahead on this business. And as you know, it's a beautiful, it's a beautiful category, but lots of share consolidation opportunity around the world."

I certainly understand it was weak because of weather, but I think offset had to do with winter sports. My understanding was winter sports with a kind of third quarter, fourth quarter sell-in. There's very little sell-through in the back half unless the kind of excess inventory set with the retailers. So just could you help me understand that? And was there anything connected to your commentary about Coleman that you saw some weakness in the quarter on that business that made improvement?"

Within [indisce",552,"Within outdoor solutions, we have a bunch of moving parts. The [indiscernible] business did very well, but anything that's winter-sensitive is dealing with a hangover on inventories from the sell-in from last year and working through that. Within [indiscernible] is probably is more challenge than Vocal. Vocal had a pretty good quarter in Q2, but there clearly are winter weather-related hangovers in any business that chips a lot in the back half of the year hoping to have it consumed out in the front half of the year. So we're definitely dealing with a hangover there. Coleman is a challenging business at the moment. It's not that we don't believe in it. We do actually. It reminds me a lot of where Graco was when I started in that the brand has unbelievable legacy equity. It probably -- we'll find out before I, maybe before September we'll get these results. We put all of these brands into equity testing so we're going to get relative metrics so we can compare across the total portfolio. I'm betting that Coleman stands out is probably one of the strongest brands from an equity perspective in the whole portfolio. I think Oster will be there. I think Mr. Coffee, despite people's preconceived notions, will be there. Obviously, Yankee, I think, will do very well. But I'd bet you Coleman's top of the league table between the legacy Jarden portfolio as was Graco and Rubbermaid. But there's work to do on Coleman because too much of its portfolio sits in the good segment or good, better, best. And that's where pricing and margin contraction becomes an issue if you don't have a broadened footprint. And so the Coleman business I think is going to have an okay year, will have a brilliant year because it's stuck with too of its much portfolio in that segment of the market, and that's the segment of the market where you get a lot of pressure. And if you don't have differentiation in your product offerings relative to store level, store brands, then you run the risk of always being under pressure. And that's the cycle. I guess, I describe it that's the cycle that Coleman's really in, and we're going to have to address that. And we'll address it in the same way we did with Graco. We'll walk through -- it will take some time. This will be one of those projects that takes multiple years to get right. It's going to require investment in insights. It's going to require investment in design and innovation. We're a big enough company where we can afford to take a margin contraction and hit on a big brand like that in order to get it reset, but this is going to be one of our big projects. It's actually very exciting because I think the brand has tremendous potential. But we need to get it into a more sustainable pattern of strategic growth, and that will take some time. So it's all hands on deck on that business. It's not a crisis. It's just an opportunity under leverage. But this is where the best of our model can be applied. And I think it will be really interesting to see what we'll able to do with it over a couple of years."

This is the portion of the business that probably doesn't fit the model or doesn't have real opportunity, won't ever get up on the list of investment priorities we've made. Whereas it may be interesting to somebody else. Our priority for that $250 million and $300 million, if we were in a situation where we don't have to bifurcate the trademark like a Rubbermaid situation where you can't really sell the stuff you don't really want without licensing the brand, which I'm not prepared to do, in situations where you don't have that scenario, obviously, we look to find a buyer for this businesses rather than exit them, but I'm not clear at all whether we be able to find a buyer for some of them. And so that's why I laid out this issue of $250 million to $300 million of product line exits. If we can sell them, we'll sell them because that's a more constructive way to manage the exit of those businesses. But it's not part of some broader plan to wean the portfolio down. We may make in the future strategic choices about the portfolio, but it won't be in the context of businesses that don't necessarily have any role within the portfolio. It'll be about bartering one part of the portfolio for maybe something stronger that's out there that we could acquire in."

There are others we're there's opportunity to go to market more efficiently. And part of the outcome of the of portfolio choices work will be to articulate which businesses should benefit from the full cost model and which businesses could be managed more entrepreneurially and more efficiently. And so there will be change across the entire enterprise with different bits of the portfolio getting different -- playing different roles and therefore having different models with respect to the cost structure. And there are some of the Newell legacy businesses that will be moved around with respect to prioritization. So there's a lot of cost work going on.

I actually think Mr. Coffee and Oster and Sunbeam are excellent brands. We're going to find out that they have a lot of potential. The challenge in the business was the margin structure of the business. And so will this feature at the top of the list when you get assets like Writing or assets like Yankee? I think that we are going to need to continue to think about how to get operating margin into this business so that we can write resource. I do think that there's a huge opportunity in the emerging markets in appliances as people move into the middle class. I think there's a real opportunity to tap into mom's needs in those countries to simplify life a bit, and the portfolio fits right into that space. But there are also opportunities in appliances in the developed world. So there's a lot of potential here. Our challenge will be how much investment can you put into it given the operating margins in the business, and we'll have the work through that. We'll look to the efficiencies where we can get them, again while increasing investment probably in insights and design to help the innovation of funnel along. In the short term, I believe there's opportunities and merchandising opportunities that can sustain solid growth. I wouldn't build a model around 7%, 8% growth. That's a big number on a big business. But high -- mid-single digits maybe, maybe in that 4% to 5% range, that's probably the right place kind of to build that business model out.

But we're not banking that in revenue, in revenue upside at this point. And if we were to get that upside, we might choose to accelerate some of the exits so that we get that behind us."

I mean, the Yankee story is really a pretty incredible story about extending a brand and taking risks and geographies. And I think we haven't been this courageous as that team has been. And Jim Martin and Ian were on that business after they acquired it. So there's an important lesson learned there for us on legacy Newell Rubbermaid folk. I think there's opportunity connected to applying some of the lessons learned we had the Growth Game Plan to a set of assets that Jarden had available to it. And I think the fact that we will manage the portfolio in a different way where we don't just we don't look at individual businesses would specific accountabilities, we make trade-offs on investments across the landscape, we manage resources dynamically horizontally across businesses more actively in the Jarden team. That will give us the flexibility to make some investments that wouldn't otherwise happen in the Jarden model like on Coleman. This is going to be a 1- or 2-year series of investments we have to make. We'll try to fund it within Coleman, but the likely answer is that it'll be funded from outside of Coleman. And we'll mortgage, rip cost out of corporate or do something that enables estimate those investments beds and take the step back on EBITDA margin while we're fixing the business. That's the thing that we will do differently. So there's really different business conditions and different things that could be learned from both sides of the new company and that we really intend to do that. I mean, I have no pride of authorship other than things that believe are important and applicable. But if there are things on the other side that I wish I've done on a legacy Newell Rubbermaid businesses, I'm going to be selfish and take them and go do it. So -- and there's plenty of examples of that. When I said at the very beginning in December that we're going to take the best of both, I really meant that. The best of both talent, best of both ideas for how to go to market, best of both sets of learnings. And we're going to apply it across the enterprise."

So we're going to work through that over the first 18 months. And I have a very long view on our agenda and the company we're trying to build. And I think we get growth acceleration as we get through this period, this transition period of change and portfolio work. But we haven't committed to what that is. But certainly, Q2 where there was less portfolio activity, is encouraging. So that tells us a little bit about what's possible, and that's without the benefit of applying the best of what we could potentially apply from a capability standpoint. I do think the things to look at it if you want to get a sense of what's possible, who would've thought Baby would be growing at 11% 5 years ago? And if you look at the period 2012, 2013 was compounded 10%. Who would have thought Writing would be growing 11% double-digit core growth in the first half of the year when we first started? There's a lot of talk about technology conversions, making -- Writing was dead was the first series of questions I've gotten, why would I ever been on Writing, but that's obviously not true. And so there are lots of reasons, if you look back at the evidence of with last 5 years, to believe that these brands will respond to investment activity and capabilities in the area of design and innovation. And our challenge as leaders is to figure out how within the P&L to free up the space to drive that investment forward while simultaneously delivering the margin improvement committed to in the deal. And I think it's doable. I mean, I'm excited by that. The question becomes how much growth potential is there really here? I don't know. But Q2 certainly -- Q2 and the other evidence would suggest that when we get it right, we can grow really well on these businesses, and they're really responsive. And probably the most important strategic chart for investors to look at is the one that talks about the size of these markets, our position in the markets, the relative the market share the cumulative market share, the top 3 players in these categories globally and then the cost of growth. And that is a really attractive chart because it tells the story of what's possible in this set of category, these types of categories relative to what's possible in fast-moving consumer goods where they are far more consolidated than the top 5 have 90% of the share, and the cost of growth is so high as a consequence. And so this is a much more attractive space to be playing in if you really think about it in that way as long as you can -- you tackle the cost and release the cost in the P&L to be able to invest behind the brands. And we had a theory that these categories will be responsive to activity. We know help plenty of proof that they're responsive to activity. So it's real -- this algorithm is working, and it has the potential to even work harder across this broader canvas once we get through the transition period."

And so the balancing act when you thought an operating margin as high as the one we have is to not get too ambitious for the margin and to really think about to grow. I've think we've struck the right balance up until now. We substantially increased the amount of A&P on that business over the last 5 years. And while geographic footprint extension will require incremental investment if we don't want to mortgage investment levels at home, I'm not sure how much more it doesn't really need, I don't think, given the competitive set personal care levels of A&P ratio. So we're getting close. If we can get ourselves to 9%, 10% A&P ratios, I think we've got really interesting and extendable place to be. And then I think some of the other businesses, we want to continue to work on the margin structures. So a lot of the work we're doing on costs are in businesses that have less to offer in that respect. And we have to do more. We have more work to do that's why there's $230 million left on our Project Renewal road map is because we want to get the margin flexibility into that portion of the P&L so that we do have the ability to invest. Now in the combination, we may not choose to reapply investment where we get the cost savings out, I mean take that money, Ralph [indiscernible] Mark and give it to Bill and ask him to go spend on the Yankee because that's a better choice that makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts. So we have plenty of room to go, room to run on cost on the legacy Newell business. And we have scale leverage to be captured through the integration in route to market, in costs to serve, in many, many places that we're going to be able to go after. And we should be able to get beyond the 500 such that we have increased firepower. The question is how quickly do we do that and how quickly are we confident enough in that outcome that we're prepared to share that with you."

Part of it is because I think it's a prudent thing to do given the amount of change of the organization is going to go through. So it's the right kind of cautious stance to take. Whether we beat that or not? Time will tell. But Q2 didn't really have any material product line exits executed in it. So that's part of the discussion. I don't want to get too specific on where those exits will occur because I don't want to be disruptive either internally or compromise potential external opportunities to sell some of these assets. So I'm cautious on that one, and I know that feels like a bit of a fudge, but I think it's actually in your interest and investors' interest for me to manage it that way. On Yankee, look, the compound annual growth rate on Yankee has been around 7% for a long period of time. So if you want to double a business, all you got to do is compound the growth at 7% for 10 years. No, I'm not saying -- I'm not time-bounding how long it will take to double the business, but that's how the math works on that. Do we believe in Yankee? Absolutely. The we believe in Yankee as much as we believe in Writing? Yes. Will Yankee end up being right up there at the top of the list of things we want to bet on? Yes. And is there an immense opportunity here? Yes. Is it broader than fragrance candles? Work to be done to confirm, but my intuition says yes. And so we'll see. It's a big category. It's a very, very strong brand. The experience in Europe that Jarden really has led increases confidence in the ability for the business to travel. And that is one of the reasons, that coupled with the margin structure, coupled with the ability to create beautiful products through design our number of the reasons that it factors as a potentially really attractive play for us."

So we should grow our gross margins, and some of that gross margin improvement is going to get reinvested to A&P line, as Mike alluded to earlier, as we look to kind of settle out at an A&P range across the whole portfolio, which should get us ultimately some operating income improvement."

But I think the way to think about it is that Jostens growth rate will be dilutive to the overall core growth rate of the company because we don't expect Jostens to be much more than a 1% to 2% growth business. So you have to build that into your thinking as well. The Waddington has some interesting opportunities. So I wouldn't declare which way at Waddington will break.

I think last call we had, we talked about this specifically. Q1 will definitely be a dilutive quarter versus prior year because of share count, interest expense and the fact that it's not a great, normally a big quarter for the Jarden businesses. So we -- in all of the conversations that I'm provided around accretion, I talked about year 1 being high single digits. Now we may do better than that given some of the numbers we're putting up. But Q1 is definitely going to be dilutive, needs to be built into the model that way. When I look at your guys estimates for Q1 through first call, and I do want to get into specific number, but they're close to what I would think it would be and -- but we shouldn't be thinking about Q1 being a big winning quarter for us from EPS perspective. So it definitely needs to be built into your models that way on share count on interest expense alone. And then the other side of this is although synergies will work toward as a positive as well as renewal savings work towards as a positive, but on balance, there's nobody to overcome the share count. Because remember, your share count is going from 2 60 to something almost double that, so not a chance we're accretive in Q1. But full year, I think you guys are pretty close in aggregate. I don't think everybody got their estimates for '17. But when we get closer, you should expect us with Q3 earnings to provide some perspective on '17."

So clearly, there's a shifting in shopping behavior underway in the U.S., and we want to reach consumers way or the shop and we also want to win with winning customers. And so those 2 principles drive the allocation of resource for us. In order to reach consumers where they shop, when they're shopping and an e-commerce environment, we made the determination that we need to invest in specialized skills. And we built that the whole team of e-commerce resources from the outside that are really driving our activity plans in these areas. And so we intend to continue to step up investments in this area this year, next year, the year beyond. And this can be and should be for Newell Brands a differentiated capability relative to our competitive set. That does not mean that we are taking resource away from our bricks-and-mortars partners. Wal-Mart is our biggest partner. A big 95% of their business with us is brick-and-mortar sales. So obviously, for all of those folks that are in that phase of striking the right balance within their business model, we need to resource of a relationship with that customer and our programming with that customer in a way that fits their strategic road map. And so that's the moment we're in with respect to e-commerce. We expect to disproportionately grow our e-commerce business relative to bricks-and-mortar, and we want to grow ahead of the market growth in the channel because we want to have our share of market in the e-commerce channels portal greater than our share of market in brick-and-mortar. Because as shoppers shift to the channel, we do not want a negative share mix effect on the aggregate market. And so really, really important, one of the dislocating ideas and the most important things we do as a company over the next 5 to 10 years is to be in front in this space. I think that's our last question. I would just end by saying this is probably a message to my -- to our team. I'm incredibly proud of our team for what we did in the second quarter. A deal like this has the potential to be incredibly distractive, and the team was able to focus on delivery in an unwavering way that inspires confidence in our ability to really play for the upside in the combination.

Please refer to our earnings release and the most recent Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for additional information concerning risk factors. Newell undertakes no responsibility to update any forward-looking statements. 
Let me remind you also that we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures today, including those identified in the tables of the earnings press release. We provide these non-GAAP measures because management believes that providing insights on the measures discussed enable investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results. Specifically, the biggest differences between the GAAP and non-GAAP metrics this quarter are onetime charges and other expenses related to the Jarden transaction, including inventory step-up, acquisition-related amortization and other transaction costs. 
In addition, we're defining Newell Brands' core sale as if the Jarden combination occurred April 15 of last year, meaning we are including last year's Jarden results in our 2015 base. Waddington, Jostens and Elmer's are not included in core sales until their respective 1-year anniversaries. 
The reconciliations of these and other non-GAAP measures with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP are included in the earnings release and are available on our website.

I'm very pleased to report a strong set of second quarter results with positive momentum on the number of fronts. We drove very competitive levels of growth in the quarter, cost synergies and Project Renewal savings of ramping, and right where we expected them to be. And cash flow was strong enabling us to pay down $750 million of our $1.5 billion term loan. So a strong start as Newell Brands. And as a consequence, we reaffirmed full year guidance this morning. 
The Q2 headlines are as follows: net sales have more than doubled as a result of the Jarden transaction to $3.86 billion. Core sales grew 5%, led by strong performances in Writing, Baby and Parenting, Food & Beverage, Yankee Candle & Appliances. 
On both reported and normalized basis, gross margins and operating margins were right in line with our expectations. Reported EPS was $0.30 per diluted share. Normalized EPS was $0.78, up nearly 22% versus prior year. And operating cash flow was nearly $600 million. So all in, a very good set of second quarter results with continued momentum in our key businesses and a lot of energy and excitement around the opportunities ahead.

As Mike noted, we were pleased with our second quarter results with strong reported end-core sales growth. Gross and operating margin came in consistent with our expectations, and we are on track with our deleveraging plan. A strong operating cash flow allowed us to pay down about $0.75 billion in debt. Overall, a very good start. 
Turning to our detailed review. Second quarter reported net sales were $3.86 billion, 147% increase versus last year, largely from the contribution of the Jarden transaction. Core sales increased 5%. Reported gross margin was 28.4% compared with 39.8% in the prior year, largely due to a $334 million inventory step-up related to the Jarden transaction. There will be a similar step-up impact of around $130 million in Q3, as we expect substantially all of the remaining inventory to turn. 
Normalized gross margin was 37.2%, down 280 basis points versus last year. The decline is due to the negative mix effect from the Jarden acquisition and the deconsolidation of Venezuela as well as the impact of unfavorable currency, which more than offset productivity and pricing. 
Reported SG&A expense was $947 million or 24.5% of sales, down 70 basis points over last year. Normalized SG&A expense was $827 million or 21.4% of sales, down 260 basis points versus prior year, thanks to the mix impact from the inclusion of the Jarden legacy businesses, which have historically carried a lower SG&A spend rate, also benefiting from Project Renewable savings and early Jarden deal synergies. 
Advertising and promotion spending at the Newell Rubbermaid legacy businesses increased 50 basis points in the quarter, driven by incremental investments behind new products, including Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens, Mr. Sketch Scented Crayons, Rubbermaid FreshWorks Produce Saver and Graco Extend2Fit convertible car seats. 
Reported operating margin was 3.6% of sales compared with 13.8% in the prior year. The decrease was largely driven by the onetime inventory step-up, acquisition-related amortization costs and other expenses incurred in connection with the Jarden deal. Normalized operating margin declined 20 basis points to 15.8%. Interest expense of $127 million rose $109 million year-over-year, reflecting a $10 billion increase in debt, resulting from the financing of the Jarden and Elmer's transactions. 
Our reported tax rate was 20.3% compared with 22.7% in the prior year. The normalized tax rate was 29.2% compared with 24.5% in the prior year, attributable to the mix effect of the Jarden acquisition and geographic earnings. 
Reported EPS was $0.30 per share compared with $0.55 in the prior year, due largely to a number of acquisition-related charges and expenses. We also had an increased interest expense and a higher share count. These Jarden transaction charges were partially offset by the contribution from the Jarden and Elmer's acquisitions and a gain on the day sale of the Décor business. Normalized EPS, which excludes the transaction-related expenses, among other things, was $0.78, a 21.9% increase versus last year. The improvement was primarily driven by strong sales growth, the contribution from the Jarden and Elmer's acquisitions and Project Renewal savings. These benefits more than offset increased advertising and promotion support, negative foreign currency, increased interest expense and increased shares outstanding. 
I will now move on to our segment results. Starting with Writing, net sales increased 15.8%. Core sales increased 11.3%, driven by strong double-digit growth in North America. We had a very good start with the Back-to-School sell-in, thanks to innovation and increased advertising and promotion. 
Net sales in the Home Solutions segment decreased 1.1% as strong growth in our Food & Beverage business was more than offset by the negative impact of the divested Décor business and planned exits in the low-margin Consumer Storage business and unfavorable foreign currency. Core sales grew 1.7%. 
Tools net sales declined 3.8%, reflecting continued weakness in Brazil and negative foreign currency. Core sales declined 2.3% as growth in North America was offset by Brazil macro challenges and industrial sectors softness in China. 
Net sales in Commercial Products decline 7.9%, primarily due to the divestiture of the Rubbermaid medical cart business and unfavorable foreign currency. Core sales declined 1.4%, reflecting softness driven by complexity-reduction initiatives in the North American distributor channel and in Brazil due to macro challenges in that country. 
Our Baby segment grew net sales 12.4%, thanks to continued strong momentum at Graco North America, driven by innovation and advertising and promotion. Core sales grew 11.1%. 
In my discussion of the legacy Jarden segments, I will refer to post-transaction net and core sales compared against pro forma results for the same period in 2015. Post-transaction net sales in branded consumables increased 36.8%, reflecting the Waddington acquisition. Core sales increased 7.8%, due largely to strong growth in Yankee Candle and Home & Family in Europe. 
Net sales in Consumer Solutions increased 4.9%. Core sales increased 8.3%, driven by strong growth in kitchen appliances in North America, Europe and Latin America. Outdoor solutions net sales increased 53.6%, due largely to the Jostens acquisition. Core sales increased 50 basis points, reflecting strong growth from Pure Fishing, offset by weather-related softness in its key businesses. Net sales in Process Solutions increased 20 basis points. Core sales increased 50 basis points. 
Let's now turn to Q2 core sales by geography. Importantly, North America, which represents 79% of total sales delivered strong core growth of 6.7%. In EMEA, core sales grew 2.6%. Latin America core sales increased 1.9%, reflecting solid growth across the region with the exception of Brazil. Asia Pacific core sales declined 7.7%, due primarily to softness in branded consumables in that region.
Moving on to cash flow. During Q2, we reported almost $600 million in operating cash flow compared with $102 million in the prior year, reflecting the contribution from Jarden, including Jostens and Waddington, improved operating results and favorable working capital movements. We also generated $236 million from the sale of Décor. We returned $92 million in dividends to shareholders. We also paid down debt by $750 million, bringing our quarter-end debt balance down to $13 billion. We remain confident in our ability to reach our leverage goal of 3 to 3.5x in the next 2 to 3 years. So a very good start to the quarter and with progress on many important areas. 
With that, I'll now turn the call back to Mike."

Since coming together as Newell Brands, we've been hard at work getting to know each other and laying the groundwork for accelerated value creation. Together, we have a strong portfolio of leading brands and significantly greater scale across a number of key channels, customers and geographies with the opportunity to leverage these assets in a bigger way for expanded reach, visibility, impact and growth. We've identified a number of new growth opportunities and put many into action that will materialize through channel cross-sell, accelerated international deployment and strengthened innovation delivery over time. 
We're also making very good progress on costs. As previously shared, we've committed to achieve an incremental $300 million in Project Renewal savings over the next few years. And against that target, we've delivered $70 million in incremental savings in the first half of 2016.
We also have a clear line of sight to the $500 million of cost synergies with significant upside potential. The synergy teams have hit the ground running and are now in full flight with early successes on procurement, where we've already realized $40 million in annualized savings. We're quite confident in our ability to deliver the targeted synergies given our track record of success on Project Renewal. 
We're also making good progress on developing the new strategy for Newell Brands. A few weeks ago, my leadership team spent time together discussing the choices ahead and the next steps in our transformation that will flow from that strategy. Critical decisions about portfolio roles and category and geographic priorities were at the center of our discussions. Mark Tarchetti and his team led by Russ Torres led the dialogue and much of the thinking. As you'd expect, if you're familiar with how we work, those discussions were underpinned by rigorous analysis. The insights generated will frame a set of sharp portfolio, resource allocation and organizational design choices. In early August, we'll solicit input from the Board of Directors. And with the benefit of the board's perspective incorporated, these new strategic framework will shape our activities and investment choices from 2017 forward.
Let me now turn back and take a look at the balance of 2016. This morning, we reaffirmed Newell Brands 2016 full year guidance. We continue to expect 2016 full year Newell Brands core sales growth of 3% to 4% and full year normalized EPS of $2.75 to $2.90. Despite a strong start to the year, we continued to believe that both full year guidance metrics appropriately bracket the most likely outcome from the full year, which is right in the middle of both guidance ranges. 
Where we actually fall in the full year guidance range will depend on 3 key factors. The first factor relates to the success of the second half 2016 prior periods of Back-to-School on Writing and the holidays on Yankee Candle. We are well positioned against both. Importantly, both businesses have leadership positions in large, growing global markets with tremendous opportunity to still capture market share both in their markets at home and in our markets abroad. Yankee and Writing also have above-fleet average margin structures, and so their performance can move the needle for Newell Brands in the meaningful way. 
On Writing, we have tremendous momentum. The latest 12-week U.S. value market share through the middle of July, as measured by IRI, is up over 140 basis points with dollars sales growth of 7%. In Q2, Writing had an extraordinary sell-in for the Back-to-School season, delivering about $15 million more revenue in this key sell-in period that we anticipated. While the revenue and the associated income will reverse out in Q3, the strength of the sell-in and the programming and innovation in place bodes well for display activity and merchandising-driven sell-out in Q3. 
As we complete the Back-to-School dry period on Writing, we'll turn our attention to the holidays. The Yankee Candle team is gearing up for the holidays with strong merchandising plans and with new products under way to retail. We're pressing forward in a new effort to broaden distribution even further in the U.S. and Canada with incremental placements that leverage Newell Brands' route to market in adjacent channels that could potentially positively impact Q4 2016 and more importantly, 2017. 
We're also exploring ways to enhance brand investment in the fourth quarter and certainly into 2017. Importantly, if we find ourselves with full year earnings upside beyond the midpoint to the full year normalized EPS guidance range, we will likely reinvest a substantial portion of that upside back into the Yankee Candle business for strength in consumer impact around the holidays and positive momentum into 2017. 
The second factor that could influence where we fall on the full year guidance range is the delivery of Project Renewal cost savings and the transaction cost synergies. We have a clear line of sight to the full year Project Renewal incremental savings, and as planned, we expect to deliver well over $100 million in incremental savings this year. With respect to the Jarden transaction cost synergies, we are well on our way to deliver our $50 million to $80 million full year synergy cost guidance with a good probability of delivering towards the high end of that range. So we're on track and foresee no issues here and perhaps some opportunity. 
The third factor that could influence where we land in the full year guidance range is product line exits. To be clear, our full year guidance reflects our intention to actively manage the portfolio. In 2016, we expect to begin to exit certain product lines with roughly $250 million to $300 million of revenue over the 2 -- the next 2 to 3 years. These are businesses that have low to no likelihood of featuring our strategic priorities for the company. As we've stated, our goal would be to sell these assets, if possible, rather than exit, and we hope to be able to find a buyer for some. If we're unsuccessful at finding buyers, the process of exiting these businesses will begin as early as the third quarter. As mentioned previously, we do not expect a material financial impact related to potential product line exits. 
While we do not provide quarterly guidance, I do want to provide some context for the flow of our business in the second half. Given the likely Q3 reversal of the Writing incremental Q2 Back-to-School sell-in and the possible Q3 timing of product line exits, we expect Q3 core sales growth rate to be near the bottom of our 3% to 4% full year guidance range. In Q4, we expect growth rates to recover towards the midpoint of our full year range. We also expect normalized EPS to skew roughly 10% higher in Q4 relative to Q3 as a result of the holiday season peaking of the profitable Yankee Candle business. 
So in closing, we've had a strong start to the year on many fronts. We successfully completed the most transformative deal in the history of either Newell Rubbermaid or Jarden. Despite the potential for distraction and the transaction of this size could create, we grew core sales 5% and delivered normalized EPS growth of nearly 22% in the second quarter. We've made good early progress in the integration of the 2 companies, while simultaneously taking a big step forward on Project Renewal. With the continued positive momentum in our business, we're well on our way to delivering our 2016 full year financial outlook. We've committed to reduce the leverage ratio to 3 to 3.5x over the next 2 to 3 years. And in the second quarter, we paid down $750 million of our $1.5 billion term loan. And our work to prioritize our investment choices and realign resource against the capabilities that can differentiate us and the brands with the greatest potential is well underway, setting the stage for future acceleration of growth and value creation. 
I want to thank our people for their hard work and unwavering focus on delivery. Performance is an everyday thing, and I'm very proud of the determination and the drive for results, particularly in the midst of increasing change. Together, we're building a bigger, stronger, faster-growing and more profitable company with a portfolio of leading brands to compete in large-growing unconsolidated global categories that are responsive to innovation and brand support and also have a low cost of growth given the lack of market consolidation. Our confidence is high because our team has done this kind of work before. We are incredibly well positioned to build these brands and energized by the opportunity to simultaneously create a ton of value for our shareholders. And we're driven by the prospect of building one of the leading consumer goods companies in the world, a company that helps consumers live better every day where they live, learn, work and play. That is both the promise and the potential of Newell Brands. 
With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions and pass the call back to Ebony."

This is a highly intense, operationally focused group of business unit leaders that I've had the opportunity to engage with. And in fact, we just came back from, I guess it was about the week ago now, maybe 1.5 weeks ago, we spent the whole week going through the 2016 [ph] back-half plans and the outlook for 2017 business unit by business unit. And it was full on week, every day, 5 days worth of plowing through operating reviews. And I came away from those reviews really encouraged. There's some great brands here. If we do our job and deliver beyond the $500 million in synergies that we've committed to, we're going to release a lot of ability to invest back into the business. If I said -- if there was one observation I'd make, it's that while we've got the same level of operational intensity, the P&L on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid side gives us much more flexibly to invest back into the business. So the combination we released a lot of costs that should enable us to extend some of the core capabilities that differentiate -- have the potential to differentiate us like insights, design, innovation delivery, e-commerce across the total enterprise and also the ability to put more advertising and promotion investment by -- behind the businesses with the greatest potential to create value on the legacy Jarden side of the family. Obviously, I talked a lot about Yankee Candle, so they know it really well. This is obviously a crown jewel in the company. It's a great acquisitions that Mark and Ian did. There's tremendous opportunity to build our footprint there. We love our Writing business. Obviously, we're going to continue to invest across that. Food & beverage has done really well. The combination of the assets between Newell and Jarden on Baby create a really powerful platform for growth going forward. The -- and there's some -- and the Appliance business, you can see how responsive the Appliance business is to activity and merchandising. These are great brands, Oster, Mr. Coffee, Sunbeam. These are terrific assets, and some of them even stronger outside of the U.S. than in the U.S. And so I'm really encouraged by the possibilities here. All of our choices will drive off the strategic work that we're doing today. So we will establish a strategic framework that puts relative priorities in place on these businesses. Many of the Jarden businesses could benefit from the design capability we've built out, and we intend to apply that design capability more broadly to help support innovation delivery over time. And then there's an entrepreneurial spirit in many of the Jarden businesses that I think we'll look to figure out a way to preserve within the context of the operating model we'll eventually build out. Businesses like Jostens are really interesting. There's -- they have their own ecosystem and culture. The Jostens business I like in terms of its scale, profitability and ability to spin off cash to fund other potential investments in other parts of the portfolio. So our choices will pivot off the portfolio prioritization work that's underway today. I'm encouraged by what I see. There's always opportunity to do work. I think we have work to do on Coleman to strengthen the brand. It's a great asset with a tremendous amount of equity, but I think the portfolio could be broadened and the innovation capability we have could be applied to premiumize certain aspects of that business in a way that would give it more growth potential. We have to work our way through in all the winter weather-related businesses, the hangover from last winter, which we've got baked into our guidance. So that will just be a matter of time and clearing of inventories in certain parts of the business to get ourselves through to a normal year. This won't be the normal year for any of the winter-sensitive businesses. But all in all, my impression is incredibly positive. And I'm really excited, and I think the team is energized by the possibilities. It won't be simple. We've got a lot of change that the organization is going to go through over the next 6 months and into 2017. And we're going to have to do our best to deliver while simultaneously changing. And we've demonstrated the ability to do that. That will be the key kind of executional issue that will have to lead the organization through. But I'm confident because of the experience we have in doing things like this that we will get through that period of change and really come out a much stronger company on the backside of it with more growth potential and more potential to create value. That was a thrifty [ph] answer, Dara, but very straightforward question. It's probably my favorite question to answer."

And all of us, including me, have development opportunities. So we're going to invest in our people and help them grow. Growing company creates great opportunities for personal development, and we're going to ensure that our people have that opportunity. My team is set now. We've talked about potentially one other job, which is a supply chain leadership role. And I think as we go forward, we'll be looking and exploring to -- and figuring out whether there's somebody that can plug into our team dynamic, which I really love now. I'm impressed with the talent that I've got on both sides. I think the areas for improvement, we're always going to want to strengthen our commercial operations and strengthen and broaden our customer reach and channel reach in our selling organization. So that will be an opportunity for investment, not because we're not happy with the people, I just want to broaden the direct sell-in capabilities of the organization. And supply chain is probably the other area where we'll -- we want to invest to strengthen our capabilities. We've managed the supply chain in a very disaggregated way, and quite frankly, pretty well. But there are opportunities across the network that we're going to want to create a leadership catalyst to activate over time. And this isn't an urgent role to fill from my perspective, but it's an important area where we want to step up leadership. And Ralph, on IT?"

On the -- Dara, on the IT side, significant opportunities, a lot of focus in the very short term here is on building some of the infrastructure on the legacy Jarden businesses on just visibility to things like daily sales, point-of-sale information, those kinds of things. That information sort of exists across their group, but we need to develop it in a more systematic way to get this ability to that kind of across the company and in the center as well on a more daily basis. So that's a big effort going on now. Also, as we've developed and formulate the portfolio and the sets of choices that we make, we'll be leveraging what I think is a great platform on SAP that the legacy Newell business develop, and we'll begin to make some migrations for the levers of that platform over time. That would be the second piece. And I would just say the third big effort that is really getting started now, it really relates to synergies. But there's IT infrastructure opportunity that we can really unlock some value on cost by harmonizing a lot of the, I'll call it, back-of-the-house support for running servers and telecommunications and all those kinds of things. So that's another piece of systems work that's going on."

Writing benefit from a couple of things in the second quarter, and this is an important point to register. We were very successful to sell-in, which I love because that -- at this time of year, that's a really constructive thing to do because you pour us all this inventory to the floor in retailers, which is how you get the merchandising sell-out. So we're really excited about that we nailed Q2, the sell-in period. It's -- there are 2 things underlying the share gains we're experiencing around and the growth we're -- the underlying growth we're getting in the business. And one of them is the innovation agenda and the brand support agenda that goes with that. InkJoy Gel is going to be a huge hit. You can already see it in the consumption data. I'm really excited to see how it plays post Back-to-School and see how much of a step change we get from it because the product is beautiful. The ink system is unique and differentiated. For anybody who loves gel pens, it's beautiful, smooth write, but it doesn't smear because it's got an ink that dries 3x faster than the next leading competitor. So it's got a really differentiated proposition. So I think the innovation agenda is going really well. We have also extended the footprint of this business. As you know, our progress in Mexico in Writing is really pretty extraordinary. Our progress in Canada where we are underdeveloped is really quite strong. Bob King [ph], who runs the Canadian business has done a great job on Writing over the last 18 months to build out our footprint and build the business. And as you know, we've invested to launch Sharpie in the U.K. about 1.5 years ago. That's going really well. We've got great presence at Tesco and Sainsbury's in the mass retailers in the U.K., and there's opportunity still to be had there. And we will leverage the Jarden business going forward to apply the same principles in France and Germany, leveraging their mass retail footprint. But I think those are -- the current reality is U.K., it's Canada, it's Mexico and it's the obvious success we've had in the U.S. Part of the success is driven by this macro trend on adult coloring, which has helped Sharpie Fine Point, it's helped Flair and obviously Prismacolor, which is right in the center of that big trend. And that trend continues at the tailwind to this business. That's probably worth 1.5, 2 points of our growth that macro event, which really has nothing to do with our marketing, but we're extremely well positioned to take advantage of it. So the real question there is, is this a sustainable trend or is this a fad that will ebb over time. That's why I always say to you guys, you should not play-in Writing at double-digit core growth. You should build your models with Writing in the sort of 5% to 7% range, which I think is the right place to be. Now we've got all kinds of exciting things ahead on Writing. I've got -- if I was with you, Bill, I'd give you the Chinese product that's set to launch both InkJoy, regular InkJoy, InkJoy Gel and Sharpie in Shanghai in the fourth quarter. And the product looks great. I've seen the videos of the sell-in discussions with distributors. That went great. So we're excited about the prospects for broadening the footprint over time both in France and Germany most likely, leveraging Jarden's mass retail footprint and obviously, in China, where we've made the commitment. So there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic ahead on this business. And it's -- and as you know, it's a beautiful category, but lots of share consolidation opportunity around the world."

Within outdoor solutions, we have a bunch of different moving parts. The Pure Fishing business did really well. But anything that's winter-sensitive is dealing with a hangover on inventories from the sell-in from last year and working through that. Within ski, K2 is probably more challenged than vocal. Vocal had a pretty good quarter in Q2, but there clearly are winter weather-related hangovers in any business that chips a lot in the back half of the year hoping to have it consumed out in the front half of the year. So we're definitely dealing with a hangover there. Coleman is a challenging business at the moment. It's not that we don't believe in it. We do actually. It reminds me a lot of where Graco was when I started in that -- the brand has unbelievable legacy equity. It's probably -- we'll find out before I -- maybe before September, we'll get these results. We put all of these brands into equity testing, so we're going to get relative metrics that we can compare across the total portfolio. I'm betting that Coleman stands out. It's probably one of the strongest brands from an equity perspective in the whole portfolio. I think Oster will be there. I think Mr. Coffee, despite people's preconceived notions, will be there. Obviously, Yankee, I think, will do very well. But I'd bet you Coleman's top of the league table within the legacy Jarden portfolio as was Graco and Rubbermaid. But there's work to do on Coleman because too much of its portfolio sits in the good segment or good, better, best. And that's where pricing and margin contraction becomes an issue if you don't have a broadened footprint. And so the Coleman business, I think it's going to have an okay year, will have a brilliant year because it's stuck with too much of its portfolio in that segment of the market, and that's the segment of the market where you get a lot of pressure. And if you don't have differentiation in your product offerings relative to store level, store brands, then you run the risk of always being under pressure. And that's the cycle. I just guess I'll describe it. That's the cycle that Coleman's currently in. And we're going to have to address that, and we'll address it in the same way we did with Graco. We'll work through. It would be -- take some time. This will be one of those projects that takes multiple years to get right. It's going to require investment in insights. It's going to require investment in design and in innovation. We're a big enough company where we can afford to take a margin contraction and hit on a big brand like that in order to get it reset, but this is going to be one of our big projects. It's actually very exciting because I think the brand has tremendous potential. But we need to get it into a more sustainable pattern of strategic growth, and that will take some time. So it's all hands on deck on that business. It's not a crisis. It's just an opportunity under leverage. But this is where the best of our model can be applied. And I think it will be really interesting to see what we'll able to do with it over a couple of years."

It won't ever get up on the list of investment priorities we'd make, whereas it -- maybe interesting to somebody else. Our priority for that $250 million and $300 million, if we were in a situation where we don't have to bifurcate the trademark like the Rubbermaid situation where you can't really sell the stuff you don't really want without licensing the brand, which I'm not prepared to do. In situations where you don't have that scenario, obviously, we'd love to find a buyer for this businesses rather than exit them, but I'm not clear at all whether we would be able to find a buyer for some of them. And so that's why I've laid out this issue of $250 million to $300 million of product line exits. If we can sell them, we'll sell them because that's a much more constructive way to manage the exit of those businesses. But it's not part of some broader plan to wean the portfolio down.

So that one's a give and a take. There are others where there's opportunity to go to market more efficiently. And part of the outcome of the portfolio choices work will be to articulate which businesses should benefit from the full cost model and which businesses could be managed more entrepreneurially and more efficiently. And so there will be change across the entire enterprise, with different bits of the portfolio getting different -- playing different roles and, therefore, having different models with respect to the cost structure. And there are some of the Newell legacy businesses that will be moved around with respect to prioritization. So there's a lot of cost -- work going on.

I don't know that I'd build a plan to mid-single digits, but if you were to break out the portion that we're more strategically interested in, certainly, certainly, that portion needs to grow in the mid-singles to -- mid- to high single digits, and that's what where we're -- where, obviously, we're going to dedicate resource. It's also where the opportunity to differentiate product is, which should give us the opportunity to margin up that portion of the business. But yes, I think I wouldn't give you a forecast on Home Solutions, but I would tell you that Food & Beverage needs to be growing mid- to high single digits in the model going forward. And we believe it can."

That's some of the stuff that we've already talked about. They've had a nice run in the appliance business. And while we're not quoting pro forma numbers year-to-date for those businesses, it's been a solid first half for the appliance business. And I think people underestimate the quality of the brands. I actually think Mr. Coffee and Oster and Sunbeam are excellent brands. We're going to find out that they have a lot of potential. The challenge in the business was the margin structure of the business. And so will this feature at the top of the list when you've got assets like Writing or assets like Yankee? I think that we're going to need to continue to think about how to get operating margin into this business so that we can write resource. And I do think that there's a huge opportunity in the emerging markets in appliances, as people move into the middle class. I think there's a real opportunity to tap into moms' needs in those countries to simplify life a bit, and the portfolio fits right into that space. But there are also opportunities in appliances in the developed world. So there's a lot of potential here. Our challenge will be how much investment can you put into it given the operating margins in the business, and we'll have the work through that. We'll look for the efficiencies where we can get them, again, while increasing investment, probably in insights and design to help the innovation funnel along. In the short term, I believe, there are distribution opportunities and merchandising opportunities that can sustain solid growth. I wouldn't build a model around 7%, 8% growth. That's a big number on a big business. But high -- mid-single digits maybe, maybe in that 4% to 5% range, that's probably the right place kind of to build that business model out. But the portions of that portfolio that are really interesting and those mega brands that I was describing, really interesting, and then there's some other challenge aspects in that portfolio."

The corporate duplication synergies, we're going after fast. So we're right in the middle of that in Q3. We'll have that largely behind us, all those choices made and done in the third quarter. I would be surprised that there are things hanging out there beyond that. And then with respect to route-to-market synergies, there's opportunity in every country to look for where those synergies might come. We'll work together as a team to deploy for the things that makes the most sense, and I don't think we'll drag it out over a whole long period of time. I think consensus is that whatever changes we are going to make me, we ought to get them done as fast as we can as long as we are confident in our ability to not be distracted on delivery. And that's why some of the guidance makes sense in the context of a strong first half. There'd be a fair amount of work to do in the second half with respect to the integration.

So we're excited about the prospect of trying to get a Yankee Candle within arm's reach of as many consumers as we can. And so that, clearly, is the near-end opportunity.

And Jim, Martin and Ian were on that business after they acquired it. So there's an important lesson learned there for us, legacy Newell Rubbermaid folk. I think there's opportunity connected to applying some of the lessons learned we had through the Growth Game Plan to a set of assets that Jarden had available to it. And I think the fact that we will manage the portfolio in a different way where we don't just -- we don't look at individual businesses would specific accountabilities. We make trade-offs on investments across the landscape, we manage resources dynamically horizontally across businesses more actively than the Jarden team. That will give us the flexibility to make some investments that wouldn't have otherwise happened in a Jarden model, like on Coleman. This is going to be a 1- or 2-year series of investments we have to make. We'll try to fund it within Coleman, but the likely answer is that it'll be funded from outside of Coleman. And we'll mortgage, rip cost out of corporate or do something that enables us to make those investment bets and take a step back on EBITDA margin while we're fixing the business. That's the thing that we will do differently. So there's really different business conditions and different things that can be learned from both sides of the new company, and we really intend to do that. I have no pride of authorship other than things I believe are important and applicable. But if there are things on the other side that I wish I've done on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid businesses, I'm going to be selfish and take them and go do it. So -- and there's plenty of examples of that. When I said at the very beginning, in December, that we're going to take the best of both, I really meant that, best of both talent, best of both ideas for how to go to market, best of both sets of learnings.

Look, I think, long term, it's a very exciting set of possibilities. I think in the next -- what we've said in terms of guidance on core growth for this year and next is 3% of 4%, and we're very unlikely to change that guidance because there's a lot of work to do within the portfolio that will both help the growth agenda, but some things that will -- given how we define core sales, potentially hurt the growth agenda. So we're going to work through that over the first 18 months. And I have a very long view on our agenda in the company we're trying to build. And I think we get growth acceleration as we get through this period, this transition period of change and portfolio work. But we haven't committed to what that is. But certainly, Q2, where there was less portfolio activity, is encouraging. So that tells us a little bit about what's possible, and that's without the benefit of applying the best of what we could potentially apply from a capability standpoint. I do think the things to look at, if you want to get a sense of what's possible, who would've thought Baby would be growing at 11% 5 years ago? And if you look at the period, in 2012, 2013, it was compounded 10%. Who would have thought Writing would be growing 11% double-digit core growth in the first half of the year when we first started? So there's a lot of talk about technology conversions, making -- Writing was dead, was the first series of questions I've gotten, why would I ever been on Writing, but that's obviously not true. And so there are lots of reasons if you look back at the evidence over the last 5 years, to believe that these brands will respond to investment activity and capabilities in the area of design and innovation. And our challenge as leaders is to figure out how, within the P&L, to free up the space to drive that investment forward while simultaneously delivering the margin improvement committed to in the deal. And I think it's doable. I mean, I'm excited by that. The question becomes how much growth potential is there really here? I don't know. But Q2, certainly -- Q2 and the other evidence would suggest that when we get it right, we can grow really well on these businesses, and they're really responsive. And probably the most important strategic chart for investors to look at is the one that talks about the size of these markets, our position in the markets, the relative -- the market share, the cumulative market share, the top 3 players in these categories globally and then the cost of growth. And that is a really attractive chart because it tells the story of what's possible in this set of category, these types of categories, relative to what's possible in fast-moving consumer goods, where they are far more consolidated, the top 5 have 90% of the share and the cost of growth is so high, as a consequence. And so this is a much more attractive space to be playing in if you really think about it in that way as long as you can -- you tackle the cost and release the cost in the P&L to be able to invest behind the brands. And we had a theory that these categories would be responsive to activity. We now have plenty of proof that they're responsive to activity. So it's real. This algorithm is working and it has the potential to even work harder across this broader canvas once we get through the transition period."

And so the balancing act, when you've got an operating margin as high as the one we have, is to not get too ambitious for the margin and to really think about the growth. I think we've struck the right balance up until now. We've substantially increased the amount of A&P on that business over the last 5 years. And while geographic footprint extension will require incremental investment if we don't want to mortgage investment levels at home, I'm not sure how much more. It doesn't really need, I don't think, given the competitive set, personal care levels of A&P ratios. So we're getting close. If we can get ourselves to 9%, 10% A&P ratios, I think we've got a really interesting and extendable place to be. And then I think some of the other businesses, we want to continue to work on the margin structures. So a lot of the work we're doing on costs are in businesses that have less to offer in that respect. And we have to do more. We have more work to do, that's why there's $230 million left on our Project Renewal roadmap, is because we want to get the margin flexibility into that portion of the P&L, such that we do have the ability to invest. Now in the combination, we may not choose to reapply the investment where we get the cost savings out. I mean, take that money -- Ralph let me take that money with Mark and give it to Bill and ask him to go spend it on Yankee because that's a better choice. That makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts. So we have plenty of room to go, room to run on cost on the legacy Newell business. And we have scale leverage to be captured through the integration in route-to-market, in cost to serve, in many, many places that we're going to be able to go after. And we should be able to get beyond the 500, such that we have increased firepower. The question is how quickly do we do that and how quickly are we confident enough in that outcome that we're prepared to share that with you."

The 5% organic sales growth is -- clearly came in ahead of expectations. So is it really the product line exits? There's nothing suggesting that the momentum should slow, because it looks like the guidance, which you sort of conservatively took down to about 2% to 4%, it feels a bit conservative relative to business momentum that has continued since the deal closed, particularly in JBC and JCS. So I just wanted to make sure that I was clear on that. And then secondarily, I don't know if you're prepared to comment on this today, but Yankee -- and I share your optimism there and what you can potentially do with the business. Can you talk a little bit about your willingness to expand the retail footprint, distribution opportunities, particularly abroad, potentially, product category expansion plans, leveraging that brand equity, and we've seen a little bit of that at a large mass customer in auto air fresheners. Maybe you could build upon that a little bit, and further context, the former -- or the CEO of Jarden thought that they could double the size of that business over a reasonable amount of time, which I also agree sort of felt reasonable. Maybe you can sort of comment on that a little bit with respect to the potential long-term growth rate for the business?"

So the first part of the question on sustaining a 5% growth rate on the total business, I've -- clearly, part of the reason we won't do that in the back half of the year is product line exit related. Part of it is because I think it's the prudent thing to do, given the amount of change the organization has been going through. So it's the right kind of cautious stance to take. Whether we beat that or not, time will tell. But Q2 didn't really have any material product line exits executed in it. So that's part of the discussion. I don't want to get too specific on where those exits will occur because I don't want to be disruptive, either internally or compromise potential external opportunities to sell some of these assets. So I'm cautious on that one, and I know that feels like a bit of a fudge, but I think it's actually, in your interest, in the investors' interest for me to manage it that way. On Yankee, look, the compound annual growth rate on Yankee has been around 7% for a long period of time. So if you want to double a business, all you got to do is compound the growth at 7% for 10 years. No, I'm not saying -- I'm not time-bounding how long it'll take to double the business, but that's how the math works on that. Do we believe in Yankee? Absolutely. Do we believe in Yankee as much as we believe in Writing? Yes. Will Yankee end up being right up there at the top of the list of things we want to bet on? Yes. And is there an immense opportunity here? Yes. Is it broader than fragrance candles? Work to be done to confirm, but my intuition says yes. And so we'll see. It's a big category. It's a very, very strong brand. The experience in Europe that Jarden really has led increases confidence in the ability for the business to travel. And that is one of the reasons, that, coupled with the margin structure, coupled with the ability to create beautiful products through design are a number of the reasons that it factors as a potentially really attractive play for us."

Yankee is, I don't think quite that high, but it's a pretty high quarter. And there's another element to that, which is the relative profit contribution, which is also quite high in Q4.

Our assumption is on cost that we'll be able to price cost away, over time. So any cost increases, we should be able to manage through pricing over time. In any one particular month or quarter, there'll be some lumpiness to it, but we should be able to manage that over time. And then leveraging our fixed cost that still sit up in the gross margin line through growth is the other piece. So we should grow our gross margins, and some of that gross margin improvement is going to get reinvested into the A&P line, as Mike alluded to earlier, as we look to kind of settle out at an A&P range across the whole portfolio, which should get us, ultimately, some operating income improvement."

Q1 will definitely be a dilutive quarter versus prior year because of share count, interest expense and the fact that it's not a great -- normally a big quarter for the Jarden businesses. So we -- in all of the conversations that I provided around accretion, I talked about year 1 being high single digits. Now we may do better than that, given some of the numbers we're putting up. But Q1, definitely, is going to be dilutive, needs to be built into the model that way. I look at your guys' estimates for Q1 through the first call, and I don't want to get into a specific number, but they're close to what I would think it would be and -- but we shouldn't be thinking about Q1 being a big winning quarter for us from an EPS perspective. So it definitely needs to be built into your models that way on share count, on interest expense alone. And then the other side of this is although synergies will work toward -- as a positive, as renewal savings work towards -- as a positive, but on balance, there's no way to overcome the share count. Because remember, your share count is going from 260 million to something almost double that, so not a chance we're accretive in Q1. But full year, I think you guys are pretty close, in aggregate. I don't think everybody's got their estimates in for '17. But when we get closer, I would -- you should expect us, with Q3 earnings, to provide some perspective on '17."

So clearly, there's a shift in shopping behavior underway in the U.S., and we want to reach consumers where they shop. And we also want to win with winning customers. And so those 2 principles drive the allocation of resource for us. In order to reach consumers where they shop -- when they're shopping in an e-commerce environment, we've made the determination that we need to invest in specialized skills. And we've built out a whole team of e-commerce resources from the outside that are really driving our activity plans in these areas. And so we intend to continue to step up investments in this area this year, next year, the year beyond. And this can be and should be, for Newell Brands, a differentiated capability relative to our competitive set. That does not mean we're taking resource away from our bricks-and-mortar partners. Wal-Mart is our biggest partner. A big 95% of their business with us is brick-and-mortar sales. So obviously, for all of those folks that are in that phase of striking the right balance within their business model, we need to resource of a relationship with that customer and our programming with that customer in a way that fits their strategic roadmap. And so that's the moment we're in with respect to e-commerce. We expect to disproportionately grow our e-commerce business, relative to bricks-and-mortar, and we want to grow ahead of the market growth in the channel because we want to have our share of market in the e-commerce channel's portal greater than our share of market in brick-and-mortar. Because as shoppers shift to that channel, we do not want a negative share mix effect on the aggregate market. And so really, really important, one of the dislocating ideas and the most important things we do as a company over the next 5 to 10 years is to be in front in this space. 
Thank you, everybody. I think that's our last question. I would just end by saying, and this is probably a message to my -- to our team. I'm incredibly proud of our team for what we did in the second quarter. A deal like this has the potential to be incredibly distractive, and the team was able to focus on delivery in an unwavering way that inspires confidence in our ability to really play for the upside in the combination.

Please refer to our earnings release and the most recent Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for additional information concerning risk factors. Newell undertakes no responsibility to update any forward-looking statements. 
Let me remind you also that we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures today, including those identified in the tables of the earnings press release. We provide these non-GAAP measures because management believes that providing insights on the measures discussed enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results. Specifically, the biggest differences between the GAAP and non-GAAP metrics this quarter are onetime charges and other expenses related to the Jarden transaction, including inventory step-up, acquisition-related amortization and other transaction costs. 
In addition, we're defining Newell Brands' core sales as if the Jarden combination occurred April 15 of last year, meaning we are including last year's Jarden results in our 2015 base. Waddington, Jostens and Elmer's are not included in core sales until their respective 1-year anniversaries.

I'm very pleased to report a strong set of second quarter results with positive momentum on the number of fronts. We drove very competitive levels of growth in the quarter, cost synergies and Project Renewal savings are ramping and right where we expected them to be. And cash flow was strong enabling us to pay down $750 million of our $1.5 billion term loan. So a strong start as Newell Brands. And as a consequence, we reaffirmed full year guidance this morning. 
The Q2 headlines are as follows: net sales have more than doubled as a result of the Jarden transaction to $3.86 billion. Core sales grew 5%, led by strong performances in Writing, Baby and Parenting, Food & Beverage, Yankee Candle & Appliances. 
On both a reported and normalized basis, gross margins and operating margins were right in line with our expectations. Reported EPS was $0.30 per diluted share. Normalized EPS was $0.78, up nearly 22% versus prior year. And operating cash flow was nearly $600 million. So all in, a very good set of second quarter results with continued momentum in our key businesses and a lot of energy and excitement around the opportunities ahead. 
Let me hand the call over to Ralph to go through the results in more detail, and then I'll return to provide an update on our road map forward and the perspective on our outlook for the balance of 2016."

As Mike noted, we were pleased with our second quarter results with strong reported end-core sales growth. Gross and operating margin came in consistent with our expectations, and we are on track with our deleveraging plan. A strong operating cash flow allowed us to pay down about $0.75 billion in debt. Overall, a very good start. 
Turning to our detailed review. Second quarter reported net sales were $3.86 billion, 147% increase versus last year, largely from the contribution of the Jarden transaction. Core sales increased 5%. Reported gross margin was 28.4% compared with 39.8% in the prior year, largely due to a $334 million inventory step-up related to the Jarden transaction. There will be a similar step-up impact of around $130 million in Q3, as we expect substantially all of the remaining inventory to turn. 
Normalized gross margin was 37.2%, down 280 basis points versus last year. The decline is due to the negative mix effect from the Jarden acquisition and the deconsolidation of Venezuela as well as the impact of unfavorable currency, which more than offset productivity and pricing. 
Reported SG&A expense was $947 million or 24.5% of sales, down 70 basis points over last year. Normalized SG&A expense was $827 million or 21.4% of sales, down 260 basis points versus prior year, thanks to the mix impact from the inclusion of the Jarden legacy businesses, which have historically carried a lower SG&A spend rate, also benefiting from Project Renewable savings and early Jarden deal synergies. 
Advertising and promotion spending at the Newell Rubbermaid legacy businesses increased 50 basis points in the quarter, driven by incremental investments behind new products, including Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens, Mr. Sketch Scented Crayons, Rubbermaid FreshWorks Produce Saver and Graco Extend2Fit convertible car seats. 
Reported operating margin was 3.6% of sales compared with 13.8% in the prior year. The decrease was largely driven by the onetime inventory step-up, acquisition-related amortization costs and other expenses incurred in connection with the Jarden deal. Normalized operating margin declined 20 basis points to 15.8%. Interest expense of $127 million rose $109 million year-over-year, reflecting a $10 billion increase in debt, resulting from the financing of the Jarden and Elmer's transactions. 
Our reported tax rate was 20.3% compared with 22.7% in the prior year. The normalized tax rate was 29.2% compared with 24.5% in the prior year, attributable to the mix effect of the Jarden acquisition and geographic earnings. 
Reported EPS was $0.30 per share compared with $0.55 in the prior year, due largely to a number of acquisition-related charges and expenses. We also had an increased interest expense and a higher share count. These Jarden transaction charges were partially offset by the contribution from the Jarden and Elmer's acquisitions and a gain on the day sale of the Décor business. Normalized EPS, which excludes the transaction-related expenses, among other things, was $0.78, a 21.9% increase versus last year. The improvement was primarily driven by strong sales growth, the contribution from the Jarden and Elmer's acquisitions and Project Renewal savings. These benefits more than offset increased advertising and promotion support, negative foreign currency, increased interest expense and increased shares outstanding. 
I will now move on to our segment results. Starting with Writing, net sales increased 15.8%. Core sales increased 11.3%, driven by strong double-digit growth in North America. We had a very good start with the Back-to-School sell-in, thanks to innovation and increased advertising and promotion. 
Net sales in the Home Solutions segment decreased 1.1% as strong growth in our Food & Beverage business was more than offset by the negative impact of the divested Décor business and planned exits in the low-margin Consumer Storage business and unfavorable foreign currency. Core sales grew 1.7%. 
Tools net sales declined 3.8%, reflecting continued weakness in Brazil and negative foreign currency. Core sales declined 2.3% as growth in North America was offset by Brazil macro challenges and industrial sector softness in China. 
Net sales in Commercial Products declined 7.9%, primarily due to the divestiture of the Rubbermaid medical cart business and unfavorable foreign currency. Core sales declined 1.4%, reflecting softness driven by complexity-reduction initiatives in the North American distributor channel and in Brazil due to macro challenges in that country. 
Our Baby segment grew net sales 12.4%, thanks to continued strong momentum at Graco North America, driven by innovation and advertising and promotion. Core sales grew 11.1%. 
In my discussion of the legacy Jarden segments, I will refer to post-transaction net and core sales compared against pro forma results for the same period in 2015. Post-transaction net sales in branded consumables increased 36.8%, reflecting the Waddington acquisition. Core sales increased 7.8%, due largely to strong growth in Yankee Candle and Home & Family in Europe. 
Net sales in Consumer Solutions increased 4.9%. Core sales increased 8.3%, driven by strong growth in kitchen appliances in North America, Europe and Latin America. Outdoor solutions net sales increased 53.6%, due largely to the Jostens acquisition. Core sales increased 50 basis points, reflecting strong growth from Pure Fishing, offset by weather-related softness in the ski businesses. Net sales in Process Solutions increased 20 basis points. Core sales increased 50 basis points. 
Let's now turn to Q2 core sales by geography. Importantly, North America, which represents 79% of total sales delivered strong core growth of 6.7%. In EMEA, core sales grew 2.6%. Latin America core sales increased 1.9%, reflecting solid growth across the region with the exception of Brazil. Asia Pacific core sales declined 7.7%, due primarily to softness in branded consumables in that region.
Moving on to cash flow. During Q2, we reported almost $600 million in operating cash flow compared with $102 million in the prior year, reflecting the contribution from Jarden, including Jostens and Waddington, improved operating results and favorable working capital movements. We also generated $236 million from the sale of Décor. We returned $92 million in dividends to shareholders. We also paid down debt by $750 million, bringing our quarter-end debt balance down to $13 billion. We remain confident in our ability to reach our leverage goal of 3 to 3.5x in the next 2 to 3 years. So a very good start to the quarter and with progress on many important areas. 
With that, I'll now turn the call back to Mike."

Since coming together as Newell Brands, we've been hard at work getting to know each other and laying the groundwork for accelerated value creation. Together, we have a strong portfolio of leading brands and significantly greater scale across a number of key channels, customers and geographies with the opportunity to leverage these assets in a bigger way for expanded reach, visibility, impact and growth. We've identified a number of new growth opportunities and put many into action that will materialize through channel cross-sell, accelerated international deployment and strengthened innovation delivery over time. 
We're also making very good progress on costs. As previously shared, we've committed to achieve an incremental $300 million in Project Renewal savings over the next few years. And against that target, we've delivered $70 million in incremental savings in the first half of 2016.
We also have a clear line of sight to the $500 million of cost synergies with significant upside potential. The synergy teams have hit the ground running and are now in full flight with early successes on procurement, where we've already realized $40 million in annualized savings. We're quite confident in our ability to deliver the targeted synergies given our track record of success on Project Renewal. 
We're also making good progress on developing the new strategy for Newell Brands. A few weeks ago, my leadership team spent time together discussing the choices ahead and the next steps in our transformation that will flow from that strategy. Critical decisions about portfolio roles and category and geographic priorities were at the center of our discussions. Mark Tarchetti and his team led by Russ Torres led the dialogue and much of the thinking. As you'd expect, if you're familiar with how we work, those discussions were underpinned by rigorous analysis. The insights generated will frame a set of sharp portfolio, resource allocation and organizational design choices. In early August, we'll solicit input from the Board of Directors. And with the benefit of the board's perspective incorporated, this new strategic framework will shape our activities and investment choices from 2017 forward.
Let me now turn back and take a look at the balance of 2016. This morning, we reaffirmed Newell Brands’ 2016 full year guidance. We continue to expect 2016 full year Newell Brands core sales growth of 3% to 4% and full year normalized EPS of $2.75 to $2.90. Despite a strong start to the year, we continued to believe that both full year guidance metrics appropriately bracket the most likely outcome from the full year, which is right in the middle of both guidance ranges. 
Where we actually fall in the full year guidance range will depend on 3 key factors. The first factor relates to the success of the second half 2016 drive periods of Back-to-School on Writing and the holidays on Yankee Candle. We are well positioned against both. Importantly, both businesses have leadership positions in large, growing global markets with tremendous opportunity to still capture market share both in their markets at home and in their markets abroad. Yankee and Writing also have above-fleet average margin structures, and so their performance can move the needle for Newell Brands in a meaningful way. 
On Writing, we have tremendous momentum. The latest 12-week U.S. value market share through the middle of July, as measured by IRI, is up over 140 basis points with dollars sales growth of 7%. In Q2, Writing had an extraordinary sell-in for the Back-to-School season, delivering about $15 million more revenue in this key sell-in period that we anticipated. While the revenue and the associated income will reverse out in Q3, the strength of the sell-in and the programming and innovation in place bodes well for display activity and merchandising-driven sell-out in Q3. 
As we complete the Back-to-School drive period on Writing, we'll turn our attention to the holidays. The Yankee Candle team is gearing up for the holidays with strong merchandising plans and with new products on their way to retail. We're pressing forward in a new effort to broaden distribution even further in the U.S. and Canada with incremental placements that leverage Newell Brands' route to market in adjacent channels that could potentially positively impact Q4 2016 and, more importantly, 2017. 
We're also exploring ways to enhance brand investment in the fourth quarter and certainly into 2017. Importantly, if we find ourselves with full year earnings upside beyond the midpoint to the full year normalized EPS guidance range, we will likely reinvest a substantial portion of that upside back into the Yankee Candle business for strength in consumer impact around the holidays and positive momentum into 2017. 
The second factor that could influence where we fall on the full year guidance range is the delivery of Project Renewal cost savings and the transaction cost synergies. We have a clear line of sight to the full year Project Renewal incremental savings, and as planned, we expect to deliver well over $100 million in incremental savings this year. With respect to the Jarden transaction cost synergies, we are well on our way to deliver our $50 million to $80 million full year synergy cost guidance with a good probability of delivering towards the high end of that range. So we're on track and foresee no issues here and perhaps some opportunity. 
The third factor that could influence where we land in the full year guidance range is product line exits. To be clear, our full year guidance reflects our intention to actively manage the portfolio. In 2016, we expect to begin to exit certain product lines with roughly $250 million to $300 million of revenue over the 2 -- the next 2 to 3 years. These are businesses that have low to no likelihood of featuring as strategic priorities for the company. As we've stated, our goal would be to sell these assets, if possible, rather than exit, and we hope to be able to find a buyer for some. If we're unsuccessful at finding buyers, the process of exiting these businesses will begin as early as the third quarter. As mentioned previously, we do not expect a material financial impact related to potential product line exits. 
While we do not provide quarterly guidance, I do want to provide some context for the flow of our business in the second half. Given the likely Q3 reversal of the Writing incremental Q2 Back-to-School sell-in and the possible Q3 timing of product line exits, we expect Q3 core sales growth rate to be near the bottom of our 3% to 4% full year guidance range. In Q4, we expect growth rates to recover towards the midpoint of our full year range. We also expect normalized EPS to skew roughly 10% higher in Q4 relative to Q3 as a result of the holiday season peaking of the profitable Yankee Candle business. 
So in closing, we've had a strong start to the year on many fronts. We successfully completed the most transformative deal in the history of either Newell Rubbermaid or Jarden. Despite the potential for distraction that a transaction of this size could create, we grew core sales 5% and delivered normalized EPS growth of nearly 22% in the second quarter. We've made good early progress in the integration of the 2 companies, while simultaneously taking a big step forward on Project Renewal. With the continued positive momentum in our business, we're well on our way to delivering our 2016 full year financial outlook. We've committed to reduce the leverage ratio to 3 to 3.5x over the next 2 to 3 years. And in the second quarter, we paid down $750 million of our $1.5 billion term loan. And our work to prioritize our investment choices and realign resource against the capabilities that can differentiate us and the brands with the greatest potential is well under way, setting the stage for future acceleration of growth and value creation. 
I want to thank our people for their hard work and unwavering focus on delivery. Performance is an everyday thing, and I'm very proud of the determination and the drive for results, particularly in the midst of increasing change. Together, we're building a bigger, stronger, faster-growing and more profitable company with a portfolio of leading brands that compete in large-growing unconsolidated global categories that are responsive to innovation and brand support and also have a low cost of growth given the lack of market consolidation. Our confidence is high because our team has done this kind of work before. We are incredibly well positioned to build these brands and energized by the opportunity to simultaneously create a ton of value for our shareholders. And we're driven by the prospect of building one of the leading consumer goods companies in the world, a company that helps consumers live better every day where they live, learn, work and play. That is both the promise and the potential of Newell Brands. 
With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions and pass the call back to Ebony."

This is a highly intense, operationally focused group of business unit leaders that I've had the opportunity to engage with. And in fact, we just came back from, I guess it was about the week ago now, maybe 1.5 weeks ago, we spent the whole week going through the 2016 back-half plans and the outlook for 2017 business unit by business unit. And it was full on week, every day, 5 days’ worth of plowing through operating reviews. And I came away from those reviews really encouraged. There's some great brands here. If we do our job and deliver beyond the $500 million in synergies that we've committed to, we're going to release a lot of ability to invest back into the business. If I said -- if there was one observation I'd make, it's that while we've got the same level of operational intensity, the P&L on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid side gives us much more flexibly to invest back into the business. So the combination will release a lot of costs that should enable us to extend some of the core capabilities that differentiate -- have the potential to differentiate us like insights, design, innovation delivery, e-commerce across the total enterprise and also the ability to put more advertising and promotion investment by -- behind the businesses with the greatest potential to create value on the legacy Jarden side of the family. Obviously, I talk a lot about Yankee Candle because I know it really well. This is obviously a crown jewel in the company. It's a great acquisition that Mark and Ian did. There's tremendous opportunity to build our footprint there. We love our Writing business. Obviously, we're going to continue to invest across that. Food & beverage has done really well. The combination of the assets between Newell and Jarden on Baby create a really powerful platform for growth going forward. The -- and there's some -- and the Appliance business, you can see how responsive the Appliance business is to activity and merchandising. These are great brands, Oster, Mr. Coffee, Sunbeam. These are terrific assets, and some of them even stronger outside of the U.S. than in the U.S. And so I'm really encouraged by the possibilities here. All of our choices will drive off the strategic work that we're doing today. So we will establish a strategic framework that puts relative priorities in place on these businesses. Many of the Jarden businesses could benefit from the design capability we've built out, and we intend to apply that design capability more broadly to help support innovation delivery over time. And then there's an entrepreneurial spirit in many of the Jarden businesses that I think we'll look to figure out a way to preserve within the context of the operating model we'll eventually build out. Businesses like Jostens are really interesting. There's -- they have their own ecosystem and culture. The Jostens business I like in terms of its scale, profitability and ability to spin off cash to fund other potential investments in other parts of the portfolio. So our choices will pivot off the portfolio prioritization work that's under way today. I'm encouraged by what I see. There's always opportunity to do work. I think we have work to do on Coleman to strengthen the brand. It's a great asset with a tremendous amount of equity, but I think the portfolio could be broadened and the innovation capability we have could be applied to premium-ize certain aspects of that business in a way that would give it more growth potential. We have to work our way through in all the winter weather-related businesses the hangover from last winter which we've got baked into our guidance. So that will just be a matter of time and clearing of inventories in certain parts of the business to get ourselves through to a normal year. This won't be the normal year for any of the winter-sensitive businesses. But all in all, my impression is incredibly positive. And I'm really excited, and I think the team is energized by the possibilities. It won't be simple. We've got a lot of change that the organization is going to go through over the next 6 months and into 2017. And we're going to have to do our best to deliver while simultaneously changing. And we've demonstrated the ability to do that. That will be the key kind of executional issue that we’ll have to lead the organization through. But I'm confident because of the experience we have in doing things like this that we will get through that period of change and really come out a much stronger company on the backside of it with more growth potential and more potential to create value. That was a pithy answer, Dara, to a very straightforward question. But it's probably my favorite question to answer."

Growing company creates great opportunities for personal development, and we're going to ensure that our people have that opportunity. My team is set now. We've talked about potentially one other job, which is a supply chain leadership role. And I think as we go forward, we'll be looking and exploring to -- and figuring out whether there's somebody that can plug into our team dynamic, which I really love now. I'm impressed with the talent that I've got on both sides. I think the areas for improvement, we're always going to want to strengthen our commercial operations and strengthen and broaden our customer reach and channel reach in our selling organization. So that will be an opportunity for investment, not because we're not happy with the people, I just want to broaden the direct sell-in capabilities of the organization. And supply chain is probably the other area where we'll -- we want to invest to strengthen our capabilities. We've managed the supply chain in a very disaggregated way, and quite frankly, pretty well. But there are opportunities across the network that we're going to want to create a leadership catalyst to activate over time.

On the -- Dara, on the IT side, significant opportunities, a lot of focus in the very short term here is on building some of the infrastructure on the legacy Jarden businesses on just visibility to things like daily sales, point-of-sale information, those kinds of things. That information sort of exists across their group, but we need to develop it in a more systematic way to get visibility to that kind of across the company and in the center as well on a more daily basis. So that's a big effort going on now. Also, as we've developed and formulate the portfolio and the sets of choices that we make, we'll be leveraging what I think is a great platform on SAP that the legacy Newell business developed, and we'll begin to make some migrations to further leverage that platform over time. That would be the second piece. And I would just say the third big effort that is really getting started now, it really relates to synergies. But there's a IT infrastructure opportunity that we can really unlock some value on cost by harmonizing a lot of the, I'll call it, back-of-the-house support for running servers and telecommunications and all those kinds of things.

Writing benefitted from a couple of things in the second quarter, and this is an important point to register. We were very successful with the sell-in, which I love because that -- at this time of year, that's a really constructive thing to do because you force all this inventory to the floor in retailers, which is how you get the merchandising sell-out. So we're really excited about that we nailed Q2, the sell-in period. It's -- there are 2 things underlying the share gains we're experiencing around and the growth we're -- the underlying growth we're getting in the business. And one of them is the innovation agenda and the brand support agenda that goes with that. InkJoy Gel is going to be a huge hit. You can already see it in the consumption data. I'm really excited to see how it plays post Back-to-School and see how much of a step change we get from it because the product is beautiful. The ink system is unique and differentiated. For anybody who loves gel pens, it's beautiful, smooth write, but it doesn't smear because it's got an ink that dries 3 times faster than the next leading competitor. So it's got a really differentiated proposition. So I think the innovation agenda is going really well. We have also extended the footprint of this business. As you know, our progress in Mexico in Writing is really pretty extraordinary. Our progress in Canada where we are underdeveloped is really quite strong. Bob King, who runs the Canadian business has done a great job on Writing over the last 18 months to build out our footprint and build the business. And as you know, we've invested to launch Sharpie in the U.K. about 1.5 years ago. That's going really well. We've got great presence at Tesco and Sainsbury's in the mass retailers in the U.K., and there's opportunity still to be had there. And we will leverage the Jarden business going forward to apply the same principles in France and Germany, leveraging their mass retail footprint. But I think those are -- the current reality is U.K., it's Canada, it's Mexico and it's the obvious success we've had in the U.S. Part of the success is driven by this macro trend on adult coloring, which has helped Sharpie Fine Point, it's helped Flair and obviously Prismacolor, which is right in the center of that big trend. And that trend continues as a tailwind to this business. That's probably worth 1.5, 2 points of our growth that macro event, which really has nothing to do with our marketing, but we're extremely well positioned to take advantage of it. So the real question there is, is this a sustainable trend or is this a fad that will ebb over time. That's why I always say to you guys, you should not plan Writing at double-digit core growth. You should build your models with Writing in the sort of 5% to 7% range, which I think is the right place to be. Now we've got all kinds of exciting things ahead on Writing. I've got -- if I was with you, Bill, I'd give you the Chinese product that's set to launch, both InkJoy, regular InkJoy, InkJoy Gel, and Sharpie, in Shanghai in the fourth quarter. And the product looks great. I've seen the videos of the sell-in discussions with distributors. That went great. So we're excited about the prospects for broadening the footprint over time both in France and Germany most likely, leveraging Jarden's mass retail footprint and obviously, in China, where we've made the commitment. So there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic ahead on this business. And it's -- and as you know, it's a beautiful category, but lots of share consolidation opportunity around the world."

I mean, I certainly understand it was weak because of weather, but I think what Ralph had said was had to do with winter sports. My understanding was winter sports was really kind of third quarter, fourth quarter sell-in. There's very little sell-through in the back half unless the kind of excess inventory set with the retailers. So just could you help me understand that? And then was there anything connected to your commentary about Coleman that you saw some weakness in the quarter on that business that needs improvement?"

Within outdoor solutions, we have a bunch of different moving parts. The Pure Fishing business did really well. But anything that's winter-sensitive is dealing with a hangover on inventories from the sell-in from last year and working through that. Within ski, K2 is probably more challenged than vocal. Vocal had a pretty good quarter in Q2, but there clearly are winter weather-related hangovers in any business that ships a lot in, in the back half of the year hoping to have it consumed out in the front half of the year. So we're definitely dealing with a hangover there. Coleman is a challenging business at the moment. It's not that we don't believe in it. We do actually. It reminds me a lot of where Graco was when I started in that -- the brand has unbelievable legacy equity. It's probably -- we'll find out before I -- maybe before September, we'll get these results. But we put all of these brands into equity testing, so we're going to get relative metrics that we can compare across the total portfolio. I'm betting that Coleman stands out. It's probably one of the strongest brands from an equity perspective in the whole portfolio. I think Oster will be there. I think Mr. Coffee, despite people's preconceived notions, will be there. Obviously, Yankee, I think, will do very well. But I'd bet you Coleman's top of the league table within the legacy Jarden portfolio as was Graco and Rubbermaid. But there's work to do on Coleman because too much of its portfolio sits in the good segment of good, better, best. And that's where pricing and margin contraction becomes an issue if you don't have a broadened footprint. And so the Coleman business, I think it's going to have an okay year, won’t have a brilliant year because it's stuck with too much of its portfolio in that segment of the market, and that's the segment of the market where you get a lot of pressure. And if you don't have differentiation in your product offerings relative to store level, store brands, then you run the risk of always being under pressure. And that's the cycle. I just guess I'd describe it as that's the cycle that Coleman's currently in. And we're going to have to address that, and we'll address it in the same way we did with Graco. We'll work through. It will take some time. This will be one of those projects that takes multiple years to get right. It's going to require investment in insights. It's going to require investment in design and in innovation. We're a big enough company where we can afford to take a margin contraction and hit on a big brand like that in order to get it reset, but this is going to be one of our big projects. It's actually very exciting because I think the brand has tremendous potential. But we need to get it into a more sustainable pattern of strategic growth, and that will take some time. So it's all hands on deck on that business. It's not a crisis. It's just an opportunity underleveraged. But this is where the best of our model can be applied. And I think it will be really interesting to see what we'll able to do with it over a couple of years."

But I wouldn't expect us to be exiting 1% to 2% of the business every year. This is the portion of the business that probably doesn't fit the model or doesn't have real opportunity. It won't ever get up on the list of investment priorities we'd make, whereas it may be interesting to somebody else. Our priority for that $250 million and $300 million, if we were in a situation where we don't have to bifurcate a trademark like the Rubbermaid situation where you can't really sell the stuff you don't really want without licensing the brand, which I'm not prepared to do. In situations where you don't have that scenario, obviously, we'd love to find a buyer for these businesses rather than exit them, but I'm not clear at all whether we would be able to find a buyer for some of them. And so that's why I've laid out this issue of $250 million to $300 million of product line exits. If we can sell them, we'll sell them because that's a much more constructive way to manage the exit of those businesses. But it's not part of some broader plan to wean the portfolio down. We may make in the future strategic choices about the portfolio, but it won't be in the context of businesses that don't necessarily have any role within the portfolio. It'll be about bartering one part of the portfolio for maybe something stronger that's out there that we could acquire in."

I think Coleman, actually -- the point on Coleman is it's probably an and that we want to attack the cost structure, at the same time -- although the cost structure is pretty lean, at the same time it's investing in other areas to create more growth potential and maybe more margin trajectory in it. So that one's a give and a take. There are others where there's opportunity to go to market more efficiently. And part of the outcome of the portfolio choices work will be to articulate which businesses should benefit from the full cost model and which businesses could be managed more entrepreneurially and more efficiently. And so there will be change across the entire enterprise, with different bits of the portfolio getting different -- playing different roles and, therefore, having different models with respect to the cost structure. And there are some of the Newell legacy businesses that will be moved around with respect to prioritization. So there's a lot of cost -- work going on. There's opportunities within businesses, and then there's opportunities across business -- across the enterprise, and we're doing both sets of work."

I actually think Mr. Coffee and Oster and Sunbeam are excellent brands. We're going to find out that they have a lot of potential. The challenge in the business was the margin structure of the business. And so will this feature at the top of the list when you've got assets like Writing or assets like Yankee? I think that we're going to need to continue to think about how to get operating margin into this business so that we can right resource it. And I do think that there's a huge opportunity in the emerging markets in appliances as people move into the middle class. I think there's a real opportunity to tap into moms' needs in those countries to simplify life a bit, and the portfolio fits right into that space. But there are also opportunities in appliances in the developed world. So there's a lot of potential here. Our challenge will be how much investment can you put into it given the operating margins in the business, and we'll have to work through that. We'll look for the efficiencies where we can get them, again, while increasing investment, probably in insights and design to help the innovation funnel along. In the short term, I believe, there are distribution opportunities and merchandising opportunities that can sustain solid growth. I wouldn't build a model around 7%, 8% growth. That's a big number on a big business. But high -- mid-single digits maybe, maybe in that 4% to 5% range, that's probably the right place kind of to build that business model out.

So we're excited by the prospect of trying to get a Yankee Candle within arm's reach of as many consumers as we can. And so that, clearly, is the near-end opportunity. And Newell's footprint channel breadth offers some opportunity for those guys, just in the same way that Coleman's channel breadth offers opportunity for the beverage business. And we've made pitches already to key customers on beverages, leveraging the Coleman route to market and relationships with customers. So we should see wins quickly, to be honest with you.

I mean, the Yankee story is really a pretty incredible story about extending a brand and taking risks in geographies. And I think we haven't been this courageous as that team has been, and Jim, Martin and Ian were on that business after they acquired it. So there's an important lesson learned there for us, legacy Newell Rubbermaid folk. I think there's opportunity connected to applying some of the lessons learned we had through the Growth Game Plan to a set of assets that Jarden had available to it. And I think the fact that we will manage the portfolio in a different way where we don't just -- we don't look at individual businesses with specific accountabilities. We make trade-offs on investments across the landscape. We manage resources dynamically horizontally across businesses more actively than the Jarden team. That will give us the flexibility to make some investments that wouldn't have otherwise happened in a Jarden model, like on Coleman. This is going to be a 1- or 2-year series of investments we have to make. We'll try to fund it within Coleman, but the likely answer is that it'll be funded from outside of Coleman. And we'll mortgage, rip costs out of corporate or do something that enables us to make those investment bets and take a step back on EBITDA margin while we're fixing the business. That's the thing that we will do differently. So there's really different business conditions and different things that can be learned from both sides of the new company, and we really intend to do that. I have no pride of authorship other than things I believe are important and applicable. But if there are things on the other side that I wish I'd done on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid businesses, I'm going to be selfish and take them and go do it. So -- and there's plenty of examples of that. When I said at the very beginning, in December, that we're going to take the best of both, I really meant that, best of both talent, best of both ideas for how to go to market, best of both sets of learnings. And we're going to apply it across the enterprise."

Look, I think, long term, it's a very exciting set of possibilities. I think in the next -- what we've said in terms of guidance on core growth for this year and next is 3% of 4%, and we're very unlikely to change that guidance because there's a lot of work to do within the portfolio that will both help the growth agenda, but some things that will -- given how we define core sales, potentially hurt the growth agenda. So we're going to work through that over the first 18 months. And I have a very long view on our agenda in the company we're trying to build. And I think we get growth acceleration as we get through this period, this transition period of change and portfolio work. But we haven't committed to what that is. But certainly, Q2, where there was less portfolio activity, is encouraging. So that tells us a little bit about what's possible, and that's without the benefit of applying the best of what we could potentially apply from a capability standpoint. I do think the things to look at, if you want to get a sense of what's possible, who would've thought Baby would be growing at 11% 5 years ago? And if you look at the period, in 2012, 2013, it was compounded 10%. Who would have thought Writing would be growing 11% double-digit core growth in the first half of the year when we first started? So there's a lot of talk about technology conversions, making -- Writing was dead, was the first series of questions I've gotten, why would I ever bet on Writing, but that's obviously not true. And so there are lots of reasons if you look back at the evidence over the last 5 years, to believe that these brands will respond to investment activity and capabilities in the area of design and innovation. And our challenge as leaders is to figure out how, within the P&L, to free up the space to drive that investment forward while simultaneously delivering the margin improvement committed to in the deal. And I think it's doable. I mean, I'm excited by that. The question becomes how much growth potential is there really here? I don't know. But Q2, certainly -- Q2 and the other evidence would suggest that when we get it right, we can grow really well on these businesses, and they're really responsive. And probably the most important strategic chart for investors to look at is the one that talks about the size of these markets, our position in the markets, the relative -- the market share, the cumulative market share, the top 3 players in these categories globally and then the cost of growth. And that is a really attractive chart because it tells the story of what's possible in this set of category, these types of categories, relative to what's possible in fast-moving consumer goods, where they are far more consolidated, the top 5 have 90% of the share and the cost of growth is so high as a consequence. And so this is a much more attractive space to be playing in if you really think about it in that way as long as you can -- you tackle the cost and release the cost in the P&L to be able to invest behind the brands. And we had a theory that these categories would be responsive to activity. We now have plenty of proof that they're responsive to activity. So it's real. This algorithm is working and it has the potential to even work harder across this broader canvas once we get through the transition period."

And so the balancing act, when you've got an operating margin as high as the one we have, is to not get too ambitious for the margin and to really think about the growth. I think we've struck the right balance up until now. We've substantially increased the amount of A&P in that business over the last 5 years. And while geographic footprint extension will require incremental investment if we don't want to mortgage investment levels at home, I'm not sure how much more. It doesn't really need, I don't think, given the competitive set, personal care levels of A&P ratios. So we're getting close. If we can get ourselves to 9%, 10% A&P ratios, I think we've got a really interesting and extendable place to be. And then I think some of the other businesses, we want to continue to work on the margin structures. So a lot of the work we're doing on costs are in businesses that have less to offer in that respect. And we have to do more. We have more work to do, that's why there's $230 million left on our Project Renewal road map, is because we want to get the margin flexibility into that portion of the P&L, such that we do have the ability to invest. Now in the combination, we may not choose to reapply the investment where we get the cost savings out. I may take that money -- Ralph and I may take that money with Mark and give it to Bill and ask him to go spend it on Yankee because that's a better choice. That makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts. So we have plenty of room to go, room to run on cost on the legacy Newell business. And we have scale leverage to be captured through the integration in route-to-market, in cost to serve, in many, many places that we're going to be able to go after. And we should be able to get beyond the 500, such that we have increased firepower. The question is how quickly do we do that and how quickly are we confident enough in that outcome that we're prepared to share that with you."

So I just wanted to make sure that I was clear on that. And then secondarily, I don't know if you're prepared to comment on this today, but Yankee -- and I share your optimism there and what you can potentially do with the business. Can you talk a little bit about your willingness to expand the retail footprint, distribution opportunities, particularly abroad, potentially, product category expansion plans, leveraging that brand equity, and we've seen a little bit of that at a large mass customer in auto air fresheners. Maybe you could build upon that a little bit, and further context, the former -- or the CEO of Jarden thought that they could double the size of that business over a reasonable amount of time, which I also agree sort of felt reasonable.

So the first part of the question on sustaining a 5% growth rate on the total business, I've -- clearly, part of the reason we won't do that in the back half of the year is product line exit related. Part of it is because I think it's the prudent thing to do, given the amount of change the organization has been going through. So it's the right kind of cautious stance to take. Whether we beat that or not, time will tell. But Q2 didn't really have any material product line exits executed in it. So that's part of the discussion. I don't want to get too specific on where those exits will occur because I don't want to be disruptive, either internally or compromise potential external opportunities to sell some of these assets. So I'm cautious on that one, and I know that feels like a bit of a fudge, but I think it's actually, in your interest, in the investors' interest for me to manage it that way. On Yankee, look, the compound annual growth rate on Yankee has been around 7% for a long period of time. So if you want to double a business, all you got to do is compound the growth at 7% for 10 years. Now I'm not saying -- I'm not time-bounding how long it'll take to double the business, but that's how the math works on that. Do we believe in Yankee? Absolutely. Do we believe in Yankee as much as we believe in Writing? Yes. Will Yankee end up being right up there at the top of the list of things we want to bet on? Yes. And is there an immense opportunity here? Yes. Is it broader than fragrance candles? Work to be done to confirm, but my intuition says yes. And so we'll see. It's a big category. It's a very, very strong brand. The experience in Europe that Jarden really has led increases confidence in the ability for the business to travel. And that is one of the reasons, that, coupled with the margin structure, coupled with the ability to create beautiful products through design are a number of the reasons that it factors as a potentially really attractive play for us."

But it wouldn't surprise me that we would want somewhere near 5% across the total landscape. There are portions of the business where we really have learned, either it doesn't work and therefore we'd be better off pivoting that investment to selling expense on the legacy Newell businesses. And then there's specific businesses within the Jarden footprint that really we wouldn't put big A&P behind, Process Solutions being one of them, and there's some other businesses as well.

I think the way to think about that is, once you look at it on a kind of pro forma basis, so that there's no mix effect of the combination of the businesses, we'll look to grow our gross margins over time through a combination of driving innovation and mix. Our assumption is on cost that we'll be able to price cost away, over time. So any cost increases, we should be able to manage through pricing over time. In any one particular month or quarter, there'll be some lumpiness to it, but we should be able to manage that over time. And then leveraging our fixed costs that still sit up in the gross margin line through growth is the other piece. So we should grow our gross margins, and some of that gross margin improvement is going to get reinvested into the A&P line, as Mike alluded to earlier, as we look to kind of settle out at an A&P range across the whole portfolio, which should get us, ultimately, some operating income improvement."

Jostens, interestingly enough, a little sound bite, grew in the third -- in the second quarter, which is really important and good news. But I think the way to think about it is that Jostens' growth rate will be dilutive to the overall core growth rate of the company because we don't expect Jostens to be much more than a 1% to 2% growth business. So you have to build that into your thinking as well. And Waddington has some interesting opportunities. So I wouldn't declare which way a Waddington will break.

Q1 will definitely be a dilutive quarter versus prior year because of share count, interest expense and the fact that it's not a great -- normally a big quarter for the Jarden businesses. So we -- in all of the conversations that I provided around accretion, I talked about year 1 being high single digits. Now we may do better than that, given some of the numbers we're putting up. But Q1, definitely, is going to be dilutive, needs to be built into the model that way. I look at your guys' estimates for Q1 through the first call, and I don't want to get into a specific number, but they're close to what I would think it would be and -- but we shouldn't be thinking about Q1 being a big winning quarter for us from an EPS perspective. So it definitely needs to be built into your models that way on share count, on interest expense alone. And then the other side of this is although synergies will work toward -- as a positive, as will renewal savings work towards -- as a positive, but on balance, there's no way to overcome the share count. Because remember, your share count is going from 260 million to something almost double that, so not a chance we're accretive in Q1. But full year, I think you guys are pretty close, in aggregate. I don't think everybody's got their estimates in for '17. But when we get closer, I would -- you should expect us, with Q3 earnings, to provide some perspective on '17."

So clearly, there's a shift in shopping behavior under way in the U.S., and we want to reach consumers where they shop. And we also want to win with winning customers. And so those 2 principles drive the allocation of resource for us. In order to reach consumers where they shop -- when they're shopping in an e-commerce environment, we've made the determination that we need to invest in specialized skills. And we've built out a whole team of e-commerce resources from the outside that are really driving our activity plans in these areas. And so we intend to continue to step up investment in this area this year, next year, the year beyond. And this can be and should be, for Newell Brands, a differentiated capability relative to our competitive set. That does not mean we're taking resource away from our bricks-and-mortar partners. Wal-Mart is our biggest partner. A big 95% of their business with us is brick-and-mortar still. So obviously, for all of those folks that are in that phase of striking the right balance within their business model, we need to resource our relationship with that customer and our programming with that customer in a way that fits their strategic road map. And so that's the moment we're in with respect to e-commerce. We expect to disproportionately grow our e-commerce business relative to bricks-and-mortar, and we want to grow ahead of the market growth in the channel because we want to have our share of market in the e-commerce channel's portal greater than our share of market in brick-and-mortar. Because as shoppers shift to that channel, we do not want a negative share mix effect on the aggregate market. And so really, really important, one of the dislocating ideas and the most important things we do as a company over the next 5 to 10 years is to be in front in this space. 
Thank you, Ebony. I think that's our last question. I would just end by saying, and this is probably a message to my -- to our team. I'm incredibly proud of our team for what we did in the second quarter. A deal like this has the potential to be incredibly distractive, and the team was able to focus on delivery in an unwavering way that inspires confidence in our ability to really play for the upside in the combination.

Please refer to our earnings release and the most recent Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for additional information concerning risk factors. Newell undertakes no responsibility to update any forward-looking statements. 
Let me remind you also that we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures today, including those identified in the tables of the earnings press release. We provide these non-GAAP measures because management believes that providing insights on the measures discussed enables investors to better understand and analyze our ongoing results. Specifically, the biggest differences between the GAAP and non-GAAP metrics this quarter are onetime charges and other expenses related to the Jarden transaction, including inventory step-up, acquisition-related amortization and other transaction costs. 
In addition, we're defining Newell Brands' core sales as if the Jarden combination occurred April 15 of last year, meaning we are including last year's Jarden results in our 2015 base. Waddington, Jostens and Elmer's are not included in core sales until their respective 1-year anniversaries. 
The reconciliations of these and other non-GAAP measures with the most directly comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP are included in the earnings release and are available on our website.

I'm very pleased to report a strong set of second quarter results with positive momentum on the number of fronts. We drove very competitive levels of growth in the quarter, cost synergies and Project Renewal savings are ramping and right where we expected them to be. And cash flow was strong enabling us to pay down $750 million of our $1.5 billion term loan. So a strong start as Newell Brands. And as a consequence, we reaffirmed full year guidance this morning. 
The Q2 headlines are as follows: net sales have more than doubled as a result of the Jarden transaction to $3.86 billion. Core sales grew 5%, led by strong performances in Writing, Baby and Parenting, Food & Beverage, Yankee Candle & Appliances. 
On both a reported and normalized basis, gross margins and operating margins were right in line with our expectations. Reported EPS was $0.30 per diluted share. Normalized EPS was $0.78, up nearly 22% versus prior year. And operating cash flow was nearly $600 million. So all in, a very good set of second quarter results with continued momentum in our key businesses and a lot of energy and excitement around the opportunities ahead.

As Mike noted, we were pleased with our second quarter results with strong reported end-core sales growth. Gross and operating margin came in consistent with our expectations, and we are on track with our deleveraging plan. A strong operating cash flow allowed us to pay down about $0.75 billion in debt. Overall, a very good start. 
Turning to our detailed review. Second quarter reported net sales were $3.86 billion, 147% increase versus last year, largely from the contribution of the Jarden transaction. Core sales increased 5%. Reported gross margin was 28.4% compared with 39.8% in the prior year, largely due to a $334 million inventory step-up related to the Jarden transaction. There will be a similar step-up impact of around $130 million in Q3, as we expect substantially all of the remaining inventory to turn. 
Normalized gross margin was 37.2%, down 280 basis points versus last year. The decline is due to the negative mix effect from the Jarden acquisition and the deconsolidation of Venezuela as well as the impact of unfavorable currency, which more than offset productivity and pricing. 
Reported SG&A expense was $947 million or 24.5% of sales, down 70 basis points over last year. Normalized SG&A expense was $827 million or 21.4% of sales, down 260 basis points versus prior year, thanks to the mix impact from the inclusion of the Jarden legacy businesses, which have historically carried a lower SG&A spend rate, also benefiting from Project Renewable savings and early Jarden deal synergies. 
Advertising and promotion spending at the Newell Rubbermaid legacy businesses increased 50 basis points in the quarter, driven by incremental investments behind new products, including Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens, Mr. Sketch Scented Crayons, Rubbermaid FreshWorks Produce Saver and Graco Extend2Fit convertible car seats. 
Reported operating margin was 3.6% of sales compared with 13.8% in the prior year. The decrease was largely driven by the onetime inventory step-up, acquisition-related amortization costs and other expenses incurred in connection with the Jarden deal. Normalized operating margin declined 20 basis points to 15.8%. Interest expense of $127 million rose $109 million year-over-year, reflecting a $10 billion increase in debt, resulting from the financing of the Jarden and Elmer's transactions. 
Our reported tax rate was 20.3% compared with 22.7% in the prior year. The normalized tax rate was 29.2% compared with 24.5% in the prior year, attributable to the mix effect of the Jarden acquisition and geographic earnings. 
Reported EPS was $0.30 per share compared with $0.55 in the prior year, due largely to a number of acquisition-related charges and expenses. We also had an increased interest expense and a higher share count. These Jarden transaction charges were partially offset by the contribution from the Jarden and Elmer's acquisitions and a gain on the day sale of the Décor business. Normalized EPS, which excludes the transaction-related expenses, among other things, was $0.78, a 21.9% increase versus last year. The improvement was primarily driven by strong sales growth, the contribution from the Jarden and Elmer's acquisitions and Project Renewal savings. These benefits more than offset increased advertising and promotion support, negative foreign currency, increased interest expense and increased shares outstanding. 
I will now move on to our segment results. Starting with Writing, net sales increased 15.8%. Core sales increased 11.3%, driven by strong double-digit growth in North America. We had a very good start with the Back-to-School sell-in, thanks to innovation and increased advertising and promotion. 
Net sales in the Home Solutions segment decreased 1.1% as strong growth in our Food & Beverage business was more than offset by the negative impact of the divested Décor business and planned exits in the low-margin Consumer Storage business and unfavorable foreign currency. Core sales grew 1.7%. 
Tools net sales declined 3.8%, reflecting continued weakness in Brazil and negative foreign currency. Core sales declined 2.3% as growth in North America was offset by Brazil macro challenges and industrial sector softness in China. 
Net sales in Commercial Products declined 7.9%, primarily due to the divestiture of the Rubbermaid medical cart business and unfavorable foreign currency. Core sales declined 1.4%, reflecting softness driven by complexity-reduction initiatives in the North American distributor channel and in Brazil due to macro challenges in that country. 
Our Baby segment grew net sales 12.4%, thanks to continued strong momentum at Graco North America, driven by innovation and advertising and promotion. Core sales grew 11.1%. 
In my discussion of the legacy Jarden segments, I will refer to post-transaction net and core sales compared against pro forma results for the same period in 2015. Post-transaction net sales in branded consumables increased 36.8%, reflecting the Waddington acquisition. Core sales increased 7.8%, due largely to strong growth in Yankee Candle and Home & Family in Europe. 
Net sales in Consumer Solutions increased 4.9%. Core sales increased 8.3%, driven by strong growth in kitchen appliances in North America, Europe and Latin America. Outdoor solutions net sales increased 53.6%, due largely to the Jostens acquisition. Core sales increased 50 basis points, reflecting strong growth from Pure Fishing, offset by weather-related softness in the ski businesses. Net sales in Process Solutions increased 20 basis points. Core sales increased 50 basis points. 
Let's now turn to Q2 core sales by geography. Importantly, North America, which represents 79% of total sales delivered strong core growth of 6.7%. In EMEA, core sales grew 2.6%. Latin America core sales increased 1.9%, reflecting solid growth across the region with the exception of Brazil. Asia Pacific core sales declined 7.7%, due primarily to softness in branded consumables in that region.
Moving on to cash flow. During Q2, we reported almost $600 million in operating cash flow compared with $102 million in the prior year, reflecting the contribution from Jarden, including Jostens and Waddington, improved operating results and favorable working capital movements. We also generated $236 million from the sale of Décor. We returned $92 million in dividends to shareholders. We also paid down debt by $750 million, bringing our quarter-end debt balance down to $13 billion. We remain confident in our ability to reach our leverage goal of 3 to 3.5x in the next 2 to 3 years. So a very good start to the quarter and with progress on many important areas. 
With that, I'll now turn the call back to Mike."

Since coming together as Newell Brands, we've been hard at work getting to know each other and laying the groundwork for accelerated value creation. Together, we have a strong portfolio of leading brands and significantly greater scale across a number of key channels, customers and geographies with the opportunity to leverage these assets in a bigger way for expanded reach, visibility, impact and growth. We've identified a number of new growth opportunities and put many into action that will materialize through channel cross-sell, accelerated international deployment and strengthened innovation delivery over time. 
We're also making very good progress on costs. As previously shared, we've committed to achieve an incremental $300 million in Project Renewal savings over the next few years. And against that target, we've delivered $70 million in incremental savings in the first half of 2016.
We also have a clear line of sight to the $500 million of cost synergies with significant upside potential. The synergy teams have hit the ground running and are now in full flight with early successes on procurement, where we've already realized $40 million in annualized savings. We're quite confident in our ability to deliver the targeted synergies given our track record of success on Project Renewal. 
We're also making good progress on developing the new strategy for Newell Brands. A few weeks ago, my leadership team spent time together discussing the choices ahead and the next steps in our transformation that will flow from that strategy. Critical decisions about portfolio roles and category and geographic priorities were at the center of our discussions. Mark Tarchetti and his team led by Russ Torres led the dialogue and much of the thinking. As you'd expect, if you're familiar with how we work, those discussions were underpinned by rigorous analysis. The insights generated will frame a set of sharp portfolio, resource allocation and organizational design choices. In early August, we'll solicit input from the Board of Directors. And with the benefit of the board's perspective incorporated, this new strategic framework will shape our activities and investment choices from 2017 forward.
Let me now turn back and take a look at the balance of 2016. This morning, we reaffirmed Newell Brands’ 2016 full year guidance. We continue to expect 2016 full year Newell Brands core sales growth of 3% to 4% and full year normalized EPS of $2.75 to $2.90. Despite a strong start to the year, we continued to believe that both full year guidance metrics appropriately bracket the most likely outcome from the full year, which is right in the middle of both guidance ranges. 
Where we actually fall in the full year guidance range will depend on 3 key factors. The first factor relates to the success of the second half 2016 drive periods of Back-to-School on Writing and the holidays on Yankee Candle. We are well positioned against both. Importantly, both businesses have leadership positions in large, growing global markets with tremendous opportunity to still capture market share both in their markets at home and in their markets abroad. Yankee and Writing also have above-fleet average margin structures, and so their performance can move the needle for Newell Brands in a meaningful way. 
On Writing, we have tremendous momentum. The latest 12-week U.S. value market share through the middle of July, as measured by IRI, is up over 140 basis points with dollars sales growth of 7%. In Q2, Writing had an extraordinary sell-in for the Back-to-School season, delivering about $15 million more revenue in this key sell-in period that we anticipated. While the revenue and the associated income will reverse out in Q3, the strength of the sell-in and the programming and innovation in place bodes well for display activity and merchandising-driven sell-out in Q3. 
As we complete the Back-to-School drive period on Writing, we'll turn our attention to the holidays. The Yankee Candle team is gearing up for the holidays with strong merchandising plans and with new products on their way to retail. We're pressing forward in a new effort to broaden distribution even further in the U.S. and Canada with incremental placements that leverage Newell Brands' route to market in adjacent channels that could potentially positively impact Q4 2016 and, more importantly, 2017. 
We're also exploring ways to enhance brand investment in the fourth quarter and certainly into 2017. Importantly, if we find ourselves with full year earnings upside beyond the midpoint to the full year normalized EPS guidance range, we will likely reinvest a substantial portion of that upside back into the Yankee Candle business for strength in consumer impact around the holidays and positive momentum into 2017. 
The second factor that could influence where we fall on the full year guidance range is the delivery of Project Renewal cost savings and the transaction cost synergies. We have a clear line of sight to the full year Project Renewal incremental savings, and as planned, we expect to deliver well over $100 million in incremental savings this year. With respect to the Jarden transaction cost synergies, we are well on our way to deliver our $50 million to $80 million full year synergy cost guidance with a good probability of delivering towards the high end of that range. So we're on track and foresee no issues here and perhaps some opportunity. 
The third factor that could influence where we land in the full year guidance range is product line exits. To be clear, our full year guidance reflects our intention to actively manage the portfolio. In 2016, we expect to begin to exit certain product lines with roughly $250 million to $300 million of revenue over the 2 -- the next 2 to 3 years. These are businesses that have low to no likelihood of featuring as strategic priorities for the company. As we've stated, our goal would be to sell these assets, if possible, rather than exit, and we hope to be able to find a buyer for some. If we're unsuccessful at finding buyers, the process of exiting these businesses will begin as early as the third quarter. As mentioned previously, we do not expect a material financial impact related to potential product line exits. 
While we do not provide quarterly guidance, I do want to provide some context for the flow of our business in the second half. Given the likely Q3 reversal of the Writing incremental Q2 Back-to-School sell-in and the possible Q3 timing of product line exits, we expect Q3 core sales growth rate to be near the bottom of our 3% to 4% full year guidance range. In Q4, we expect growth rates to recover towards the midpoint of our full year range. We also expect normalized EPS to skew roughly 10% higher in Q4 relative to Q3 as a result of the holiday season peaking of the profitable Yankee Candle business. 
So in closing, we've had a strong start to the year on many fronts. We successfully completed the most transformative deal in the history of either Newell Rubbermaid or Jarden. Despite the potential for distraction that a transaction of this size could create, we grew core sales 5% and delivered normalized EPS growth of nearly 22% in the second quarter. We've made good early progress in the integration of the 2 companies, while simultaneously taking a big step forward on Project Renewal. With the continued positive momentum in our business, we're well on our way to delivering our 2016 full year financial outlook. We've committed to reduce the leverage ratio to 3 to 3.5x over the next 2 to 3 years. And in the second quarter, we paid down $750 million of our $1.5 billion term loan. And our work to prioritize our investment choices and realign resource against the capabilities that can differentiate us and the brands with the greatest potential is well under way, setting the stage for future acceleration of growth and value creation. 
I want to thank our people for their hard work and unwavering focus on delivery. Performance is an everyday thing, and I'm very proud of the determination and the drive for results, particularly in the midst of increasing change. Together, we're building a bigger, stronger, faster-growing and more profitable company with a portfolio of leading brands that compete in large-growing unconsolidated global categories that are responsive to innovation and brand support and also have a low cost of growth given the lack of market consolidation. Our confidence is high because our team has done this kind of work before. We are incredibly well positioned to build these brands and energized by the opportunity to simultaneously create a ton of value for our shareholders. And we're driven by the prospect of building one of the leading consumer goods companies in the world, a company that helps consumers live better every day where they live, learn, work and play. That is both the promise and the potential of Newell Brands. 
With that, I'd like to open up the call for questions and pass the call back to Ebony."

This is a highly intense, operationally focused group of business unit leaders that I've had the opportunity to engage with. And in fact, we just came back from, I guess it was about the week ago now, maybe 1.5 weeks ago, we spent the whole week going through the 2016 back-half plans and the outlook for 2017 business unit by business unit. And it was full on week, every day, 5 days’ worth of plowing through operating reviews. And I came away from those reviews really encouraged. There's some great brands here. If we do our job and deliver beyond the $500 million in synergies that we've committed to, we're going to release a lot of ability to invest back into the business. If I said -- if there was one observation I'd make, it's that while we've got the same level of operational intensity, the P&L on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid side gives us much more flexibly to invest back into the business. So the combination will release a lot of costs that should enable us to extend some of the core capabilities that differentiate -- have the potential to differentiate us like insights, design, innovation delivery, e-commerce across the total enterprise and also the ability to put more advertising and promotion investment by -- behind the businesses with the greatest potential to create value on the legacy Jarden side of the family. Obviously, I talk a lot about Yankee Candle because I know it really well. This is obviously a crown jewel in the company. It's a great acquisition that Mark and Ian did. There's tremendous opportunity to build our footprint there. We love our Writing business. Obviously, we're going to continue to invest across that. Food & beverage has done really well. The combination of the assets between Newell and Jarden on Baby create a really powerful platform for growth going forward. The -- and there's some -- and the Appliance business, you can see how responsive the Appliance business is to activity and merchandising. These are great brands, Oster, Mr. Coffee, Sunbeam. These are terrific assets, and some of them even stronger outside of the U.S. than in the U.S. And so I'm really encouraged by the possibilities here. All of our choices will drive off the strategic work that we're doing today. So we will establish a strategic framework that puts relative priorities in place on these businesses. Many of the Jarden businesses could benefit from the design capability we've built out, and we intend to apply that design capability more broadly to help support innovation delivery over time. And then there's an entrepreneurial spirit in many of the Jarden businesses that I think we'll look to figure out a way to preserve within the context of the operating model we'll eventually build out. Businesses like Jostens are really interesting. There's -- they have their own ecosystem and culture. The Jostens business I like in terms of its scale, profitability and ability to spin off cash to fund other potential investments in other parts of the portfolio. So our choices will pivot off the portfolio prioritization work that's under way today. I'm encouraged by what I see. There's always opportunity to do work. I think we have work to do on Coleman to strengthen the brand. It's a great asset with a tremendous amount of equity, but I think the portfolio could be broadened and the innovation capability we have could be applied to premium-ize certain aspects of that business in a way that would give it more growth potential. We have to work our way through in all the winter weather-related businesses the hangover from last winter which we've got baked into our guidance. So that will just be a matter of time and clearing of inventories in certain parts of the business to get ourselves through to a normal year. This won't be the normal year for any of the winter-sensitive businesses. But all in all, my impression is incredibly positive. And I'm really excited, and I think the team is energized by the possibilities. It won't be simple. We've got a lot of change that the organization is going to go through over the next 6 months and into 2017. And we're going to have to do our best to deliver while simultaneously changing. And we've demonstrated the ability to do that. That will be the key kind of executional issue that we’ll have to lead the organization through. But I'm confident because of the experience we have in doing things like this that we will get through that period of change and really come out a much stronger company on the backside of it with more growth potential and more potential to create value. That was a pithy answer, Dara, to a very straightforward question. But it's probably my favorite question to answer."

Growing company creates great opportunities for personal development, and we're going to ensure that our people have that opportunity. My team is set now. We've talked about potentially one other job, which is a supply chain leadership role. And I think as we go forward, we'll be looking and exploring to -- and figuring out whether there's somebody that can plug into our team dynamic, which I really love now.

On the -- Dara, on the IT side, significant opportunities, a lot of focus in the very short term here is on building some of the infrastructure on the legacy Jarden businesses on just visibility to things like daily sales, point-of-sale information, those kinds of things. That information sort of exists across their group, but we need to develop it in a more systematic way to get visibility to that kind of across the company and in the center as well on a more daily basis. So that's a big effort going on now. Also, as we've developed and formulate the portfolio and the sets of choices that we make, we'll be leveraging what I think is a great platform on SAP that the legacy Newell business developed, and we'll begin to make some migrations to further leverage that platform over time. That would be the second piece. And I would just say the third big effort that is really getting started now, it really relates to synergies. But there's a IT infrastructure opportunity that we can really unlock some value on cost by harmonizing a lot of the, I'll call it, back-of-the-house support for running servers and telecommunications and all those kinds of things. So that's another piece of systems work that's going on."

Writing benefitted from a couple of things in the second quarter, and this is an important point to register. We were very successful with the sell-in, which I love because that -- at this time of year, that's a really constructive thing to do because you force all this inventory to the floor in retailers, which is how you get the merchandising sell-out. So we're really excited about that we nailed Q2, the sell-in period. It's -- there are 2 things underlying the share gains we're experiencing around and the growth we're -- the underlying growth we're getting in the business. And one of them is the innovation agenda and the brand support agenda that goes with that. InkJoy Gel is going to be a huge hit. You can already see it in the consumption data. I'm really excited to see how it plays post Back-to-School and see how much of a step change we get from it because the product is beautiful. The ink system is unique and differentiated. For anybody who loves gel pens, it's beautiful, smooth write, but it doesn't smear because it's got an ink that dries 3 times faster than the next leading competitor. So it's got a really differentiated proposition. So I think the innovation agenda is going really well. We have also extended the footprint of this business. As you know, our progress in Mexico in Writing is really pretty extraordinary. Our progress in Canada where we are underdeveloped is really quite strong. Bob King, who runs the Canadian business has done a great job on Writing over the last 18 months to build out our footprint and build the business. And as you know, we've invested to launch Sharpie in the U.K. about 1.5 years ago. That's going really well. We've got great presence at Tesco and Sainsbury's in the mass retailers in the U.K., and there's opportunity still to be had there. And we will leverage the Jarden business going forward to apply the same principles in France and Germany, leveraging their mass retail footprint. But I think those are -- the current reality is U.K., it's Canada, it's Mexico and it's the obvious success we've had in the U.S. Part of the success is driven by this macro trend on adult coloring, which has helped Sharpie Fine Point, it's helped Flair and obviously Prismacolor, which is right in the center of that big trend. And that trend continues as a tailwind to this business. That's probably worth 1.5, 2 points of our growth that macro event, which really has nothing to do with our marketing, but we're extremely well positioned to take advantage of it. So the real question there is, is this a sustainable trend or is this a fad that will ebb over time. That's why I always say to you guys, you should not plan Writing at double-digit core growth. You should build your models with Writing in the sort of 5% to 7% range, which I think is the right place to be. Now we've got all kinds of exciting things ahead on Writing. I've got -- if I was with you, Bill, I'd give you the Chinese product that's set to launch, both InkJoy, regular InkJoy, InkJoy Gel, and Sharpie, in Shanghai in the fourth quarter. And the product looks great. I've seen the videos of the sell-in discussions with distributors. That went great. So we're excited about the prospects for broadening the footprint over time both in France and Germany most likely, leveraging Jarden's mass retail footprint and obviously, in China, where we've made the commitment. So there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic ahead on this business. And it's -- and as you know, it's a beautiful category, but lots of share consolidation opportunity around the world."

Within outdoor solutions, we have a bunch of different moving parts. The Pure Fishing business did really well. But anything that's winter-sensitive is dealing with a hangover on inventories from the sell-in from last year and working through that. Within ski, K2 is probably more challenged than vocal. Vocal had a pretty good quarter in Q2, but there clearly are winter weather-related hangovers in any business that ships a lot in, in the back half of the year hoping to have it consumed out in the front half of the year. So we're definitely dealing with a hangover there. Coleman is a challenging business at the moment. It's not that we don't believe in it. We do actually. It reminds me a lot of where Graco was when I started in that -- the brand has unbelievable legacy equity. It's probably -- we'll find out before I -- maybe before September, we'll get these results. But we put all of these brands into equity testing, so we're going to get relative metrics that we can compare across the total portfolio. I'm betting that Coleman stands out. It's probably one of the strongest brands from an equity perspective in the whole portfolio. I think Oster will be there. I think Mr. Coffee, despite people's preconceived notions, will be there. Obviously, Yankee, I think, will do very well. But I'd bet you Coleman's top of the league table within the legacy Jarden portfolio as was Graco and Rubbermaid. But there's work to do on Coleman because too much of its portfolio sits in the good segment of good, better, best. And that's where pricing and margin contraction becomes an issue if you don't have a broadened footprint. And so the Coleman business, I think it's going to have an okay year, won’t have a brilliant year because it's stuck with too much of its portfolio in that segment of the market, and that's the segment of the market where you get a lot of pressure. And if you don't have differentiation in your product offerings relative to store level, store brands, then you run the risk of always being under pressure. And that's the cycle. I just guess I'd describe it as that's the cycle that Coleman's currently in. And we're going to have to address that, and we'll address it in the same way we did with Graco. We'll work through. It will take some time. This will be one of those projects that takes multiple years to get right. It's going to require investment in insights. It's going to require investment in design and in innovation. We're a big enough company where we can afford to take a margin contraction and hit on a big brand like that in order to get it reset, but this is going to be one of our big projects. It's actually very exciting because I think the brand has tremendous potential. But we need to get it into a more sustainable pattern of strategic growth, and that will take some time. So it's all hands on deck on that business. It's not a crisis. It's just an opportunity underleveraged. But this is where the best of our model can be applied. And I think it will be really interesting to see what we'll able to do with it over a couple of years."

But I wouldn't expect us to be exiting 1% to 2% of the business every year. This is the portion of the business that probably doesn't fit the model or doesn't have real opportunity. It won't ever get up on the list of investment priorities we'd make, whereas it may be interesting to somebody else. Our priority for that $250 million and $300 million, if we were in a situation where we don't have to bifurcate a trademark like the Rubbermaid situation where you can't really sell the stuff you don't really want without licensing the brand, which I'm not prepared to do. In situations where you don't have that scenario, obviously, we'd love to find a buyer for these businesses rather than exit them, but I'm not clear at all whether we would be able to find a buyer for some of them. And so that's why I've laid out this issue of $250 million to $300 million of product line exits. If we can sell them, we'll sell them because that's a much more constructive way to manage the exit of those businesses. But it's not part of some broader plan to wean the portfolio down. We may make in the future strategic choices about the portfolio, but it won't be in the context of businesses that don't necessarily have any role within the portfolio. It'll be about bartering one part of the portfolio for maybe something stronger that's out there that we could acquire in."

I think Coleman, actually -- the point on Coleman is it's probably an and that we want to attack the cost structure, at the same time -- although the cost structure is pretty lean, at the same time it's investing in other areas to create more growth potential and maybe more margin trajectory in it. So that one's a give and a take. There are others where there's opportunity to go to market more efficiently. And part of the outcome of the portfolio choices work will be to articulate which businesses should benefit from the full cost model and which businesses could be managed more entrepreneurially and more efficiently. And so there will be change across the entire enterprise, with different bits of the portfolio getting different -- playing different roles and, therefore, having different models with respect to the cost structure. And there are some of the Newell legacy businesses that will be moved around with respect to prioritization. So there's a lot of cost -- work going on. There's opportunities within businesses, and then there's opportunities across business -- across the enterprise, and we're doing both sets of work."

And while we're not quoting pro forma numbers year-to-date for those businesses, it's been a solid first half for the appliance business. And I think people underestimate the quality of the brands. I actually think Mr. Coffee and Oster and Sunbeam are excellent brands. We're going to find out that they have a lot of potential. The challenge in the business was the margin structure of the business. And so will this feature at the top of the list when you've got assets like Writing or assets like Yankee? I think that we're going to need to continue to think about how to get operating margin into this business so that we can right resource it. And I do think that there's a huge opportunity in the emerging markets in appliances as people move into the middle class. I think there's a real opportunity to tap into moms' needs in those countries to simplify life a bit, and the portfolio fits right into that space. But there are also opportunities in appliances in the developed world. So there's a lot of potential here. Our challenge will be how much investment can you put into it given the operating margins in the business, and we'll have to work through that. We'll look for the efficiencies where we can get them, again, while increasing investment, probably in insights and design to help the innovation funnel along. In the short term, I believe, there are distribution opportunities and merchandising opportunities that can sustain solid growth. I wouldn't build a model around 7%, 8% growth. That's a big number on a big business. But high -- mid-single digits maybe, maybe in that 4% to 5% range, that's probably the right place kind of to build that business model out. But there are portions of that portfolio that are really interesting and those mega brands that I was describing, really interesting, and then there's some other challenged aspects in that portfolio."

So we've got people needs that we will increase and money that needs to go into research that started already. And that's guided by the strategic prioritization work. The corporate duplication synergies, we're going after fast. So we're right in the middle of that in Q3. We'll have that largely behind us, all those choices made and done in the third quarter. I would be surprised if there are things hanging out there beyond that. And then with respect to route-to-market synergies, there's opportunity in every country to look for where those synergies might come. We'll work together as a team to play for the things that make the most sense, and I don't think we'll drag it out over a whole long period of time. I think consensus is that whatever changes we are going to make, we ought to get them done as fast as we can as long as we are confident in our ability to not be distracted on delivery. And that's why some of the guidance makes sense in the context of a strong first half. There'll be a fair amount of work to do in the second half with respect to the integration. But our goal would be to get the organizational-related stuff behind us as fast as possible, so we can pivot towards growth and fulfilling the ambition that we've articulated for the company.

So there's an important lesson learned there for us, legacy Newell Rubbermaid folk. I think there's opportunity connected to applying some of the lessons learned we had through the Growth Game Plan to a set of assets that Jarden had available to it. And I think the fact that we will manage the portfolio in a different way where we don't just -- we don't look at individual businesses with specific accountabilities. We make trade-offs on investments across the landscape. We manage resources dynamically horizontally across businesses more actively than the Jarden team. That will give us the flexibility to make some investments that wouldn't have otherwise happened in a Jarden model, like on Coleman. This is going to be a 1- or 2-year series of investments we have to make. We'll try to fund it within Coleman, but the likely answer is that it'll be funded from outside of Coleman. And we'll mortgage, rip costs out of corporate or do something that enables us to make those investment bets and take a step back on EBITDA margin while we're fixing the business. That's the thing that we will do differently. So there's really different business conditions and different things that can be learned from both sides of the new company, and we really intend to do that. I have no pride of authorship other than things I believe are important and applicable. But if there are things on the other side that I wish I'd done on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid businesses, I'm going to be selfish and take them and go do it. So -- and there's plenty of examples of that.

Look, I think, long term, it's a very exciting set of possibilities. I think in the next -- what we've said in terms of guidance on core growth for this year and next is 3% of 4%, and we're very unlikely to change that guidance because there's a lot of work to do within the portfolio that will both help the growth agenda, but some things that will -- given how we define core sales, potentially hurt the growth agenda. So we're going to work through that over the first 18 months. And I have a very long view on our agenda in the company we're trying to build. And I think we get growth acceleration as we get through this period, this transition period of change and portfolio work. But we haven't committed to what that is. But certainly, Q2, where there was less portfolio activity, is encouraging. So that tells us a little bit about what's possible, and that's without the benefit of applying the best of what we could potentially apply from a capability standpoint. I do think the things to look at, if you want to get a sense of what's possible, who would've thought Baby would be growing at 11% 5 years ago? And if you look at the period, in 2012, 2013, it was compounded 10%. Who would have thought Writing would be growing 11% double-digit core growth in the first half of the year when we first started? So there's a lot of talk about technology conversions, making -- Writing was dead, was the first series of questions I've gotten, why would I ever bet on Writing, but that's obviously not true. And so there are lots of reasons if you look back at the evidence over the last 5 years, to believe that these brands will respond to investment activity and capabilities in the area of design and innovation. And our challenge as leaders is to figure out how, within the P&L, to free up the space to drive that investment forward while simultaneously delivering the margin improvement committed to in the deal. And I think it's doable. I mean, I'm excited by that. The question becomes how much growth potential is there really here? I don't know. But Q2, certainly -- Q2 and the other evidence would suggest that when we get it right, we can grow really well on these businesses, and they're really responsive. And probably the most important strategic chart for investors to look at is the one that talks about the size of these markets, our position in the markets, the relative -- the market share, the cumulative market share, the top 3 players in these categories globally and then the cost of growth. And that is a really attractive chart because it tells the story of what's possible in this set of category, these types of categories, relative to what's possible in fast-moving consumer goods, where they are far more consolidated, the top 5 have 90% of the share and the cost of growth is so high as a consequence. And so this is a much more attractive space to be playing in if you really think about it in that way as long as you can -- you tackle the cost and release the cost in the P&L to be able to invest behind the brands. And we had a theory that these categories would be responsive to activity. We now have plenty of proof that they're responsive to activity. So it's real. This algorithm is working and it has the potential to even work harder across this broader canvas once we get through the transition period."

And so the balancing act, when you've got an operating margin as high as the one we have, is to not get too ambitious for the margin and to really think about the growth. I think we've struck the right balance up until now. We've substantially increased the amount of A&P in that business over the last 5 years. And while geographic footprint extension will require incremental investment if we don't want to mortgage investment levels at home, I'm not sure how much more. It doesn't really need, I don't think, given the competitive set, personal care levels of A&P ratios. So we're getting close. If we can get ourselves to 9%, 10% A&P ratios, I think we've got a really interesting and extendable place to be. And then I think some of the other businesses, we want to continue to work on the margin structures. So a lot of the work we're doing on costs are in businesses that have less to offer in that respect. And we have to do more. We have more work to do, that's why there's $230 million left on our Project Renewal road map, is because we want to get the margin flexibility into that portion of the P&L, such that we do have the ability to invest. Now in the combination, we may not choose to reapply the investment where we get the cost savings out. I may take that money -- Ralph and I may take that money with Mark and give it to Bill and ask him to go spend it on Yankee because that's a better choice. That makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts. So we have plenty of room to go, room to run on cost on the legacy Newell business. And we have scale leverage to be captured through the integration in route-to-market, in cost to serve, in many, many places that we're going to be able to go after. And we should be able to get beyond the 500, such that we have increased firepower. The question is how quickly do we do that and how quickly are we confident enough in that outcome that we're prepared to share that with you."

There's nothing suggesting that the momentum should slow, because it looks like the guidance, which you sort of conservatively took down to about 2% to 4%, it feels a bit conservative relative to the business momentum that has continued since the deal closed, particularly in JBC and JCS. So I just wanted to make sure that I was clear on that. And then secondarily, I don't know if you're prepared to comment on this today, but Yankee -- and I share your optimism there and what you can potentially do with the business. Can you talk a little bit about your willingness to expand the retail footprint, distribution opportunities, particularly abroad, potentially, product category expansion plans, leveraging that brand equity, and we've seen a little bit of that at a large mass customer in auto air fresheners. Maybe you could build upon that a little bit, and further context, the former -- or the CEO of Jarden thought that they could double the size of that business over a reasonable amount of time, which I also agree sort of felt reasonable.

So the first part of the question on sustaining a 5% growth rate on the total business, I've -- clearly, part of the reason we won't do that in the back half of the year is product line exit related. Part of it is because I think it's the prudent thing to do, given the amount of change the organization has been going through. So it's the right kind of cautious stance to take. Whether we beat that or not, time will tell. But Q2 didn't really have any material product line exits executed in it. So that's part of the discussion. I don't want to get too specific on where those exits will occur because I don't want to be disruptive, either internally or compromise potential external opportunities to sell some of these assets. So I'm cautious on that one, and I know that feels like a bit of a fudge, but I think it's actually, in your interest, in the investors' interest for me to manage it that way. On Yankee, look, the compound annual growth rate on Yankee has been around 7% for a long period of time. So if you want to double a business, all you got to do is compound the growth at 7% for 10 years. Now I'm not saying -- I'm not time-bounding how long it'll take to double the business, but that's how the math works on that. Do we believe in Yankee? Absolutely. Do we believe in Yankee as much as we believe in Writing? Yes. Will Yankee end up being right up there at the top of the list of things we want to bet on? Yes. And is there an immense opportunity here? Yes. Is it broader than fragrance candles? Work to be done to confirm, but my intuition says yes. And so we'll see. It's a big category. It's a very, very strong brand. The experience in Europe that Jarden really has led increases confidence in the ability for the business to travel. And that is one of the reasons, that, coupled with the margin structure, coupled with the ability to create beautiful products through design are a number of the reasons that it factors as a potentially really attractive play for us."

So clearly, there's a shift in shopping behavior under way in the U.S., and we want to reach consumers where they shop. And we also want to win with winning customers. And so those 2 principles drive the allocation of resource for us. In order to reach consumers where they shop -- when they're shopping in an e-commerce environment, we've made the determination that we need to invest in specialized skills. And we've built out a whole team of e-commerce resources from the outside that are really driving our activity plans in these areas. And so we intend to continue to step up investment in this area this year, next year, the year beyond. And this can be and should be, for Newell Brands, a differentiated capability relative to our competitive set. That does not mean we're taking resource away from our bricks-and-mortar partners. Wal-Mart is our biggest partner. A big 95% of their business with us is brick-and-mortar still. So obviously, for all of those folks that are in that phase of striking the right balance within their business model, we need to resource our relationship with that customer and our programming with that customer in a way that fits their strategic road map. And so that's the moment we're in with respect to e-commerce. We expect to disproportionately grow our e-commerce business relative to bricks-and-mortar, and we want to grow ahead of the market growth in the channel because we want to have our share of market in the e-commerce channel's portal greater than our share of market in brick-and-mortar. Because as shoppers shift to that channel, we do not want a negative share mix effect on the aggregate market. And so really, really important, one of the dislocating ideas and the most important things we do as a company over the next 5 to 10 years is to be in front in this space. 
Thank you, Ebony. I think that's our last question. I would just end by saying, and this is probably a message to my -- to our team. I'm incredibly proud of our team for what we did in the second quarter. A deal like this has the potential to be incredibly distractive, and the team was able to focus on delivery in an unwavering way that inspires confidence in our ability to really play for the upside in the combination. So thank you to my team, if you're still listening, and let's go -- let's go after the upside together. Talk soon, everybody."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the Newell Brands' third quarter earnings call. 
I'm pleased this morning to report a solid set of third quarter results with good progress on many fronts. Third quarter was planned as an income-driven quarter. We delivered results that were well ahead of our plan, enabled by strong cost synergies and Project Renewal savings, initial tax synergies and competitive levels of growth in the context of an intense period of organization and portfolio change. 
Our momentum businesses of Writing, Baby, Food and Appliances continue to deliver strong growth, which was partially offset by expected declines on Outdoor Solutions and Commercial Products. 
Cash flow was quite strong, enabling us to pay down over $230 million of debt or about $1.3 billion since the completion of the Jarden transaction only 26 weeks ago. 
We delivered these results while also completing a comprehensive review of the business, aligning the organization around the new strategic framework called the Growth Game Plan. The New Growth Game Plan establishes a new set of investment priorities, make sharp portfolio of choices, resets and streamlines the organization from a holding company to an operating company consolidating 32 business units to 16 divisions while simultaneously scaling our innovation, design, insight, brand development and e-commerce capabilities across much of our new portfolio with the intention to deliver steady growth acceleration with rapid earnings accretion and strong cash flow generation over the next few years. 
We've driven this new strategy into action in the third quarter, announcing a series of organization and portfolio changes. We've chosen to move decisively and with speed because we have the benefit of lessons learned from the Newell Rubbermaid transformation and confidence in our team's ability to perform while we simultaneously transform. 
Our third quarter and year-to-date results are good evidence that we can deliver while changing. And in that context, this morning, we've raised our 2016 guidance toward the high end of both guidance ranges. 
So with that as preamble, let me quickly review our performance highlights and then I'll pass the time to Ralph to dive deeper. 
The  Q3 headlines are as follows: net sales have more than doubled as a result of the Jarden transaction of $3.95 billion. Core sales grew 3%, led by strong performances in Writing, Baby, Food and Appliances. Reported EPS was $0.38 per diluted share after absorbing the negative impact of about $0.19 of onetime cost associated with the Jarden inventory step-up and about $0.08 of other onetime transaction-related costs. Normalized EPS was $0.78, an increase of over 25% versus prior year. And operating cash flow was over $511 million, an increase of over 50% versus prior year. 
Year-to-date, net sales have more than doubled to $9.13 billion as a result of the Jarden transaction. Core sales have grown 4.2%, and that growth has been broad-based with 7 and 9 segments growing in North American core growth of 5%, Latin American core growth of 8% and Europe, Middle East and Africa core growth of nearly 3%. 
Reported EPS was $0.91 per diluted share after absorbing the negative impact of about $0.78 of onetime cost associated with the Jarden inventory step-up and about $0.20 of onetime transaction-related costs. Normalized EPS was $2.08, up over 28% versus prior year. And operating cash flow was $837 million, an increase of over 190% versus prior year. 
So a good set of outcomes, and we continue to do what we say we're going to do. 
With that, I will now hand the call over to Ralph, and then I'll return to provide perspective on the balance of 2016 and our initial outlook for 2017."

As Mike noted, our Q3 financial results were solid on a -- and on plan across all key metrics: core sales, gross and operating margin and operating cash flow. We're also on track with capturing cost savings through synergies and Project Renewal and on track with our deleveraging plan. 
Third quarter reported net sales were $3.95 billion, a 159% increase versus last year, which was largely attributable to the Jarden transaction. Core sales increased 3%. Recorded -- reported gross margin was 32.2% compared with 39.1% last year largely due to the Jarden transaction-related inventory step-up charges in the amount of $146 million. This completes the turn of Jarden-acquired inventory and the related step-up charges. 
Normalized gross margin was 36% compared with 39.5% last year. The decline is due to the negative mix effect from the Jarden acquisition and the deconsolidation of Venezuela, which more than offset positive impacts from synergies, productivity and pricing. 
We reported SG&A expense of $938 million or 23.7% of net sales, 190 basis point improvement versus last year despite the impacts of higher integration cost. 
Normalized SG&A expense was $817 million or 20.6% of sales, a 360 basis point improvement. Both reported a normalized improvements were driven by the mixed impact from the Jarden legacy businesses, which have historically carried a lower SG&A spend rate as well as benefits from Project Renewal savings and transaction-related synergies. 
Reported operating margin was 8.2% of sales compared with 12.2% in the prior year. This decrease was largely attributable to the inventory step-up amortization-related cost and certain other transaction-related expenses. Normalized operating margin improved 20 basis points to 15.4% of sales when compared to the prior year. 
Interest expense of $125 million rose $107 million year-over-year, reflecting the higher debt balance incurred in the financing of the Jarden and Elmer's transactions. 
Our reported tax rate was 6.8% compared with last year's reported rate of 16.1%, reflecting the effect of discrete items in the quarter. The normalized tax rate was 22.5% compared with 20% in the prior year, driven by tax synergies and discrete items in the quarter, more than offset by the mix effect of the Jarden acquisition. 
Reported EPS was $0.38 compared with $0.50 in the prior year due largely to the acquisition-related charges and expenses as well as increased interest expense and a higher share count. These transaction-related expenses were partially offset by the operating profit contribution from the Jarden and Elmer's acquisitions. 
Normalized EPS, which excludes transaction-related expenses and certain other charges, was $0.78, a 26% increase versus last year. The improvement was primarily driven by sales growth, the contribution from the Jarden and Elmer's acquisitions and savings benefits from both synergies and Project Renewal. These benefits more than offset increased shares outstanding and higher interest expense. 
Turning now to our segment results. Writing net sales increased 14.5%, slight acceleration of approximately $15 million of net sales from Q3 into Q2 to support Back-to-School merchandising. Writing core sales increased 7.7%, reflecting a strong Back-to-School season behind innovation such as Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens and increased advertising and promotion support. 
Net sales in Home Solutions declined 19.1% due primarily to the divestiture of the Décor business. Core sales, which excludes the Rubbermaid Consumer Storage totes business that is held for sale, declined 0.5%, primarily attributable to the timing impact of the transition of the key distribution center in the beverage business. 
Tools net sales declined 5.7%, driven by continued challenges in Brazil and negative foreign currency, partially offset by growth in Europe. 
Commercial Products net sales declined 3.7%, primarily due to the divestiture of the Rubbermaid medical cart business, the negative impact of foreign currency and softness in the North American distribution trade channel related to ongoing plan complexity reduction activity. Core sales decreased 1.8%. 
Baby grew net sales 11.3% largely due to continued strong sales momentum in North America from Graco and Baby Jogger. Core sales, which excludes the Teutonia business that was held-for-sale, increased 10.6%. 
Turning now to legacy Jarden segments. I will refer to net and core sales as compared with pro forma results for the same period in 2015. 
Net sales in branded consumables increased 5% and core sales increased 0.6%. Waddington, which is reflected in core sales as of August 1, grew mid-single digits. Yankee Candle grew more modestly as we lapped last year's pipeline sale at Walmart. Core growth was partially offset by weak performance of the Safety & Security business outside the United States. 
Consumer Solutions net sales increased 7.9%. Core sales, which exclude the U.S. Heaters, Humidifiers and Fans business that is held for sale, increased 9.3%, driven by strong results in both North America and Latin America. 
We had good growth in Crockpot, Sunbeam and FoodSaver, fueled by innovation such as the new FoodSaver food preservation system, which launched in Q3. 
Outdoor Solutions net sales increased 12.1% largely attributable to the Jostens acquisition. Core sales, which excludes the Winter Sports business that is held for sale, declined 3.2% compared with prior year, with growth in Pure Fishing more than offset by declines in Coleman. 
Net sales in Process Solutions increased 11.4%. Core sales increased 12.4% compared with prior year due to volume growth and commodity-based pricing. 
Let's turn now to Q3 core sales by geography. North America, which represents about 80% of total sales, grew core growth by 3.1% led by strong growth in Baby and Writing. 
In EMEA, core sales grew 2.7%, reflecting continued strong growth in Yankee Candle, partially offset by weakness in Commercial Products. 
Latin America delivered strong core growth sales growth of 15.2%, driven by robust sales in Consumer Solutions and Writing. 
Asia Pacific core sales declined 8.4% due primarily to softness in our Safety & Security business deployed [ph] from that region. 
During Q3, we reported $511 million of operating cash flow compared with $340 million in the prior year. The improvement reflects contribution from Jarden, improved operating results across the portfolio and favorable working capital movements. 
We returned $92 million in dividends to shareholders. We also paid down debt by $231 million, which brings our quarter-end gross debt balance down to $12.75 billion. With the benefit of the cash proceeds from the upcoming sale of Tools, we are now projecting that we'll reach our 3 to 3.5x leverage goal ahead of plan. 
In summary, a good quarter with progress on many fronts. At this point, I'll turn the call back to Mike."

If you no doubt know, we've been hard at work laying the groundwork for accelerated performance and value creation.

If you no doubt know, we've been hard at work laying the groundwork for accelerated performance and value creation. Creation of Newell Brands strengthens our presence in existing geographies and customers and enhances our reach to an extended international footprint and access to new channels of distribution. This new scale gives us the opportunity to make life better for hundreds of millions of consumers everyday, where they live, learn, work and play. 
This New Growth Game Plan has at its core this bold ambition and vision, and a new set of investment priorities and portfolio choices that will shape our growth ambitions and resource allocation. Strategy is designed to unlock the unique opportunity that's inherent in the categories of both legacy companies. 
Across the Newell Brands portfolio, we have leading brands to compete in large growing categories that are responsive to activity. These are categories that are unconsolidated and, as a result, have a low cost of growth. These unique conditions create a unique potential for the company prepared to make the investments necessary to capture the market share consolidation opportunity. 
Over the last 5 years, we've invested to build advantaged capabilities in insight, design, innovation, brand marketing, e-commerce and collaborative selling that differentiate us versus our sub-scaled  competitive set. We've reshaped the company from a holding company to an operating company, releasing costs that have been reinvested to both build these scaled competitive advantages in our core growth capabilities and to more than double the E&P investment on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid brands. 
This operating model has worked as it's evident in the company's performance. Capturing the transformative value-creation opportunity inherent in the Newell Rubbermaid combination with Jarden will be a function of our success applying this model more broadly. The New Growth Game Plan is designed to do just that, apply this proven playbook across a broader set of categories and geographies. And we're moving fast now to drive this new strategy into action. 
We've announced our intention to focus our portfolio on the categories with the greatest potential, divesting about $1.5 billion of business with a definitive agreement now reached to sell more cyclical Tools business to a strategic buyer at an attractive multiple. 
We will also divest a number of other noncore businesses, including Winter Sports, Rubbermaid Consumer Storage, U.S. Heaters, Humidifiers and Fans, Lehigh Rope and Cordage and a number of smaller brands, including Teutonia, Zoot and Squadra. The work to sell these assets has begun. And we hope to have buyers lined up for these businesses by the end of 2017. 
We've also made a new set of investment priorities, clustering the balance of our businesses against 3 discrete portfolio roles: win bigger, develop for growth and deliver entrepreneurially. These 3 roles will shape resource allocation with win bigger categories benefiting from higher advertising and promotion investment and develop for growth categories receiving a meaningful increase in insight and design investment as we work to strengthen the funnel of future growth ideas. 
Both our win bigger and develop for growth categories will leverage a delivery and development operating model like the one previously deployed on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid businesses. 
Our deliver entrepreneurially businesses will be led and resourced more autonomously with very specific business targets that ladder up to the overall company performance. 
We've also begun the comprehensive reset of the organization that flows from these priorities. We'll consolidate 32 business to 16 Global Divisions, with these divisions becoming the key operating nodes of the company. We will scale our U.S. selling organization, creating integrated selling teams in our top 20 retail partners that account for 50% of our U.S. revenue.  We will create global centers of expertise in key HR and finance disciplines and establish new global functions in procurement, IT and legal. We will build 2 new design hubs in Chicago and New York and increase investment in brand research, as we extend the reach of these advantage capabilities to new Jarden brands. We will create a new Global eCommerce Division that will assume accountability for delivering over $1 billion of incremental growth across the enterprise by 2020. We expect to have the U.S. organization reset by the end of the year with the rest of the world to follow sometime in 2017. 
With this scope of change, we're making very good progress on costs with tremendous opportunity still ahead. We've delivered over $100 million in incremental 2016 savings related to Project Renewal through the third quarter. And we are well on our way to deliver between $130 million and $140 million of incremental savings for the full year. The cost synergy teams are now in full flight, with excellent progress on procurement, corporate duplication and corporate functions, and now, the operating divisions. 
The decisive action to reshape the portfolio set new investment priorities and reset the organization where released -- where we'll release the accelerated savings and synergies we've committed to deliver, ensuring earnings development while simultaneously enabling investment for growth. 
Let me now turn to our 2016 outlook and our initial outlook for 2017. This morning, we increased Newell Brands' 2016 full year guidance, raising the bottom of the guidance ranges. We now expect to deliver 2016 full year core sales growth of 3.5% to 4% and full year normalized EPS of $2.85 to $2.90. We're tracking towards the high end of the new core sales guidance range and the midpoint of the new normalized EPS range. 
Our full year 2016 guidance assumes just over $210 million in incremental gross cost savings related to both Project Renewal and cost and tax synergies from the combination with Jarden. And with the benefit of tax synergies and onetime tax benefits in the third quarter, we now expect the full year tax rate to be about 27.5%. 
Our revised guidance assumes the assets held for sale are not divested until January 1, 2017, and that the current share count of just over 486 million shares remains essentially unchanged through the end of 2016. 
This morning, we've also provided our initial outlook for 2017. We expect full year core sales growth of 3% to 4% and normalized earnings per share of $2.85 to $3.05. Our 2017 guidance metrics assumes we complete the divestiture of all assets held for sale on January 1, 2017, resulted -- resulting in normalized earnings per share dilution net of interest expense benefit of about $0.20 per share. 
Our 2017 guidance assumes just over $300 million in incremental gross cost savings related to Project Renewal and the incremental cost and tax synergies related to the combination with Jarden. We will spend some of these benefits back in the business as we extend our growth capabilities to the Jarden businesses and scale our e-commerce division. We expect the 2017 share count to be about 488 million shares and the tax rate to be between 26% and 27%. We expect to deliver strong double-digit normalized operating income and normalized net income in 2017 despite the dilutive impact of divestitures and higher interest expense associated with the Jarden transaction. 
While we do not provide quarterly guidance, I do want to make sure you're taking the following dynamics into consideration as you think about the next 2 quarters. 
First, regarding the fourth quarter of 2016, we've taken the decision to invest significantly more A&P in Q4 than we did in Q3, with investment prioritized against new innovations like the launch of Rubbermaid Brilliance, one of our best-ever food storage line of products that provides a seal that simply will not leak. And on Yankee Candle with a significant new investment in advertising during the holidays. Given our current growth assumptions for the fourth quarter, this increased level of investment to over 6% of revenue on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid brands will likely yield fourth quarter normalized earnings per share of about $0.80, which would represent about a $0.24 increase in normalized earnings per share versus prior year or about a 43% increase. 
To be clear, we have -- if we have earnings upside to the fourth quarter, we would likely take the opportunity to make further investments for growth rather than let the benefits flow to furthering what is already very strong earnings performance. 
With regard to the first quarter of 2017, as we discussed on our second quarter earnings call, we expect normalized earnings per share dilution in the first quarter of 2017 versus 2016. The first quarter is a seasonally low earnings quarter for both legacy Jarden and Newell Rubbermaid. And earnings per share will be burdened by the significantly higher share count and interest expense related to the combination. 
Since our last call, we've announced the sale of our Tools business and plans to divest a number of other businesses. We expect a full year dilution net of interest expense benefit to be about $0.20, with that dilution skewed more to the first half of the year, driven by the phasing of mitigating actions assumed in the net impact. We expect the first quarter impact of dilution net of interest expense benefit to be about $0.06 to $0.07, assuming the transactions are completed by January 1. So I would encourage you to take this into account in your first quarter estimates. 
So in closing, we're moving now with speed and decisiveness to capture the transformative value-creation opportunity inherent in the combination of Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden. Year-to-date, we've grown core sales 4.2% and delivered normalized EPS growth of over 28% despite the potential distraction that a transaction of this size could create. 
We've reset our corporate strategy and launched the New Growth Game Plan with a clear road map that sets new investment priorities, strengthens our portfolios and reshapes the organization. These actions are in full flight, and we expect them to be largely completed before the first anniversary of the combination. 
We're simultaneously making new investments in design, insights and e-commerce. And we'll decisively move resourcing to our highest priority, win bigger and develop for growth categories as part of the 2017 plan. 
Our cost and savings programs are delivering on an -- on our -- on an accelerated timetable. We now expect to deliver over $210 million in combined growth savings in 2016 and have a line of sight to over $300 million in combined incremental gross savings and tax synergies in 2017. 
We have raised guidance for 2016 and have an ambitious plan for 2017 that will deliver strong double-digit normalized operating income and normalized net income growth despite the lost income and retained cost associated with divestitures. 
We're generating a lot of cash through the operations and by the end of 2016 now expect to a pay down about $2 billion of debt since the completion of the Jarden transaction. And with the incremental U.S.-based net proceeds from the divestitures available into early 2017, we should be in a position to accelerate debt repayment further. 
Our principles for capital allocation are clear and firm. We will invest in value-creating CapEx and restructuring. We will generate dividends in our 30% to 35% payout ratio range. We will drive our leverage ratio to the targeted 3 to 3.5x range with both gross debt reduction and EBITDA development. And over time, our cash generative business will create many options to complement our organic agenda with external development of our core categories. 
With the choice to restructure our portfolio and the generation of substantial net proceeds from those divestitures, we can now envision paths to accelerate achievement of our leverage ratio targets while simultaneously pursuing the external development of our anchored categories through bolt-on M&A in the core. 
This is an exciting time to be part of Newell Brands. I want to thank our people for their hard work and unwavering focus on delivery. Execution is an everyday thing, and I'm very proud of our team's determination and drive for results, particularly in the midst of tremendous change. Together, we're building a larger, stronger, fast growing and more profitable company. Our confidence is high because our team has done this kind of work before. We're incredibly well positioned to grow our brands, are energized by the opportunity to create a lot of value for our shareholders and are driven by the prospects of building one of the leading consumer goods companies in the world, a company that helps make life better for hundreds of millions of consumers every day where they live, learn, work and play. That is both the promise and the potential of Newell Brands. 
With that, I'd like to pass the call back to Hannah, who'll open the line for questions."

I'd say also that, which -- and Mike kind of alluded to in his remarks, the slope of the curve of the dilution is something you also have to be mindful of because while the dilution is assumed to be the full year starting on January 1, some of the savings offsets that we're going to be pursuing will take a little bit more time to evolve throughout the year. So the curve is a little bit skewed to the first and second quarters of the year. Mike said $0.06 to $0.07 in the first quarter. That's you should be factoring in and if the timing of the closing suggest, obviously that we'll get -- we'll give you some guidance on that as it materializes."

There's probably very few companies there as complex to model right now as us given the assets going out, given the changes we're making in the business and given some of the unique dynamics underway in some of our categories. Obviously, some businesses that have -- they're performing well. Other businesses are dealing with consequences of things -- of outcomes that happened earlier in the year or external events like weather. And we'll try to help provide as much visibility to all of that as possible without getting stuck in sort of too many inside baseball type of discussions."

And we source and provide one of the most important ingredients that they use in the -- and we use together in the creation of First Alert finished product for Europe",691,"First Alert has a relationship with a publicly traded company in the U.K. called Sprue. And we source and provide one of the most important ingredients that they use in the -- and we use together in the creation of First Alert finished product for Europe out of Asia. And you've got -- if you look at the complexion of our results, you see good growth in North America, good growth in Latin America, good growth in Europe. And then you see down elevator in Asia. The down elevator in Asia relates largely to this business. And this has been an issue that, that Jarden business has been dealing with all year long related to an assumption that was made in 2015 about regulatory shift that would require all households in -- all new households in France and Germany to have carbon monoxide protection and carbon -- and smoke alarms. And that legislation has been not fully enforced in 2016. But there was a lot of growth in 2015 on that business related to the impending change. And so the business -- the Branded Consumables business, the First Alert business has actually had a great year in the U.S. But it's been offset, in many ways, by significant year-over-year down elevators. And if we don't -- the First Alert business for the full year, the impact would have been about $50 million in the full year to core sales. And so this was not -- this is not a surprise. This is a known issue and we've been dealing with it all along. But that's what that comment relates to. It relates to the fact that we're working through this 2015 big bubble positive event in 2016. And by the end of the year, we've lapped all of that noise. And we're back to steady-state, and we can get on with growing our business. If you want to read what Sprue has to say about this, you can read their public comments given that they're publicly traded company on the AIM Exchange. So that's what that specifically relates to. And we don't typically get into all that level of detail, but I'm happy to if it's helpful to help explain some of the dynamics because to your point earlier, there is a lot going on in the moving parts of the business. And we're -- we've made the choice to move with speed to resolve these issues or to take advantage of opportunities. Our choice to see the complexity reduction work through on Rubbermaid Commercial Products and absorb the core sales hit associated with that is grounded in the believe that, that's the right thing to set up the future. If you look at the operating income margin in Commercial Products in the third quarter, you see a 250 basis point improvement in margin. Well, guess what, it's connected to some of those choices. And so we're going to see these choices through, irrespective of the consequences to our headline numbers because of the right thing to do to set up the future and to set up '17. And we'll take the bumps. We'll deal with the potholes and the bumps in the road with you guys and help explain it to you. But we're moving forward in a single-mindedly focused way to set up '17 in the new context of the New Growth Game Plan. And that's why I guided 2, 3 down to the low end of the range. That's why I said a month or so back that Q4 would be in the middle of the range. We're going to take the choices, we believe, are right for the future of the business and see this through irrespective of potentially having more income-driven quarters like we had in Q3 and like we might have in Q4 versus your expectation of us to get to the high end of our core sales growth ranges. And so a lot of that's happening. There's a lot of moving parts underneath the surface. Again, happy to explain it, but not going to hesitate to move forward and set up the future."

So for example in the third quarter, Writing had -- as a category, is a market had a very good growth. We had tremendous growth from a POS standpoint. And if you adjust our 7.6% growth for the $15 million, we end up near double-digit type of growth on a revenue -- on a core sales basis as well. We've increased market share in the U.S. where we can -- we have good measurements by over 100 basis points in the third quarter on our Writing business connected to an excellent story around Back-to-School. And so we've come through that period with the right replenishment orders. And we actually come into our lower seasonality period now on Writing with the opportunity to kind of reset and set up momentum for the future. And so we felt great about that. Baby, obviously, we're consolidating market share. We're growing unbelievably well in baby gear, largely U.S.-driven related to innovation. You know that we launched the 4ever car seat in 2015. That's now $100 million item for us within the baby gear business, which is, by far, our biggest innovation ever. And we've now followed that up with the Extend2Fit car seat on Graco, which allows your child to sit rear facing longer, but comfortably because of the extension that we've built into the car seat, which is, as you know, the safest way to ride as a small child. And so these innovations are driving really good growth. And in baby gear, we've consolidated share, again, as best we can measure it. But with over 10% growth and with the kind of POS numbers we see through our transactional database, very good progress. On Yankee Candle, continue to see very good POS momentum. I know there's some syndicated data out there that would suggest there's some challenges in that category. That's just not the way we see it. And while I can't disclose the specific numbers to you because these are retailer -- this is retailer data that we get every week, we have very nice growth going on from POS perspective on Yankee. The numbers on Yankee were more modest growth in Q3, but that's related to lapping the pipeline on Walmart last year and actually, the subsequent loss distribution at Target that creates an apples-and-oranges comparison in Q3 as well. Now we're back talking with all of our retailers about extending the presence of the Yankee brand. But Yankees' underlying performance was quite good, great growth in Europe, double-digit growth in Europe. So again, one of these inside baseball underlying dynamics that we had to deal with in Q3, but the good fundamental momentum. Coleman continues to be a challenge. We're not winning share there. We're going to lose share there this year related to distribution. Marmot dealing with the macro issues associated with both apparel and the consequences of last year's warm weather. Appliances, building share. These are, I'd say, evolve the Jarden businesses, the one to kind of highlight is the tremendous momentum on JCS, Jarden Consumer Solutions. It's been a full year of great growth and that's going to -- should continue into the fourth quarter with a whole series of new appliance launches. So we're, in general, in a very good shape. We've get these dynamics like Sprue, which is the distributor issue we talked about in Europe related to First Alert. You've got Yankee having to lap year-ago dynamics and having the consequences of the subsequent loss distribution at Target. You've got complexity reduction choices that we've made on Rubbermaid Commercial Products that we're going to see through because they're the right things for the long term. And you've got the loss distribution on Coleman. So these things -- you've got a mixed picture. Food storage, great growth, great market share growth, over 100 basis points of market share growth in Food Storage related to the early launch of -- early '16 launch of FRESHWORKS. And now, we're really excited about what happens with Brilliance. So at the beginning of the year, I told you guys that we were -- this was the renaissance year for Rubbermaid. It's really coming to life, obviously, through Food Storage. Beverages, fine growth on POS. But as a result of the pull forward into June related to the distribution transformation -- distribution center transition in July, not as great top line in the quarter, but very good underlying momentum. And we're going to have a really strong Q4. So I think we're exactly where we thought we were going to be. We're going to see these things through. The next business that's on the hit parade from a complexity reduction standpoint is our Writing business. And so we've talked about this all along, about going after 50 SKUs -- 50% of the SKUs and about 50% of the product line. We're in the midst of that. And we're going to drive that all the way home through the first quarter and into -- through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter. This set up next year's Back-to-School with the benefits of margin development becoming available through that window. So we're going to see these things all the way through because they're critical to renewal delivery and Project Renewal savings delivery. And they're the right things to do for the business to give us the affordability in the P&L to drive growth aggressively going forward."

But I will tell you that I'm really pleased and impressed with the Appliance business, and we've got good things going on there. I do think we -- as we build out these new design hubs that I just described in the prepared remarks, that we can do some things to even make that funnel stronger relating to fit, form and finish the design aspects of the product. So I think there's some things we can do there to strengthen the funnel. But I do think there's some interesting ideas coming through the funnel out of the JCS. I think there's good innovation in a lot of places. But the thing that I would say is that this -- innovation is not art. It's science. And the discipline of innovation development is what we built a capability in. And this is where we can bring know-how to some of our Jarden businesses. And that should increase the probability of success and increase the size of some of these projects, the incrementality of some of these projects. And so you're right. There is a lead-lag kind of effect on when that work will yield. As you -- if you put through the web deck that you put out there, you see -- you'll see how we categorize different categories with respect to portfolio roles. And for the businesses that are in the develop for growth category or win bigger, we will be able to shape and sharpen some of the work that's going on there with added resources that will be co-located with those teams. But I don't think the impact of those actions really yields growth in '17. I think that begins the yield growth in '18. In 2017, we want to continue to bring the ideas that are in the funnel to market. And we want to create broader commercial success. Example that on Coleman. We've gone back in to a number of customers and we've gotten the distribution that we lost back for 2017. That's a commercial success from my perspective. We're pushing now on Yankee Candle to broaden the wholesale distribution footprint. I'd love to find a way back into some of the customers where we've lost presence in 2015 as a result of some of the choices we've made. And we're going to go get that done. We're in the fourth quarter on baby gear. In Canada, we will restructure of our selling systems. We're a distributed business in Canada. We're going to go direct selling business in Canada. We'll take the hit on baby growth rates in Q4 to take the inventory out of the distributor. But then we'll get this big benefit in '17 connected to building out a direct selling capability on baby gear in Canada, which will give us tremendous growth opportunity. So as I've said,  whether it's Writing complexity and accepting the fact that our growth rates for the next couple of quarters will contract or whether it's baby transition in Canada from a distributor to a direct selling sales force or whether it's regaining the lost distribution on Coleman or pressing for broader distribution on Yankee in the U.S. markets, these things are as valuable as innovation-led growth. It's just commercial-led growth. And so we're -- '17 will be more commercially and execution-led for the Jarden businesses. And we'll continue the momentum on a balance of innovation and commercial-led growth on the legacy Newell businesses. But as you -- as we talk about these -- our agenda going forward, you're going to hear less Newell Rubbermaid language. You're going to hear less Jarden language. You're going to hear about our brands and about the 16 divisions we've created. And this commitment to really make life better to consumers, hundreds and millions of consumer everyday where they live, learn, work and play. And that's a powerful framework for the new company going forward. And that's how we'll map our businesses and that's how we'll begin to talk about our businesses with you."

But I think it' be tough to get it done by the end of the year. I'm sort of hopeful on Tools, although if Tools were to take longer, that's actually a positive. But I think it's best for the Tools business, for the tools team and for us to get the net proceeds in hand, so that we can work on the debt and the leverage ratio more aggressively. Because if we do that, if we get that -- if we get the proceeds in hand early, pay down the debt more aggressively, we find ourselves in a position having reset the organization to potentially get back into full-front M&A in the core complementing our organic agenda. And we think we'll have the capacity to do that, organizational capacity to do that type of thing because of the experience and leadership team and the speed with which we're moving through Q3 and Q4. So I do think Q3 and Q4 are set-up quarters for '17, and we're going to be uncompromising and finishing things we've started or getting the bad cholesterol out of the system in '16, so that we have a clean comparator. But you're right. Certain businesses lose money in certain quarters and make money in others. Ski happens to be a one that -- the perfect scenario on skis is to sell it by the end of the year. But we focused on getting Tools done first. We're in the midst of ramping on skis. And there's a lot of interest. So I'm hopeful we get a good value, we get -- we set these businesses up for success in the context of their new owner. But there are those dynamics, again, inside baseball dynamics of timing and impact on dilution and modeling that we'll do our best to help you with this as we get more clarity."

And so -- and it -- and that's certainly below what kind of core renewal has been growing over the past 3, 4 years or so.

Remember, we're going -- we're going to go through -- we have already redesigned the organization. And we're repopulating the organization in the fourth quarter in the U.S. We'll have touched over 10,000 jobs in the U.S. between Q3 and Q4. Obviously, not -- the people aren't leaving, but they're moving into different roles and different configuration. And we're working as fast as I've ever worked in my career to get the organization reset. That organization will come up to speed and get into a rhythm of working in the first quarter that has a natural sort of startup curve to it. So I do think that the first half of 2017 is a transition half. But I think you're right. I think we'll get through this very, very quickly. And we'll get into a rhythm of working. And because the cultures are more similar than different, we'll -- I think we'll get through that transition period really well. But I do think that you have to accept that when you're making that kind of broad change, that there is some distraction potential in the business. And there's always execution risk connected to that, which is why we've guided the way we've guided. You're right, the businesses we're selling have lower aggregated growth rates than the total company, so we should get a positive mix effect in core on growth. And we will get a positive mix effect when this is all said and done on margin. The issue for all of you, because this -- because of the new rules that don't allow us to do [indiscernible] on these things is that you're going to be comparing -- you won't see that margin development benefit until really 2018 after we've lapped and gotten the full year under our belt because the history will still be in our base P&L next year. But we'll try to demonstrate that to you in the -- as best we can through active engagement. But I think it's a fair challenge for us. And I used the words in the script, that steadily accelerating growth rates. I don't pick my words really carefully. That's how you should think about the growth through 2017. And we said steadily increase -- steadily accelerating growth and rapid accretion and strong cash flow -- rapid earnings accretion and strong cash delivery. And that should tell you what we think the story is. We've guided EPS, which is complicated next year because of dilution share count and interest expense. But I also, in the script, said strong double-digit normalized operating income growth and net -- normalized net income growth, which should tell you what's going on in the underlying business. And I think if you went all the way back and rewound the tape to April and said, ""What did Mike say in April?"" I said year 1 accretion high single digits; year 2 accretion, mid-teens to high teens and then strong double-digit accretion year 3 and onward. Well, unfortunately, the years don't correlate to the calendar year, so you'd have to kind of peak that all together. But if you go back and look at that, it looks to me like we're well ahead of what we said we were going to do. So -- but there's so much noise in all of your models because it's so difficult for you to do what normally saying you guys need to do with accuracy given how much we disclose that we're going to have to deal with the fact that -- and Nancy will work hard with you to try to narrow the arrow band around these things. We'll have to deal with the fact that 2017 is probably another year where it isn't quite as precise as it will be once we get to apples-to-apples comparators for you."

Does running the 2 separate operating models that you've described today limit the synergy upside to the $500 million that you at least talked about as potentially residing in the business? Because it seems like the magnitude of synergies available on the entrepreneurial model businesses would be materially less than the development and delivery businesses, does that make sense?"

I thought of putting that on the deck. I think we'll hold on that. Let us get through '17 planning so I can provide a forward-looking view.

Let us get through '17 planning so I can provide a forward-looking view. We'll probably give you that at CAGNY so you'll have a little  bit more specificity. We also have to get into the reporting segments as we resolved that through the fourth quarter because we're not going to report 16 divisions obviously. But you should think about that as the context of strategic ambition I laid out around Live, Learn, Work and Play and there's probably maybe a fifth segment out there, who knows, but we need to work through all that over time. With respect to your question on synergies, the devils are in the the details. So for example, we're going to play synergies everywhere we can get them. So from a -- for the entrepreneurial a -- to deliver entrepreneurially positions businesses, we're going to clearly go after synergies and corporate functions. And we're going to go after synergies where we said procurements, IT, legal and eventually as we build out a shared services model on IT transactions, financed transactions, HR transaction, no matter whether your entrepreneurial or whether you're develop and deliver kind of the model. You're going to leverage that systems or yearly don't get a choice. The discussion is not about. It's not a democracy when it comes to capturing those synergies. There's a certain other synergies there going to be available for certain businesses. So business like Pure Fishing, which is a great example where it has a big part of its business in a channel that's specific to it. You're not going to capture synergies there, your may be able to scale Coleman selling with Pure Fishing. But for the Pure Fishing art of the portfolio that sold through Walmart, that sales synergy is going to be captured. If you're looking at Safety & Security, which is positioned as an entrepreneurial business, the home center portion of Safety & Security is going to be sold by the Home Depot team and the Lowe's steam. You'll get back bit of synergy. And so it's not binary. There's a level of granularity to this that enables you to play for some of those route-to-market synergies and certainly, the corporate search services across the entire enterprise. E-commerce is a division will cut across the whole enterprise irrespective of whether you are an entrepreneurial led business are part of the development delivery model. So I don't think it's going to limit it. We still believe that I give you some very specific numbers with respect to growth synergies and savings for next year for this year, and we're well on our way to delivering those numbers and to the degree we can find more, we'll offer those out. I think I'm almost certain there will be more, not necessarily next year perhaps, but not necessarily next year. But as we look forward beyond '17, to '18, to '19 kind of hopeful that there are. I'm not at all fuzzed by the 2 operating model approach. I think it's actually a positive relative to what we had on the Newell Rubbermaid side. We've learned from that experience and some those businesses would have been better managed as more autonomous businesses with a very specific targets that shape the margin development of them."

So that will change the complexion over that period of time, so we'll get the benefit on the organic side from all the things that Mike had alluded to. But I would say this sort of repositioning also strengthens us overall because we're going to be we subcategories out that frankly, would have been more of a challenge in our minds to develop and grow within that model, and then have an opportunity to bring in some different businesses in our core categories and capabilities that we could leverage and create more.

So think about this year, you're divesting businesses that are noncore that don't really play in the same spaces to balance your portfolio, they don't rough to market synergies or they don't have -- they don't or can't leverage your core operating model. And so we're going to get margin development from that, we're going to get the net proceeds in from that, we'll pay down the debt, will give us access to M&A faster. But the real story in the M&A is that we have the breadth of the products and categories that we want now. The whole theory of the combination is grounded in this opportunity to consolidate unconsolidated categories. So we compete in large growing unconsolidated categories with leading brands. And so we're going to apply the model for growth to build market share in those anchored categories but then we're going to complement with M&A in the core. And the M&A in the core is, by far, the most interesting value creation past we could take because we will plug brands into the existing operating units. And best example is Elmer's. Within 6 months, we have plug that brand into the Reading creative expressions group and delivered 20-plus million of run rate synergies. Think about a very creation connected to that. So as we get back into bolt-on activity in the core, we will be able to bridge right back to the original guide path and I actually think ahead of the original guide path. And I actually think ahead of the original guide path. You may not all work. The timing they may not all work out in '17, but once we get it to '18 and beyond, we should be really modeling and hopefully, ahead -- obviously, the numbers I communicated in that $5.5 billion to $6 billion excluded any disposals but also excluded any acquisitions. And I think we got right back to the glide path, it's just we look through this transitional window and I think we might actually get ahead of the glide path that we originally laid out driven by synergies connected to the acquisitions."

So the things that I'm looking at is am looking at the net sales numbers relative to what you guys have a new models, and we're off a bit. And I think part of that is driven by other performance in the held-for-sale businesses relative to what you expected. And to be fair, some of those businesses underperformed our expectations as well. If you follow the Stanley discussion when they were talking about the deal, they talked about a distribution transition issue in Tool -- our Tools business that they were aware of, and we disclosed. And so we had -- the held-for-sale businesses underperforming slightly. The balance of the business came in pretty much where we thought it was going to be. I debated back with Q2 earnings given you guys some of these moving parts that I've now disclosed like a didn't think I would be a better be talking about our SPRUE relationship in the U.K., but I think it's worth talking about. You have a whole series -- and I didn't talk to you about the beverage DC transition because I don't think it was were talking about. But it was kind of hoping that we would have gotten 20, 30, 40 basis points more, but that's $12 million in the quarter, so it's not something I spent a lot of time worrying about. But beverages, there are whole series of onetime things that we just chose to model right on through that their beverages DC, the SPRUE event continuing to see that the Commercial Products transition all the way through. These are choices that are the right choices for the long haul, but they compromise year end type of delivery. And we just accepted that risk associated with the guidance. But your rough math is right, but they were just -- they were roughly the same amount of onetime negatives in the business that we're working against the number you quoted. So all of that was within our line of sight, maybe we're hoping for a little bit better or less profound impacts there, but it's on the fringes when you think about what else we were worrying about in the quarter. We were worried about disposing $1.5 billion worth of business, we were resetting the entire organization, including the sales force, which is not a small deal to do when you're -- as U.S.-centric as we are. So our focus was on the longer time frame and in a perfect world, we would have delivered 3.5, 4, but in the context of what we were doing, we wanted to see the other stuff through that could have mitigated the risk, and we chose to take a longer than 90-day view on some of those choices. You could easily defer the transition and beverages, you could have easily defer some  of the other choices we're making on complexity to flatter core numbers, but we just didn't in the context of the kind of profound change we're driving just didn't want to create that complexity in the organization. So we chose to ignore it and let the numbers play the way they were going to play."

This is a commercial organization so this is a selling and demand conversion organization so they will not be spending the vast majority of their time in digital market that would be the brand book with organization people that will be creating the digital assets and thinking about the digital media strategy. So the brand owners will own that work. This is a group of people that will be focused, and it will be a sizable group of people who will be focused on taking the demand created by the brand teams and converting it to purchase in these channels. And their focus is going to be largely brick-and-mortar.com and pure-play.com. We do not envision a huge movement forward on Director consumer, except in the Yankee business and then selected other businesses like Marmot and potentially Coleman and Baby. But the reality is that the vast majority of that growth is going to come bricks-and-mortar.com and pure-play.com. And so the selling aspects around Amazon, the pure play or Ali Baba as a pure play, or walmart.com as a pure play, that will be led by this team and they'll be working in partnership with the bricks-and-mortar teams to drive conversion of demand, the purchase and the channel. It's going to be really, really exciting. The $1 billion growth, I think, is conservative in terms of what's possible by 2020, but we're ramping that capability now and the hub of that organization will be 1 floor below the executive team in Hoboken.

So yes, there some value pipeline and value in China, but we're going to really pulled the throttle back as we go through this complexity reduction period in writing.

What I've said historically though is that ideas trap the macros that you can't really let wait for the macros to help you or if they're going to hurt you, you better figure out how you're going to compensate for that. And that would be -- that's the way we tend to look at things."

So you can back it to roughly what that will be post disposals and come up with the revenue base that this growth is off of. We can't measure eComm growth everywhere in the world but where we have transaction data, and POS data, we actually break down all of our retailer trends, bricks-and-mortar and.com. So we look at every product family in the U.S. for example, by retailer in bricks-and-mortar and then.com, so we're looking at trends separately since we can get access to their data in that way. For reference, our U.S. businesses are growing double-digit, have nice double-digit growth and I won't quote a specific number in the channel, and this is after year, 2 or 3 years of that type of momentum. And so we continue to grow really nicely here with particularly big platforms existing in camping and then baby gear, rapidly growing Writing instrument business, and we expect to be able to build some big platforms around Yankee beyond their direct to consumer work that they do themselves. We've got a lot of interesting things happening here and obviously this is a global opportunity to the organization that we're building we'll have -- we'll be a global organization like all of our operating divisions. I won't quote the exact investment amount but it's sizable, the savings that we generate some of the other work that we're doing will fund the investment necessary to populate that organization. The analytics question is it actually excellent question, and it's really, really important to both us and the retailers that we're doing business with in the space because nobody's quite figure out, whether it's the pure play players or the bricks-and-mortar.com players or, in my experience, the suppliers, folks like us. Nobody's quite figured out how to create moments that matter online that are linked to the underlying consumer moments that matter. So Food Storage around holidays, Food Storage -- around Food Storage around anytime that there's leftovers, writing instruments Back-to-School, interestingly enough, the online channel loses to bricks-and-mortar Back-to-School in writing, ironically. And because the online players haven't figured in both brick-and-mortar and in.com and pure-play.com haven't yet end manufacturers haven't figured out how to get their fair share of the channel in that moment that matters. And so analytics will be really, really critical to us, sharpening the way we activate our marketing programs in these channels. And there's a lot to be learned here. So this is a big part of that organization. If you look at that team, when we expose that team to, I'm sure we will at some point, you'll see a much higher percentage of the overhead structured in this area and there are some very specific skills and techniques that they are applying to glean incest necessarily to make sure we're going to return on investment. So there's a lot to do here. I don't think anybody's got it right both on the retailers side and on the supplier side."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the Newell Brands' third quarter earnings call. 
I'm pleased this morning to report a solid set of third quarter results with good progress on many fronts. Third quarter was planned as an income-driven quarter. We delivered results that were well ahead of our plan, enabled by strong cost synergies and Project Renewal savings, initial tax synergies and competitive levels of growth in the context of an intense period of organization and portfolio change. 
Our momentum businesses of Writing, Baby, Food and Appliances continue to deliver strong growth, which was partially offset by expected declines on Outdoor Solutions and Commercial Products. 
Cash flow was quite strong, enabling us to pay down over $230 million of debt or about $1.3 billion since the completion of the Jarden transaction only 26 weeks ago. 
We delivered these results while also completing a comprehensive review of the business, aligning the organization around the new strategic framework called the Growth Game Plan. The New Growth Game Plan establishes a new set of investment priorities, make sharp portfolio of choices, resets and streamlines the organization from a holding company to an operating company consolidating 32 business units to 16 divisions while simultaneously scaling our innovation, design, insight, brand development and e-commerce capabilities across much of our new portfolio with the intention to deliver steady growth acceleration with rapid earnings accretion and strong cash flow generation over the next few years. 
We've driven this new strategy into action in the third quarter, announcing a series of organization and portfolio changes. We've chosen to move decisively and with speed because we have the benefit of lessons learned from the Newell Rubbermaid transformation and confidence in our team's ability to perform while we simultaneously transform. 
Our third quarter and year-to-date results are good evidence that we can deliver while changing. And in that context, this morning, we've raised our 2016 guidance toward the high end of both guidance ranges. 
So with that as preamble, let me quickly review our performance highlights and then I'll pass the time to Ralph to dive deeper. 
The  Q3 headlines are as follows: net sales have more than doubled as a result of the Jarden transaction of $3.95 billion. Core sales grew 3%, led by strong performances in Writing, Baby, Food and Appliances. Reported EPS was $0.38 per diluted share after absorbing the negative impact of about $0.19 of onetime cost associated with the Jarden inventory step-up and about $0.08 of other onetime transaction-related costs. Normalized EPS was $0.78, an increase of over 25% versus prior year. And operating cash flow was over $511 million, an increase of over 50% versus prior year. 
Year-to-date, net sales have more than doubled to $9.13 billion as a result of the Jarden transaction. Core sales have grown 4.2%, and that growth has been broad-based with 7 and 9 segments growing in North American core growth of 5%, Latin American core growth of 8% and Europe, Middle East and Africa core growth of nearly 3%. 
Reported EPS was $0.91 per diluted share after absorbing the negative impact of about $0.78 of onetime cost associated with the Jarden inventory step-up and about $0.20 of onetime transaction-related costs. Normalized EPS was $2.08, up over 28% versus prior year. And operating cash flow was $837 million, an increase of over 190% versus prior year. 
So a good set of outcomes, and we continue to do what we say we're going to do. 
With that, I will now hand the call over to Ralph, and then I'll return to provide perspective on the balance of 2016 and our initial outlook for 2017."

As Mike noted, our Q3 financial results were solid on a -- and on plan across all key metrics: core sales, gross and operating margin and operating cash flow. We're also on track with capturing cost savings through synergies and Project Renewal and on track with our deleveraging plan. 
Third quarter reported net sales were $3.95 billion, a 159% increase versus last year, which was largely attributable to the Jarden transaction. Core sales increased 3%. Recorded -- reported gross margin was 32.2% compared with 39.1% last year largely due to the Jarden transaction-related inventory step-up charges in the amount of $146 million. This completes the turn of Jarden-acquired inventory and the related step-up charges. 
Normalized gross margin was 36% compared with 39.5% last year. The decline is due to the negative mix effect from the Jarden acquisition and the deconsolidation of Venezuela, which more than offset positive impacts from synergies, productivity and pricing. 
We reported SG&A expense of $938 million or 23.7% of net sales, 190 basis point improvement versus last year despite the impacts of higher integration cost. 
Normalized SG&A expense was $817 million or 20.6% of sales, a 360 basis point improvement. Both reported a normalized improvements were driven by the mixed impact from the Jarden legacy businesses, which have historically carried a lower SG&A spend rate as well as benefits from Project Renewal savings and transaction-related synergies. 
Reported operating margin was 8.2% of sales compared with 12.2% in the prior year. This decrease was largely attributable to the inventory step-up amortization-related cost and certain other transaction-related expenses. Normalized operating margin improved 20 basis points to 15.4% of sales when compared to the prior year. 
Interest expense of $125 million rose $107 million year-over-year, reflecting the higher debt balance incurred in the financing of the Jarden and Elmer's transactions. 
Our reported tax rate was 6.8% compared with last year's reported rate of 16.1%, reflecting the effect of discrete items in the quarter. The normalized tax rate was 22.5% compared with 20% in the prior year, driven by tax synergies and discrete items in the quarter, more than offset by the mix effect of the Jarden acquisition. 
Reported EPS was $0.38 compared with $0.50 in the prior year due largely to the acquisition-related charges and expenses as well as increased interest expense and a higher share count. These transaction-related expenses were partially offset by the operating profit contribution from the Jarden and Elmer's acquisitions. 
Normalized EPS, which excludes transaction-related expenses and certain other charges, was $0.78, a 26% increase versus last year. The improvement was primarily driven by sales growth, the contribution from the Jarden and Elmer's acquisitions and savings benefits from both synergies and Project Renewal. These benefits more than offset increased shares outstanding and higher interest expense. 
Turning now to our segment results. Writing net sales increased 14.5%, slight acceleration of approximately $15 million of net sales from Q3 into Q2 to support Back-to-School merchandising. Writing core sales increased 7.7%, reflecting a strong Back-to-School season behind innovation such as Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens and increased advertising and promotion support. 
Net sales in Home Solutions declined 19.1% due primarily to the divestiture of the Décor business. Core sales, which excludes the Rubbermaid Consumer Storage totes business that is held for sale, declined 0.5%, primarily attributable to the timing impact of the transition of the key distribution center in the beverage business. 
Tools net sales declined 5.7%, driven by continued challenges in Brazil and negative foreign currency, partially offset by growth in Europe. 
Commercial Products net sales declined 3.7%, primarily due to the divestiture of the Rubbermaid medical cart business, the negative impact of foreign currency and softness in the North American distribution trade channel related to ongoing plan complexity reduction activity. Core sales decreased 1.8%. 
Baby grew net sales 11.3% largely due to continued strong sales momentum in North America from Graco and Baby Jogger. Core sales, which excludes the Teutonia business that was held-for-sale, increased 10.6%. 
Turning now to legacy Jarden segments. I will refer to net and core sales as compared with pro forma results for the same period in 2015. 
Net sales in branded consumables increased 5% and core sales increased 0.6%. Waddington, which is reflected in core sales as of August 1, grew mid-single digits. Yankee Candle grew more modestly as we lapped last year's pipeline sale at Walmart. Core growth was partially offset by weak performance of the Safety & Security business outside the United States. 
Consumer Solutions net sales increased 7.9%. Core sales, which exclude the U.S. Heaters, Humidifiers and Fans business that is held for sale, increased 9.3%, driven by strong results in both North America and Latin America. 
We had good growth in Crockpot, Sunbeam and FoodSaver, fueled by innovation such as the new FoodSaver food preservation system, which launched in Q3. 
Outdoor Solutions net sales increased 12.1% largely attributable to the Jostens acquisition. Core sales, which excludes the Winter Sports business that is held for sale, declined 3.2% compared with prior year, with growth in Pure Fishing more than offset by declines in Coleman. 
Net sales in Process Solutions increased 11.4%. Core sales increased 12.4% compared with prior year due to volume growth and commodity-based pricing. 
Let's turn now to Q3 core sales by geography. North America, which represents about 80% of total sales, grew core growth by 3.1% led by strong growth in Baby and Writing. 
In EMEA, core sales grew 2.7%, reflecting continued strong growth in Yankee Candle, partially offset by weakness in Commercial Products. 
Latin America delivered strong core growth sales growth of 15.2%, driven by robust sales in Consumer Solutions and Writing. 
Asia Pacific core sales declined 8.4% due primarily to softness in our Safety & Security business [indiscernible] from that region. 
During Q3, we reported $511 million of operating cash flow compared with $340 million in the prior year. The improvement reflects contribution from Jarden, improved operating results across the portfolio and favorable working capital movements. 
We returned $92 million in dividends to shareholders. We also paid down debt by $231 million, which brings our quarter-end gross debt balance down to $12.75 billion. With the benefit of the cash proceeds from the upcoming sale of Tools, we are now projecting that we'll reach our 3 to 3.5x leverage goal ahead of plan. 
In summary, a good quarter with progress on many fronts. At this point, I'll turn the call back to Mike."

If you no doubt know, we've been hard at work laying the groundwork for accelerated performance and value creation.

If you no doubt know, we've been hard at work laying the groundwork for accelerated performance and value creation. Creation of Newell Brands strengthens our presence in existing geographies and customers and enhances our reach to an extended international footprint and access to new channels of distribution. This new scale gives us the opportunity to make life better for hundreds of millions of consumers every day, where they live, learn, work and play. 
This New Growth Game Plan has at its core this bold ambition and vision, and a new set of investment priorities and portfolio choices that will shape our growth ambitions and resource allocation. Strategy is designed to unlock the unique opportunity that's inherent in the categories of both legacy companies. 
Across the Newell Brands portfolio, we have leading brands to compete in large growing categories that are responsive to activity. These are categories that are unconsolidated and, as a result, have a low cost of growth. These unique conditions create a unique potential for the company prepared to make the investments necessary to capture the market share consolidation opportunity. 
Over the last 5 years, we've invested to build advantaged capabilities in insight, design, innovation, brand marketing, e-commerce and collaborative selling that differentiate us versus our sub-scaled competitive set. We've reshaped the company from a holding company to an operating company, releasing costs that have been reinvested to both build these scaled competitive advantages in our core growth capabilities and to more than double the E&P investment on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid brands. 
This operating model has worked as it's evident in the company's performance. Capturing the transformative value-creation opportunity inherent in the Newell Rubbermaid combination with Jarden will be a function of our success applying this model more broadly. The New Growth Game Plan is designed to do just that, apply this proven playbook across a broader set of categories and geographies. And we're moving fast now to drive this new strategy into action. 
We've announced our intention to focus our portfolio on the categories with the greatest potential, divesting about $1.5 billion of business with a definitive agreement now reached to sell more cyclical Tools business to a strategic buyer at an attractive multiple. 
We will also divest a number of other noncore businesses, including Winter Sports, Rubbermaid Consumer Storage, U.S. Heaters, Humidifiers and Fans, Lehigh Rope and Cordage and a number of smaller brands, including Teutonia, Zoot and Squadra. The work to sell these assets has begun. And we hope to have buyers lined up for these businesses by the end of 2017. 
We've also made a new set of investment priorities, clustering the balance of our businesses against 3 discrete portfolio roles: win bigger, develop for growth and deliver entrepreneurially. These 3 roles will shape resource allocation with win bigger categories benefiting from higher advertising and promotion investment and develop for growth categories receiving a meaningful increase in insight and design investment as we work to strengthen the funnel of future growth ideas. 
Both our win bigger and develop for growth categories will leverage a delivery and development operating model like the one previously deployed on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid businesses. 
Our deliver entrepreneurially businesses will be led and resourced more autonomously with very specific business targets that ladder up to the overall company performance. 
We've also begun the comprehensive reset of the organization that flows from these priorities. We'll consolidate 32 businesses to 16 Global Divisions, with these divisions becoming the key operating nodes of the company. We will scale our U.S. selling organization, creating integrated selling teams in our top 20 retail partners that account for 50% of our U.S. revenue.  We will create global centers of expertise in key HR and finance disciplines and establish new global functions in procurement, IT and legal. We will build 2 new design hubs in Chicago and New York and increase investment in brand research, as we extend the reach of these advantage capabilities to new Jarden brands. We will create a new Global eCommerce Division that will assume accountability for delivering over $1 billion of incremental growth across the enterprise by 2020. We expect to have the U.S. organization reset by the end of the year with the rest of the world to follow sometime in 2017. 
With this scope of change, we're making very good progress on costs with tremendous opportunity still ahead. We've delivered over $100 million in incremental 2016 savings related to Project Renewal through the third quarter. And we are well on our way to deliver between $130 million and $140 million of incremental savings for the full year. The cost synergy teams are now in full flight, with excellent progress on procurement, corporate duplication and corporate functions, and now, the operating divisions. 
The decisive action to reshape the portfolio set new investment priorities and reset the organization where released -- where we'll release the accelerated savings and synergies we've committed to deliver, ensuring earnings development while simultaneously enabling investment for growth. 
Let me now turn to our 2016 outlook and our initial outlook for 2017. This morning, we increased Newell Brands' 2016 full year guidance, raising the bottom of the guidance ranges. We now expect to deliver 2016 full year core sales growth of 3.5% to 4% and full year normalized EPS of $2.85 to $2.90. We're tracking towards the high end of the new core sales guidance range and the midpoint of the new normalized EPS range. 
Our full year 2016 guidance assumes just over $210 million in incremental gross cost savings related to both Project Renewal and cost and tax synergies from the combination with Jarden. And with the benefit of tax synergies and onetime tax benefits in the third quarter, we now expect the full year tax rate to be about 27.5%. 
Our revised guidance assumes the assets held for sale are not divested until January 1, 2017, and that the current share count of just over 486 million shares remains essentially unchanged through the end of 2016. 
This morning, we've also provided our initial outlook for 2017. We expect full year core sales growth of 3% to 4% and normalized earnings per share of $2.85 to $3.05. Our 2017 guidance metrics assumes we complete the divestiture of all assets held for sale on January 1, 2017, resulted -- resulting in normalized earnings per share dilution net of interest expense benefit of about $0.20 per share. 
Our 2017 guidance assumes just over $300 million in incremental gross cost savings related to Project Renewal and the incremental cost and tax synergies related to the combination with Jarden. We will spend some of these benefits back in the business as we extend our growth capabilities to the Jarden businesses and scale our e-commerce division. We expect the 2017 share count to be about 488 million shares and the tax rate to be between 26% and 27%. We expect to deliver strong double-digit normalized operating income and normalized net income in 2017 despite the dilutive impact of divestitures and higher interest expense associated with the Jarden transaction. 
While we do not provide quarterly guidance, I do want to make sure you're taking the following dynamics into consideration as you think about the next 2 quarters. 
First, regarding the fourth quarter of 2016, we've taken the decision to invest significantly more A&P in Q4 than we did in Q3, with investment prioritized against new innovations like the launch of Rubbermaid Brilliance, one of our best-ever food storage line of products that provides a seal that simply will not leak. And on Yankee Candle with a significant new investment in advertising during the holidays. Given our current growth assumptions for the fourth quarter, this increased level of investment to over 6% of revenue on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid brands will likely yield fourth quarter normalized earnings per share of about $0.80, which would represent about a $0.24 increase in normalized earnings per share versus prior year or about a 43% increase. 
To be clear, we have -- if we have earnings upside to the fourth quarter, we would likely take the opportunity to make further investments for growth rather than let the benefits flow to furthering what is already very strong earnings performance. 
With regard to the first quarter of 2017, as we discussed on our second quarter earnings call, we expect normalized earnings per share dilution in the first quarter of 2017 versus 2016. The first quarter is a seasonally low earnings quarter for both legacy Jarden and Newell Rubbermaid. And earnings per share will be burdened by the significantly higher share count and interest expense related to the combination. 
Since our last call, we've announced the sale of our Tools business and plans to divest a number of other businesses. We expect a full year dilution net of interest expense benefit to be about $0.20, with that dilution skewed more to the first half of the year, driven by the phasing of mitigating actions assumed in the net impact. We expect the first quarter impact of dilution net of interest expense benefit to be about $0.06 to $0.07, assuming the transactions are completed by January 1. So I would encourage you to take this into account in your first quarter estimates. 
So in closing, we're moving now with speed and decisiveness to capture the transformative value-creation opportunity inherent in the combination of Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden. Year-to-date, we've grown core sales 4.2% and delivered normalized EPS growth of over 28% despite the potential distraction that a transaction of this size could create. 
We've reset our corporate strategy and launched the New Growth Game Plan with a clear road map that sets new investment priorities, strengthens our portfolios and reshapes the organization. These actions are in full flight, and we expect them to be largely completed before the first anniversary of the combination. 
We're simultaneously making new investments in design, insights and e-commerce. And we'll decisively move resourcing to our highest priority, win bigger and develop for growth categories as part of the 2017 plan. 
Our cost and savings programs are delivering on an -- on our -- on an accelerated timetable. We now expect to deliver over $210 million in combined growth savings in 2016 and have a line of sight to over $300 million in combined incremental gross savings and tax synergies in 2017. 
We have raised guidance for 2016 and have an ambitious plan for 2017 that will deliver strong double-digit normalized operating income and normalized net income growth despite the lost income and retained cost associated with divestitures. 
We're generating a lot of cash through the operations and by the end of 2016 now expect to a pay down about $2 billion of debt since the completion of the Jarden transaction. And with the incremental U.S.-based net proceeds from the divestitures available into early 2017, we should be in a position to accelerate debt repayment further. 
Our principles for capital allocation are clear and firm. We will invest in value-creating CapEx and restructuring. We will generate dividends in our 30% to 35% payout ratio range. We will drive our leverage ratio to the targeted 3 to 3.5x range with both gross debt reduction and EBITDA development. And over time, our cash generative business will create many options to complement our organic agenda with external development of our core categories. 
With the choice to restructure our portfolio and the generation of substantial net proceeds from those divestitures, we can now envision paths to accelerate achievement of our leverage ratio targets while simultaneously pursuing the external development of our anchored categories through bolt-on M&A in the core. 
This is an exciting time to be part of Newell Brands. I want to thank our people for their hard work and unwavering focus on delivery. Execution is an everyday thing, and I'm very proud of our team's determination and drive for results, particularly in the midst of tremendous change. Together, we're building a larger, stronger, fast growing and more profitable company. Our confidence is high because our team has done this kind of work before. We're incredibly well positioned to grow our brands, are energized by the opportunity to create a lot of value for our shareholders and are driven by the prospects of building one of the leading consumer goods companies in the world, a company that helps make life better for hundreds of millions of consumers every day where they live, learn, work and play. That is both the promise and the potential of Newell Brands. 
With that, I'd like to pass the call back to Hannah, who'll open the line for questions."

And that assumption would be that it all gets transacted at the beginning of the year. And if that occurred, it's -- it would equate -- on all the divestitures, it would equate to about $0.20 of dilution. So from that, as the actual time tables unfold, as we move through the year, we'll share that with you. You'll see that and we'll adjust accordingly. I'd say also that, which -- and Mike kind of alluded to in his remarks, the slope of the curve of the dilution is something you also have to be mindful of because while the dilution is assumed to be the full year starting on January 1, some of the savings offsets that we're going to be pursuing will take a little bit more time to evolve throughout the year. So the curve is a little bit skewed to the first and second quarters of the year. Mike said $0.06 to $0.07 in the first quarter. That's you should be factoring in and if the timing of the closing suggest, obviously that we'll get -- we'll give you some guidance on that as it materializes."

And we'll take the opportunity to provide clarity at that moment, any incremental clarity that we can provide with those -- as those opportunities present themselves. We could have played at 1 or 2 ways. We chose to play it this way, so that you could start thinking about this. There's probably very few companies there as complex to model right now as us given the assets going out, given the changes we're making in the business and given some of the unique dynamics underway in some of our categories. Obviously, some businesses that have -- they're performing well. Other businesses are dealing with consequences of things -- of outcomes that happened earlier in the year or external events like weather.

And you've got -- if you look at the complexion of our results, you see good growth in North America, good growth in Latin America, good growth in Europe. And then you see down elevator in Asia. The down elevator in Asia relates largely to this business. And this has been an issue that, that Jarden business has been dealing with all year long related to an assumption that was made in 2015 about regulatory shift that would require all households in -- all new households in France and Germany to have carbon monoxide protection and carbon -- and smoke alarms. And that legislation has been not fully enforced in 2016. But there was a lot of growth in 2015 on that business related to the impending change. And so the business -- the Branded Consumables business, the First Alert business has actually had a great year in the U.S. But it's been offset, in many ways, by significant year-over-year down elevators. And if we don't -- the First Alert business for the full year, the impact would have been about $50 million in the full year to core sales. And so this was not -- this is not a surprise. This is a known issue and we've been dealing with it all along. But that's what that comment relates to. It relates to the fact that we're working through this 2015 big bubble positive event in 2016. And by the end of the year, we've lapped all of that noise. And we're back to steady-state, and we can get on with growing our business. If you want to read what Sprue has to say about this, you can read their public comments given that they're publicly traded company on the AIM Exchange. So that's what that specifically relates to. And we don't typically get into all that level of detail, but I'm happy to if it's helpful to help explain some of the dynamics because to your point earlier, there is a lot going on in the moving parts of the business. And we're -- we've made the choice to move with speed to resolve these issues or to take advantage of opportunities. Our choice to see the complexity reduction work through on Rubbermaid Commercial Products and absorb the core sales hit associated with that is grounded in the believe that, that's the right thing to set up the future. If you look at the operating income margin in Commercial Products in the third quarter, you see a 250 basis point improvement in margin. Well, guess what, it's connected to some of those choices. And so we're going to see these choices through, irrespective of the consequences to our headline numbers because of the right thing to do to set up the future and to set up '17. And we'll take the bumps. We'll deal with the potholes and the bumps in the road with you guys and help explain it to you. But we're moving forward in a single-mindedly focused way to set up '17 in the new context of the New Growth Game Plan. And that's why I guided 2, 3 down to the low end of the range. That's why I said a month or so back that Q4 would be in the middle of the range. We're going to take the choices, we believe, are right for the future of the business and see this through irrespective of potentially having more income-driven quarters like we had in Q3 and like we might have in Q4 versus your expectation of us to get to the high end of our core sales growth ranges. And so a lot of that's happening. There's a lot of moving parts underneath the surface. Again, happy to explain it, but not going to hesitate to move forward and set up the future."

We've increased market share in the U.S. where we can -- we have good measurements by over 100 basis points in the third quarter on our Writing business connected to an excellent story around Back-to-School. And so we've come through that period with the right replenishment orders. And we actually come into our lower seasonality period now on Writing with the opportunity to kind of reset and set up momentum for the future. And so we felt great about that. Baby, obviously, we're consolidating market share. We're growing unbelievably well in baby gear, largely U.S.-driven related to innovation. You know that we launched the 4ever car seat in 2015. That's now $100 million item for us within the baby gear business, which is, by far, our biggest innovation ever. And we've now followed that up with the Extend2Fit car seat on Graco, which allows your child to sit rear facing longer, but comfortably because of the extension that we've built into the car seat, which is, as you know, the safest way to ride as a small child. And so these innovations are driving really good growth. And in baby gear, we've consolidated share, again, as best we can measure it. But with over 10% growth and with the kind of POS numbers we see through our transactional database, very good progress. On Yankee Candle, continue to see very good POS momentum. I know there's some syndicated data out there that would suggest there's some challenges in that category. That's just not the way we see it. And while I can't disclose the specific numbers to you because these are retailer -- this is retailer data that we get every week, we have very nice growth going on from POS perspective on Yankee. The numbers on Yankee were more modest growth in Q3, but that's related to lapping the pipeline on Walmart last year and actually, the subsequent loss distribution at Target that creates an apples-and-oranges comparison in Q3 as well. Now we're back talking with all of our retailers about extending the presence of the Yankee brand. But Yankees' underlying performance was quite good, great growth in Europe, double-digit growth in Europe. So again, one of these inside baseball underlying dynamics that we had to deal with in Q3, but the good fundamental momentum. Coleman continues to be a challenge. We're not winning share there. We're going to lose share there this year related to distribution. Marmot dealing with the macro issues associated with both apparel and the consequences of last year's warm weather. Appliances, building share. These are, I'd say, evolve the Jarden businesses, the one to kind of highlight is the tremendous momentum on JCS, Jarden Consumer Solutions. It's been a full year of great growth and that's going to -- should continue into the fourth quarter with a whole series of new appliance launches. So we're, in general, in a very good shape. We've get these dynamics like Sprue, which is the distributor issue we talked about in Europe related to First Alert. You've got Yankee having to lap year-ago dynamics and having the consequences of the subsequent loss distribution at Target. You've got complexity reduction choices that we've made on Rubbermaid Commercial Products that we're going to see through because they're the right things for the long term. And you've got the loss distribution on Coleman. So these things -- you've got a mixed picture. Food storage, great growth, great market share growth, over 100 basis points of market share growth in Food Storage related to the early launch of -- early '16 launch of FreshWorks. And now, we're really excited about what happens with Brilliance. So at the beginning of the year, I told you guys that we were -- this was the renaissance year for Rubbermaid. It's really coming to life, obviously, through Food Storage. Beverages, fine growth on POS. But as a result of the pull forward into June related to the distribution transformation -- distribution center transition in July, not as great top line in the quarter, but very good underlying momentum. And we're going to have a really strong Q4. So I think we're exactly where we thought we were going to be. We're going to see these things through. The next business that's on the hit parade from a complexity reduction standpoint is our Writing business. And so we've talked about this all along, about going after 50 SKUs -- 50% of the SKUs and about 50% of the product line. We're in the midst of that. And we're going to drive that all the way home through the first quarter and into -- through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter. This set up next year's Back-to-School with the benefits of margin development becoming available through that window. So we're going to see these things all the way through because they're critical to renewal delivery and Project Renewal savings delivery. And they're the right things to do for the business to give us the affordability in the P&L to drive growth aggressively going forward."

But I will tell you that I'm really pleased and impressed with the Appliance business, and we've got good things going on there. I do think we -- as we build out these new design hubs that I just described in the prepared remarks, that we can do some things to even make that funnel stronger relating to fit, form and finish the design aspects of the product. So I think there's some things we can do there to strengthen the funnel. But I do think there's some interesting ideas coming through the funnel out of the JCS. I think there's good innovation in a lot of places. But the thing that I would say is that this -- innovation is not art. It's science. And the discipline of innovation development is what we built a capability in. And this is where we can bring know-how to some of our Jarden businesses. And that should increase the probability of success and increase the size of some of these projects, the incrementality of some of these projects. And so you're right. There is a lead-lag kind of effect on when that work will yield. As you -- if you put through the web deck that you put out there, you see -- you'll see how we categorize different categories with respect to portfolio roles. And for the businesses that are in the develop for growth category or win bigger, we will be able to shape and sharpen some of the work that's going on there with added resources that will be co-located with those teams. But I don't think the impact of those actions really yields growth in '17. I think that begins the yield growth in '18. In 2017, we want to continue to bring the ideas that are in the funnel to market. And we want to create broader commercial success. An example of that is on Coleman. We've gone back in to a number of customers and we've gotten the distribution that we lost back for 2017. That's a commercial success from my perspective. We're pushing now on Yankee Candle to broaden the wholesale distribution footprint. I'd love to find a way back into some of the customers where we've lost presence in 2015 as a result of some of the choices we've made. And we're going to go get that done. We're in the fourth quarter on baby gear. In Canada, we will restructure of our selling systems. We're a distributed business in Canada. We're going to go direct selling business in Canada. We'll take the hit on baby growth rates in Q4 to take the inventory out of the distributor. But then we'll get this big benefit in '17 connected to building out a direct selling capability on baby gear in Canada, which will give us tremendous growth opportunity. So as I've said, whether it's Writing complexity and accepting the fact that our growth rates for the next couple of quarters will contract or whether it's baby transition in Canada from a distributor to a direct selling sales force or whether it's regaining the lost distribution on Coleman or pressing for broader distribution on Yankee in the U.S. markets, these things are as valuable as innovation-led growth. It's just commercial-led growth. And so we're -- '17 will be more commercially and execution-led for the Jarden businesses. And we'll continue the momentum on a balance of innovation and commercial-led growth on the legacy Newell businesses. But as you -- as we talk about these -- our agenda going forward, you're going to hear less Newell Rubbermaid language. You're going to hear less Jarden language. You're going to hear about our brands and about the 16 divisions we've created. And this commitment to really make life better to consumers, hundreds and millions of consumer everyday where they live, learn, work and play. And that's a powerful framework for the new company going forward. And that's how we'll map our businesses and that's how we'll begin to talk about our businesses with you."

So obviously, from an M&A standpoint, all that is equalizing the value. But in terms of the pacing and the dilution, we actually will get hurt a little bit ironically if it went early in the year.

But I think it' be tough to get it done by the end of the year. I'm sort of hopeful on Tools, although if Tools were to take longer, that's actually a positive. But I think it's best for the Tools business, for the tools team and for us to get the net proceeds in hand, so that we can work on the debt and the leverage ratio more aggressively. Because if we do that, if we get that -- if we get the proceeds in hand early, pay down the debt more aggressively, we find ourselves in a position having reset the organization to potentially get back into bolt-on M&A in the core complementing our organic agenda. And we think we'll have the capacity to do that, organizational capacity to do that type of thing because of the experience and leadership team and the speed with which we're moving through Q3 and Q4. So I do think Q3 and Q4 are set-up quarters for '17, and we're going to be uncompromising and finishing things we've started or getting the bad cholesterol out of the system in '16, so that we have a clean comparator. But you're right. Certain businesses lose money in certain quarters and make money in others. Ski happens to be a one that -- the perfect scenario on skis is to sell it by the end of the year. But we focused on getting Tools done first. We're in the midst of ramping on skis. And there's a lot of interest. So I'm hopeful we get a good value, we get -- we set these businesses up for success in the context of their new owner. But there are those dynamics, again, inside baseball dynamics of timing and impact on dilution and modeling that we'll do our best to help you with this as we get more clarity."

And so -- and it -- and that's certainly below what kind of core renewal has been growing over the past 3, 4 years or so.

Remember, we're going -- we're going to go through -- we have already redesigned the organization. And we're repopulating the organization in the fourth quarter in the U.S. We'll have touched over 10,000 jobs in the U.S. between Q3 and Q4. Obviously, not -- the people aren't leaving, but they're moving into different roles and different configuration. And we're working as fast as I've ever worked in my career to get the organization reset. That organization will come up to speed and get into a rhythm of working in the first quarter that has a natural sort of startup curve to it. So I do think that the first half of 2017 is a transition half. But I think you're right. I think we'll get through this very, very quickly. And we'll get into a rhythm of working. And because the cultures are more similar than different, we'll -- I think we'll get through that transition period really well. But I do think that you have to accept that when you're making that kind of broad change, that there is some distraction potential in the business. And there's always execution risk connected to that, which is why we've guided the way we've guided. You're right, the businesses we're selling have lower aggregated growth rates than the total company, so we should get a positive mix effect in core on growth. And we will get a positive mix effect when this is all said and done on margin. The issue for all of you, because this -- because of the new rules that don't allow us to do [indiscernible] treatment on these things is that you're going to be comparing -- you won't see that margin development benefit until really 2018 after we've lapped and gotten the full year under our belt because the history will still be in our base P&L next year. But we'll try to demonstrate that to you in the -- as best we can through active engagement. But I think it's a fair challenge for us. And I used the words in the script, that steadily accelerating growth rates. I don't pick my words really carefully. That's how you should think about the growth through 2017. And we said steadily increase -- steadily accelerating growth and rapid accretion and strong cash flow -- rapid earnings accretion and strong cash delivery. And that should tell you what we think the story is. We've guided EPS, which is complicated next year because of dilution share count and interest expense. But I also, in the script, said strong double-digit normalized operating income growth and net -- normalized net income growth, which should tell you what's going on in the underlying business. And I think if you went all the way back and rewound the tape to April and said, ""What did Mike say in April?"" I said year 1 accretion high single digits; year 2 accretion, mid-teens to high teens and then strong double-digit accretion year 3 and onward. Well, unfortunately, the years don't correlate to the calendar year, so you'd have to kind of peak that all together. But if you go back and look at that, it looks to me like we're well ahead of what we said we were going to do. So -- but there's so much noise in all of your models because it's so difficult for you to do what normally saying you guys need to do with accuracy given how much we disclose that we're going to have to deal with the fact that -- and Nancy will work hard with you to try to narrow the arrow band around these things. We'll have to deal with the fact that 2017 is probably another year where it isn't quite as precise as it will be once we get to apples-to-apples comparators for you."

We'll -- and let us get through '17 planning, so I can provide a forward-looking view. We'll probably give you that at CAGNY, so you have a little bit more specificity. We also have to get into the reporting segments as we resolved that through the fourth quarter because we're not going to report 16 divisions, obviously. So -- but you should think about that in the context of the strategic ambition I laid out around live, learn, work, play. And there's probably maybe a fifth segment out there, who knows? But we need to work through all that over time. With respect to your question on synergies, the devil is in the details. So for example, we're going to play for synergies everywhere we can get them. So from a -- for the entrepreneurial -- to deliver entrepreneurially a positions businesses, we're going to clearly go after synergies and corporate functions. And we're going to go after synergies where we said procurements, IT, legal. And eventually, as we build out a shared services model on IT transactions, financed transactions, HR transaction, it doesn't matter whether your entrepreneurial or whether you're develop and deliver kind of the model. You're going to leverage that systems. You really don't get a choice. That's not up for discussion. It's not a vote. It's not a democracy when it comes to capturing those synergies. There's certain other synergies there going to be available for certain businesses. So a business like Pure Fishing, which is a great example, where it has a big part of its business in a channel that's specific to it, you're not going to capture synergies there. You may be able to scale Coleman selling with Pure Fishing. But for the Pure Fishing out part of the portfolio that sold through Walmart, that sales synergy is going to be captured. If you're looking at Safety & Security, which is positioned as an entrepreneurial business, the home center portion of Safety & Security is going to be sold by the Home Depot team and the Lowe's steam. You'll get that bit of synergy. And so it's not binary. There's a level of granularity to this that enables you to play for some of those route-to-market synergies and certainly, the corporate-shared services synergies across the entire enterprise. E-commerce is a division, we'll cut across the whole enterprise, irrespective of whether you're an entrepreneurial-led business or part of a development delivery model. So I don't think it's going to limit it. We still believe that -- I gave you some very specific numbers with respect to growth synergies and savings for next year and for this year and we're well on our way to delivering those numbers. And to the degree we can find more, we'll offer those out. But I think -- I'm almost certain there will be more, not necessarily next year perhaps, but not necessarily next year. But as we look forward beyond '17, to '18 and '19, I'm kind of hopeful that there are. And I'm not at all fuzzed by the 2 operating model approach. I think it's actually a positive relative to what we had on the Newell Rubbermaid side. We've learned from that experience that some those businesses would have been better managed as more autonomous businesses with very specific targets that shape the margin development of them."

So that will change the complexion over that period of time, so we'll get the benefit on the organic side from all the things that Mike had alluded to. But I would say this sort of repositioning also strengthens us overall because we're going to be moving some categories out that, frankly, would have been more of a challenge in our minds to develop and grow within that model, and then have an opportunity to bring in some different businesses in our core categories and capabilities that we could leverage and create more. So I think now, nothing in macro sense changed with that. But if you sort of think about the pieces underlying it, the leverage program is enabled and the M&A program is enabled to complement the organic agenda."

They don't have route-to-market synergies or they don't have -- they don't or can't leverage your core operating model. And so we're going to get margin development from that. We're going to get the net proceeds in from that. We'll pay down the debt. It will give us access to M&A faster. But the real story in the M&A is that we have the breadth of products and categories that we want now. The whole theory of the combination is grounded in this opportunity to consolidate the unconsolidated categories. So we compete in large growing unconsolidated categories with leading brands. And so we're going to apply the model for growth to build market share in those anchored categories. But then we're going to complement it with M&A in the core. And the M&A in the core is, by far, the most interesting value-creation path we could take because we will plug brands into existing operating units, and the best example of this is Elmer's. Within 6 months, we had plugged that brand into the Writing & Creative Expression's group and delivered $20-plus million of run rate synergies. Think about the value creation connected to that. So as we get back into bolt-on activity in the core, we will be able to bridge right back to the original glide path. And I actually think ahead of the original glide path. It may not all work out. The timing may not all work out in '17. But it -- once we get into '18 and beyond, we should be really motoring. And hopefully ahead of some -- obviously, the numbers I communicated in that $5.5 billion to $6 billion excluded any disposals, but also excluded any acquisitions. And I think we get right back to the glide path. It's just we live through this transitional window. And I think we might actually get ahead of the glide path that we originally laid out driven by synergies connected to the acquisitions."

And I think part of that's driven by underperformance in the held-for-sale businesses relative to what you expected. And to be fair, some of those businesses underperformed our expectations as well. If you follow the Stanley discussion when they were talking about the deal, they talked about a distribution center transition issue in Tool -- our Tools business that they were aware of, and we disclosed. And so we had -- the held-for-sale business is underperforming slightly. The balance of the business came in pretty much where we thought it was going to be. I debated back with Q2 earnings, given you guys some of these moving parts that I've now disclosed like I didn't think I would be ever talking about our Sprue relationship in the U.K. But I think it's worth talking about. You have a whole series -- and I didn't talk to you about the beverage DC transition because I didn't think it was worth talking about. But I was kind of hoping that maybe we would have gotten 20, 30, 40 basis points more, but that's $12 million in a quarter. So it's not something I spent a lot of time worrying about. But beverages, there are a whole series of onetime things that we just chose to motor right on through that the beverages DC, the Sprue event, continuing to see that the Commercial Products transition all the way through. These are choices that are the right choices for the long haul. But they compromise near-end type of delivery. And we just accepted that risk associated with the guidance. But your rough math is right, but they were just -- they were roughly the same amount of onetime negatives in the business that we're working against that -- against the number you quoted. So all of that was within our line of sight. Maybe we're hoping for a little bit better or less profound impacts there. But it's on the fringes when you think about what else we were worrying about in the quarter. We were worried about disposing $1.5 billion worth of business. We were resetting the entire organization, including the sales force, which is not a small deal to do when you're -- as U.S.-centric as we are. So our focus was on the longer time frame. And in a perfect world, we would have delivered 3.5%, 4%. But in the context of what we were doing, we wanted to see the other stuff through that could have mitigated the risk. And we chose to take a longer than 90-day view on some of those choices. Because you could easily defer the transition on beverages. You could have easily deferred some of the other choices we're making on complexity to flatter the core growth numbers. But we just didn't, in the context of the kind of profound change we're driving, just didn't want to create that complexity in the organization. So we chose to ignore it and let the numbers play the way they were going to play."

So the complexion of our growth in the fourth quarter will change versus what has been driving as up until now.

But Writing is going to go through this transition period, much like Commercial Products at. So I think the right thing to think about on Writing is low single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. That will be an event based kind of transition. And then we're back in gears, we move through Q1. And certainly, Q1 should be strong and then -- particularly after that and Q2 really ramps up to support Back-to-School. So yes, there's some value in the pipeline in China, but we're going to really pull the throttle back as we go through this complexity reduction period in Writing. And in aggregate, that gets you to about 3.5%. And to be clear, the confidence is there in the $0.80. But because we are stepping up A&P so much, we have pressure release valve if in fact that -- if there's any risk on growth connected to what I've just shared with you. So 3.5% is probably the right place to be. And it would be great if we delivered more. But I'd want it to be -- I want to be transparent that we won't press for more in the fourth quarter because we want to get 2017 off to a fast start."

And Marmot is dealing with what everybody else in the apparel is dealing with right now, which is -- I was glad to see it's been a cold, wet and white last week in the Northeast, so that's good. But they're -- everybody is dealing with the same dynamics in apparel, so that's not going to flip on to a positive on us. But you may be right. We -- maybe that we get better momentum in appliances, and we get to a higher number than 3.5%. We think that's the right place to plan it for now given what I shared with you on Baby and Writing."

Part of that is pricing driven in Latin America against transaction ForEx issues, but good momentum.

And they will be empowered to make that choice. They'll be fully resourced with the standalone P&L and will drive the growth agenda for the company, leveraging digital assets that are created by the brand team. The point of connection to the operating divisions will come through pricing strategy and pricing execution. So obviously, you have channel conflict dynamics that can arise with this model, so that's where the point of connectedness needs to happen. It's in what we would call trade marketing or business development where those conversations really need to be very, very clear, such that we don't get into pricing dislocating dynamics between the bricks-and-mortar.com and the bricks-and-mortar or the pure-play.com and the bricks-and-mortar. So that's where the complexity is. I don't believe in shared accountability on things like this. Nothing ever gets done. It's like -- it's begging for resources. We're going to structure this team, which will be fully resourced with cross-functional resources. They'll have their own P&L. They'll have their own budgets. They'll have their own set of targets to deliver. The sales relationships will be connected to the division associated with the dot com work and all of the direct-to-consumer.com work will connect through the P&L. Now of course, we're going to have shadow P&Ls in the division, so the divisions get the benefit of e-commerce as well. And when we report externally, you won't see us reporting an e-commerce division. You'll see us reporting category-based models that likely ladders up to something more strategic than what I'm describing -- than what we've described today. But that's how it'll work.

And so we continue to grow really, really nicely here with particularly, big platforms existing in camping and then baby gear, a rapidly growing Writing instrument business. And we expect to be able to build some big platforms around Yankee beyond, their direct-to-consumer work that they do themselves. We've got a lot of interesting things happening here. And obviously, this is a global opportunity to the organization that we're building. We'll have a -- we'll be a global organization like all of our operating divisions. I won't quote, Steph, the exact investment amount, but it's sizable. The savings that we generate on some of the other work that we're doing will fund the investment necessary to populate that organization. The analytics question is an actually excellent question. And it's really, really important to both us and the retailers that we're doing business with in the space because nobody's quite figured out, whether it's the pure play players or the bricks-and-mortar.com players or, in my experience, the suppliers, folks like us. Nobody's quite figured out how to create moments that matter online that are linked to the underlying consumer moments that matter. So Food Storage the around holidays, Food Storage -- around Food Storage around anytime that there's leftovers, writing instruments at Back-to-School. Interestingly enough, the online channel loses to bricks-and-mortar at Back-to-School in Writing, ironically. And because the online players haven't figured both brick-and-mortar and in dot com and pure-play.com haven't yet -- and manufacturers haven't figured out how to get their fair share of the channel in that moment that matters. And so analytics will be really, really critical to us, sharpening the way we activate our marketing programs in these channels. And there's a lot to be learned here. So this is a big part of that organization. If you look at that team -- when we expose that team to you, I'm sure we will at some point, you'll see a much higher percentage of the overhead structured in this area. And there are some very specific skills and techniques that they are applying to [indiscernible] the insights necessary to make sure we're going the return on the investment. So there's a lot to do here. I don't think anybody's got it right and neither -- both on the retailers side and on the supplier side."

And so if you were talking to Russ Torres, who's the head of the synergy task team that's in the transformation office, he would tell you that we're all over him like a wet rag to get more than $300 million because we obviously don't want that dilution. But it's not prudent at this point to call it and -- because of the scope of what we're driving already. And -- but he's -- you can be confident that he's thinking about it.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the Newell Brands' third quarter earnings call. 
I'm pleased this morning to report a solid set of third quarter results with good progress on many fronts. Third quarter was planned as an income-driven quarter. We delivered results that were well ahead of our plan, enabled by strong cost synergies and Project Renewal savings, initial tax synergies and competitive levels of growth in the context of an intense period of organization and portfolio change. 
Our momentum businesses of Writing, Baby, Food and Appliances continue to deliver strong growth, which was partially offset by expected declines on Outdoor Solutions and Commercial Products. 
Cash flow was quite strong, enabling us to pay down over $230 million of debt or about $1.3 billion since the completion of the Jarden transaction only 26 weeks ago. 
We delivered these results while also completing a comprehensive review of the business, aligning the organization around a new strategic framework called the Growth Game Plan. The New Growth Game Plan establishes a new set of investment priorities, makes sharp portfolio choices, resets and streamlines the organization from a holding company to an operating company consolidating 32 business units to 16 divisions while simultaneously scaling our innovation, design, insight, brand development and e-commerce capabilities across much of our new portfolio with the intention to deliver steady growth acceleration with rapid earnings accretion and strong cash flow generation over the next few years. 
We've driven this new strategy into action in the third quarter, announcing a series of organization and portfolio changes. We've chosen to move decisively and with speed because we have the benefit of lessons learned from the Newell Rubbermaid transformation and confidence in our team's ability to perform while we simultaneously transform. 
Our third quarter and year-to-date results are good evidence that we can deliver while changing. And in that context, this morning, we've raised our 2016 guidance toward the high end of both guidance ranges. 
So with that as preamble, let me quickly review our performance highlights and then I'll pass the baton to Ralph to dive deeper. 
The Q3 headlines are as follows: net sales have more than doubled as a result of the Jarden transaction of $3.95 billion. Core sales grew 3%, led by strong performances in Writing, Baby, Food and Appliances. Reported EPS was $0.38 per diluted share after absorbing the negative impact of about $0.19 of onetime cost associated with the Jarden inventory step-up and about $0.08 of other onetime transaction-related costs. Normalized EPS was $0.78, an increase of over 25% versus prior year. And operating cash flow was over $511 million, an increase of over 50% versus prior year. 
Year-to-date, net sales have more than doubled to $9.13 billion as a result of the Jarden transaction. Core sales have grown 4.2%, and that growth has been broad-based with 7 and 9 segments growing in North American core growth of 5%, Latin American core growth of 8% and Europe, Middle East and Africa core growth of nearly 3%. 
Reported EPS was $0.91 per diluted share after absorbing the negative impact of about $0.78 of onetime cost associated with the Jarden inventory step-up and about $0.20 of onetime transaction-related costs. Normalized EPS was $2.08, up over 28% versus prior year. And operating cash flow was $837 million, an increase of over 190% versus prior year. 
So a good set of outcomes, and we continue to do what we say we're going to do. 
With that, I will now hand the call over to Ralph, and then I'll return to provide perspective on the balance of 2016 and our initial outlook for 2017."

As Mike noted, our Q3 financial results were solid on a -- and on plan across all key metrics: core sales, gross and operating margin and operating cash flow. We're also on track with capturing cost savings through synergies and Project Renewal and on track with our deleveraging plan. 
Third quarter reported net sales were $3.95 billion, a 159% increase versus last year, which was largely attributable to the Jarden transaction. Core sales increased 3%. Recorded gross margin -- reported gross margin was 32.2% compared with 39.1% last year largely due to the Jarden transaction-related inventory step-up charges in the amount of $146 million. This completes the turn of Jarden-required inventory and the related step-up charges. 
Normalized gross margin was 36% compared with 39.5% last year. The decline is due to the negative mix effect from the Jarden acquisition and the deconsolidation of Venezuela, which more than offset positive impacts from synergies, productivity and pricing. 
We reported SG&A expense of $938 million or 23.7% of net sales, 190-basis-point improvement versus last year despite the impacts of higher integration cost. 
Normalized SG&A expense was $817 million or 20.6% of sales, a 360-basis-point improvement. Both reported and normalized improvements were driven by the mixed impact from the Jarden legacy businesses, which have historically carried a lower SG&A spend rate, as well as benefits from Project Renewal savings and transaction-related synergies. 
Reported operating margin was 8.2% of sales compared with 12.2% in the prior year. This decrease was largely attributable to the inventory step-up acquisition-related amortization costs and certain other transaction-related expenses. Normalized operating margin improved 20 basis points to 15.4% of sales when compared to the prior year. 
Interest expense of $125 million rose $107 million year-over-year, reflecting the higher debt balance incurred in the financing of the Jarden and Elmer's transactions. 
Our reported tax rate was 6.8% compared with last year's reported rate of 16.1%, reflecting the effect of discrete items in the quarter. The normalized tax rate was 22.5% compared with 20% in the prior year, driven by tax synergies and discrete items in the quarter, more than offset by the mix effect of the Jarden acquisition. 
Reported EPS was $0.38 compared with $0.50 in the prior year due largely to the acquisition-related charges and expenses as well as increased interest expense and a higher share count. These transaction-related expenses were partially offset by the operating profit contribution from the Jarden and Elmer's acquisitions. 
Normalized EPS, which excludes transaction-related expenses and certain other charges, was $0.78, a 26% increase versus last year. The improvement was primarily driven by sales growth, the contribution from the Jarden and Elmer's acquisitions and savings benefits from both synergies and Project Renewal. These benefits more than offset increased shares outstanding and higher interest expense. 
Turning now to our segment results. Writing net sales increased 14.5%, despite the acceleration of approximately $15 million of net sales from Q3 into Q2 to support Back-to-School merchandising. Writing core sales increased 7.7%, reflecting a strong Back-to-School season behind innovation such as Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens and increased advertising and promotion support. 
Net sales in Home Solutions declined 19.1% due primarily to the divestiture of the Décor business. Core sales, which exclude the Rubbermaid Consumer Storage totes business that is held for sales, declined 0.5%, primarily attributable to the timing impact of the transition of a key distribution center in the beverage business. 
Tools net sales declined 5.7%, driven by continued challenges in Brazil and negative foreign currency, partially offset by growth in Europe. 
Commercial Products net sales declined 3.7%, primarily due to the divestiture of the Rubbermaid medical cart business, the negative impact of foreign currency and softness in the North American distributive trade channel related to ongoing plan complexity reduction activity. Core sales decreased 1.8%. 
Baby grew net sales 11.3% largely due to continued strong sales momentum in North America from Graco and Baby Jogger. Core sales, which excludes the Teutonia business that is held for sale, increased 10.6%. 
Turning now to legacy Jarden segments. I will refer to net and core sales as compared with pro forma results for the same period in 2015. 
Net sales in branded consumables increased 5% and core sales increased 0.6%. Waddington, which is reflected in core sales as of August 1, grew mid-single digits. Yankee Candle grew more modestly as we lapped last year's pipeline sale at Walmart. Core growth was partially offset by weak performance of the Safety & Security business outside the United States. 
Consumer Solutions net sales increased 7.9%. Core sales, which exclude the U.S. Heaters, Humidifiers and Fans business that is held for sale, increased 9.3%, driven by strong results in both North America and Latin America. 
We had good growth in Crock-Pot, Sunbeam and FoodSaver, fueled by innovations such as the new FoodSaver food preservation system, which launched in Q3. 
Outdoor Solutions net sales increased 12.1% largely attributable to the Jostens acquisition. Core sales, which excludes the Winter Sports business that is held for sale, declined 3.2% compared with prior year, with growth in Pure Fishing more than offset by declines in Coleman. 
Net sales in Process Solutions increased 11.4%. Core sales increased 12.4% compared with prior year due to volume growth and commodity-based pricing. 
Let's turn now to Q3 core sales by geography. North America, which represents about 80% of total sales, grew core growth by 3.1% led by strong growth in Baby and Writing. 
In EMEA, core sales grew 2.7%, reflecting continued strong growth in Yankee Candle, partially offset by weakness in Commercial Products. 
Latin America delivered strong core growth sales growth of 15.2%, driven by robust sales in Consumer Solutions and Writing. 
Asia Pacific core sales declined 8.4% due primarily to softness in our Safety & Security business deployed from that region. 
During Q3, we reported $511 million of operating cash flow compared with $340 million in the prior year. The improvement reflects contribution from Jarden, improved operating results across the portfolio and favorable working capital movements. 
We returned $92 million in dividends to shareholders. We also paid down debt by $231 million, which brings our quarter-end gross debt balance down to $12.75 billion. With the benefit of the cash proceeds from the upcoming sale of Tools, we are now projecting that we'll reach our 3x to 3.5x leverage goal ahead of plan. 
In summary, a good quarter with progress on many fronts. At this point, I'll turn the call back to Mike."

As you no doubt know, we've been hard at work laying the groundwork for accelerated performance and value creation. Creation of Newell Brands strengthens our presence in existing geographies and customers and enhances our reach to an extended international footprint and access to new channels of distribution. This new scale gives us the opportunity to make life better for hundreds of millions of consumers every day, where they live, learn, work and play. 
This New Growth Game Plan has at its core this bold ambition and vision, and a new set of investment priorities and portfolio choices that will shape our growth ambitions and resource allocation. Strategy is designed to unlock the unique opportunity that's inherent in the categories of both legacy companies. 
Across the Newell Brands portfolio, we have leading brands that compete in large growing categories that are responsive to activity. These are categories that are unconsolidated and, as a result, have a low cost of growth. These unique conditions create a unique potential for the company prepared to make the investments necessary to capture the market share consolidation opportunity. 
Over the last 5 years, we've invested to build advantaged capabilities in insight, design, innovation, brand marketing, e-commerce and collaborative selling that differentiate us versus our sub-scaled competitive set. We've reshaped the company from a holding company to an operating company, releasing costs that have been reinvested to both build these scaled competitive advantages in our core growth capabilities and to more than double the E&P investment on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid brands. 
This operating model has worked as is evident in the company's performance. Capturing the transformative value-creation opportunity inherent in the Newell Rubbermaid combination with Jarden will be a function of our success applying this model more broadly. The New Growth Game Plan is designed to do just that: apply this proven playbook across a broader set of categories and geographies. And we're moving fast now to drive this new strategy into action. 
We've announced our intention to focus our portfolio on the categories with the greatest potential, divesting about $1.5 billion of business with a definitive agreement now reached to sell our more cyclical Tools business to a strategic buyer at an attractive multiple. 
We will also divest a number of other noncore businesses, including Winter Sports, Rubbermaid Consumer Storage, U.S. Heaters, Humidifiers and Fans, Lehigh Rope and Cordage and a number of smaller brands, including Teutonia, Zoot and Squadra. The work to sell these assets has begun. And we hope to have buyers lined up for these businesses by the end of 2017. 
We've also made a new set of investment priorities, clustering the balance of our businesses against 3 discrete portfolio roles: win bigger, develop for growth and deliver entrepreneurially. These 3 roles will shape resource allocation with win bigger categories benefiting from higher advertising and promotion investment and develop for growth categories receiving a meaningful increase in insight and design investment as we work to strengthen the funnel of future growth ideas. 
Both our win bigger and develop for growth categories will leverage a delivery and development operating model like the one previously deployed on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid businesses. 
Our deliver entrepreneurially businesses will be led and resourced more autonomously with very specific business targets that ladder up to the overall company performance. 
We've also begun the comprehensive reset of the organization that flows from these priorities. We'll consolidate 32 businesses to 16 Global Divisions, with these divisions becoming the key operating nodes of the company. We will scale our U.S. selling organization, creating integrated selling teams at our top 20 retail partners that account for 50% of our U.S. revenue.  We will create global centers of expertise in key HR and finance disciplines and establish new global functions in procurement, IT and legal. We will build 2 new design hubs in Chicago and New York and increase investment in brand research, as we extend the reach of these advantage capabilities to new Jarden brands. We will create a new Global eCommerce Division that will assume accountability for delivering over $1 billion of incremental growth across the enterprise by 2020. We expect to have the U.S. organization reset by the end of the year with the rest of the world to follow sometime in 2017. 
With this scope of change, we're making very good progress on costs with tremendous opportunity still ahead. We've delivered over $100 million in incremental 2016 savings related to Project Renewal through the third quarter. And we are well on our way to deliver between $130 million and $140 million of incremental savings for the full year. The cost synergy teams are now in full flight, with excellent progress on procurement, corporate duplication and corporate functions, and now, the operating divisions. 
The decisive action to reshape the portfolio set new investment priorities and reset the organization where released -- where we'll release the accelerated savings and synergies we've committed to deliver, ensuring earnings development while simultaneously enabling investment for growth. 
Let me now turn to our 2016 outlook and our initial outlook for 2017. This morning, we increased Newell Brands' 2016 full year guidance, raising the bottom of both guidance ranges. We now expect to deliver 2016 full year core sales growth of 3.5% to 4% and full year normalized EPS of $2.85 to $2.90. We're tracking towards the high end of the new core sales guidance range and the midpoint of the new normalized EPS range. 
Our full year 2016 guidance assumes just over $210 million in incremental gross cost savings related to both Project Renewal and cost and tax synergies from the combination with Jarden. And with the benefit of tax synergies and onetime tax benefits in the third quarter, we now expect the full year tax rate to be about 27.5%. 
Our revised guidance assumes the assets held for sale are not divested until January 1, 2017, and that the current share count of just over 486 million shares remains essentially unchanged through the end of 2016. 
This morning, we've also provided our initial outlook for 2017. We expect full year core sales growth of 3% to 4% and normalized earnings per share of $2.85 to $3.05. Our 2017 guidance metrics assumes we complete the divestiture of all assets held for sale on January 1, 2017, resulted -- resulting in normalized earnings per share dilution net of interest expense benefit of about $0.20 per share. 
Our 2017 guidance assumes just over $300 million in incremental gross cost savings related to Project Renewal and the incremental cost and tax synergies related to the combination with Jarden. We will spend some of these benefits back in the business as we extend our growth capabilities to the Jarden businesses and scale our e-commerce division. We expect the 2017 share count to be about 488 million shares and the tax rate to be between 26% and 27%. We expect to deliver strong double-digit normalized operating income and normalized net income in 2017 despite the dilutive impact of divestitures and higher interest expense associated with the Jarden transaction. 
While we do not provide quarterly guidance, I do want to make sure you're taking the following dynamics into consideration as you think about the next 2 quarters. 
First, regarding the fourth quarter of 2016, we've taken the decision to invest significantly more A&P in Q4 than we did in Q3, with investment prioritized against new innovations like the launch of Rubbermaid Brilliance, one of our best-ever food storage line of products that provides a seal that simply will not leak. And on Yankee Candle with a significant new investment in advertising during the holidays. Given our current growth assumptions for the fourth quarter, this increased level of investment to over 6% of revenue on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid brands will likely yield fourth quarter normalized earnings per share of about $0.80, which would represent about a $0.24 increase in normalized earnings per share versus prior year or about a 43% increase. 
To be clear, we have -- if we have earnings upside to the fourth quarter, we would likely take the opportunity to make further investments for growth rather than let the benefits flow to furthering what is already very strong earnings performance. 
With regard to the first quarter of 2017, as we discussed on our second quarter earnings call, we expect normalized earnings per share dilution in the first quarter of 2017 versus 2016. The first quarter is a seasonally low earnings quarter for both legacy Jarden and Newell Rubbermaid. And earnings per share will be burdened by the significantly higher share count and interest expense related to the combination. 
Since our last call, we've announced the sale of our Tools business and plans to divest a number of other businesses. We expect a full year dilution net of interest expense benefit to be about $0.20, with that dilution skewed more to the first half of the year, driven by the phasing of mitigating actions assumed in the net impact. We expect the first quarter impact of dilution net of interest expense benefit to be about $0.06 to $0.07, assuming the transactions are completed by January 1. So I would encourage you to take this into account in your first quarter estimates. 
So in closing, we're moving now with speed and decisiveness to capture the transformative value-creation opportunity inherent in the combination of Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden. Year-to-date, we've grown core sales 4.2% and delivered normalized EPS growth of over 28% despite the potential distraction that a transaction of this size could create. 
We've reset our corporate strategy and launched the New Growth Game Plan with a clear road map that sets new investment priorities, strengthens our portfolios and reshapes the organization. These actions are in full flight, and we expect them to be largely completed before the first anniversary of the combination. 
We're simultaneously making new investments in design, insights and e-commerce. And we'll decisively move resourcing to our highest priority, win bigger and develop for growth categories as part of the 2017 plan. 
Our cost and savings programs are delivering on an -- on our -- on an accelerated timetable. We now expect to deliver over $210 million in combined growth savings in 2016 and have a line of sight to over $300 million in combined incremental gross savings and tax synergies in 2017. 
We have raised guidance for 2016 and have an ambitious plan for 2017 that will deliver strong double-digit normalized operating income and normalized net income growth despite the lost income and retained cost associated with divestitures. 
We're generating a lot of cash through the operations and by the end of 2016 now expect to have paid down about $2 billion of debt since the completion of the Jarden transaction. And with the incremental U.S.-based net proceeds from the divestitures available into early 2017, we should be in a position to accelerate debt repayment further. 
Our principles for capital allocation are clear and firm. We will invest in value-creating CapEx and restructuring. We will generate dividends in our 30% to 35% payout ratio range. We will drive our leverage ratio to the targeted 3 to 3.5x range through both gross debt reduction and EBITDA development. And over time, our cash generative business will create many options to complement our organic agenda with external development of our core categories. 
With the choice to restructure our portfolio and the generation of substantial net proceeds from those divestitures, we can now envision paths to accelerate achievement of our leverage ratio targets while simultaneously pursuing the external development of our anchored categories through bolt-on M&A in the core. 
This is an exciting time to be part of Newell Brands. I want to thank our people for their hard work and unwavering focus on delivery. Execution is an everyday thing, and I'm very proud of our team's determination and drive for results, particularly in the midst of tremendous change. Together, we're building a larger, stronger, fast growing and more profitable company. Our confidence is high because our team has done this kind of work before. We're incredibly well positioned to grow our brands, are energized by the opportunity to create a lot of value for our shareholders and are driven by the prospects of building one of the leading consumer goods companies in the world, a company that helps make life better for hundreds of millions of consumers every day where they live, learn, work and play. That is both the promise and the potential of Newell Brands. 
With that, I'd like to pass the call back to Hannah, who'll open the line for questions."

If we're assuming or you're assuming that all the divestitures close on January 1, but that's probably not actually the way it will play out, unless I'm missing something, how do we possibly model this? We don't really have those pieces. So I mean, is it best to just kind of plug for it to get to the EPS that you're talking about?"

And that assumption would be that it all gets transacted at the beginning of the year. And if that occurred, it's -- it would equate to -- on all the divestitures, it would equate to about $0.20 of dilution. So from that, as the actual time tables unfold as we move through the year, we'll share that with you. You'll see that and we'll adjust accordingly. I'd say also that, which -- and Mike kind of alluded to in his remarks, the slope of the curve of the dilution is something you also have to be mindful of because while the dilution is assumed to be the full year starting on January 1, some of the savings offsets that we're going to be pursuing will take a little bit more time to evolve throughout the year. So the curve is a little bit skewed to the first and second quarters of the year. Mike said $0.06 to $0.07 in the first quarter. That's what you should be factoring in and if the timing of the closing suggests, obviously that we'll get -- we'll give you some guidance on that as it materializes."

Well, we have a couple of opportunities to communicate, at least one opportunity to communicate publicly between now and earnings at the end of January. And we'll take the opportunity to provide clarity at that moment, any incremental clarity that we can provide with those -- as those opportunities present themselves. We could have played it 1 or 2 ways. We chose to play it this way, so that you could start thinking about this. There's probably very few companies that are as complex to model right now as us given the assets going out, given the changes we're making in the business and given some of the unique dynamics underway in some of our categories. Obviously, some businesses that have -- they're performing well. Other businesses are dealing with consequences of things -- of outcomes that happened earlier in the year or external events like weather. And we'll try to help provide as much visibility to all of that as possible without getting stuck in sort of too many inside baseball type of discussions."

And we source and provide one of the most important ingredients that they use in the -- and we use together in the creation of First Alert finished products for Europe out of Asia. And you've got -- if you look at the complexion of our results, you see good growth in North America, good growth in Latin America, good growth in Europe. And then you see a down elevator in Asia. The down elevator in Asia relates largely to this business. And this has been an issue that the Jarden business has been dealing with all year long related to an assumption that was made in 2015 about regulatory shift that would require all households in -- all new households in France and Germany to have carbon monoxide protection and carbon -- and smoke alarms. And that legislation has been not fully enforced in 2016. But there was a lot of growth in 2015 on that business related to the impending change. And so the business -- the Branded Consumables business, the First Alert business has actually had a great year in the U.S. But it's been offset, in many ways, by significant year-over-year down elevators. And if we don't -- the First Alert business for the full year, the impact would have been about $50 million in the full year to core sales. And so this was not -- this is not a surprise. This is a known issue and we've been dealing with it all along. But that's what that comment relates to. It relates to the fact that we're working through this 2015 big bubble positive event in 2016. And by the end of the year, we've lapped all of that noise. And we're back to steady-state, and we can get on with growing our business. If you want to read what Sprue has to say about this, you can read their public comments given that they're a publicly traded company on the AIM Exchange. So that's what that specifically relates to. And we don't typically get into all that level of detail, but I'm happy to if it's helpful to help explain some of the dynamics because to your point earlier, there is a lot going on in the moving parts of the business. And we're -- we've made the choice to move with speed to resolve these issues or to take advantage of opportunities. Our choice to see the complexity reduction work through on Rubbermaid Commercial Products and absorb the core sales hit associated with that is grounded in the believe that, that's the right thing to set up the future. If you look at the operating income margin in Commercial Products in the third quarter, you see a 250-basis-point improvement in margin. Well, guess what, it's connected to some of those choices. And so we're going to see these choices through, irrespective of the consequences to our headline numbers because they're the right thing to do to set up the future and to set up '17. And we'll take the bumps. We'll deal with the potholes and the bumps in the road with you guys and help explain it to you. But we're moving forward in a single-mindedly focused way to set up '17 in the new context of the New Growth Game Plan. And that's why I guided 2, 3 down to the low end of the range. That's why I said a month or so back that Q4 would be in the middle of the range. We're going to take the choices we believe are right for the future of the business and see this through irrespective of potentially having more income-driven quarters like we had in Q3 and like we might have in Q4 versus your expectation of us to get to the high end of our core sales growth ranges. And so a lot of that's happening. There's a lot of moving parts underneath the surface. Again, happy to explain it, but not going to hesitate to move forward and set up the future."

So we don't see major shifts in category growth right now in the markets that we can measure. So for example, in the third quarter, Writing had -- as a category, as a market had a very good growth. We had tremendous growth from a POS standpoint.",927,"Yes, yes. So we don't see major shifts in category growth right now in the markets that we can measure. So for example, in the third quarter, Writing had -- as a category, as a market had a very good growth. We had tremendous growth from a POS standpoint. And if you adjust our 7.6% growth for the $15 million, we end up near double-digit type of growth on a revenue -- on a core sales basis as well. We've increased market share in the U.S. where we can -- we have good measurements by over 100 basis points in the third quarter on our Writing business connected to an excellent story around Back-to-School. And so we've come through that period with the right replenishment orders. And we actually come into our lower seasonality period now on Writing with the opportunity to kind of reset and set up momentum for the future. And so we felt great about that. Baby, obviously, we're consolidating market share. We're growing unbelievably well in baby gear, largely U.S.-driven related to innovation. You know that we launched the 4Ever car seat in 2015. That's now a $100 million item for us within the baby gear business, which is, by far, our biggest innovation ever. And we've now followed that up with the Extend2Fit car seat on Graco, which allows your child to sit rear facing longer, but comfortably because of the extension that we've built into the car seat, which is, as you know, the safest way to ride as a small child. And so these innovations are driving really good growth. And in baby gear, we've consolidated share, again, as best we can measure it. But with over 10% growth and with the kind of POS numbers we see through our transactional database, very good progress. On Yankee Candle, continue to see very good POS momentum. I know there's some syndicated data out there that would suggest there's some challenges in that category. That's just not the way we see it. And while I can't disclose the specific numbers to you because these are retailer -- this is retailer data that we get every week, we have very nice growth going on from a POS perspective on Yankee. The numbers on Yankee were more modest growth in Q3, but that's related to lapping the pipeline on Walmart last year and actually, the subsequent loss distribution at Target that creates an apples-and-oranges comparison in Q3 as well. We're back talking with all of our retailers about extending the presence of the Yankee brand. But Yankee's underlying performance was quite good, great growth in Europe, double-digit growth in Europe. So again, one of these inside baseball underlying dynamics that we had to deal with in Q3, but the good fundamental momentum. Coleman continues to be a challenge. We're not winning share there. We're going to lose share there this year related to distribution. Marmot dealing with the macro issues associated with both apparel and the consequences of last year's warm weather. Appliances, building share. These are, I'd say, evolve the Jarden businesses, the one to kind of highlight is the tremendous momentum on JCS, Jarden Consumer Solutions. It's been a full year of great growth and that's going to -- that should continue into the fourth quarter with a whole series of new appliance launches. So we're, in general, in very good shape. We've get these dynamics like Sprue, which is the distributor issue we talked about in Europe related to First Alert. You've got Yankee having to lap year-ago dynamics and having the consequences of the subsequent loss distribution at Target. You've got complexity reduction choices that we've made on Rubbermaid Commercial Products that we're going to see through because they're the right things for the long term. And you've got the loss distribution on Coleman. So these things -- you've got a mixed picture. Food storage, great growth, great market share growth, over 100 basis points of market share growth in Food Storage related to the early launch of -- early '16 launch of FreshWorks. And now, we're really excited about what happens with Brilliance. So at the beginning of the year, I told you guys that we were -- this was the renaissance year for Rubbermaid. It's really coming to life, obviously, through Food Storage. Beverages, fine growth on POS. But as a result of the pull forward into June related to the distribution transformation -- distribution center transition in July, not as great top line in the quarter, but very good underlying momentum. And we're going to have a really strong Q4. So I think we're exactly where we thought we were going to be. We're going to see these things through. The next business that's on the hit parade from a complexity reduction standpoint is our Writing business. And so we've talked about this all along, about going after 50 SKUs -- 50% of the SKUs and about 50% of the product line. We're in the midst of that. And we're going to drive that all the way home through the first quarter and into -- through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter. This set up next year's Back-to-School with the benefits of margin development becoming available through that window. So we're going to see these things all the way through because they're critical to renewal delivery and Project Renewal savings delivery. And they're the right things to do for the business to give us the affordability in the P&L to drive growth aggressively going forward."

And that should increase the probability of success and increase the size of some of these projects, the incrementality of some of these projects. And so you're right. There is a lead-lag kind of effect on when that work will yield. As you -- if you flip through the web deck that we put out there, you see -- you'll see how we categorize different categories with respect to portfolio roles. And for the businesses that are in the develop for growth category or win bigger, we will be able to shape and sharpen some of the work that's going on there with added resources that will be co-located with those teams. But I don't think the impact of those actions really yields growth in '17. I think that begins to yield growth in '18. In 2017, we want to continue to bring the ideas that are in the funnel to market. And we want to create broader commercial success. An example of that is on Coleman. We've gone back in to a number of customers and we've gotten the distribution that we lost back for 2017. That's a commercial success from my perspective. We're pushing now on Yankee Candle to broaden the wholesale distribution footprint. And I'd love to find a way back into some of the customers where we've lost presence in 2015 as a result of some of the choices we've made. And we're going to go get that done. We're in the fourth quarter on baby gear. In Canada, we will restructure our selling systems. We're a distributed business in Canada. We're going to go to a direct selling business in Canada. We'll take the hit on baby growth rates in Q4 to take the inventory out of the distributor. But then we'll get this big benefit in '17 connected to building out a direct selling capability on baby gear in Canada, which will give us tremendous growth opportunity. So as I've said, whether it's Writing complexity and accepting the fact that our growth rates for the next couple of quarters will contract or whether it's baby transition in Canada from a distributor to a direct selling sales force or whether it's regaining the lost distribution on Coleman or pressing for broader distribution on Yankee in the U.S. markets, these things are as valuable as innovation-led growth. It's just commercial-led growth. And so we're -- '17 will be more commercially and execution-led for the Jarden businesses. And we'll continue the momentum on a balance of innovation and commercial-led growth on the legacy Newell businesses. But as you -- as we talk about these -- our agenda going forward, you're going to hear less Newell Rubbermaid language. You're going to hear less Jarden language. You're going to hear about our brands and about the 16 divisions we've created. And this commitment to really make life better to consumers, hundreds and millions of consumer every day where they live, learn, work and play. And that's a powerful framework for the new company going forward. And that's how we'll map our businesses and that's how we'll begin to talk about our businesses with you."

In the first half of the year, on the -- on that business, we lose money. And then the back half of the year is where the profits come in. So obviously, from an M&A standpoint, all that is equalizing the value. But in terms of the pacing and the dilution, we actually will get hurt a little bit ironically if it went early in the year. And then obviously, towards the end of the year, we'd be picking up the profit. So that's the one that's a little tricky in this."

But I think it would be tough to get it done by the end of the year. I'm sort of hopeful on Tools, although if Tools were to take longer, that's actually a positive. But I think it's best for the Tools business, for the tools team and for us to get the net proceeds in hand, so that we can work on the debt and the leverage ratio more aggressively. Because if we do that, Bill, if we get that -- if we get the proceeds in hand early, pay down the debt more aggressively, we find ourselves in a position having reset the organization to potentially get back into bolt-on M&A in the core complementing our organic agenda. And we think we'll have the capacity to do that, organizational capacity to do that type of thing because of the experience and leadership team and the speed with which we're moving through Q3 and Q4. So I do think Q3 and Q4 are set-up quarters for '17, and we're going to be uncompromising and finishing things we've started or getting the bad cholesterol out of the system in '16, so that we have a clean comparator. But you're right. Certain businesses lose money in certain quarters and make money in others. Skis happens to be a one that -- the perfect scenario on skis is to sell it by the end of the year. But we focused on getting Tools done first. We're in the midst of ramping on skis. And there's a lot of interest. So I'm hopeful we get a good value and we get -- we set these businesses up for success in the context of their new owner. But there are those dynamics, again, inside baseball dynamics of timing and impact on dilution and modeling that we'll do our best to help you with as we get more clarity."

I've got to think that adds at least 100 basis points to kind of your growth algorithm. And so -- and it -- and that's certainly below what kind of core Newell has been growing over the past 3, 4 years or so. Do you still look at next year as a transition year as we take some of the slower-growing businesses out? Or are you just trying to be conservative as we're still in 2016?"

Remember, we're going -- we're going to go through -- we have already redesigned the organization. And we're repopulating the organization in the fourth quarter in the U.S. We'll have touched over 10,000 jobs in the U.S. between Q3 and Q4. Obviously, not -- those people aren't leaving, but they're moving into different roles and different configuration. And we're working as fast as I've ever worked in my career to get the organization reset. That organization will come up to speed and get into a rhythm of working in the first quarter that has a natural sort of startup curve to it. So I do think that the first half of 2017 is a transition half. But I think you're right. I think we'll get through this very, very quickly. And we'll get into a rhythm of working. And because the cultures are more similar than different, we'll -- I think we'll get through that transition period really well. But I do think that you have to accept that when you're making that kind of broad change, that there is some distraction potential in the business. And there's always execution risk connected to that, which is why we've guided the way we've guided. You're right, the businesses we're selling have lower aggregated growth rates than the total company, so we should get a positive mix effect in core on growth. And we will get a positive mix effect when this is all said and done on margin. The issue for all of you, because these -- because of the new rules that don't allow us to do disc ops treatment on these things is that you're going to be comparing -- you won't see that margin development benefit until really 2018 after we've lapped and gotten a full year under our belt because the history will still be in our base P&L next year. But we'll try to demonstrate that to you in the -- as best we can through active engagement. But I think it's a fair challenge for us. And I used the words in the script, that steadily accelerating growth rates. I pick my words really carefully. That's how you should think about the growth through 2017. And we said steadily increase -- steadily accelerating growth and rapid accretion and strong cash flow -- rapid earnings accretion and strong cash delivery. And that should tell you what we think the story is. We've guided EPS, which is complicated next year because of dilution share count and interest expense. But I also, in the script, said strong double-digit normalized operating income growth and net -- normalized net income growth, which should tell you what's going on in the underlying business. And I think if you went all the way back and rewound the tape to April and said, ""What did Mike say in April?"" I said year 1 accretion, high single digits; year 2 accretion, mid-teens to high teens and then strong double-digit accretion year 3 and onward. Well, unfortunately, the years don't correlate to the calendar year, so you'd have to kind of piece that all together. But if you go back and look at that, it looks to me like we're well ahead of what we said we were going to do. So -- but there's so much noise in all of your models because it's so difficult for you to do what Lauren was saying you guys need to do with accuracy given how much we disclose that we're going to have to deal with the fact that -- and Nancy will work hard with you to try to narrow the error band around these things. We'll have to deal with the fact that 2017 is probably another year where it isn't quite as precise as it will be once we get to apples-to-apples comparators for you."

We'll -- and let us get through '17 planning, so I can provide a forward-looking view. We'll probably give you that at CAGNY, so you have a little bit more specificity. We also have to get into the reporting segments as we resolve that through the fourth quarter because we're not going to report 16 divisions, obviously. So -- but you should think about that in the context of the strategic ambition I laid out around live, learn, work, play. And there's probably maybe a fifth segment out there, who knows? But we need to work through all that over time. With respect to your question on synergies, the devil is in the details. So for example, we're going to play for synergies everywhere we can get them. So from a -- for the entrepreneurial -- to deliver entrepreneurially a positions businesses, we're going to clearly go after synergies and corporate functions. And we're going to go after synergies where we said procurements, IT, legal. And eventually, as we build out a shared services model on IT transactions, financed transactions, HR transaction, it doesn't matter whether your entrepreneurial or whether you're a develop-and-deliver kind of model. You're going to leverage that system. So you really don't get a choice. That's not up for discussion. It's not a vote. It's not a democracy when it comes to capturing those synergies. There's certain other synergies that are going to be available for certain businesses. So a business like Pure Fishing, which is a great example, where it has a big part of its business in a channel that's specific to it, you're not going to capture synergies there. You may be able to scale Coleman selling with Pure Fishing. But for the Pure Fishing as part of the portfolio that sold through Walmart, that sales synergy is going to be captured. If you're looking at Safety & Security, which is positioned as an entrepreneurial business, the home center portion of Safety & Security is going to be sold by the Home Depot team and the Lowe's team. You'll get that bit of synergy. And so it's not binary. There's a level of granularity to this that enables you to play for some of those route-to-market synergies and certainly, the corporate-shared services synergies across the entire enterprise. E-commerce is a division, we'll cut across the whole enterprise, irrespective of whether you're an entrepreneurial-led business or part of a development delivery model. So I don't think it's going to limit it. We still believe that -- I gave you some very specific numbers with respect to growth synergies and savings for next year and for this year and we're well on our way to delivering those numbers. And to the degree we can find more, we'll offer those up. But I think -- I'm almost certain there will be more, not necessarily next year. Perhaps, but not necessarily next year. But as we look forward beyond '17, to '18 and '19, I'm kind of hopeful that there are. And I'm not at all fussed by the 2-operating-model approach. I think it's actually a positive relative to what we had on the Newell Rubbermaid side. We've learned from that experience that some those businesses would have been better managed as more autonomous businesses with very specific targets that shape the margin development of them."

So that will change the complexion over that period of time, so we'll get the benefit on the organic side from all the things that Mike had alluded to. But I would say this sort of repositioning also strengthens us overall because we're going to be moving some categories out that, frankly, would have been more of a challenge in our minds to develop and grow within that model, and then have an opportunity to bring in some different businesses in our core categories and capabilities that we could leverage and create more. So I think now, nothing in macro sense changed with that. But if you sort of think about the pieces underlying it, the leverage program is enabled and the M&A program is enabled to complement the organic agenda."

They don't have route-to-market synergies or they don't have -- they don't or can't leverage your core operating model. And so we're going to get margin development from that. We're going to get the net proceeds in from that. We'll pay down the debt. It will give us access to M&A faster. But the real story in the M&A is that we have the breadth of products and categories that we want now. The whole theory of the combination is grounded in this opportunity to consolidate unconsolidated categories. So we compete in large growing unconsolidated categories with leading brands. And so we're going to apply the model for growth to build market share in those anchored categories. But then we're going to complement it with M&A in the core. And the M&A in the core is, by far, the most interesting value-creation path we could take because we will plug brands into existing operating units, and best example of this is Elmer's. Within 6 months, we had plugged that brand into the Writing & Creative Expression's group and delivered $20-plus million of run rate synergies. Think about the value creation connected to that. So as we get back into bolt-on activity in the core, we will be able to bridge right back to the original glide path. And I actually think ahead of the original glide path. It may not all work out. The timing may not all work out in '17. But it -- once we get into '18 and beyond, we should be really motoring. And hopefully ahead of some -- obviously, the numbers I communicated in that $5.5 billion to $6 billion excluded any disposals, but also excluded any acquisitions. And I think we get right back to the glide path. It's just we lived through this transitional window. And I think we might actually get ahead of the glide path that we originally laid out driven by synergies connected to the acquisitions."

So the things that I'm looking at is I'm looking at the net sales numbers relative to what you guys had in your models, and we were off by a bit. And I think part of that's driven by underperformance in the held-for-sale businesses relative to what you expected. And to be fair, some of those businesses underperformed our expectations as well. If you follow the Stanley discussion when they were talking about the deal, they talked about a distribution center transition issue in Tool -- our Tools business that they were aware of, and we disclosed. And so we had -- the held-for-sale business is underperforming slightly. The balance of the business came in pretty much where we thought it was going to be. I debated back with Q2 earnings, given you guys some of these moving parts that I've now disclosed like I didn't think I would be ever talking about our Sprue relationship in the U.K. But I think it's worth talking about. You have a whole series -- and I didn't talk to you about the beverage DC transition because I didn't think it was worth talking about. But I was kind of hoping that maybe we would have gotten 20, 30, 40 basis points more, but that's $12 million in a quarter. So it's not something I'd spend a lot of time worrying about. But beverages, there are a whole series of onetime things that we just chose to motor right on through that the beverages DC, the Sprue event, continuing to see the Commercial Products transition all the way through. These are choices that are the right choices for the long haul. But they compromise near-end type of delivery. And we just accepted that risk associated with the guidance. But your rough math is right, but they were just -- they were roughly the same amount of onetime negatives in the business that we're working against that -- against the number you quoted. So all of that was within our line of sight. Maybe we're hoping for a little bit better or less profound impacts there. But it's on the fringes when you think about what else we were worrying about in the quarter. We were worried about disposing $1.5 billion worth of business. We were resetting the entire organization, including the sales force, which is not a small deal to do when you're as U.S.-centric as we are. So our focus was on the longer time frame. And in a perfect world, we would have delivered 3.5%, 4%. But in the context of what we were doing, we wanted to see the other stuff through that could have mitigated the risk. And we chose to take a longer than 90-day view on some of those choices. Because you could easily have deferred the transition on beverages. You could have easily deferred some of the other choices we're making on complexity to flatter the core growth numbers. But we just didn't, in the context of the kind of profound change we're driving, just didn't want to create that complexity in the organization. So we chose to ignore it and let the numbers play the way they were going to play."

So the rough math sort of suggest a high end, you do 3.5% core sales in 4Q where the low end would be like a sub-2 kind of number. But given the comment you just made like 3.5% probably would've been what you would have liked to have done, but you made some longer-term decisions for the business, which were sensible.

There are things happening in the fourth quarter and I've tried to be transparent about it in some of the answers I gave earlier. We will have softer Baby momentum in the fourth quarter connected to this distributor transition in Canada. We will have slower Writing growth, sort of the low end -- very low end of the range connected to the complexity reduction, a manufacturing transition and a distribution transition in the fourth quarter. And that's all driven by the choices we're making to get the complexity out of that business. This is the right time of year to do it, so that when we come up in Q1 and into Q2 ramping for Back-to-School '17, we're in full flight."

We'll have the Baby transition that will cost us $5 million to $10 million of revenue in the fourth quarter, but set up great growth next year on Baby. We'll have strong performance on Appliances. We'll have -- should have very good Yankee performance in the fourth quarter given that we're spending more. So the complexion of our growth in the fourth quarter will change versus what has been driving us up until now. But again, '16 is a reset year to be able to set up or set-up year to set up this movement forward in '17, and we're going to see all that through.

We'll learn quickly because as you know, we don't want to put money into businesses that aren't going to have that kind of responsiveness. And we haven't done that up until now.

We got all eyes on this stuff because obviously, we'd love to grow without having to make big investments in A&P. But we believe actually that A&P has sort of been an essential part of the algorithm for Newell Rubbermaid, and the categories look very, very similar. So we think that one of the things that the scale and the combination affords us is to be able to put this type of A&P behind some of the higher-priority businesses with the goal of trying to dwarf from a resourcing standpoint our subscale competition.

This is a group of people that will be focused, and it will be a sizable group of people who will be focused on taking the demand created by the brand teams and converting it to purchase in these channels. And their focus is going to be largely brick-and-mortar.com and pure-play.com. We do not envision a huge movement forward on direct-to-consumer, except in the Yankee business and then selected other businesses like Marmot and potentially Coleman and Baby. But the reality is that the vast majority of that growth is going to come from bricks-and-mortar.com and pure-play.com. And so the selling aspects around Amazon as a pure play or Alibaba as a pure play, or walmart.com as a pure play, that will be led by this team. And they'll be working in partnership with the bricks-and-mortar teams to drive conversion of demand to purchase in the channel. It's going to be really, really exciting. The $1 billion of growth, I think, is conservative in terms of what's possible by 2020. But we're ramping that capability now.

So it's sort of a timing-related dynamic, although Baby's got tremendous momentum right now. So maybe you're right. But Writing is going to go through this transition period, much like Commercial Products had. So I think the right thing to think about on Writing is low single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. That will be an event-based kind of transition. And then we're back in gear as we move through Q1. And certainly, Q1 should be strong and then -- particularly after that and Q2 really ramps up to support Back-to-School. So yes, there's some value in pipeline in China, but we're going to really pull the throttle back as we go through this complexity reduction period in Writing. And in aggregate, that gets you to about 3.5%. And to be clear, the confidence is there in the $0.80. But because we are stepping up A&P so much, we have a pressure release valve if in fact that -- if there's any risk on growth connected to what I've just shared with you. So 3.5% is probably the right place to be. And it would be great if we delivered more.

And they will be empowered to make that choice. They'll be fully resourced with a standalone P&L and will drive the growth agenda for the company, leveraging digital assets that are created by the brand team. The point of connection to the operating divisions will come through pricing strategy and pricing execution. So obviously, you have channel conflict dynamics that can arise with this model, so that's where the point of connectedness needs to happen. It's in what we would call trade marketing or business development where those conversations really need to be very, very clear, such that we don't get into pricing dislocating dynamics between the bricks-and-mortar.com and the bricks-and-mortar or the pure-play.com and the bricks-and-mortar. So that's where the complexity is. I don't believe in shared accountability on things like this. Nothing ever gets done. It's like -- it's begging for resources. We're going to structure this team, which will be fully resourced with cross-functional resources. They'll have their own P&L. They'll have their own budgets. They'll have their own set of targets to deliver. The sales relationships will be connected to the division associated with the dot com work and all of the direct-to-consumer.com work will connect through that P&L. Now of course, we're going to have shadow P&Ls in the division, so the divisions get the benefit of e-commerce as well. And when we report externally, you won't see us reporting an e-commerce division. You'll see us reporting category-based models that likely ladders up to something more strategic than what I'm describing -- than what we've described today. But that's how it'll work. And the point of complexity will be around pricing and pricing strategy across all channels."

Usually, a move in confidence as low as it's gone does eventually correlate to behavioral shifts. But we're not seeing that right now. So we don't know how things will evolve, obviously. As the Fed moves on interest rates, which they will inevitably do, that could create further confidence issues, you'll never know, or not. And we'll watch this very, very carefully.

So you can back into what roughly what that will be post disposals and come up with the -- a revenue base that this growth is off of. We can't measure e-comm growth everywhere in the world, but where we have transaction data, POS data, we actually break down all of our retailer trends, bricks-and-mortar and dot com. So we look at every product family in the U.S., for example, by retailer in bricks-and-mortar and then dot com, so we're looking at trends separately since we can get access to their data in that way. Our U.S -- for reference, our U.S. businesses are growing double digit, have nice double-digit growth and I won't quote a specific number in the channel. And this is after a year -- 2 or 3 years of that type of momentum. And so we continue to grow really, really nicely here with particularly, big platforms existing in camping and then baby gear, a rapidly growing Writing instrument business. And we expect to be able to build some big platforms around Yankee beyond, their direct-to-consumer work that they do themselves. So we've got a lot of interesting things happening here. And obviously, this is a global opportunity to the organization that we're building. We'll have a -- we'll be a global organization like all of our operating divisions. I won't quote, Steph, the exact investment amount, but it's sizable. The savings that we generate on some of the other work that we're doing will fund the investment necessary to populate that organization. The analytics question is actually an excellent question. And it's really, really important to both us and the retailers that we're doing business with in this space because nobody's quite figured out, whether it's the pure play players or the bricks-and-mortar.com players or, in my experience, the suppliers, folks like us. Nobody's quite figured out how to create moments that matter online that are linked to the underlying consumer moments that matter. So Food Storage around holidays, Food Storage around -- Food Storage around anytime that there's leftovers, writing instruments at Back-to-School. Interestingly enough, the online channel loses to bricks-and-mortar at Back-to-School in Writing, ironically. And because the online players haven't figured -- in both brick-and-mortar and in dot com and pure-play.com haven't yet -- and manufacturers haven't figured out how to get their fair share of the channel in that moment that matters. And so analytics will be really, really critical to us, sharpening the way we activate our marketing programs in these channels. And there's a lot to be learned here. So this is a big part of that organization. If you look at that team -- when we expose that team to you, I'm sure we will at some point, you'll see a much higher percentage of the overhead structured in this area. And there are some very specific skills and techniques that they are applying to glean the insights necessary to make sure we're going a return on the investment. So there's a lot to do here. I don't think anybody's got it right and neither -- both on the retailer side and on the supplier side."

And roughly, about 2/3 of that is synergies and 1/3 from renewal. We're going to -- kind of moving forward talk about this in a more combined way. Obviously, we're tracking it internally a little bit more discreetly. But I think, more as a combined way, they'll just facilitate overall communication. So think of it as we're right on track on both programs in aggregate $300 million. A little over that is assumed in the guidance."

And we'll abate it over time as we work against some of the savings that we could do to mitigate it.

And you should feel comfortable that, obviously, Ralph and I aren't very accepting of that, but that is what it is. And we think it's a prudent thing to do from a planning perspective. If we were to deliver less dilution, it would require us to deliver more gross synergies or savings from renewal. And so if you were talking to Russ Torres, who's the head of the synergy task team that's in the transformation office, he would tell you that we're all over him like a wet rag to get more than $300 million because we obviously don't want that dilution. But it's not prudent at this point to call it and -- because of the scope of what we're driving already. And -- but he's -- you can be confident that he's thinking about it. He's looking at whether there are other paths that we can mine. And we have some very specific ideas that we could go execute that eventually we will go execute.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the Newell Brands' third quarter earnings call. 
I'm pleased this morning to report a solid set of third quarter results with good progress on many fronts. Third quarter was planned as an income-driven quarter. We delivered results that were well ahead of our plan, enabled by strong cost synergies and Project Renewal savings, initial tax synergies and competitive levels of growth in the context of an intense period of organization and portfolio change. 
Our momentum businesses of Writing, Baby, Food and Appliances continue to deliver strong growth, which was partially offset by expected declines on Outdoor Solutions and Commercial Products. 
Cash flow was quite strong, enabling us to pay down over $230 million of debt or about $1.3 billion since the completion of the Jarden transaction only 26 weeks ago. 
We delivered these results while also completing a comprehensive review of the business, aligning the organization around a new strategic framework called the Growth Game Plan. The New Growth Game Plan establishes a new set of investment priorities, makes sharp portfolio choices, resets and streamlines the organization from a holding company to an operating company consolidating 32 business units to 16 divisions while simultaneously scaling our innovation, design, insight, brand development and e-commerce capabilities across much of our new portfolio with the intention to deliver steady growth acceleration with rapid earnings accretion and strong cash flow generation over the next few years. 
We've driven this new strategy into action in the third quarter, announcing a series of organization and portfolio changes. We've chosen to move decisively and with speed because we have the benefit of lessons learned from the Newell Rubbermaid transformation and confidence in our team's ability to perform while we simultaneously transform. 
Our third quarter and year-to-date results are good evidence that we can deliver while changing. And in that context, this morning, we've raised our 2016 guidance toward the high end of both guidance ranges. 
So with that as preamble, let me quickly review our performance highlights and then I'll pass the baton to Ralph to dive deeper. 
The Q3 headlines are as follows: net sales have more than doubled as a result of the Jarden transaction of $3.95 billion. Core sales grew 3%, led by strong performances in Writing, Baby, Food and Appliances. Reported EPS was $0.38 per diluted share after absorbing the negative impact of about $0.19 of onetime cost associated with the Jarden inventory step-up and about $0.08 of other onetime transaction-related costs. Normalized EPS was $0.78, an increase of over 25% versus prior year. And operating cash flow was over $511 million, an increase of over 50% versus prior year. 
Year-to-date, net sales have more than doubled to $9.13 billion as a result of the Jarden transaction. Core sales have grown 4.2%, and that growth has been broad-based with 7 and 9 segments growing in North American core growth of 5%, Latin American core growth of 8% and Europe, Middle East and Africa core growth of nearly 3%. 
Reported EPS was $0.91 per diluted share after absorbing the negative impact of about $0.78 of onetime cost associated with the Jarden inventory step-up and about $0.20 of onetime transaction-related costs. Normalized EPS was $2.08, up over 28% versus prior year. And operating cash flow was $837 million, an increase of over 190% versus prior year. 
So a good set of outcomes, and we continue to do what we say we're going to do. 
With that, I will now hand the call over to Ralph, and then I'll return to provide perspective on the balance of 2016 and our initial outlook for 2017."

As Mike noted, our Q3 financial results were solid on a -- and on plan across all key metrics: core sales, gross and operating margin and operating cash flow. We're also on track with capturing cost savings through synergies and Project Renewal and on track with our deleveraging plan. 
Third quarter reported net sales were $3.95 billion, a 159% increase versus last year, which was largely attributable to the Jarden transaction. Core sales increased 3%. Recorded gross margin -- reported gross margin was 32.2% compared with 39.1% last year largely due to the Jarden transaction-related inventory step-up charges in the amount of $146 million. This completes the turn of Jarden-required inventory and the related step-up charges. 
Normalized gross margin was 36% compared with 39.5% last year. The decline is due to the negative mix effect from the Jarden acquisition and the deconsolidation of Venezuela, which more than offset positive impacts from synergies, productivity and pricing. 
We reported SG&A expense of $938 million or 23.7% of net sales, 190-basis-point improvement versus last year despite the impacts of higher integration cost. 
Normalized SG&A expense was $817 million or 20.6% of sales, a 360-basis-point improvement. Both reported and normalized improvements were driven by the mixed impact from the Jarden legacy businesses, which have historically carried a lower SG&A spend rate, as well as benefits from Project Renewal savings and transaction-related synergies. 
Reported operating margin was 8.2% of sales compared with 12.2% in the prior year. This decrease was largely attributable to the inventory step-up acquisition-related amortization costs and certain other transaction-related expenses. Normalized operating margin improved 20 basis points to 15.4% of sales when compared to the prior year. 
Interest expense of $125 million rose $107 million year-over-year, reflecting the higher debt balance incurred in the financing of the Jarden and Elmer's transactions. 
Our reported tax rate was 6.8% compared with last year's reported rate of 16.1%, reflecting the effect of discrete items in the quarter. The normalized tax rate was 22.5% compared with 20% in the prior year, driven by tax synergies and discrete items in the quarter, more than offset by the mix effect of the Jarden acquisition. 
Reported EPS was $0.38 compared with $0.50 in the prior year due largely to the acquisition-related charges and expenses as well as increased interest expense and a higher share count. These transaction-related expenses were partially offset by the operating profit contribution from the Jarden and Elmer's acquisitions. 
Normalized EPS, which excludes transaction-related expenses and certain other charges, was $0.78, a 26% increase versus last year. The improvement was primarily driven by sales growth, the contribution from the Jarden and Elmer's acquisitions and savings benefits from both synergies and Project Renewal. These benefits more than offset increased shares outstanding and higher interest expense. 
Turning now to our segment results. Writing net sales increased 14.5%, despite the acceleration of approximately $15 million of net sales from Q3 into Q2 to support Back-to-School merchandising. Writing core sales increased 7.7%, reflecting a strong Back-to-School season behind innovation such as Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens and increased advertising and promotion support. 
Net sales in Home Solutions declined 19.1% due primarily to the divestiture of the Décor business. Core sales, which exclude the Rubbermaid Consumer Storage totes business that is held for sales, declined 0.5%, primarily attributable to the timing impact of the transition of a key distribution center in the beverage business. 
Tools net sales declined 5.7%, driven by continued challenges in Brazil and negative foreign currency, partially offset by growth in Europe. 
Commercial Products net sales declined 3.7%, primarily due to the divestiture of the Rubbermaid medical cart business, the negative impact of foreign currency and softness in the North American distributive trade channel related to ongoing plan complexity reduction activity. Core sales decreased 1.8%. 
Baby grew net sales 11.3% largely due to continued strong sales momentum in North America from Graco and Baby Jogger. Core sales, which excludes the Teutonia business that is held for sale, increased 10.6%. 
Turning now to legacy Jarden segments. I will refer to net and core sales as compared with pro forma results for the same period in 2015. 
Net sales in branded consumables increased 5% and core sales increased 0.6%. Waddington, which is reflected in core sales as of August 1, grew mid-single digits. Yankee Candle grew more modestly as we lapped last year's pipeline sale at Walmart. Core growth was partially offset by weak performance of the Safety & Security business outside the United States. 
Consumer Solutions net sales increased 7.9%. Core sales, which exclude the U.S. Heaters, Humidifiers and Fans business that is held for sale, increased 9.3%, driven by strong results in both North America and Latin America. 
We had good growth in Crock-Pot, Sunbeam and FoodSaver, fueled by innovations such as the new FoodSaver food preservation system, which launched in Q3. 
Outdoor Solutions net sales increased 12.1% largely attributable to the Jostens acquisition. Core sales, which excludes the Winter Sports business that is held for sale, declined 3.2% compared with prior year, with growth in Pure Fishing more than offset by declines in Coleman. 
Net sales in Process Solutions increased 11.4%. Core sales increased 12.4% compared with prior year due to volume growth and commodity-based pricing. 
Let's turn now to Q3 core sales by geography. North America, which represents about 80% of total sales, grew core growth by 3.1% led by strong growth in Baby and Writing. 
In EMEA, core sales grew 2.7%, reflecting continued strong growth in Yankee Candle, partially offset by weakness in Commercial Products. 
Latin America delivered strong core growth sales growth of 15.2%, driven by robust sales in Consumer Solutions and Writing. 
Asia Pacific core sales declined 8.4% due primarily to softness in our Safety & Security business deployed from that region. 
During Q3, we reported $511 million of operating cash flow compared with $340 million in the prior year. The improvement reflects contribution from Jarden, improved operating results across the portfolio and favorable working capital movements. 
We returned $92 million in dividends to shareholders. We also paid down debt by $231 million, which brings our quarter-end gross debt balance down to $12.75 billion. With the benefit of the cash proceeds from the upcoming sale of Tools, we are now projecting that we'll reach our 3x to 3.5x leverage goal ahead of plan. 
In summary, a good quarter with progress on many fronts. At this point, I'll turn the call back to Mike."

As you no doubt know, we've been hard at work laying the groundwork for accelerated performance and value creation.

As you no doubt know, we've been hard at work laying the groundwork for accelerated performance and value creation. Creation of Newell Brands strengthens our presence in existing geographies and customers and enhances our reach to an extended international footprint and access to new channels of distribution. This new scale gives us the opportunity to make life better for hundreds of millions of consumers every day, where they live, learn, work and play. 
This New Growth Game Plan has at its core this bold ambition and vision, and a new set of investment priorities and portfolio choices that will shape our growth ambitions and resource allocation. Strategy is designed to unlock the unique opportunity that's inherent in the categories of both legacy companies. 
Across the Newell Brands portfolio, we have leading brands that compete in large growing categories that are responsive to activity. These are categories that are unconsolidated and, as a result, have a low cost of growth. These unique conditions create a unique potential for the company prepared to make the investments necessary to capture the market share consolidation opportunity. 
Over the last 5 years, we've invested to build advantaged capabilities in insight, design, innovation, brand marketing, e-commerce and collaborative selling that differentiate us versus our sub-scaled competitive set. We've reshaped the company from a holding company to an operating company, releasing costs that have been reinvested to both build these scaled competitive advantages in our core growth capabilities and to more than double the E&P investment on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid brands. 
This operating model has worked as is evident in the company's performance. Capturing the transformative value-creation opportunity inherent in the Newell Rubbermaid combination with Jarden will be a function of our success applying this model more broadly. The New Growth Game Plan is designed to do just that: apply this proven playbook across a broader set of categories and geographies. And we're moving fast now to drive this new strategy into action. 
We've announced our intention to focus our portfolio on the categories with the greatest potential, divesting about $1.5 billion of business with a definitive agreement now reached to sell our more cyclical Tools business to a strategic buyer at an attractive multiple. 
We will also divest a number of other noncore businesses, including Winter Sports, Rubbermaid Consumer Storage, U.S. Heaters, Humidifiers and Fans, Lehigh Rope and Cordage and a number of smaller brands, including Teutonia, Zoot and Squadra. The work to sell these assets has begun. And we hope to have buyers lined up for these businesses by the end of 2017. 
We've also made a new set of investment priorities, clustering the balance of our businesses against 3 discrete portfolio roles: win bigger, develop for growth and deliver entrepreneurially. These 3 roles will shape resource allocation with win bigger categories benefiting from higher advertising and promotion investment and develop for growth categories receiving a meaningful increase in insight and design investment as we work to strengthen the funnel of future growth ideas. 
Both our win bigger and develop for growth categories will leverage a delivery and development operating model like the one previously deployed on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid businesses. 
Our deliver entrepreneurially businesses will be led and resourced more autonomously with very specific business targets that ladder up to the overall company performance. 
We've also begun the comprehensive reset of the organization that flows from these priorities. We'll consolidate 32 businesses to 16 Global Divisions, with these divisions becoming the key operating nodes of the company. We will scale our U.S. selling organization, creating integrated selling teams at our top 20 retail partners that account for 50% of our U.S. revenue.  We will create global centers of expertise in key HR and finance disciplines and establish new global functions in procurement, IT and legal. We will build 2 new design hubs in Chicago and New York and increase investment in brand research, as we extend the reach of these advantage capabilities to new Jarden brands. We will create a new Global eCommerce Division that will assume accountability for delivering over $1 billion of incremental growth across the enterprise by 2020. We expect to have the U.S. organization reset by the end of the year with the rest of the world to follow sometime in 2017. 
With this scope of change, we're making very good progress on costs with tremendous opportunity still ahead. We've delivered over $100 million in incremental 2016 savings related to Project Renewal through the third quarter. And we are well on our way to deliver between $130 million and $140 million of incremental savings for the full year. The cost synergy teams are now in full flight, with excellent progress on procurement, corporate duplication and corporate functions, and now, the operating divisions. 
The decisive action to reshape the portfolio set new investment priorities and reset the organization where released -- where we'll release the accelerated savings and synergies we've committed to deliver, ensuring earnings development while simultaneously enabling investment for growth. 
Let me now turn to our 2016 outlook and our initial outlook for 2017. This morning, we increased Newell Brands' 2016 full year guidance, raising the bottom of both guidance ranges. We now expect to deliver 2016 full year core sales growth of 3.5% to 4% and full year normalized EPS of $2.85 to $2.90. We're tracking towards the high end of the new core sales guidance range and the midpoint of the new normalized EPS range. 
Our full year 2016 guidance assumes just over $210 million in incremental gross cost savings related to both Project Renewal and cost and tax synergies from the combination with Jarden. And with the benefit of tax synergies and onetime tax benefits in the third quarter, we now expect the full year tax rate to be about 27.5%. 
Our revised guidance assumes the assets held for sale are not divested until January 1, 2017, and that the current share count of just over 486 million shares remains essentially unchanged through the end of 2016. 
This morning, we've also provided our initial outlook for 2017. We expect full year core sales growth of 3% to 4% and normalized earnings per share of $2.85 to $3.05. Our 2017 guidance metrics assumes we complete the divestiture of all assets held for sale on January 1, 2017, resulted -- resulting in normalized earnings per share dilution net of interest expense benefit of about $0.20 per share. 
Our 2017 guidance assumes just over $300 million in incremental gross cost savings related to Project Renewal and the incremental cost and tax synergies related to the combination with Jarden. We will spend some of these benefits back in the business as we extend our growth capabilities to the Jarden businesses and scale our e-commerce division. We expect the 2017 share count to be about 488 million shares and the tax rate to be between 26% and 27%. We expect to deliver strong double-digit normalized operating income and normalized net income in 2017 despite the dilutive impact of divestitures and higher interest expense associated with the Jarden transaction. 
While we do not provide quarterly guidance, I do want to make sure you're taking the following dynamics into consideration as you think about the next 2 quarters. 
First, regarding the fourth quarter of 2016, we've taken the decision to invest significantly more A&P in Q4 than we did in Q3, with investment prioritized against new innovations like the launch of Rubbermaid Brilliance, one of our best-ever food storage line of products that provides a seal that simply will not leak. And on Yankee Candle with a significant new investment in advertising during the holidays. Given our current growth assumptions for the fourth quarter, this increased level of investment to over 6% of revenue on the legacy Newell Rubbermaid brands will likely yield fourth quarter normalized earnings per share of about $0.80, which would represent about a $0.24 increase in normalized earnings per share versus prior year or about a 43% increase. 
To be clear, we have -- if we have earnings upside to the fourth quarter, we would likely take the opportunity to make further investments for growth rather than let the benefits flow to furthering what is already very strong earnings performance. 
With regard to the first quarter of 2017, as we discussed on our second quarter earnings call, we expect normalized earnings per share dilution in the first quarter of 2017 versus 2016. The first quarter is a seasonally low earnings quarter for both legacy Jarden and Newell Rubbermaid. And earnings per share will be burdened by the significantly higher share count and interest expense related to the combination. 
Since our last call, we've announced the sale of our Tools business and plans to divest a number of other businesses. We expect a full year dilution net of interest expense benefit to be about $0.20, with that dilution skewed more to the first half of the year, driven by the phasing of mitigating actions assumed in the net impact. We expect the first quarter impact of dilution net of interest expense benefit to be about $0.06 to $0.07, assuming the transactions are completed by January 1. So I would encourage you to take this into account in your first quarter estimates. 
So in closing, we're moving now with speed and decisiveness to capture the transformative value-creation opportunity inherent in the combination of Newell Rubbermaid and Jarden. Year-to-date, we've grown core sales 4.2% and delivered normalized EPS growth of over 28% despite the potential distraction that a transaction of this size could create. 
We've reset our corporate strategy and launched the New Growth Game Plan with a clear road map that sets new investment priorities, strengthens our portfolios and reshapes the organization. These actions are in full flight, and we expect them to be largely completed before the first anniversary of the combination. 
We're simultaneously making new investments in design, insights and e-commerce. And we'll decisively move resourcing to our highest priority, win bigger and develop for growth categories as part of the 2017 plan. 
Our cost and savings programs are delivering on an -- on our -- on an accelerated timetable. We now expect to deliver over $210 million in combined growth savings in 2016 and have a line of sight to over $300 million in combined incremental gross savings and tax synergies in 2017. 
We have raised guidance for 2016 and have an ambitious plan for 2017 that will deliver strong double-digit normalized operating income and normalized net income growth despite the lost income and retained cost associated with divestitures. 
We're generating a lot of cash through the operations and by the end of 2016 now expect to have paid down about $2 billion of debt since the completion of the Jarden transaction. And with the incremental U.S.-based net proceeds from the divestitures available into early 2017, we should be in a position to accelerate debt repayment further. 
Our principles for capital allocation are clear and firm. We will invest in value-creating CapEx and restructuring. We will generate dividends in our 30% to 35% payout ratio range. We will drive our leverage ratio to the targeted 3 to 3.5x range through both gross debt reduction and EBITDA development. And over time, our cash generative business will create many options to complement our organic agenda with external development of our core categories. 
With the choice to restructure our portfolio and the generation of substantial net proceeds from those divestitures, we can now envision paths to accelerate achievement of our leverage ratio targets while simultaneously pursuing the external development of our anchored categories through bolt-on M&A in the core. 
This is an exciting time to be part of Newell Brands. I want to thank our people for their hard work and unwavering focus on delivery. Execution is an everyday thing, and I'm very proud of our team's determination and drive for results, particularly in the midst of tremendous change. Together, we're building a larger, stronger, fast growing and more profitable company. Our confidence is high because our team has done this kind of work before. We're incredibly well positioned to grow our brands, are energized by the opportunity to create a lot of value for our shareholders and are driven by the prospects of building one of the leading consumer goods companies in the world, a company that helps make life better for hundreds of millions of consumers every day where they live, learn, work and play. That is both the promise and the potential of Newell Brands. 
With that, I'd like to pass the call back to Hannah, who'll open the line for questions."

If we're assuming or you're assuming that all the divestitures close on January 1, but that's probably not actually the way it will play out, unless I'm missing something, how do we possibly model this? We don't really have those pieces. So I mean, is it best to just kind of plug for it to get to the EPS that you're talking about?"

And that assumption would be that it all gets transacted at the beginning of the year. And if that occurred, it's -- it would equate to -- on all the divestitures, it would equate to about $0.20 of dilution. So from that, as the actual time tables unfold as we move through the year, we'll share that with you. You'll see that and we'll adjust accordingly. I'd say also that, which -- and Mike kind of alluded to in his remarks, the slope of the curve of the dilution is something you also have to be mindful of because while the dilution is assumed to be the full year starting on January 1, some of the savings offsets that we're going to be pursuing will take a little bit more time to evolve throughout the year. So the curve is a little bit skewed to the first and second quarters of the year. Mike said $0.06 to $0.07 in the first quarter. That's what you should be factoring in and if the timing of the closing suggests, obviously that we'll get -- we'll give you some guidance on that as it materializes."

We could have played it 1 or 2 ways. We chose to play it this way, so that you could start thinking about this. There's probably very few companies that are as complex to model right now as us given the assets going out, given the changes we're making in the business and given some of the unique dynamics underway in some of our categories. Obviously, some businesses that have -- they're performing well. Other businesses are dealing with consequences of things -- of outcomes that happened earlier in the year or external events like weather. And we'll try to help provide as much visibility to all of that as possible without getting stuck in sort of too many inside baseball type of discussions."

There's still going to be exits, the small number, but there's still exits on our divestitures. So any color on both of those pieces would be great."

And we source and provide one of the most important ingredients that they use in the -- and we use together in the creation of First Alert finished products for Europe out of Asia. And you've got -- if you look at the complexion of our results, you see good growth in North America, good growth in Latin America, good growth in Europe. And then you see a down elevator in Asia. The down elevator in Asia relates largely to this business. And this has been an issue that the Jarden business has been dealing with all year long related to an assumption that was made in 2015 about regulatory shift that would require all households in -- all new households in France and Germany to have carbon monoxide protection and carbon -- and smoke alarms. And that legislation has been not fully enforced in 2016. But there was a lot of growth in 2015 on that business related to the impending change. And so the business -- the Branded Consumables business, the First Alert business has actually had a great year in the U.S. But it's been offset, in many ways, by significant year-over-year down elevators. And if we don't -- the First Alert business for the full year, the impact would have been about $50 million in the full year to core sales. And so this was not -- this is not a surprise. This is a known issue and we've been dealing with it all along. But that's what that comment relates to. It relates to the fact that we're working through this 2015 big bubble positive event in 2016. And by the end of the year, we've lapped all of that noise. And we're back to steady-state, and we can get on with growing our business. If you want to read what Sprue has to say about this, you can read their public comments given that they're a publicly traded company on the AIM Exchange. So that's what that specifically relates to. And we don't typically get into all that level of detail, but I'm happy to if it's helpful to help explain some of the dynamics because to your point earlier, there is a lot going on in the moving parts of the business. And we're -- we've made the choice to move with speed to resolve these issues or to take advantage of opportunities. Our choice to see the complexity reduction work through on Rubbermaid Commercial Products and absorb the core sales hit associated with that is grounded in the believe that, that's the right thing to set up the future. If you look at the operating income margin in Commercial Products in the third quarter, you see a 250-basis-point improvement in margin. Well, guess what, it's connected to some of those choices. And so we're going to see these choices through, irrespective of the consequences to our headline numbers because they're the right thing to do to set up the future and to set up '17. And we'll take the bumps. We'll deal with the potholes and the bumps in the road with you guys and help explain it to you. But we're moving forward in a single-mindedly focused way to set up '17 in the new context of the New Growth Game Plan. And that's why I guided 2, 3 down to the low end of the range. That's why I said a month or so back that Q4 would be in the middle of the range. We're going to take the choices we believe are right for the future of the business and see this through irrespective of potentially having more income-driven quarters like we had in Q3 and like we might have in Q4 versus your expectation of us to get to the high end of our core sales growth ranges. And so a lot of that's happening. There's a lot of moving parts underneath the surface. Again, happy to explain it, but not going to hesitate to move forward and set up the future."

So for example, in the third quarter, Writing had -- as a category, as a market had a very good growth. We had tremendous growth from a POS standpoint. And if you adjust our 7.6% growth for the $15 million, we end up near double-digit type of growth on a revenue -- on a core sales basis as well. We've increased market share in the U.S. where we can -- we have good measurements by over 100 basis points in the third quarter on our Writing business connected to an excellent story around Back-to-School. And so we've come through that period with the right replenishment orders. And we actually come into our lower seasonality period now on Writing with the opportunity to kind of reset and set up momentum for the future. And so we felt great about that. Baby, obviously, we're consolidating market share. We're growing unbelievably well in baby gear, largely U.S.-driven related to innovation. You know that we launched the 4Ever car seat in 2015. That's now a $100 million item for us within the baby gear business, which is, by far, our biggest innovation ever. And we've now followed that up with the Extend2Fit car seat on Graco, which allows your child to sit rear facing longer, but comfortably because of the extension that we've built into the car seat, which is, as you know, the safest way to ride as a small child. And so these innovations are driving really good growth. And in baby gear, we've consolidated share, again, as best we can measure it. But with over 10% growth and with the kind of POS numbers we see through our transactional database, very good progress. On Yankee Candle, continue to see very good POS momentum. I know there's some syndicated data out there that would suggest there's some challenges in that category. That's just not the way we see it. And while I can't disclose the specific numbers to you because these are retailer -- this is retailer data that we get every week, we have very nice growth going on from a POS perspective on Yankee. The numbers on Yankee were more modest growth in Q3, but that's related to lapping the pipeline on Walmart last year and actually, the subsequent loss distribution at Target that creates an apples-and-oranges comparison in Q3 as well. We're back talking with all of our retailers about extending the presence of the Yankee brand. But Yankee's underlying performance was quite good, great growth in Europe, double-digit growth in Europe. So again, one of these inside baseball underlying dynamics that we had to deal with in Q3, but the good fundamental momentum. Coleman continues to be a challenge. We're not winning share there. We're going to lose share there this year related to distribution. Marmot dealing with the macro issues associated with both apparel and the consequences of last year's warm weather. Appliances, building share. These are, I'd say, evolve the Jarden businesses, the one to kind of highlight is the tremendous momentum on JCS, Jarden Consumer Solutions. It's been a full year of great growth and that's going to -- that should continue into the fourth quarter with a whole series of new appliance launches. So we're, in general, in very good shape. We've get these dynamics like Sprue, which is the distributor issue we talked about in Europe related to First Alert. You've got Yankee having to lap year-ago dynamics and having the consequences of the subsequent loss distribution at Target. You've got complexity reduction choices that we've made on Rubbermaid Commercial Products that we're going to see through because they're the right things for the long term. And you've got the loss distribution on Coleman. So these things -- you've got a mixed picture. Food storage, great growth, great market share growth, over 100 basis points of market share growth in Food Storage related to the early launch of -- early '16 launch of FreshWorks. And now, we're really excited about what happens with Brilliance. So at the beginning of the year, I told you guys that we were -- this was the renaissance year for Rubbermaid. It's really coming to life, obviously, through Food Storage. Beverages, fine growth on POS. But as a result of the pull forward into June related to the distribution transformation -- distribution center transition in July, not as great top line in the quarter, but very good underlying momentum. And we're going to have a really strong Q4. So I think we're exactly where we thought we were going to be. We're going to see these things through. The next business that's on the hit parade from a complexity reduction standpoint is our Writing business. And so we've talked about this all along, about going after 50 SKUs -- 50% of the SKUs and about 50% of the product line. We're in the midst of that. And we're going to drive that all the way home through the first quarter and into -- through the fourth quarter and into the first quarter. This set up next year's Back-to-School with the benefits of margin development becoming available through that window. So we're going to see these things all the way through because they're critical to renewal delivery and Project Renewal savings delivery. And they're the right things to do for the business to give us the affordability in the P&L to drive growth aggressively going forward."

But I will tell you that I'm really pleased and impressed with the Appliance business, and we've got good things going on there. I do think we -- as we build out these new design hubs that I just described in the prepared remarks, that we can do some things to even make that funnel stronger relating to fit, form and finish the design aspects of the product. So I think there's some things we can do there to strengthen the funnel. But I do think there's some interesting ideas coming through the funnel out of the JCS. I think there's good innovation in a lot of places. But the thing that I would say is that -- innovation is not art. It's science. And the discipline of innovation development is what we built a capability in. And this is where we can bring know-how to some of our Jarden businesses. And that should increase the probability of success and increase the size of some of these projects, the incrementality of some of these projects. And so you're right. There is a lead-lag kind of effect on when that work will yield. As you -- if you flip through the web deck that we put out there, you see -- you'll see how we categorize different categories with respect to portfolio roles. And for the businesses that are in the develop for growth category or win bigger, we will be able to shape and sharpen some of the work that's going on there with added resources that will be co-located with those teams. But I don't think the impact of those actions really yields growth in '17. I think that begins to yield growth in '18. In 2017, we want to continue to bring the ideas that are in the funnel to market. And we want to create broader commercial success. An example of that is on Coleman. We've gone back in to a number of customers and we've gotten the distribution that we lost back for 2017. That's a commercial success from my perspective. We're pushing now on Yankee Candle to broaden the wholesale distribution footprint. And I'd love to find a way back into some of the customers where we've lost presence in 2015 as a result of some of the choices we've made. And we're going to go get that done. We're in the fourth quarter on baby gear. In Canada, we will restructure our selling systems. We're a distributed business in Canada. We're going to go to a direct selling business in Canada. We'll take the hit on baby growth rates in Q4 to take the inventory out of the distributor. But then we'll get this big benefit in '17 connected to building out a direct selling capability on baby gear in Canada, which will give us tremendous growth opportunity. So as I've said, whether it's Writing complexity and accepting the fact that our growth rates for the next couple of quarters will contract or whether it's baby transition in Canada from a distributor to a direct selling sales force or whether it's regaining the lost distribution on Coleman or pressing for broader distribution on Yankee in the U.S. markets, these things are as valuable as innovation-led growth. It's just commercial-led growth. And so we're -- '17 will be more commercially and execution-led for the Jarden businesses. And we'll continue the momentum on a balance of innovation and commercial-led growth on the legacy Newell businesses. But as you -- as we talk about these -- our agenda going forward, you're going to hear less Newell Rubbermaid language. You're going to hear less Jarden language. You're going to hear about our brands and about the 16 divisions we've created. And this commitment to really make life better to consumers, hundreds and millions of consumer every day where they live, learn, work and play. And that's a powerful framework for the new company going forward. And that's how we'll map our businesses and that's how we'll begin to talk about our businesses with you."

Because if we do that, Bill, if we get that -- if we get the proceeds in hand early, pay down the debt more aggressively, we find ourselves in a position having reset the organization to potentially get back into bolt-on M&A in the core complementing our organic agenda. And we think we'll have the capacity to do that, organizational capacity to do that type of thing because of the experience and leadership team and the speed with which we're moving through Q3 and Q4. So I do think Q3 and Q4 are set-up quarters for '17, and we're going to be uncompromising and finishing things we've started or getting the bad cholesterol out of the system in '16, so that we have a clean comparator. But you're right. Certain businesses lose money in certain quarters and make money in others. Skis happens to be a one that -- the perfect scenario on skis is to sell it by the end of the year. But we focused on getting Tools done first. We're in the midst of ramping on skis. And there's a lot of interest. So I'm hopeful we get a good value and we get -- we set these businesses up for success in the context of their new owner. But there are those dynamics, again, inside baseball dynamics of timing and impact on dilution and modeling that we'll do our best to help you with as we get more clarity."

I've got to think that adds at least 100 basis points to kind of your growth algorithm. And so -- and it -- and that's certainly below what kind of core Newell has been growing over the past 3, 4 years or so. Do you still look at next year as a transition year as we take some of the slower-growing businesses out? Or are you just trying to be conservative as we're still in 2016?"

Remember, we're going -- we're going to go through -- we have already redesigned the organization. And we're repopulating the organization in the fourth quarter in the U.S. We'll have touched over 10,000 jobs in the U.S. between Q3 and Q4. Obviously, not -- those people aren't leaving, but they're moving into different roles and different configuration. And we're working as fast as I've ever worked in my career to get the organization reset. That organization will come up to speed and get into a rhythm of working in the first quarter that has a natural sort of startup curve to it. So I do think that the first half of 2017 is a transition half. But I think you're right. I think we'll get through this very, very quickly. And we'll get into a rhythm of working. And because the cultures are more similar than different, we'll -- I think we'll get through that transition period really well. But I do think that you have to accept that when you're making that kind of broad change, that there is some distraction potential in the business. And there's always execution risk connected to that, which is why we've guided the way we've guided. You're right, the businesses we're selling have lower aggregated growth rates than the total company, so we should get a positive mix effect in core on growth. And we will get a positive mix effect when this is all said and done on margin. The issue for all of you, because these -- because of the new rules that don't allow us to do disc ops treatment on these things is that you're going to be comparing -- you won't see that margin development benefit until really 2018 after we've lapped and gotten a full year under our belt because the history will still be in our base P&L next year. But we'll try to demonstrate that to you in the -- as best we can through active engagement. But I think it's a fair challenge for us. And I used the words in the script, that steadily accelerating growth rates. I pick my words really carefully. That's how you should think about the growth through 2017. And we said steadily increase -- steadily accelerating growth and rapid accretion and strong cash flow -- rapid earnings accretion and strong cash delivery. And that should tell you what we think the story is. We've guided EPS, which is complicated next year because of dilution share count and interest expense. But I also, in the script, said strong double-digit normalized operating income growth and net -- normalized net income growth, which should tell you what's going on in the underlying business. And I think if you went all the way back and rewound the tape to April and said, ""What did Mike say in April?"" I said year 1 accretion, high single digits; year 2 accretion, mid-teens to high teens and then strong double-digit accretion year 3 and onward. Well, unfortunately, the years don't correlate to the calendar year, so you'd have to kind of piece that all together. But if you go back and look at that, it looks to me like we're well ahead of what we said we were going to do. So -- but there's so much noise in all of your models because it's so difficult for you to do what Lauren was saying you guys need to do with accuracy given how much we disclose that we're going to have to deal with the fact that -- and Nancy will work hard with you to try to narrow the error band around these things. We'll have to deal with the fact that 2017 is probably another year where it isn't quite as precise as it will be once we get to apples-to-apples comparators for you."

We'll -- and let us get through '17 planning, so I can provide a forward-looking view. We'll probably give you that at CAGNY, so you have a little bit more specificity. We also have to get into the reporting segments as we resolve that through the fourth quarter because we're not going to report 16 divisions, obviously. So -- but you should think about that in the context of the strategic ambition I laid out around live, learn, work, play. And there's probably maybe a fifth segment out there, who knows? But we need to work through all that over time. With respect to your question on synergies, the devil is in the details. So for example, we're going to play for synergies everywhere we can get them. So from a -- for the entrepreneurial -- to deliver entrepreneurially a positions businesses, we're going to clearly go after synergies and corporate functions. And we're going to go after synergies where we said procurements, IT, legal. And eventually, as we build out a shared services model on IT transactions, financed transactions, HR transaction, it doesn't matter whether your entrepreneurial or whether you're a develop-and-deliver kind of model. You're going to leverage that system. So you really don't get a choice. That's not up for discussion. It's not a vote. It's not a democracy when it comes to capturing those synergies. There's certain other synergies that are going to be available for certain businesses. So a business like Pure Fishing, which is a great example, where it has a big part of its business in a channel that's specific to it, you're not going to capture synergies there. You may be able to scale Coleman selling with Pure Fishing. But for the Pure Fishing as part of the portfolio that sold through Walmart, that sales synergy is going to be captured. If you're looking at Safety & Security, which is positioned as an entrepreneurial business, the home center portion of Safety & Security is going to be sold by the Home Depot team and the Lowe's team. You'll get that bit of synergy. And so it's not binary. There's a level of granularity to this that enables you to play for some of those route-to-market synergies and certainly, the corporate-shared services synergies across the entire enterprise. E-commerce is a division, we'll cut across the whole enterprise, irrespective of whether you're an entrepreneurial-led business or part of a development delivery model. So I don't think it's going to limit it. We still believe that -- I gave you some very specific numbers with respect to growth synergies and savings for next year and for this year and we're well on our way to delivering those numbers. And to the degree we can find more, we'll offer those up. But I think -- I'm almost certain there will be more, not necessarily next year. Perhaps, but not necessarily next year. But as we look forward beyond '17, to '18 and '19, I'm kind of hopeful that there are. And I'm not at all fussed by the 2-operating-model approach. I think it's actually a positive relative to what we had on the Newell Rubbermaid side. We've learned from that experience that some those businesses would have been better managed as more autonomous businesses with very specific targets that shape the margin development of them."

So that will change the complexion over that period of time, so we'll get the benefit on the organic side from all the things that Mike had alluded to. But I would say this sort of repositioning also strengthens us overall because we're going to be moving some categories out that, frankly, would have been more of a challenge in our minds to develop and grow within that model, and then have an opportunity to bring in some different businesses in our core categories and capabilities that we could leverage and create more. So I think now, nothing in macro sense changed with that.

They don't have route-to-market synergies or they don't have -- they don't or can't leverage your core operating model. And so we're going to get margin development from that. We're going to get the net proceeds in from that. We'll pay down the debt. It will give us access to M&A faster. But the real story in the M&A is that we have the breadth of products and categories that we want now. The whole theory of the combination is grounded in this opportunity to consolidate unconsolidated categories. So we compete in large growing unconsolidated categories with leading brands. And so we're going to apply the model for growth to build market share in those anchored categories. But then we're going to complement it with M&A in the core. And the M&A in the core is, by far, the most interesting value-creation path we could take because we will plug brands into existing operating units, and best example of this is Elmer's. Within 6 months, we had plugged that brand into the Writing & Creative Expression's group and delivered $20-plus million of run rate synergies. Think about the value creation connected to that. So as we get back into bolt-on activity in the core, we will be able to bridge right back to the original glide path. And I actually think ahead of the original glide path. It may not all work out. The timing may not all work out in '17. But it -- once we get into '18 and beyond, we should be really motoring. And hopefully ahead of some -- obviously, the numbers I communicated in that $5.5 billion to $6 billion excluded any disposals, but also excluded any acquisitions. And I think we get right back to the glide path. It's just we lived through this transitional window. And I think we might actually get ahead of the glide path that we originally laid out driven by synergies connected to the acquisitions."

So the things that I'm looking at is I'm looking at the net sales numbers relative to what you guys had in your models, and we were off by a bit. And I think part of that's driven by underperformance in the held-for-sale businesses relative to what you expected. And to be fair, some of those businesses underperformed our expectations as well. If you follow the Stanley discussion when they were talking about the deal, they talked about a distribution center transition issue in Tool -- our Tools business that they were aware of, and we disclosed. And so we had -- the held-for-sale business is underperforming slightly. The balance of the business came in pretty much where we thought it was going to be. I debated back with Q2 earnings, given you guys some of these moving parts that I've now disclosed like I didn't think I would be ever talking about our Sprue relationship in the U.K. But I think it's worth talking about. You have a whole series -- and I didn't talk to you about the beverage DC transition because I didn't think it was worth talking about. But I was kind of hoping that maybe we would have gotten 20, 30, 40 basis points more, but that's $12 million in a quarter. So it's not something I'd spend a lot of time worrying about. But beverages, there are a whole series of onetime things that we just chose to motor right on through that the beverages DC, the Sprue event, continuing to see the Commercial Products transition all the way through. These are choices that are the right choices for the long haul. But they compromise near-end type of delivery. And we just accepted that risk associated with the guidance. But your rough math is right, but they were just -- they were roughly the same amount of onetime negatives in the business that we're working against that -- against the number you quoted. So all of that was within our line of sight. Maybe we're hoping for a little bit better or less profound impacts there. But it's on the fringes when you think about what else we were worrying about in the quarter. We were worried about disposing $1.5 billion worth of business. We were resetting the entire organization, including the sales force, which is not a small deal to do when you're as U.S.-centric as we are. So our focus was on the longer time frame. And in a perfect world, we would have delivered 3.5%, 4%. But in the context of what we were doing, we wanted to see the other stuff through that could have mitigated the risk. And we chose to take a longer than 90-day view on some of those choices. Because you could easily have deferred the transition on beverages. You could have easily deferred some of the other choices we're making on complexity to flatter the core growth numbers. But we just didn't, in the context of the kind of profound change we're driving, just didn't want to create that complexity in the organization. So we chose to ignore it and let the numbers play the way they were going to play."

We've gotten new advertising that the team has worked on together. And we're going to try to stimulate more demand around the customization promise that Yankee can make through broad-based television advertising as we come through the holidays. Because of Yankee's retail footprint, we'll be able to measure that really quickly. So I'm actually excited to be able to see -- pull a lever and get a response that is tangible, hopefully. We'll learn quickly because as you know, we don't want to put money into businesses that aren't going to have that kind of responsiveness. And we haven't done that up until now. We've been quite commercial through Q2 and Q3 on Jarden investment. But the money is now being shifted over to Yankee as part of our portfolio and prioritization work. And we should learn very, very quickly fourth quarter into Q1 as to whether that worked or didn't work. And we're kind of hopeful that it will. So time will tell. It's right around the corner. We got all eyes on this stuff because obviously, we'd love to grow without having to make big investments in A&P. But we believe actually that A&P has sort of been an essential part of the algorithm for Newell Rubbermaid, and the categories look very, very similar. So we think that one of the things that the scale and the combination affords us is to be able to put this type of A&P behind some of the higher-priority businesses with the goal of trying to dwarf from a resourcing standpoint our subscale competition. And we'll learn in the fourth quarter. It's right around the corner."

This is a commercial organization, so this is a selling and demand conversion organization.

This is a group of people that will be focused, and it will be a sizable group of people who will be focused on taking the demand created by the brand teams and converting it to purchase in these channels. And their focus is going to be largely brick-and-mortar.com and pure-play.com. We do not envision a huge movement forward on direct-to-consumer, except in the Yankee business and then selected other businesses like Marmot and potentially Coleman and Baby. But the reality is that the vast majority of that growth is going to come from bricks-and-mortar.com and pure-play.com. And so the selling aspects around Amazon as a pure play or Alibaba as a pure play, or walmart.com as a pure play, that will be led by this team. And they'll be working in partnership with the bricks-and-mortar teams to drive conversion of demand to purchase in the channel. It's going to be really, really exciting. The $1 billion of growth, I think, is conservative in terms of what's possible by 2020. But we're ramping that capability now.

So first of all, Baby's real, that'll be a material's downshift because we have to take the inventory back in Canada and then we can turn around and sell it back in, but that won't happen until Q1. So it's sort of a timing-related dynamic, although Baby's got tremendous momentum right now. So maybe you're right. But Writing is going to go through this transition period, much like Commercial Products had. So I think the right thing to think about on Writing is low single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. That will be an event-based kind of transition. And then we're back in gear as we move through Q1. And certainly, Q1 should be strong and then -- particularly after that and Q2 really ramps up to support Back-to-School. So yes, there's some value in pipeline in China, but we're going to really pull the throttle back as we go through this complexity reduction period in Writing. And in aggregate, that gets you to about 3.5%. And to be clear, the confidence is there in the $0.80. But because we are stepping up A&P so much, we have a pressure release valve if in fact that -- if there's any risk on growth connected to what I've just shared with you. So 3.5% is probably the right place to be. And it would be great if we delivered more.

As the Fed moves on interest rates, which they will inevitably do, that could create further confidence issues, you'll never know, or not. And we'll watch this very, very carefully.

So you can back into what roughly what that will be post disposals and come up with the -- a revenue base that this growth is off of. We can't measure e-comm growth everywhere in the world, but where we have transaction data, POS data, we actually break down all of our retailer trends, bricks-and-mortar and dot com. So we look at every product family in the U.S., for example, by retailer in bricks-and-mortar and then dot com, so we're looking at trends separately since we can get access to their data in that way. Our U.S -- for reference, our U.S. businesses are growing double digit, have nice double-digit growth and I won't quote a specific number in the channel. And this is after a year -- 2 or 3 years of that type of momentum. And so we continue to grow really, really nicely here with particularly, big platforms existing in camping and then baby gear, a rapidly growing Writing instrument business. And we expect to be able to build some big platforms around Yankee beyond, their direct-to-consumer work that they do themselves. So we've got a lot of interesting things happening here. And obviously, this is a global opportunity to the organization that we're building. We'll have a -- we'll be a global organization like all of our operating divisions. I won't quote, Steph, the exact investment amount, but it's sizable. The savings that we generate on some of the other work that we're doing will fund the investment necessary to populate that organization. The analytics question is actually an excellent question. And it's really, really important to both us and the retailers that we're doing business with in this space because nobody's quite figured out, whether it's the pure play players or the bricks-and-mortar.com players or, in my experience, the suppliers, folks like us. Nobody's quite figured out how to create moments that matter online that are linked to the underlying consumer moments that matter. So Food Storage around holidays, Food Storage around -- Food Storage around anytime that there's leftovers, writing instruments at Back-to-School. Interestingly enough, the online channel loses to bricks-and-mortar at Back-to-School in Writing, ironically. And because the online players haven't figured -- in both brick-and-mortar and in dot com and pure-play.com haven't yet -- and manufacturers haven't figured out how to get their fair share of the channel in that moment that matters. And so analytics will be really, really critical to us, sharpening the way we activate our marketing programs in these channels. And there's a lot to be learned here. So this is a big part of that organization. If you look at that team -- when we expose that team to you, I'm sure we will at some point, you'll see a much higher percentage of the overhead structured in this area. And there are some very specific skills and techniques that they are applying to glean the insights necessary to make sure we're going a return on the investment. So there's a lot to do here. I don't think anybody's got it right and neither -- both on the retailer side and on the supplier side."

Principally, the proceeds that will fall in the U.S. especially, we'll act on that. We'll be a little bit more cautious on timing and how we think about the proceeds that will remain outside the U.S. because frankly, there, we might have the ability to deploy some of that cash towards M&A outside the U.S., which is highly efficient to do that, to spend the monies get permanently reinvested. So priority one is to deleverage in using the proceeds. The majority of the money is -- will be in the U.S., so we'll have that opportunity. But it is something that obviously, we're trying to balance and optimize across the strategic agenda as well and hit the leverage goals."

I'd love to leave with just a message to my team, which is I couldn't be prouder of my team's unwavering commitment to deliver through change. This is a really, really important aspect of what we do. It's the thing that gives us permission to take on risk, is to consistently do what we say we're going to do. I feel like the third quarter was one -- a second pearl on the chain in the combination of Newell Brands. And I'm confident, based on the drive, determination and intensity of focus, that we're going to weave together a really exciting story over the next couple of years. Thanks, again, for all your support. To anybody that's still on the phone, thanks for all the questions. Look forward to connecting to you at our next opportunity."
