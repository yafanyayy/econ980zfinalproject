The fourth quarter was a strong finish to another great year for Red Hat and our momentum and outlook are strong as we begin the new fiscal year. Our results reflect the fac",1334,"Thank you, Tom, and let me add my welcome to everyone joining us on today's call. The fourth quarter was a strong finish to another great year for Red Hat and our momentum and outlook are strong as we begin the new fiscal year. Our results reflect the fact that enterprises are increasingly adopting hybrid cloud infrastructures and open source technology. And they are turning to Red Hat as the strategic partners they do so. 
We exceeded guidance across all our financial metrics in the fourth quarter in addition to setting new records in milestones for the year. Here are a few highlights.
First, the fourth quarter marked our 56th consecutive quarter of revenue growth, which contributed to Red Hat's first year of crossing the $2 billion in total revenue milestone. Second, we drove accelerated full year revenue growth in both the infrastructure related technologies at 18% constant-currency growth compared to 13% in the prior year and the application development in emerging technologies at 46% constant currency, up from 43% last year. Third, strong sales execution led to record total backlog of over $2.1 billion at the end of the year. And fourth, we delivered full year revenue growth of 21% in constant currency, non-GAAP operating income growth of 16% and operating cash flow growth of 15%. 
Looking at our large deal wins for the quarter, we saw strength as it related to the volume of large deals, the size of the deals as well as the breadth of technologies that were purchased. Here are some of the highlights of our top 30 largest deals. All of them are greater than $1 million. In fact, we closed 3 times that many delivering more than 90 deals in excess of $1 million in Q4. We also had a record 14 deals in Q4 that were in excess of $5 million. Of these deals, we closed 15 in excess of $10 million, which is a record number of deals over $10 million for any quarter. 
Cross-selling was strong with 80% of the deals, including one or more components from our group of application development and emerging technologies offerings. Middleware in particular had strong traction in our largest deals with 75%, including a middleware component. This type of traction demonstrates our continued share gain in the middleware space. 
Our emerging cloud technologies also gained traction in our top deals, including a multimillion dollar win for OpenStack that we expect will be one of the largest installs of OpenStack once it's fully implemented. 
The top vertical for the quarter was telecommunications where we closed a number of deals with several global telecommunications providers. The next highest vertical on the top deals was financial services. 
In addition to our success on-premise, we continue to be very active with our partners in the certified cloud and service provider program or CCSP. We've added more partners in FY '16 and now have approximately 150 certified partners around the globe. In Q4, we further expanded our technology offerings that can be consumed in the cloud. For instance, RHEL on demand is activated on Azure in February. OpenShift, our past solution and our storage technology will be added to the Google Cloud and RHEL OpenStack platform is now available at Rackspace as a managed service. In fact, we already have our first reference customer using this service, TV Bank. 
The CCSP program has generated over $100 million this fiscal year and grew approximately 90% year-over-year. During meetings, Frank and I hosted over the quarter, investors have asked whether the public cloud is a positive driver for Red Hat. We firmly believe that it will be a hybrid cloud world where applications will run across all 4 footprints, physical, virtual, public cloud and private cloud. Furthermore, we are providing technologies that enable choice and consistencies across all 4 environments and we enhanced this value with application development technologies storage and management. The public cloud specifically activate channel for us and it is part of the value we bring to customers. Beyond expansion of our relationship with cloud providers and high-growth revenue results, let me share with you some customer data from our largest public cloud partner. 
First is a channel partner. This public cloud has been a great resource for us to reach new customers, including small and medium-sized businesses. We see approximately half the revenue from this public cloud comes from usage totaling less than $5,000 per customer in the quarter. This group most likely include small and medium-sized businesses, test and development environments, business divisions and start up companies. Second, the public cloud enables our existing customers, additional choice on where to run their workloads. The other approximately half of the revenue with this cloud vendor comes from existing customers. We match this data with the on-premise purchasing patterns of subscriptions for these existing customers. What we found was that this group of customers has continued to expand their on-premise subscription purchases while they are also rapidly utilizing the public cloud environment for additional RHEL workload. This reinforces our view that it will be a hybrid cloud world and that Red Hat can continue to expand our wallet share as we provide choice and consistency to customers across all 4 footprints. 
As I noted previously, we achieved higher rates of revenue growth across our infrastructure, application development and emerging technologies during fiscal '16 which represents strong sales growth across all 4 footprints. Within the application development and emerging technologies, our fast-growing OpenStack private cloud, OpenShift PaaS and CloudForms' cloud management product line. We've made significant progress this past year, expanding our position in this part of the hybrid cloud environment and driving faster adoption. Here are some highlights. 
We closed a number of large production deployments and hundreds of initial deployments along with hundreds of proof of concepts. Our sales traction has led to lighthouse customer wins with Cox Enterprises, Union Bank and FICO, just to name a few from FY '16. We doubled the number of Red Hat OpenStack certified professionals worldwide over the past year and we have trained over 10,000 customers on OpenStack in calendar 2015 alone. Companies wanting to bring Red Hat OpenStack to their IT environments can look to a growing pool of qualified professionals to make it happen. Our combination of training certification in Professional Services is speeding adoption at this technology. We're excited about our accomplishments today. 
Our revenue from private infrastructures as a service, PaaS and cloud management technologies is growing at nearly twice as fast as our public cloud revenue did when it was at the same size. We believe FY '17 will be another year of significant revenue growth with new customer adoption and further expansion with existing ones. 
In summary, customers are demanding technologies that modernize the development, deployment and life cycle management of applications across hybrid cloud environments. Many are relying on Red Hat to provide both the infrastructure and application development platforms to run their enterprise applications consistently and reliably across physical, virtual, private and public cloud environments. This has positioned Red Hat for solid growth in fiscal '17 that Frank will detail in a moment. We continue to focus on capturing market share in each of the new high-growth market areas in which we compete. To achieve this goal, our plan is to continue to invest for the long-term growth of our open hybrid cloud technologies with enterprises and service provider customers. 
Before turning the call over to Frank, I want to congratulate and thank our 8800 Red Hat Associates around the globe for their efforts to achieve the $2 billion revenue milestone and position us for further growth next year and beyond. On a final note, I hope many of you will be able to join us for the June 30 Analyst Day at the Red Hat Summit in San Francisco. It will be a great opportunity to learn more about our strategic direction and innovative technologies. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Frank."
33679,327061533,955131,"Red Hat, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 22, 2016",2016-03-22,"Earnings Calls","Red Hat, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. We executed well on the fourth quarter and throughout FY '16. We effectively managed our investment in expanding our open hybrid cloud opportunities with strong execution while delivering profitable growth. We exceeded our guidance, which",2185,"Thank you, Jim. We executed well on the fourth quarter and throughout FY '16. We effectively managed our investment in expanding our open hybrid cloud opportunities with strong execution while delivering profitable growth. We exceeded our guidance, which led to double-digit growth in revenue, non-GAAP operating income, operating cash flow and total backlog for the fiscal year. The fourth quarter also marked our fifth consecutive quarter of 20% plus total revenue growth on a constant currency basis. We are proud to be one of the very few software companies who can deliver this type of growth at over $2 billion in scale and it is a testament to our leadership position, business model and market opportunity. 
Here are some of the Q4 financial highlights. We were pleased to generate total revenue of $544 million, which grew 21% on a year-over-year basis in constant currency or 17% in U.S. dollars. Taking into account the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, total revenue would have been $17 million or 360 basis points higher, using the rates from Q4 of last year. Due to the continued high FX volatility, I will provide both U.S. dollar and constant currency results for the quarter using the rates from Q4 last year where it's appropriate. Our revenue performance for the quarter exceeded the high end of our guidance by approximately $5 million on a U.S. dollar basis. Both subscription and service revenue was stronger than forecasted. All of our major geographies recorded strong growth with the Americas up 19%, EMEA up 24%, Asia-Pacific up 26% on a constant currency basis. The main driver of our total revenue growth was subscription revenue, up $480 million, an increase of 22% constant currency and 18% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. This renewable revenue stream now constitutes 88% of total revenue. 
We continue to drive higher growth across our technology portfolio. The subscription revenue for infrastructure related offerings was $391 million, an increase of 18% in constant currency and 15% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Our subscription revenue for application development related in emerging technologies offerings was $89 million, an increase of 43% in constant currency and 38% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Application development related and emerging technologies revenue was approximately 16% of total revenue, and that's up 250 basis points from the year-ago quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $124 million and grew 13%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 22.9%. And as a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjust for noncash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combination. These non-GAAP operating margin was modestly above our guidance while it included a full quarter of expenses and investments related to the Ansible acquisition. 
As our results have demonstrated and combined with the growth drivers that Jim just discussed, we believe we can further expand our market share gain with additional investments in our hybrid cloud capabilities. In Q4, we were proactive on our fiscal 2017 investments due to the strong momentum of our business. We added approximately 480 associates this quarter, mainly in sales, customer support, consulting and R&D. For the full fiscal year, we have added approximately 1,500 associates for a total of approximately 8,800 associates globally. 
After adjusting for noncash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, transaction costs related to business combinations and noncash interest expense related to the convertible debt discount, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.52 per share. That's $0.05 above the guidance we provided in December. In addition to the higher revenue and disciplined spending, which drove the $0.01 per share of upside, we benefited from a discrete tax benefit of approximately $0.04 per share related to the reauthorization of the R&D tax credit. 
Next, let me discuss our annual backlog that we disclosed with the fourth quarter results. First, total backlog was up 15% year-over-year on February 29 for a record balance in excess of $2.13 billion in U.S. dollars. On a constant currency basis, total backlog growth would have exceeded 16%. We define total backlog at the value of noncancelable subscriptions and service agreements including our total deferred revenue, which is billed, plus the value of noncancelable subscriptions and service agreements to be billed in the future, which are not reflected in our financial statements. 
Here are the component pieces. The portion of a total backlog that has been billed is total deferred, which is $1.72 billion at the end of fiscal 2016 and this was up 16% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, the total deferred revenue would have been up 18%. The portion of total backlog to be billed in the future or our off-balance sheet backlog was in excess of $410 million compared to an excess of $380 million last fiscal year. This was up over 8% year-over-year in U.S. dollars, and on a constant currency basis, the off-balance sheet backlog would have been up more than 10%. It is worth noting that the portion of off-balance sheet backlog to be billed in the next 12 months was in excess of $275 million and this was up approximately $45 million or 20% from fiscal 2015. 
The combination of deferred revenue and off-balance sheet backlog provides us with forward-looking visibility into a significant portion of FY '17 revenue as well as contributing to revenue beyond FY '17. The average contract length in the quarter was 22 months and for the full year, the average deal length return to the historic 21 month duration after being elevated at 22 months in FY '15.
 Deferred revenue is also a component of our billing proxy. Our preferred view of billing is the rolling 4 quarter's billing proxy, which is calculated by adding revenue, plus the change in total deferred on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters. On a rolling 4 quarter basis, the fourth quarter billing proxy was $578 million, that's up 12% year-over-year and on a constant currency basis, this metric would have been up 17% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2 billion and during the quarter, we returned $114 million to shareholders from repurchasing approximately 1.6 million shares of stock. We had approximately $237 million remaining on the current share repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter. For the full year, we returned $263 million to shareholders from repurchasing approximately 3.5 million shares of stock. And over the past 5 years, our repurchase program have reduced our fully diluted share count by over 10 million shares or approximately 6%. 
Operating cash flow of $247 million for the quarter was up 14% year-over-year and a record for any quarter. Strong collections contributed to this result with FX adjusted day sales outstanding at 61 days. This is down from 62 days a year ago quarter. 
Now to briefly recap and summarize the highlights for the full fiscal year. Total revenue grew $2.05 billion, that's up 21% year-over-year in constant currency or up 15% in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue grew $1.8 billion, an increase of 22% in constant currency or 16% in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue for infrastructure related offerings was $1.48 billion, that's up 18% in constant currency and 12% U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue for application development and emerging technologies was $323 million, up 46% in constant currency and 37% in U.S. dollars. For FY '16 application development and emerging technology subscriptions contributed 16% of total revenue, and that's up from 13% last fiscal year. Non-GAAP operating income grew 16%. Full year fiscal '16 non-GAAP operating margin was 30 basis points higher than FY '15 and included the dilutive impact from the Ansible acquisition. Non-GAAP EPS for the full year was $1.91. That's up 19% over the prior year. 
Overall, our priorities to continue to make smart investments, focus on long-term objectives and remain the open source market leader are proving to be effective. We remain highly focused on strong execution across all areas of business. 
I will now review the metrics for business momentum and talk renewals in the quarter. Across all geographies, we saw continued growth in our bookings. This quarter, 64% of bookings came from the Americas, 23% from EMEA, 13% from Asia Pacific versus 63, 25, 12 split in Q4 of last year. The Q4 sales route to market mix was 71% from the channel and 29% from our direct sales force, and that's compared to 68 32 split in Q4 of last year. For the full fiscal year, we surpassed our multiyear annual goal with a 72-28 split. This quarter, we once again renewed all the deals in our top 25 deals metrics. The total subscription value of these top 25 renewals was approximately 120% of the prior value. Our ability to renew and increase our wallet share with large customers demonstrates Red Hat's increasing strategic importance with customers. This fiscal year, we renewed all the deals in the top 25 deals metric per quarter, renewing all of our deals in each quarter will upsell growth between 115% to 120% for this metric. Over the past 5 years, we've had seamless success renewing 498 out of 500 top deals and this is a phenomenal track record. While we want never want to lose a deal, if we do so, we never give up trying to win back the business. This quarter, I am pleased to report that we closed a multimillion dollar win back of 1 of these 2 former top deals from the 500 deals we reported. We won back this deal on RHEL because of our award-winning support and expanded portfolio of technologies. In addition to now running RHEL, this customer's relying on Red Hat to help modernize application development with Red Hat JBoss middleware and to realize the benefits from hybrid cloud computing with our OpenStack technology. Congratulations to the accounting for an exceptional job of positioning Red Hat to win and expanding our footprint with this customer. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and foreign currency. We are forecasting our full year revenue guidance to be $2.380 billion to $2.420 billion. That's up approximately 18% at the high-end of the range. Our non-GAAP operating margin forecasts reflects our increased hiring in sales, R&D, services and support at the end of FY '16 and our plan to continue to invest in business and emerging technologies as well as the full year impact of ongoing operational expenses from the Ansible acquisition. We expect operating income to grow by 14% to 16%, with an operating margin of approximately 23.2%. Our plan includes adding approximately 1,400 net new associates or 16% headcount growth, down from 20% headcount growth in FY '16. We expect full year non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $2.22 to $2.26 per share, assuming a $1 million to $2 million per quarter forecast for a net other income. A lower annual effective tax rate of 27% and approximately 184 million diluted share. At the top end of the guidance, this would be an 18% growth in earnings per share. On a GAAP basis, we estimate annual stock compensation expenses of approximately $180 million and annual amortization expense of approximately $29 million. GAAP fully diluted EPS guidance includes noncash interest expense, which is related to the convertible debt discount of approximately $19 million. Operating cash flow is expected to grow in the range from $800 million to $820 million. This range includes a headwind of approximately $10 million for increased cash taxes as the company continues to drive greater profitability. For those of you who try to model billings metrics, we would expect the same business flow in our renewal subscription model as in the past. We expect both bookings and billings to repeat their historic pattern of being lowest in Q1 and growing --  going forward to the end of the highest level in Q4. 
For Q1 specifically, we offer the following outlook. We expect revenue to be in the range of $558 million to $566 million, which is up 18% in U.S. dollars at the high-end of the range. One should note that FY '16 Q1 revenue had a onetime catch up benefit from the CCSP program that will not repeat in Q1 of this year. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 22% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.50. 
Consistent with prior practices, I will not forecast quarterly cash flow, but please note that it can be variable depending upon individual payments or receipts. 
Overall, we delivered a strong performance in Q4 and throughout FY '16. We continue to believe there is significant opportunity for Red Hat as IT organizations transition their application development and infrastructure to the hybrid cloud environment. We are very well positioned to deliver an attractive combination of revenue growth, profitability, and cash flow for FY '17. We remain optimistic about the company's long-term opportunity as we are uniquely positioned to further drive the adoption of open source technologies and to enable customers to reap the benefits of hybrid cloud computing.

As you can see throughout the last year, we've had the rolling 4 quarter proxy be up about 20% from a constant currency basis and I think that's fairly strong from a -- for a $2 billion company. Coming in at about 17%, it's modestly down from what we saw in the past few quarters, but nothing out of the ordinary. This quarter, we had, as Jim mentioned, we have strong renewals, we had up sales in top deals.

And as you know, I've been with the company for about 3 quarters and I've been out at various conferences. And one of the things that I've noticed as part of the company, which I think is very important, is the emerging technology opportunity. And we're early in that, when you start thinking about OpenStack and OpenShift and some of the other emerging technology products that we have, it's important for us to invest in that business in order to see its scale. We just finished a long-range plan. And as we look at the next several years, there's a tremendous amount of opportunity for us and we want to make sure that we're supporting that. So we've done a lot of analysis in the last several weeks, several months in looking at the investments that we have to make. When you start looking at a PaaS implementation or an Infrastructure-as-a-Service implementation, they're firmly complex and we did some analysis to kind of look at what a typical deal in that space would involve and you it could be as short as 12 months as far as the investment up to about 24 months as we go through an initiation, evaluation phase where we're working with the customer, we then have to go through a pilot project period, which is part of the early development We then go into a larger production environment. That will also take a couple of months. And after that, once you start getting that PaaS or the Infrastructure-as-a-Service in place, we then start looking at adding in JBoss and storage. So this process is fairly complex and can be lengthy, and of course, investments associated with that. So [indiscernible] over the last 2 quarters we've increased our spending to support that. And as we look at FY '17, we're doing the same thing there in at the same time, trying to balance those investments. If you look at the overall guidance that we provided, when you adjust for some of the Ansible and also a couple of other minor adjustments like with the cloud business that we had last year, the margins are about flat and so I think that's a fairly good model to have while we're making some of these important strategic investments."

Ansible I think opens a significant number of opportunities for us. First off, when you start thinking about container management, an idea of microservices where you could have literally hundreds of thousands or millions of microservices, you had to have a way to orchestrate that in an agentless way and some of the leading orchestration tools out there require an agent on every container, which just want scale and a microservices world. So we think as applications move to containerized environment to microservices, it's clearly the best technology. So there's a big opportunity there. I think you rightly notice that it's, not just necessarily compute workloads. How you think about managing network as well. Ansible has been a technology that many of the networking providers are very, very interested in. They're opportunities in IoT. We see it a lot as we do assess with OpenStack. And so it's it into a whole series of areas in the portfolio to obviously early days now, but it has tremendous traction in general in the marketplace of people using the open-source components.

The fourth quarter was a strong finish to another great year for Red Hat and our momentum and outlook are strong as we begin the new fiscal year. Our results reflect the fact that enterprises are increasingly adopting hybrid cloud infrastructures and open source technologies, and they are turning to Red Hat as their strategic partner as they do so. 
We exceeded guidance across all our financial metrics in the fourth quarter in addition to setting new records and milestones for the year. Here are a few highlights.
First, the fourth quarter marked our 56th consecutive quarter of revenue growth, which contributed to Red Hat's first year of crossing the $2 billion in total revenue milestone. Second, we drove accelerated full year revenue growth in both the infrastructure-related technologies at 18% constant currency growth compared to 13% in the prior year and the application development and emerging technologies at 46% constant currency, up from 43% last year. Third, strong sales execution led to record total backlog of over $2.1 billion at the end of the year. And fourth, we delivered full year revenue growth of 21% in constant currency, non-GAAP operating income growth of 16% and operating cash flow growth of 15%. 
Looking at our large deal wins for the quarter, we saw strength as it related to the volume of large deals, the size of the deals as well as the breadth of technologies that were purchased. Here are some of the highlights of our top 30 largest deals. All of them were greater than $1 million. In fact, we closed 3 times that many, delivering more than 90 deals in excess of $1 million in Q4. We also had a record 14 deals in Q4 that were in excess of $5 million. Of these deals, we closed 15 in excess of $10 million, which is a record number of deals over $10 million for any quarter. 
Cross-selling was strong with 80% of the deals, including one or more components from our group of application development and emerging technologies offerings. Middleware in particular had strong traction in our largest deals with 75%, including a middleware component. This type of traction demonstrates our continued share gain in the middleware space. 
Our emerging cloud technologies also gained traction in our top deals, including a multimillion dollar win for OpenStack that we expect will be one of the largest installs of OpenStack once it's fully implemented. 
The top vertical for the quarter was telecommunications, where we closed a number of deals with several global telecommunications providers. The next highest vertical in the top deals was financial services. 
In addition to our success on-premise, we continue to be very active with our partners in the Certified Cloud and Service Provider Program or CCSP. We have added more partners in FY '16 and now have approximately 150 certified partners around the globe. In Q4, we further expanded our technology offerings that can be consumed in the cloud. For instance, RHEL on-demand is activated on Azure in February. OpenShift, our PaaS solution, and our storage technology will be added to the Google cloud. And RHEL OpenStack platform is now available at RackSpace as a managed service. In fact, we already have our first reference customer using this service, TD Bank. 
The CCSP program has generated over $100 million this fiscal year and grew approximately 90% year-over-year. During meetings, Frank and I have hosted over the quarter, investors have asked whether the public cloud is a positive driver for Red Hat. We firmly believe that it will be a hybrid cloud world where applications will run across all 4 footprints, physical, virtual, public cloud and private cloud. Furthermore, we are providing technologies that enable choice and consistencies across all 4 environments and we enhanced this value with application development technologies, storage and management. The public cloud specifically acts as a channel for us and it is part of the value we bring to customers. Beyond expansion of our relationship with cloud providers and high-growth revenue results, let me share with you some customer data from our largest public cloud partner. 
First, as a channel partner, this public cloud has been a great resource for us to reach new customers, including small and medium-sized businesses. We see approximately half the revenue from this public cloud comes from usage totaling less than $5,000 per customer in a quarter. This group most likely includes small and medium-sized businesses, test and development environments, business divisions and start-up companies. Second, the public cloud enables our existing customers additional choice on where to run their workloads. The other approximately half of the revenue with this cloud vendor comes from existing customers. We match this data with the on-premise purchasing patterns of subscriptions for these existing customers. What we found was that this group of customers has continued to expand their on-premise subscription purchases while they are also rapidly utilizing the public cloud environment for additional RHEL workloads. This reinforces our view that it will be a hybrid cloud world and that Red Hat can continue to expand our wallet share as we provide choice and consistency to customers across all 4 footprints. 
As I noted previously, we achieved higher rates of revenue growth across our infrastructure, application development and emerging technologies during fiscal '16 which represents strong sales growth across all 4 footprints. Within the application development and emerging technologies, our fast growing OpenStack private cloud, OpenShift PaaS and CloudForms cloud management product lines. We made significant progress this past year expanding our position in this part of the hybrid cloud environment and driving faster adoption. Here are some highlights. 
We closed a number of large production deployments and hundreds of initial deployments along with hundreds of proof of concepts. Our sales traction has led to lighthouse customer wins with Cox Enterprises, Union Bank and FICO, just to name a few from FY '16. We doubled the number of Red Hat OpenStack certified professionals worldwide over the past year, and we have trained over 10,000 customers on OpenStack in calendar 2015 alone. Companies wanting to bring Red Hat OpenStack to their IT environments can look to a growing pool of qualified professionals to make it happen. Our combination of training, certification and professional services is speeding adoption of this technology. We're excited about our accomplishments to date. 
Our revenue from private Infrastructures-as-a-Service, PaaS and cloud management technologies is growing at nearly twice as fast as our public cloud revenue did when it was at the same size. We believe FY '17 will be another year of significant revenue growth with new customer adoption and further expansion with existing ones. 
In summary, customers are demanding technologies that modernize the development, deployment and life-cycle management of applications across hybrid cloud environments. Many are relying on Red Hat to provide both the infrastructure and application development platforms to run their enterprise applications consistently and reliably across physical, virtual, private and public cloud environments. This has positioned Red Hat for solid growth in fiscal '17 that Frank will detail in a moment. We continue to focus on capturing market share in each of the new high-growth market areas in which we compete. To achieve this goal, our plan is to continue to invest for the long-term growth of our open, hybrid cloud technologies with enterprises and service provider customers. 
Before turning the call over to Frank, I want to congratulate and thank our 8,800 Red Hat associates around the globe for their efforts to achieve the $2 billion revenue milestone and position us for further growth next year and beyond.
On a final note, I hope many of you will be able to join us for the June 30 Analyst Day at the Red Hat Summit in San Francisco. It will be a great opportunity to learn more about our strategic direction and innovative technologies. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Frank."
33679,327061533,955183,"Red Hat, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 22, 2016",2016-03-22,"Earnings Calls","Red Hat, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. We executed well in the fourth quarter and throughout FY '16. We effectively managed our investments in expanding our open, hybrid cloud opportunities with strong execution while delivering profitable growth. We exceeded our guidance, whic",2183,"Thank you, Jim. We executed well in the fourth quarter and throughout FY '16. We effectively managed our investments in expanding our open, hybrid cloud opportunities with strong execution while delivering profitable growth. We exceeded our guidance, which led to double-digit growth in revenue, non-GAAP operating income, operating cash flow and total backlog for the fiscal year. The fourth quarter also marked our fifth consecutive quarter of 20% plus total revenue growth on a constant-currency basis. We are proud to be one of the very few software companies who can deliver this type of growth at over $2 billion in scale, and it is a testament to our leadership position, business model and market opportunity. 
Here are some of the Q4 financial highlights. We were pleased to generate total revenue of $544 million, which grew 21% on a year-over-year basis in constant currency or 17% in U.S. dollars. Taking into account the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, total revenue would have been $17 million or 360 basis points higher using the rates from Q4 of last year. Due to the continued high FX volatility, I will provide both U.S. dollar and constant currency results for the quarter using the rates from Q4 last year where it is appropriate.
Our revenue performance for the quarter exceeded the high end of our guidance by approximately $5 million on a U.S. dollar basis. Both subscription and service revenue was stronger than forecasted. All of our major geographies recorded strong growth with the Americas up 19%, EMEA up 24%, Asia-Pacific up 26% on a constant-currency basis. The main driver of our total revenue growth was subscription revenue, up $480 million, an increase of 22% in constant currency and 18% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. This renewable revenue stream now constitutes 88% of total revenue. 
We continued to drive high growth across our technology portfolio. The subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $391 million, an increase of 18% in constant currency and 15% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Our subscription revenue for application development related and emerging technologies offerings was $89 million, an increase of 43% in constant currency and 38% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Application development related and emerging technologies revenue was approximately 16% of total revenue and that's up 250 basis points from the year ago quarter.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $124 million and grew 13%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 22.9%. And as a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjusts for noncash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combination. This non-GAAP operating margin was modestly above our guidance, while it included a full quarter of expenses and investments related to the Ansible acquisition. 
As our results have demonstrated and combined with the growth drivers that Jim just discussed, we believe we can further expand our market share gains with additional investments in our hybrid cloud capabilities. In Q4, we were proactive on our fiscal 2017 investments due to the strong momentum of our business. We added approximately 480 associates this quarter, mainly in sales, customer support, consulting and R&D. For the full fiscal year, we have added approximately 1,500 associates for a total of approximately 8,800 associates globally. 
After adjusting for noncash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, transaction costs related to business combinations, and noncash interest expense related to the convertible debt discount, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.52 per share. That's $0.05 above the guidance we provided in December. In addition to the higher revenue and disciplined spending, which drove the $0.01 per share of upside, we benefited from a discrete tax benefit of approximately $0.04 per share related to the reauthorization of the R&D tax credit. 
Next, let me discuss our annual backlog that we disclosed with the fourth quarter results. First, total backlog was up 15% year-over-year on February 29 for a record balance in excess of $2.13 billion in U.S. dollars. On a constant-currency basis, total backlog growth would have exceeded 16%. We define total backlog at the value of noncancelable subscriptions and service agreements including our total deferred revenue, which is billed plus the value of noncancelable subscriptions and service agreements to be billed in the future, which are not reflected in our financial statements. 
Here are the component pieces. The portion of total backlog that has been billed is total deferred, which is $1.72 billion at the end of fiscal 2016 and this was up 16% year-over-year. On a constant-currency basis, the total deferred revenue would have been up 18%. The portion of total backlog to be billed in the future or our off-balance sheet backlog was in excess of $410 million compared to an excess of $380 million last fiscal year. This was up over 8% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. And on a constant-currency basis, the off-balance sheet backlog would have been up more than 10%. It is worth noting that the portion of off-balance sheet backlog to be billed in the next 12 months was in excess of $275 million and this was up approximately $45 million or 20% from fiscal 2015. 
The combination of deferred revenue and off-balance sheet backlog provides us with forward-looking visibility into a significant portion of FY '17 revenue as well as contributing to revenue beyond FY '17. The average contract length in the quarter was 22 months. And for the full year, the average deal length returned to the historic 21 months duration after being elevated at 22 months in FY '15.
Deferred revenue is also a component of our billing proxy. Our preferred view of billings is the rolling 4 quarters billing proxy, which is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in total deferred on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, the fourth quarter billing proxy was $578 million, that's up 12% year-over-year. And on a constant-currency basis, this metric would have been up 17% year-over-year.
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2 billion. And during the quarter, we returned $114 million to shareholders from repurchasing approximately 1.6 million shares of stock. We had approximately $237 million remaining on the current share repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter. For the full year, we returned $263 million to shareholders from repurchasing approximately 3.5 million shares of stock. And over the past 5 years, our repurchase programs have reduced our fully diluted share count by over 10 million shares or approximately 6%. 
Operating cash flow of $247 million for the quarter was up 14% year-over-year and a record for any quarter. Strong collections contributed to this result with FX-adjusted day sales outstanding at 61 days. This is down from 63 days a year ago quarter. 
Now to briefly recap and summarize the highlights for the full fiscal year. Total revenue grew $2.05 billion, that's up 21% year-over-year in constant currency or up 15% in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue grew $1.8 billion, an increase of 22% in constant currency or 16% in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $1.48 billion, that's up 18% in constant currency and 12% in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue for application development and emerging technologies was $323 million, up 46% in constant currency and 37% in U.S. dollars. For FY '16 application development and emerging technology subscriptions contributed 16% of total revenue and that's up from 13% last fiscal year. Non-GAAP operating income grew 16%. Full year fiscal '16 non-GAAP operating margin was 30 basis points higher than FY '15 and included the dilutive impact from the Ansible acquisition. Non-GAAP EPS for the full year was $1.91, that's up 19% over the prior year. 
Overall, our priorities to continue to make smart investments, focus on long-term objectives and remain the open source market leader are proving to be effective. We remain highly focused on strong execution across all areas of the business. 
I will now review the metrics for business momentum and talk renewals in the quarter. Across all geographies, we saw continued growth in our bookings. This quarter, 64% of bookings came from the Americas, 23% from EMEA, 13% from Asia Pacific versus 63-25-12 split in Q4 of last year. The Q4 sales route to market mix was 71% from the channel and 29% from our direct sales force, and that's compared to 68-32 split in Q4 of last year. For the full fiscal year, we surpassed our multiyear annual goal with a 72-28 split. This quarter, we once again renewed all of the deals in our top 25 deals metric. The total subscription value of these top 25 renewals was approximately 120% of the prior value. Our ability to renew and increase our wallet share with large customers demonstrates Red Hat's increasing strategic importance with customers. This fiscal year, we renewed all of the deals in the top 25 deals metric per quarter, renewing all of our deals in each quarter will upsell growth between 115% to 120% for this metric.
Over the past 5 years, we've had similar success, renewing 498 out of 500 top deals, and this is a phenomenal track record. While we never want to lose a deal, if we do so, we never give up trying to win back the business. This quarter, I am pleased to report that we closed a multimillion dollar win back of 1 of these 2 former top deals from the 500 deals we reported. We won back this deal on RHEL because of our award-winning support and expanded portfolio of technologies. In addition to now running RHEL, this customer is relying on Red Hat to help them modernize their application development with Red Hat JBoss middleware and to realize the benefits from hybrid cloud computing with our OpenStack technology. Congratulations to the account team for an exceptional job of positioning Red Hat to win and expanding our footprint with this customer. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and foreign currency. We are forecasting our full year revenue guidance to be $2.380 billion to $2.420 billion, that's up approximately 18% at the high end of the range. Our non-GAAP operating margin forecast reflects our increased hiring in sales, R&D, services and support at the end of FY '16 and our plan to continue to invest in business and emerging technologies as well as the full year impact of ongoing operational expenses from the Ansible acquisition.
We expect operating income to grow by 14% to 16%, with an operating margin of approximately 23.2%. Our plan includes adding approximately 1,400 net new associates or 16% headcount growth, down from 20% headcount growth in FY '16. We expect full year non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $2.22 to $2.26 per share, assuming a $1 million to $2 million per quarter forecast for a net other income, a lower annual effective tax rate of 27% and approximately 184 million diluted share. At the top end of the guidance, this would be an 18% growth in earnings per share.
On a GAAP basis, we estimate annual stock compensation expenses of approximately $180 million and annual amortization expense of approximately $29 million. GAAP fully-diluted EPS guidance includes noncash interest expense, which is related to the convertible debt discount, of approximately $19 million. Operating cash flow is expected to grow in the range from $800 million to $820 million. This range includes a headwind of approximately $10 million for increased cash taxes as the company continues to drive greater profitability. For those of you who try to model billings metrics, we would expect the same business flow in our renewal subscription model as in the past. We expect both bookings and billings to repeat their historic pattern of being lowest in Q1 and growing -- going forward to the end of the highest level in Q4. 
For Q1 specifically, we offer the following outlook. We expect revenue to be in the range of $558 million to $566 million, which is up 18% in U.S. dollars at the high end of the range. One should note that FY '16 Q1 revenue had a onetime catch up benefit from the CCSP program that will not repeat in Q1 of this year. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 22% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.50. 
Consistent with prior practices, I will not forecast quarterly cash flow, but please note that it can be variable depending upon individual payments or receipts. 
Overall, we delivered a strong performance in Q4 and throughout FY '16. We continue to believe there is significant opportunity for Red Hat as IT organizations transition their application development and infrastructure to the hybrid cloud environment. We are very well positioned to deliver an attractive combination of revenue growth, profitability and cash flow for FY '17. We remain optimistic about the company's long-term opportunity as we are uniquely positioned to further drive the adoption of open source technologies and to enable customers to reap the benefits of hybrid cloud computing.

Coming in at about 17%, it's modestly down from what we saw in the past few quarters, but nothing out of the ordinary.

And as you know, I've been with the company for about 3 quarters and I've been out at various conferences. And one of the things that I've noticed as part of the company, which I think is very important, is the emerging technology opportunity and we're early in that. When you start thinking about OpenStack and OpenShift and some of the other emerging technology products that we have, it's important for us to invest in that business in order to see its scale. We just finished a long-range plan. And as we look at the next several years, there's a tremendous amount of opportunity for us and we want to make sure that we're supporting that. So we've done a lot of analysis in the last several weeks, several months in looking at the investments that we have to make. When you start looking at a PaaS implementation or an Infrastructure-as-a-Service implementation, they're firmly complex. And we did some analysis to kind of look at what a typical deal in that space would involve. And it could be as short as 12 months as far as the investment, up to about 24 months as we go through an initiation, evaluation phase where we're working with the customer. We then have to go through a pilot project period, which is part of the early development. We then go into a larger production environment. That will also take a couple of months. And then after that, once you start getting that PaaS or the Infrastructure-as-a-Service in place, we then start looking at adding in JBoss or CloudForms in storage. So this process is fairly complex and could be lengthy, and of course, there is some investment associated with that. Over the last 2 quarters, we've increased our spending to support that. And as we look at FY '17, we're doing the same thing there and at the same time trying to balance those investments. If you look at the overall guidance that we provided, when you adjust for some of the Ansible and you also -- a couple of other minor adjustments like with the cloud adjustment that we had last year, the margins are about flat and so I think that's a fairly good model to have while we're making some of these important strategic investments."

So it seemed as though the announcement that Microsoft will come out with a Linux version of SQL Server. By mid-2017 is a pretty monumental event. And so it's the #1 database in the Gartner quadrant. It's one of the largest infrastructure software revenue streams in the world, but it's only been available on Windows in the past. So it seems we were remarking that the embrace of Linux in open source in general is broader than just running RHEL on Azure. And I am curious how do you interpret that and just how much interest do you expect to see for SQL Server on Linux when that product comes out in about a year.

It's not one we looked at separately because we're not in that business. But I think it's just another demonstration that Microsoft recognizes.

Ansible I think opens a significant number of opportunities for us. First off, when you start thinking about container management, an idea of microservices where you could have literally hundreds of thousands or millions of microservices, you have to have a way to orchestrate that in an agentless way and some of the leading orchestration tools out there require an agent on every container, which just won't scale in a microservices world. So we think as applications move to containerized environment to microservices, it's clearly the best technology. So there's a big opportunity there. I think you rightly notice that it's not just necessarily compute workloads how you think about managing network as well. Ansible has been a technology that many of the networking providers are very, very interested in. They're opportunities in IoT. We see it a lot as we do with SaaS in OpenStack. And so it fits into a whole series of areas in the portfolio. It's obviously early days now, but it has tremendous traction in general in the marketplace of people using the open-source components.

If you look at this past year, we just did a rough conservative number to say based on we had about $50-plus million that came in of new business in FY '16 as it came in around half the year and you just look at what that would have been if where were the subscription versus in arrears.

We're very pleased with how that performed and the other thing I would note as we talked about in that part of the prepared remarks is look at the deferred revenue also look at the off balance sheet. And specifically, that was up pretty healthy year-on-year overall. And then if you look at the portion that we broke out, which is over the next 12 months, that was up 20%. So I just want to emphasize that that's another strong indicator of how we -- how the business can kind of play out over the next year."

So whether it's our OpenShift kind of Platform-as-a-Service, which will run across the major cloud providers, whether it's various components of our middleware offerings. Obviously, any application someone is written that runs on RHEL, we know that RHEL will run across all of those cloud providers. That's a key part of our value proposition, choice, choice, choice. I would say what we're seeing now is enterprises typically pick a cloud and start there because you kind of got to get started and get comfortable with it. But enterprises even today that are on one cloud recognize going forward they're going to have to be able to run on multiple clouds just to have some leverage and some choice. And so I think a lot of enterprises even running on 1 cloud today are architecting their applications to ensure that they can run on multiple clouds. And so and again that has been what we've been saying in the marketplace for the last couple of years and the way we build our offerings. So we'd love to see people using multiple clouds because it helps highlight our offerings."

We have a very high renewal rate. And so we don't want to lower our price just to get people to either commit or pay us upfront. And when the deals were smaller, people would just have to budget in the year and would want to go ahead and do that. But once start -- as these customers get bigger and bigger and bigger, they kind of like the pay-as-you-go model, right. And so they're less likely to want to pay as upfront.

33679,327061533,955199,"Red Hat, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 22, 2016",2016-03-22,"Earnings Calls","Red Hat, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tom, and let me add my welcome to everyone joining us on today's call. The fourth quarter was a strong finish to another great year for Red Hat and our momentum and outlook are strong as we begin the new fiscal year. Our results reflect the fac",1339,"Thank you, Tom, and let me add my welcome to everyone joining us on today's call. The fourth quarter was a strong finish to another great year for Red Hat and our momentum and outlook are strong as we begin the new fiscal year. Our results reflect the fact that enterprises are increasingly adopting hybrid cloud infrastructures and open source technologies, and they are turning to Red Hat as their strategic partner as they do so. 
We exceeded guidance across all our financial metrics in the fourth quarter in addition to setting new records and milestones for the year. Here are a few highlights.
First, the fourth quarter marked our 56th consecutive quarter of revenue growth, which contributed to Red Hat's first year of crossing the $2 billion in total revenue milestone. Second, we drove accelerated full year revenue growth in both the Infrastructure-related technologies at 18% constant currency growth compared to 13% in the prior year and the application development and emerging technologies at 46% constant currency, up from 43% last year. Third, strong sales execution led to record total backlog of over $2.1 billion at the end of the year. And fourth, we delivered full year revenue growth of 21% in constant currency, non-GAAP operating income growth of 16% and operating cash flow growth of 15%. 
Looking at our large deal wins for the quarter, we saw strength as it related to the volume of large deals, the size of the deals as well as the breadth of technologies that were purchased. Here are some of the highlights of our top 30 largest deals. All of them were greater than $1 million. In fact, we closed 3x that many, delivering more than 90 deals in excess of $1 million in Q4. We also had a record 14 deals in Q4 that were in excess of $5 million. Of these deals, we closed 15 (sic) [ 5 ] in excess of $10 million, which is a record number of deals over $10 million for any quarter. 
Cross-selling was strong with 80% of the deals, including one or more components from our group of application development and emerging technologies offerings. Middleware in particular had strong traction in our largest deals with 75%, including a middleware component. This type of traction demonstrates our continued share gain in the middleware space. 
Our emerging cloud technologies also gained traction in our top deals, including a multimillion dollar win for OpenStack that we expect will be one of the largest installs of OpenStack once it's fully implemented. 
The top vertical for the quarter was telecommunications, where we closed a number of deals with several global telecommunications providers. The next highest vertical in the top deals was financial services. 
In addition to our success on-premise, we continue to be very active with our partners in the Certified Cloud and Service Provider Program or CCSP. We have added more partners in FY '16 and now have approximately 150 certified partners around the globe. In Q4, we further expanded our technology offerings that can be consumed in the cloud. For instance, RHEL on-demand is activated on Azure in February. OpenShift, our PaaS solution, and our storage technology will be added to the Google cloud. And RHEL OpenStack platform is now available at RackSpace as a managed service. In fact, we already have our first reference customer using this service, TD Bank. 
The CCSP program has generated over $100 million this fiscal year and grew approximately 90% year-over-year. 
During meetings, Frank and I have hosted over the quarter, investors have asked whether the public cloud is a positive driver for Red Hat. We firmly believe that it will be a hybrid cloud world where applications will run across all 4 footprints: physical, virtual, public cloud and private cloud. Furthermore, we are providing technologies that enable choice and consistencies across all 4 environments and we enhanced this value with application development technologies, storage and management. The public cloud specifically acts as a channel for us and it is part of the value we bring to customers. Beyond the expansion of our relationship with cloud providers and high-growth revenue results, let me share with you some customer data from our largest public cloud partner. 
First, as a channel partner, this public cloud has been a great resource for us to reach new customers, including small and medium-sized businesses. We see approximately half the revenue from this public cloud comes from usage totaling less than $5,000 per customer in a quarter. This group most likely includes small and medium-sized businesses, test and development environments, business divisions and start-up companies. Second, the public cloud enables our existing customers additional choice on where to run their workloads. The other approximately half of the revenue with this cloud vendor comes from existing customers. We match this data with the on-premise purchasing patterns of subscriptions for these existing customers. What we found was that this group of customers has continued to expand their on-premise subscription purchases while they are also rapidly utilizing the public cloud environment for additional RHEL workloads. This reinforces our view that it will be a hybrid cloud world and that Red Hat can continue to expand our wallet share as we provide choice and consistency to customers across all 4 footprints. 
As I noted previously, we achieved higher rates of revenue growth across our infrastructure, application development and emerging technologies during fiscal '16 which represents strong sales growth across all 4 footprints. Within the application development and emerging technologies, our fast growing OpenStack private cloud, OpenShift PaaS and CloudForms cloud management product lines. We made significant progress this past year expanding our position in this part of the hybrid cloud environment and driving faster adoption. Here are some highlights. 
We closed a number of large production deployments and hundreds of initial deployments along with hundreds of proof of concepts. Our sales traction has led to lighthouse customer wins with Cox Enterprises, Union Bank and FICO, just to name a few from FY '16. We doubled the number of Red Hat OpenStack certified professionals worldwide over the past year, and we have trained over 10,000 customers on OpenStack in calendar 2015 alone. Companies wanting to bring Red Hat OpenStack to their IT environments can look to a growing pool of qualified professionals to make it happen. Our combination of training, certification and professional services is speeding adoption of this technology. We're excited about our accomplishments to date. 
Our revenue from private Infrastructures-as-a-Service, PaaS and cloud management technologies is growing at nearly twice as fast as our public cloud revenue did when it was at the same size. We believe FY '17 will be another year of significant revenue growth with new customer adoption and further expansion with existing ones. 
In summary, customers are demanding technologies that modernize the development, deployment and life-cycle management of applications across hybrid cloud environments. Many are relying on Red Hat to provide both the infrastructure and application development platforms to run their enterprise applications consistently and reliably across physical, virtual, private and public cloud environments. This has positioned Red Hat for solid growth in fiscal '17 that Frank will detail in a moment. We continue to focus on capturing market share in each of the new high-growth market areas in which we compete. To achieve this goal, our plan is to continue to invest for the long-term growth of our open, hybrid cloud technologies with enterprises and service provider customers. 
Before turning the call over to Frank, I want to congratulate and thank our 8,800 Red Hat associates around the globe for their efforts to achieve the $2 billion revenue milestone and position us for further growth next year and beyond.
On a final note, I hope many of you will be able to join us for the June 30 Analyst Day at the Red Hat Summit in San Francisco. It will be a great opportunity to learn more about our strategic direction and innovative technologies. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Frank."

We executed well in the fourth quarter and throughout FY '16. We effectively managed our investments in expanding our open, hybrid cloud opportunities with strong execution while delivering profitable growth. We exceeded our guidance, whic",2183,"Thank you, Jim. We executed well in the fourth quarter and throughout FY '16. We effectively managed our investments in expanding our open, hybrid cloud opportunities with strong execution while delivering profitable growth. We exceeded our guidance, which led to double-digit growth in revenue, non-GAAP operating income, operating cash flow and total backlog for the fiscal year. The fourth quarter also marked our fifth consecutive quarter of 20% plus total revenue growth on a constant-currency basis. We are proud to be one of the very few software companies who can deliver this type of growth at over $2 billion in scale, and it is a testament to our leadership position, business model and market opportunity. 
Here are some of the Q4 financial highlights. We were pleased to generate total revenue of $544 million, which grew 21% on a year-over-year basis in constant currency or 17% in U.S. dollars. Taking into account the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, total revenue would have been $17 million or 360 basis points higher using the rates from Q4 of last year. Due to the continued high FX volatility, I will provide both U.S. dollar and constant currency results for the quarter using the rates from Q4 last year where it is appropriate.
Our revenue performance for the quarter exceeded the high end of our guidance by approximately $5 million on a U.S. dollar basis. Both subscription and service revenue was stronger than forecasted. All of our major geographies recorded strong growth with the Americas up 19%, EMEA up 24%, Asia-Pacific up 26% on a constant-currency basis. The main driver of our total revenue growth was subscription revenue, up $480 million, an increase of 22% in constant currency and 18% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. This renewable revenue stream now constitutes 88% of total revenue. 
We continued to drive high growth across our technology portfolio. The subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $391 million, an increase of 18% in constant currency and 15% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Our subscription revenue for application development related and emerging technologies offerings was $89 million, an increase of 43% in constant currency and 38% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Application development related and emerging technologies revenue was approximately 16% of total revenue and that's up 250 basis points from the year ago quarter.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $124 million and grew 13%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 22.9%. And as a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjusts for noncash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combination. This non-GAAP operating margin was modestly above our guidance, while it included a full quarter of expenses and investments related to the Ansible acquisition. 
As our results have demonstrated and combined with the growth drivers that Jim just discussed, we believe we can further expand our market share gains with additional investments in our hybrid cloud capabilities. In Q4, we were proactive on our fiscal 2017 investments due to the strong momentum of our business. We added approximately 480 associates this quarter, mainly in sales, customer support, consulting and R&D. For the full fiscal year, we have added approximately 1,500 associates for a total of approximately 8,800 associates globally. 
After adjusting for noncash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, transaction costs related to business combinations, and noncash interest expense related to the convertible debt discount, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.52 per share. That's $0.05 above the guidance we provided in December. In addition to the higher revenue and disciplined spending, which drove the $0.01 per share of upside, we benefited from a discrete tax benefit of approximately $0.04 per share related to the reauthorization of the R&D tax credit. 
Next, let me discuss our annual backlog that we disclosed with the fourth quarter results. First, total backlog was up 15% year-over-year on February 29 for a record balance in excess of $2.13 billion in U.S. dollars. On a constant-currency basis, total backlog growth would have exceeded 16%. We define total backlog at the value of noncancelable subscriptions and service agreements including our total deferred revenue, which is billed plus the value of noncancelable subscriptions and service agreements to be billed in the future, which are not reflected in our financial statements. 
Here are the component pieces. The portion of total backlog that has been billed is total deferred, which is $1.72 billion at the end of fiscal 2016 and this was up 16% year-over-year. On a constant-currency basis, the total deferred revenue would have been up 18%. The portion of total backlog to be billed in the future or our off-balance sheet backlog was in excess of $410 million compared to an excess of $380 million last fiscal year. This was up over 8% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. And on a constant-currency basis, the off-balance sheet backlog would have been up more than 10%. It is worth noting that the portion of off-balance sheet backlog to be billed in the next 12 months was in excess of $275 million and this was up approximately $45 million or 20% from fiscal 2015. 
The combination of deferred revenue and off-balance sheet backlog provides us with forward-looking visibility into a significant portion of FY '17 revenue as well as contributing to revenue beyond FY '17. The average contract length in the quarter was 22 months. And for the full year, the average deal length returned to the historic 21 months duration after being elevated at 22 months in FY '15.
Deferred revenue is also a component of our billings proxy. Our preferred view of billings is the rolling 4 quarters billing proxy, which is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in total deferred on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, the fourth quarter billings proxy was $578 million, that's up 12% year-over-year. And on a constant-currency basis, this metric would have been up 17% year-over-year.
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2 billion. And during the quarter, we returned $114 million to shareholders from repurchasing approximately 1.6 million shares of stock. We had approximately $237 million remaining on the current share repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter. For the full year, we returned $263 million to shareholders from repurchasing approximately 3.5 million shares of stock. And over the past 5 years, our repurchase programs have reduced our fully diluted share count by over 10 million shares or approximately 6%. 
Operating cash flow of $247 million for the quarter was up 14% year-over-year and a record for any quarter. Strong collections contributed to this result with FX-adjusted day sales outstanding at 61 days. This is down from 63 days a year ago quarter. 
Now to briefly recap and summarize the highlights for the full fiscal year. Total revenue grew $2.05 billion, that's up 21% year-over-year in constant currency or up 15% in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue grew $1.8 billion, an increase of 22% in constant currency or 16% in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $1.48 billion, that's up 18% in constant currency and 12% in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue for application development and emerging technologies was $323 million, up 46% in constant currency and 37% in U.S. dollars. For FY '16 application development and emerging technology subscriptions contributed 16% of total revenue and that's up from 13% last fiscal year. Non-GAAP operating income grew 16%. Full year fiscal '16 non-GAAP operating margin was 30 basis points higher than FY '15 and included the dilutive impacts from the Ansible acquisition. Non-GAAP EPS for the full year was $1.91, that's up 19% over the prior year. 
Overall, our priorities to continue to make smart investments, focus on long-term objectives and remain the open source market leader are proving to be effective. We remain highly focused on strong execution across all areas of the business. 
I will now review the metrics for business momentum and top renewals in the quarter. Across all geographies, we saw continued growth in our bookings. This quarter, 64% of bookings came from the Americas, 23% from EMEA, 13% from Asia Pacific versus 63-25-12 split in Q4 of last year. The Q4 sales route to market mix was 71% from the channel and 29% from our direct sales force, and that's compared to 68-32 split in Q4 of last year. For the full fiscal year, we surpassed our multiyear annual goal with a 72-28 split. This quarter, we once again renewed all of the deals in our top 25 deal metrics. The total subscription value of these top 25 renewals was approximately 120% of the prior value. Our ability to renew and increase our wallet share with large customers demonstrates Red Hat's increasing strategic importance with customers. This fiscal year, we renewed all of the deals in the top 25 deals metric per quarter, renewing all of our deals in each quarter with upsell growth between 115% to 120% for this metric. Over the past 5 years, we've had similar success, renewing 498 out of 500 top deals. And this is a phenomenal track record. 
While we never want to lose a deal, if we do so, we never give up trying to win back the business. This quarter, I am pleased to report that we closed a multimillion dollar win back of 1 of these 2 former top deals from the 500 deals we reported. We won back this deal on RHEL because of our award-winning support and expanded portfolio of technologies. In addition to now running RHEL, this customer is relying on Red Hat to help them modernize their application development with Red Hat JBoss middleware and to realize the benefits from hybrid cloud computing with our OpenStack technology. Congratulations to the account team for an exceptional job of positioning Red Hat to win and expanding our footprint with this customer. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and foreign currency. We are forecasting our full year revenue guidance to be $2.380 billion to $2.420 billion, that's up approximately 18% at the high end of the range. Our non-GAAP operating margin forecast reflects our increased hiring in sales, R&D, services and support at the end of FY '16 and our plan to continue to invest in business and emerging technologies as well as the full year impact of ongoing operational expenses from the Ansible acquisition.
We expect operating income to grow by 14% to 16%, with an operating margin of approximately 23.2%. Our plan includes adding approximately 1,400 net new associates or 16% headcount growth, down from 20% headcount growth in FY '16. We expect full year non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $2.22 to $2.26 per share, assuming a $1 million to $2 million per quarter forecast for a net other income, a lower annual effective tax rate of 27% and approximately 184 million diluted shares. At the top end of the guidance, this would be an 18% growth in earnings per share.
On a GAAP basis, we estimate annual stock compensation expenses of approximately $180 million and annual amortization expense of approximately $29 million. GAAP fully-diluted EPS guidance includes noncash interest expense, which is related to the convertible debt discount, of approximately $19 million. Operating cash flow is expected to grow in the range from $800 million to $820 million. This range includes a headwind of approximately $10 million for increased cash taxes as the company continues to drive greater profitability. For those of you who try to model billings metrics, we would expect the same business flow in our renewal subscription model as in the past. We expect both bookings and billings to repeat their historic pattern of being lowest in Q1 and growing -- going forward to the end of the highest level in Q4. 
For Q1 specifically, we offer the following outlook. We expect revenue to be in the range of $558 million to $566 million, which is up 18% in U.S. dollars at the high end of the range. One should note that FY '16 Q1 revenue had a onetime catch up benefit from the CCSP program that will not repeat in Q1 of this year. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 22% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.50. 
Consistent with prior practices, I will not forecast quarterly cash flow, but please note that it can be variable depending upon individual payments or receipts. 
Overall, we delivered a strong performance in Q4 and throughout FY '16. We continue to believe there is significant opportunity for Red Hat as IT organizations transition their application development and infrastructure to the hybrid cloud environment. We are very well positioned to deliver an attractive combination of revenue growth, profitability and cash flow for FY '17. We remain optimistic about the company's long-term opportunity as we are uniquely positioned to further drive the adoption of open source technologies and to enable customers to reap the benefits of hybrid cloud computing.

Coming in at about 17%, it's modestly down from what we saw in the past few quarters, but nothing out of the ordinary.

And as you know, I've been with the company for about 3 quarters and I've been out at various conferences. And one of the things that I've noticed as part of the company, which I think is very important, is the emerging technology opportunity and we're early in that. When you start thinking about OpenStack and OpenShift and some of the other emerging technology products that we have, it's important for us to invest in that business in order to see its scale. We just finished a long-range plan. And as we look at the next several years, there's a tremendous amount of opportunity for us and we want to make sure that we're supporting that. So we've done a lot of analysis in the last several weeks, several months in looking at the investments that we have to make. When you start looking at a PaaS implementation or an Infrastructure-as-a-Service implementation, they're fairly complex. And we did some analysis to kind of look at what a typical deal in that space would involve. And it could be as short as 12 months as far as the investment, up to about 24 months because we go through an initiation, evaluation phase where we're working with the customer. We then have to go through a pilot project period, which is part of the early development. We then go into a larger production environment. That also takes a couple of months. And then after that, once you start getting the PaaS or the Infrastructure-as-a-Service in place, we then start looking at adding in JBoss or CloudForms in storage. So this process is fairly complex and could be lengthy, and of course, there is some investment associated with that. Over the last 2 quarters, we've increased our spending to support that. And as we look at FY '17, we're doing the same thing there and at the same time trying to balance those investments. If you look at the overall guidance that we provided, when you adjust for some of the Ansible and you also -- a couple of other minor adjustments like with the cloud adjustment that we had last year, the margins are about flat and so I think that's a fairly good model to have while we're making some of these important strategic investments."

It's not one we looked at separately because we're not in that business. But I think it's just another demonstration that Microsoft recognizes it needs to have its technologies running on Linux just like .NET where we can access millions of .NET developers now. This is just another opportunity for us to expand the addressable market that we can get with Linux."

Ansible I think opens up a significant number of opportunities for us. First off, when you start thinking about container management, an idea of microservices where you could have literally hundreds of thousands or millions of microservices, you have to have a way to orchestrate that in an agentless way and some of the leading orchestration tools out there require an agent on every container, which just won't scale in a microservices world. So we think as applications move to containerized environment to microservices, it's clearly the best technology. So there's a big opportunity there. I think you rightly noticed that it's not just necessarily compute workloads, how you think about managing network as well. Ansible has been a technology that many of the networking providers are very, very interested in. They're opportunities in IoT. We see it a lot as we do with SaaS in OpenStack. And so it fits into a whole series of areas in the portfolio. It's obviously early days now, but it has tremendous traction in general in the marketplace of people using the open-source components. And so we feel very, very good that over time, it could be a very material contributor to Red Hat."

If you look at this past year, we just did a rough conservative number to say based on -- we had about $50-plus million that came in of new business in FY '16 as it came in around half the year and you just look at what that would have been if where it was a subscription versus an arrears.

I think just in general, net new workloads even in Mode 1 world are more likely to move to Linux now. Developer tool chains, skill sets, et cetera, we're kind of in a significant shift from a Windows type world to a place where developers start first in Linux. So when you take something like containers, containers are in Linux phenomenon. Docker is a Linux-only technology at this point. Windows is working on it. So again, any Docker or any container workload is going to be on Linux as well. So I think we just have a lot of momentum on the developer side which drags through Linux for us."

So whether it's our OpenShift kind of Platform-as-a-Service, which will run across the major cloud providers, whether it's various components of our middleware offerings. Obviously, any application someone has written that runs on RHEL, we know that RHEL will run across all of those cloud providers. That's a key part of our value proposition, choice, choice, choice. I would say what we're seeing now is enterprises typically pick a cloud and start there because you kind of got to get started and get comfortable with it. But enterprises even today that are on one cloud recognize going forward they're going to have to be able to run on multiple clouds just to have some leverage and some choice. And so I think a lot of enterprises even running on one cloud today are architecting their applications to ensure that they can run on multiple clouds. And so and again that has been what we've been saying in the marketplace for the last couple of years and the way we've built our offering. So we'd love to see people using multiple clouds because it helps highlight our offerings."

And when the deals were smaller, people would just have to budget in the year and would want to go ahead and do that.

The fourth quarter was a strong finish to another great year for Red Hat and our momentum and outlook are strong as we begin the new fiscal year. Our results reflect the fact that enterprises are increasingly adopting hybrid cloud infrastructures and open source technologies, and they are turning to Red Hat as their strategic partner as they do so. 
We exceeded guidance across all our financial metrics in the fourth quarter in addition to setting new records and milestones for the year. Here are a few highlights.
First, the fourth quarter marked our 56th consecutive quarter of revenue growth, which contributed to Red Hat's first year of crossing the $2 billion in total revenue milestone. Second, we drove accelerated full year revenue growth in both the Infrastructure-related technologies at 18% constant currency growth compared to 13% in the prior year and the application development and emerging technologies at 46% constant currency, up from 43% last year. Third, strong sales execution led to record total backlog of over $2.1 billion at the end of the year. And fourth, we delivered full year revenue growth of 21% in constant currency, non-GAAP operating income growth of 16% and operating cash flow growth of 15%. 
Looking at our large deal wins for the quarter, we saw strength as it related to the volume of large deals, the size of the deals as well as the breadth of technologies that were purchased. Here are some of the highlights of our top 30 largest deals. All of them were greater than $1 million. In fact, we closed 3x that many, delivering more than 90 deals in excess of $1 million in Q4. We also had a record 14 deals in Q4 that were in excess of $5 million. Of these deals, we closed 15 (sic) [ 5 ] in excess of $10 million, which is a record number of deals over $10 million for any quarter. 
Cross-selling was strong with 80% of the deals, including one or more components from our group of application development and emerging technologies offerings. Middleware in particular had strong traction in our largest deals with 75%, including a middleware component. This type of traction demonstrates our continued share gain in the middleware space. 
Our emerging cloud technologies also gained traction in our top deals, including a multimillion dollar win for OpenStack that we expect will be one of the largest installs of OpenStack once it's fully implemented. 
The top vertical for the quarter was telecommunications, where we closed a number of deals with several global telecommunications providers. The next highest vertical in the top deals was financial services. 
In addition to our success on-premise, we continue to be very active with our partners in the Certified Cloud and Service Provider Program or CCSP. We have added more partners in FY '16 and now have approximately 150 certified partners around the globe. In Q4, we further expanded our technology offerings that can be consumed in the cloud. For instance, RHEL on-demand is activated on Azure in February. OpenShift, our PaaS solution, and our storage technology will be added to the Google cloud. And RHEL OpenStack platform is now available at RackSpace as a managed service. In fact, we already have our first reference customer using this service, TD Bank. 
The CCSP program has generated over $100 million this fiscal year and grew approximately 90% year-over-year. 
During meetings, Frank and I have hosted over the quarter, investors have asked whether the public cloud is a positive driver for Red Hat. We firmly believe that it will be a hybrid cloud world where applications will run across all 4 footprints: physical, virtual, public cloud and private cloud. Furthermore, we are providing technologies that enable choice and consistencies across all 4 environments and we enhanced this value with application development technologies, storage and management. The public cloud specifically acts as a channel for us and it is part of the value we bring to customers. Beyond the expansion of our relationship with cloud providers and high-growth revenue results, let me share with you some customer data from our largest public cloud partner. 
First, as a channel partner, this public cloud has been a great resource for us to reach new customers, including small and medium-sized businesses. We see approximately half the revenue from this public cloud comes from usage totaling less than $5,000 per customer in a quarter. This group most likely includes small and medium-sized businesses, test and development environments, business divisions and start-up companies. Second, the public cloud enables our existing customers’ additional choice on where to run their workloads. The other approximately half of the revenue with this cloud vendor comes from existing customers. We match this data with the on-premise purchasing patterns of subscriptions for these existing customers. What we found was that this group of customers has continued to expand their on-premise subscription purchases while they are also rapidly utilizing the public cloud environment for additional RHEL workloads. This reinforces our view that it will be a hybrid cloud world and that Red Hat can continue to expand our wallet share as we provide choice and consistency to customers across all 4 footprints. 
As I noted previously, we achieved higher rates of revenue growth across our infrastructure, application development and emerging technologies during fiscal '16 which represents strong sales growth across all 4 footprints. Within the application development and emerging technologies, our fast growing OpenStack private cloud, OpenShift PaaS and CloudForms cloud management product lines. We made significant progress this past year expanding our position in this part of the hybrid cloud environment and driving faster adoption. Here are some highlights. 
We closed a number of large production deployments and hundreds of initial deployments along with hundreds of proof of concepts. Our sales traction has led to lighthouse customer wins with Cox Enterprises, Union Bank and FICO, just to name a few from FY '16. We doubled the number of Red Hat OpenStack certified professionals worldwide over the past year, and we have trained over 10,000 customers on OpenStack in calendar 2015 alone. Companies wanting to bring Red Hat OpenStack to their IT environments can look to a growing pool of qualified professionals to make it happen. Our combination of training, certification and professional services is speeding adoption of this technology. We're excited about our accomplishments to date. 
Our revenue from private Infrastructures-as-a-Service, PaaS and cloud management technologies is growing at nearly twice as fast as our public cloud revenue did when it was at the same size. We believe FY '17 will be another year of significant revenue growth with new customer adoption and further expansion with existing ones. 
In summary, customers are demanding technologies that modernize the development, deployment and life-cycle management of applications across hybrid cloud environments. Many are relying on Red Hat to provide both the infrastructure and application development platforms to run their enterprise applications consistently and reliably across physical, virtual, private and public cloud environments. This has positioned Red Hat for solid growth in fiscal '17 that Frank will detail in a moment. We continue to focus on capturing market share in each of the new high-growth market areas in which we compete. To achieve this goal, our plan is to continue to invest for the long-term growth of our open, hybrid cloud technologies with enterprises and service provider customers. 
Before turning the call over to Frank, I want to congratulate and thank our 8,800 Red Hat associates around the globe for their efforts to achieve the $2 billion revenue milestone and position us for further growth next year and beyond.
On a final note, I hope many of you will be able to join us for the June 30 Analyst Day at the Red Hat Summit in San Francisco. It will be a great opportunity to learn more about our strategic direction and innovative technologies. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Frank."

We effectively managed our investments in expanding our open, hybrid cloud opportunities with strong execution while delivering profitable growth. We exceeded our guidance, which led to double-digit growth in revenue, non-GAAP operating income, operating cash flow and total backlog for the fiscal year. The fourth quarter also marked our fifth consecutive quarter of 20% plus total revenue growth on a constant-currency basis. We are proud to be one of the very few software companies who can deliver this type of growth at over $2 billion in scale, and it is a testament to our leadership position, business model and market opportunity. 
Here are some of the Q4 financial highlights. We were pleased to generate total revenue of $544 million, which grew 21% on a year-over-year basis in constant currency or 17% in U.S. dollars. Taking into account the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, total revenue would have been $17 million or 360 basis points higher using the rates from Q4 of last year. Due to the continued high FX volatility, I will provide both U.S. dollar and constant currency results for the quarter using the rates from Q4 last year where it is appropriate.
Our revenue performance for the quarter exceeded the high end of our guidance by approximately $5 million on a U.S. dollar basis. Both subscription and service revenue was stronger than forecasted. All of our major geographies recorded strong growth with the Americas up 19%, EMEA up 24%, Asia-Pacific up 26% on a constant-currency basis. The main driver of our total revenue growth was subscription revenue, up $480 million, an increase of 22% in constant currency and 18% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. This renewable revenue stream now constitutes 88% of total revenue. 
We continued to drive high growth across our technology portfolio. The subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $391 million, an increase of 18% in constant currency and 15% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Our subscription revenue for application development related and emerging technologies offerings was $89 million, an increase of 43% in constant currency and 38% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. Application development related and emerging technologies revenue was approximately 16% of total revenue and that's up 250 basis points from the year ago quarter.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $124 million and grew 13%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 22.9%. And as a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjusts for noncash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combination. This non-GAAP operating margin was modestly above our guidance, while it included a full quarter of expenses and investments related to the Ansible acquisition. 
As our results have demonstrated and combined with the growth drivers that Jim just discussed, we believe we can further expand our market share gains with additional investments in our hybrid cloud capabilities. In Q4, we were proactive on our fiscal 2017 investments due to the strong momentum of our business. We added approximately 480 associates this quarter, mainly in sales, customer support, consulting and R&D. For the full fiscal year, we have added approximately 1,500 associates for a total of approximately 8,800 associates globally. 
After adjusting for noncash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, transaction costs related to business combinations, and noncash interest expense related to the convertible debt discount, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.52 per share. That's $0.05 above the guidance we provided in December. In addition to the higher revenue and disciplined spending, which drove the $0.01 per share of upside, we benefited from a discrete tax benefit of approximately $0.04 per share related to the reauthorization of the R&D tax credit. 
Next, let me discuss our annual backlog that we disclosed with the fourth quarter results. First, total backlog was up 15% year-over-year on February 29 for a record balance in excess of $2.13 billion in U.S. dollars. On a constant-currency basis, total backlog growth would have exceeded 16%. We define total backlog at the value of noncancelable subscriptions and service agreements including our total deferred revenue, which is billed plus the value of noncancelable subscriptions and service agreements to be billed in the future, which are not reflected in our financial statements. 
Here are the component pieces. The portion of total backlog that has been billed is total deferred, which is $1.72 billion at the end of fiscal 2016 and this was up 16% year-over-year. On a constant-currency basis, the total deferred revenue would have been up 18%. The portion of total backlog to be billed in the future or our off-balance sheet backlog was in excess of $410 million compared to an excess of $380 million last fiscal year. This was up over 8% year-over-year in U.S. dollars. And on a constant-currency basis, the off-balance sheet backlog would have been up more than 10%. It is worth noting that the portion of off-balance sheet backlog to be billed in the next 12 months was in excess of $275 million and this was up approximately $45 million or 20% from fiscal 2015. 
The combination of deferred revenue and off-balance sheet backlog provides us with forward-looking visibility into a significant portion of FY '17 revenue as well as contributing to revenue beyond FY '17. The average contract length in the quarter was 22 months. And for the full year, the average deal length returned to the historic 21 months duration after being elevated at 22 months in FY '15.
Deferred revenue is also a component of our billings proxy. Our preferred view of billings is the rolling 4 quarters billing proxy, which is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in total deferred on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, the fourth quarter billings proxy was $578 million, that's up 12% year-over-year. And on a constant-currency basis, this metric would have been up 17% year-over-year.
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2 billion. And during the quarter, we returned $114 million to shareholders from repurchasing approximately 1.6 million shares of stock. We had approximately $237 million remaining on the current share repurchase authorization at the end of the quarter. For the full year, we returned $263 million to shareholders from repurchasing approximately 3.5 million shares of stock. And over the past 5 years, our repurchase programs have reduced our fully diluted share count by over 10 million shares or approximately 6%. 
Operating cash flow of $247 million for the quarter was up 14% year-over-year and a record for any quarter. Strong collections contributed to this result with FX-adjusted day sales outstanding at 61 days. This is down from 63 days a year ago quarter. 
Now to briefly recap and summarize the highlights for the full fiscal year. Total revenue grew $2.05 billion, that's up 21% year-over-year in constant currency or up 15% in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue grew $1.8 billion, an increase of 22% in constant currency or 16% in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $1.48 billion, that's up 18% in constant currency and 12% in U.S. dollars. Subscription revenue for application development and emerging technologies was $323 million, up 46% in constant currency and 37% in U.S. dollars. For FY '16 application development and emerging technology subscriptions contributed 16% of total revenue and that's up from 13% last fiscal year. Non-GAAP operating income grew 16%. Full year fiscal '16 non-GAAP operating margin was 30 basis points higher than FY '15 and included the dilutive impacts from the Ansible acquisition. Non-GAAP EPS for the full year was $1.91, that's up 19% over the prior year. 
Overall, our priorities to continue to make smart investments, focus on long-term objectives and remain the open source market leader are proving to be effective. We remain highly focused on strong execution across all areas of the business. 
I will now review the metrics for business momentum and top renewals in the quarter. Across all geographies, we saw continued growth in our bookings. This quarter, 64% of bookings came from the Americas, 23% from EMEA, 13% from Asia Pacific versus 63-25-12 split in Q4 of last year. The Q4 sales route to market mix was 71% from the channel and 29% from our direct sales force, and that's compared to 68-32 split in Q4 of last year. For the full fiscal year, we surpassed our multiyear annual goal with a 72-28 split. This quarter, we once again renewed all of the deals in our top 25 deal metrics. The total subscription value of these top 25 renewals was approximately 120% of the prior value. Our ability to renew and increase our wallet share with large customers demonstrates Red Hat's increasing strategic importance with customers. This fiscal year, we renewed all of the deals in the top 25 deals metric per quarter, renewing all of our deals in each quarter with upsell growth between 115% to 120% for this metric. Over the past 5 years, we've had similar success, renewing 498 out of 500 top deals. And this is a phenomenal track record. 
While we never want to lose a deal, if we do so, we never give up trying to win back the business. This quarter, I am pleased to report that we closed a multimillion dollar win back of 1 of these 2 former top deals from the 500 deals we reported. We won back this deal on RHEL because of our award-winning support and expanded portfolio of technologies. In addition to now running RHEL, this customer is relying on Red Hat to help them modernize their application development with Red Hat JBoss middleware and to realize the benefits from hybrid cloud computing with our OpenStack technology. Congratulations to the account team for an exceptional job of positioning Red Hat to win and expanding our footprint with this customer. 
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and foreign currency. We are forecasting our full year revenue guidance to be $2.380 billion to $2.420 billion, that's up approximately 18% at the high end of the range. Our non-GAAP operating margin forecast reflects our increased hiring in sales, R&D, services and support at the end of FY '16 and our plan to continue to invest in business and emerging technologies as well as the full year impact of ongoing operational expenses from the Ansible acquisition.
We expect operating income to grow by 14% to 16%, with an operating margin of approximately 23.2%. Our plan includes adding approximately 1,400 net new associates or 16% headcount growth, down from 20% headcount growth in FY '16. We expect full year non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $2.22 to $2.26 per share, assuming a $1 million to $2 million per quarter forecast for a net other income, a lower annual effective tax rate of 27% and approximately 184 million diluted shares. At the top end of the guidance, this would be an 18% growth in earnings per share.
On a GAAP basis, we estimate annual stock compensation expenses of approximately $180 million and annual amortization expense of approximately $29 million. GAAP fully-diluted EPS guidance includes noncash interest expense, which is related to the convertible debt discount, of approximately $19 million. Operating cash flow is expected to grow in the range from $800 million to $820 million. This range includes a headwind of approximately $10 million for increased cash taxes as the company continues to drive greater profitability. For those of you who try to model billings metrics, we would expect the same business flow in our renewal subscription model as in the past. We expect both bookings and billings to repeat their historic pattern of being lowest in Q1 and growing -- going forward to the end of the highest level in Q4. 
For Q1 specifically, we offer the following outlook. We expect revenue to be in the range of $558 million to $566 million, which is up 18% in U.S. dollars at the high end of the range. One should note that FY '16 Q1 revenue had a onetime catch up benefit from the CCSP program that will not repeat in Q1 of this year. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 22% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.50. 
Consistent with prior practices, I will not forecast quarterly cash flow, but please note that it can be variable depending upon individual payments or receipts. 
Overall, we delivered a strong performance in Q4 and throughout FY '16. We continue to believe there is significant opportunity for Red Hat as IT organizations transition their application development and infrastructure to the hybrid cloud environment. We are very well positioned to deliver an attractive combination of revenue growth, profitability and cash flow for FY '17. We remain optimistic about the company's long-term opportunity as we are uniquely positioned to further drive the adoption of open source technologies and to enable customers to reap the benefits of hybrid cloud computing.

And as you know, I've been with the company for about 3 quarters and I've been out at various conferences. And one of the things that I've noticed as part of the company, which I think is very important, is the emerging technology opportunity and we're early in that. When you start thinking about OpenStack and OpenShift and some of the other emerging technology products that we have, it's important for us to invest in that business in order to see its scale. We just finished a long-range plan. And as we look at the next several years, there's a tremendous amount of opportunity for us and we want to make sure that we're supporting that. So we've done a lot of analysis in the last several weeks, several months in looking at the investments that we have to make. When you start looking at a PaaS implementation or an Infrastructure-as-a-Service implementation, they're fairly complex. And we did some analysis to kind of look at what a typical deal in that space would involve. And it could be as short as 12 months as far as the investment, up to about 24 months because we go through an initiation, evaluation phase where we're working with the customer. We then have to go through a pilot project period, which is part of the early development. We then go into a larger production environment. That also takes a couple of months. And then after that, once you start getting the PaaS or the Infrastructure-as-a-Service in place, we then start looking at adding in JBoss or CloudForms in storage. So this process is fairly complex and could be lengthy, and of course, there is some investment associated with that. Over the last 2 quarters, we've increased our spending to support that. And as we look at FY '17, we're doing the same thing there and at the same time trying to balance those investments. If you look at the overall guidance that we provided, when you adjust for some of the Ansible and you also -- a couple of other minor adjustments like with the cloud adjustment that we had last year, the margins are about flat and so I think that's a fairly good model to have while we're making some of these important strategic investments."

Ansible I think opens up a significant number of opportunities for us. First off, when you start thinking about container management, an idea of microservices where you could have literally hundreds of thousands or millions of microservices, you have to have a way to orchestrate that in an agentless way and some of the leading orchestration tools out there require an agent on every container, which just won't scale in a microservices world. So we think as applications move to containerized environment to microservices, it's clearly the best technology. So there's a big opportunity there. I think you rightly noticed that it's not just necessarily compute workloads, how you think about managing network as well. Ansible has been a technology that many of the networking providers are very, very interested in. They're opportunities in IoT. We see it a lot as we do with SaaS in OpenStack. And so it fits into a whole series of areas in the portfolio. It's obviously early days now, but it has tremendous traction in general in the marketplace of people using the open-source components. And so we feel very, very good that over time, it could be a very material contributor to Red Hat."

It's great to see for all the reasons that Jim mentioned earlier. So as that becomes a higher percentage -- approximately right now about 5% of our business, as that becomes a higher percentage, yes, it will have an impact as we start looking at billings and any indicator that looks at future. If you look at this past year, we just did a rough conservative number to say based on -- we had about $50-plus million that came in of new business in FY '16 as it came in around half the year and you just look at what that would have been if where it was a subscription versus an arrears.

So we obviously win a huge share of kind of what I'll call the scale out stateless kind of workloads, number one. I think that's a key driver. I think just in general, net new workloads even in Mode 1 world are more likely to move to Linux now. Developer tool chains, skill sets, et cetera, we're kind of in a significant shift from a Windows type world to a place where developers start first in Linux. So when you take something like containers, containers are in Linux phenomenon. Docker is a Linux-only technology at this point. Windows is working on it. So again, any Docker or any container workload is going to be on Linux as well. So I think we just have a lot of momentum on the developer side which drags through Linux for us."

So whether it's our OpenShift kind of Platform-as-a-Service, which will run across the major cloud providers, whether it's various components of our middleware offerings. Obviously, any application someone has written that runs on RHEL, we know that RHEL will run across all of those cloud providers. That's a key part of our value proposition, choice, choice, choice. I would say what we're seeing now is enterprises typically pick a cloud and start there because you kind of got to get started and get comfortable with it. But enterprises even today that are on one cloud recognize going forward they're going to have to be able to run on multiple clouds just to have some leverage and some choice. And so I think a lot of enterprises even running on one cloud today are architecting their applications to ensure that they can run on multiple clouds. And so and again that has been what we've been saying in the marketplace for the last couple of years and the way we've built our offering. So we'd love to see people using multiple clouds because it helps highlight our offerings."

We have a very high renewal rate. And so we don't want to lower our price just to get people to either commit or pay us upfront. And when the deals were smaller, people would just have to budget in the year and would want to go ahead and do that. But once start -- as these customers get bigger and bigger and bigger, they kind of like the pay-as-you-go model, right. And so they're less likely to want to pay us upfront.

Transformation and cloud computing are changing the way companies compete in virtually every industry today. Organizations that rapidly embrace agile IT technology are succeeding as industry innovation accelerates around them. With our open source-based technologies, we are helping customers to capture the business benefits associated with this rapid rate of change. Strong adoption of our technologies is evidenced in our financial results where we delivered our highest Q1 total revenue growth rate in U.S. dollars in 3 years, grew both Q1 total revenue and subscription revenue at 18% year-over-year and had strong sales execution that led to a record number of yields over $1 million in the Q1. 
With that overview, let me discuss some of our recent business and technology highlights from the quarter. Starting with OpenShift, our PaaS solution where we made a number of recent announcements. First, our OpenShift common's members crossed 200 organizations from over 40 countries and includes Global 2000 enterprises, ISVs and SaaS providers, system integrator partners and public sector institutions. OpenShift's commons is an community that encourages collaboration, contribution and best practices for open source technologies in PaaS and containers. 
Secondly, announced the next-generation of OpenShift Online that was made available for -- in developer preview this week. OpenShift Online has had over 3 million applications deployed to it and has now been updated to become the industry's first multi-tenant Docker container and Kubernetes powered public cloud platform. And lastly, our OpenShift technology won a Cody award for Best Platform as a Service for second year in a row. This is a prestigious purebreds award presented by the SIIA. OpenShift also received InfoWorld's 2016 technology of the year earlier in the year, for a second time. 
As a headline sponsor of the OpenStack Summit in Austin, we announced the general availability of 2 new technologies that help bridge the gap between development and operations teams to scale up for cloud computing. First, we launched cloud suite that is designed to offer an integrated hybrid cloud stack with a container application platform, a scalable infrastructure-based on OpenStack and unified management tools. Second and in conjunction with the event, we released the general availability of the latest version of our OpenStack distribution, Red Hat LSP 8, which is based on the OpenStack Community Liberty release. A coengineer solution, Red Hat LSP 8 integrates the foundation of the RHEL with Red Hat's OpenStack technology to perform a production-ready cloud platform. Red Hat's core OpenStack offering now natively includes additional automation for upgrades and updates, infrastructure and more closed management and software-defined storage. 
Our new offerings further solidifies Red Hat's early leadership position in OpenStack. This is exciting given the considerable growth in OpenStack interest level among enterprises, growing levels of customer adoption and further signs of market maturation as more enterprises are moving to live production each quarter. Importantly, we believe that Red Hat LSP is increasingly being recognized as the gold standard for large-scale production OpenStack deployments. We have hundreds of production deployments across the globe and even more proof of concepts are underway, including recent wins with Cambridge University, Patty Power Bet Fair, Fastweb, NASA JPL and proto-bond, the IT services division of Santander Bank. 
A broadening group of enterprise and service provider customers that have deployed Red Hat OpenStack Platform include: Verizon NCA mobile, and a strong ecosystem of industry leaders that around RHEL or Red Hat LSP for a transformative network function virtualization and software defined networking deployments. Of course, Red Hat LSP and cloud suite are just part of a portfolio technologies that customers are deploying to address their digital transformation needs. 
To this point, we had an important new win in Q1 with a global financial services provider, BBVA that speaks to the power and breadth and depth of Red Hat's offerings. This global strategic collaboration with BBVA establishes Red Hat as one of their priority partners. The partnership is designed to focus on business and technical alignment, enabling BBVA to accelerate innovation, manage the growth of financial transactions on digital devices and deliver digital banking services through its global customers. 
Moreover, new IaaS and PaaS-based platforms, utilizing Red Hat technology will enable BBVA to focus on developing applications that can support the heavy demands of those global digital banking services and provide customers with the service and information they want when it is needed. BBVA is a fantastic example of a global enterprise that has turned to an open source-based cloud solution and Red Hat in particular to drive business innovation through technology. We're thrilled to collaborate with them on this journey to transform their business and to help them reach their goal of becoming the world's first truly digital global bank. 
More broadly, we believe that Red Hat is seeing and winning a growing number of large deal opportunities due to the breadth and depth of our stack. As customers move work close to the cloud and develop innovative new applications, they are trained to open source-based solutions to provide them with speed, agility, security, reliability and enterprise features. They're turning to Red Hat and we believe we are well positioned to benefit as organizations invest in private, hybrid and public clouds. 
Today, we announced the acquisition of a JBoss middleware partner, 3scale. 3scale was founded in 2007 with a goal of enabling organizations of all sizes to successfully create, manage and use API in a web-enabled world where API is paramount. It offers a hybrid cloud-based API management solution that separates the cloud management layer from the API gateway, offering customers more flexibility, performance and scale. The company power's more than 700 APIs for more than 500 organizations across many industries, including banker, Johnson Controls, CEDAR, crunch base and the University of California Berkeley. 3scale scale has office in Barcelona and San Francisco, and I want to formally welcome the 3scale associates to Red Hat. 
Next, we will be showcasing more of our portfolio of technologies, customer success stories and customer traction at the Red Hat Summit in San Francisco. Once again, we're expecting strong attendance in our premier user event, which is also one of the largest annual open source events. I hope many of you will be able to join us. In summary, we're excited about our strong start to the fiscal year. We remain optimistic about our outlook for the remainder of the year, as Frank will detail in a moment. As a final note, I want to thank all Red Hat associates around the globe for their innovative ideas and technologies that led Red Hat to being recognized by ST Times as a top 10 influencer in 2016 along with companies like Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft. ST Times publishes these companies are making their mark on the entire industry and whose work has made a significant impact on what others build, how they build it and ultimately, who uses it.

This enabled us to deliver results that exceeded our guidance across a number of metrics. At the same time, we continue to invest in our high-growth application development platforms and emerging technologies, which are responding to our customers needs, to enable cloud computing and digital transformation. 
Let me begin with the financial highlights of our Q1 performance. For a more detailed view of our results and reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to GAAP, please refer to our press release. I am pleased to announce total revenue of $568 million, above the high end of our guidance and representing growth of 18% in U.S. dollars and in constant currency on a year-on-year basis. In general, currency rate volatility has stabilized to a point where many of our USD and constant currency growth rates are essentially equivalent. So for this quarter, I will keep my prepared remarks focused on our reported U.S. dollar results where appropriate, and you will find a table of constant currency results in our press release. 
Subscription revenue continue to be the largest driver of our growth at $502 million for the quarter, an increase of 18% year-over-year. This renewable revenue stream now constitutes 88% of total revenue, providing a large base for future renewals and up selling opportunities for new technologies. We continue to drive high growth across our technology portfolio. Subscription revenue for infrastructure-related offerings was $403 million, an increase of 14% year-over-year. Our application development-related and emerging technology subscription revenue was $98 million, an increase of 39% year-over-year. Application development-related and emerging technologies revenue was approximately 17% of total revenue, up 260 basis points from the year-ago quarter. 
We are pleased to see that we have reached an annualized run rate of nearly $400 million a year as customers continue to adopt our portfolio of technologies like Middleware, the Red Hat OpenStack platform, OpenShift, cloud management and storage. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $124 million grew 9% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating margin was 21.8%. This is consistent with a 22% operating margin direction we provided on our last call, which included the investment in the Ansible acquisition. As a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjusts for noncash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combinations. 
Using our non-GAAP estimated annual effective tax rate it of 27%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.50, consistent with our guidance and up 14% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2.1 billion. We returned $66 million to shareholders in the quarter through the repurchase of approximately 900,000 shares of stock. Given our strong cash position, ability to generate meaningful cash flow and firm belief in our long-term prospects for the business, I am pleased to announce a new $1 billion stock repurchase program that will replace our previous $500 million plan. We believe this new plan will contribute further value for our shareholders. 
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $1.7 billion, an increase of $256 million or 18% over the same quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, total deferred revenue was up 17%. The total change in deferred revenue from our cash flow statement, which neutralizes most of the impact of currency fluctuation decreased $46 million compared to the end of 2016. This follows the pattern we've seen historically in Q1. Operating cash flow of $232 [ph] million for the quarter was up 8% year-over-year and was at a record for Q1. Strong collections contributed to these results with FX adjusted days sales outstanding at 56 days, that's down from 59 days in the year-ago quarter. 
In addition, during the first quarter, we made the decision to adopt Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, earlier than required relating to accounting of stock compensation. The impact operating cash flow in Q1 FY '17 was a benefit of $8 million and it was the benefit of $6 million when adjusting Q1 FY '16. In Q2, we currently expect this benefit to be only $1 million. Also, as scheduled with historical adjustments for ASU 2016-09 to FY '16 operating cash flows, can be found in the supplemental data presentation that we provided with this call. 
On a rolling 4-quarter [ph] basis, the billing proxy was $596 million, that's up 16% on a constant currency basis and 13% U.S. dollars year-over-year. The rolling 4 quarters billings proxies calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on a cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters. I will now review the metrics of business momentums and large deals in the quarter. 
Our geography saw a continued growth in bookings. This quarter, 60% of bookings came from the Americas, 21% from EMEA and 19% from Asia Pacific versus a 55-25-20 split in Q1 last year. Although some companies have pointed to geographic weakness, we continue to see strong growth across all our major geographies. In fact, while EMEA's relative contribution to our total bookings was lower than the prior year, it's underlying momentum was strong. In Q1, the EMEA sales team was faced with a smaller number of multi-year deals in its renewable when compared to Q1 of last year. There was a focus on driving significant new business and a higher growth rate in single year bookings. Congratulations to the EMEA team on great execution in Q1 and renewing existing deals and growing a new business. 
The Q1 route to market mix was 78% from the channel, 22% from our direct sales force compared to 75%, 25% [ph] split in Q1 of last year. Our proxy for bookings duration was 21 months, which was in line with historic duration. Within our top largest deals, all of them were $1 million or more dollars and we had record 6 deals in Q1 that were in excess of $5 million and of these [indiscernible] 2 were over $10 million. This was a record first quarter for large deals with 45 deals over $1 million, which was up 50% year-over-year. This traction highlights Red Hat's growing strategic importance in our customers data centers and our talented sales team ability to land and expand our wallet share of IT dollars. Cross-selling was strong with a record-high of 80% of the top 30 deals, including 1 or more components from our group of application development and emerging technologies offerings.

With our renewal business, we once again renewed all of the top 25 deals that we were expecting. The total subscription value of these top 25 renewals was approximately 105% of the prior value. Similar to what we experienced a couple of years ago, we had a -- we had several large U.S. government deals that renewed at approximately 100% of their original values, weighing on this metric in Q1. Excluding these government renewals, the subscription value of our other top renewals was approximately 110%. It's important to note that overall, our government sales team delivered double-digit growth across the federal segment in Q1. 
Now we'd like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and the impact of the acquisition of 3scale and foreign exchange. We are reaffirming our full year revenue guidance of $2,380,000,000 to $2,420,000,000, up approximately 18% in U.S. dollars at the high end of the range. We are modestly increasing operating margin to approximately 23% due to a $5 million impact from the 3scale acquisition. We are reaffirming the operating cash flow in a range from $800 million to $820 million. We are also adjusting our target for full year non-GAAP earnings per share to approximately $2.19 to $2.23 per share, assuming a 27% non-GAAP annual effective tax rate, approximately a $1 million to $2 million per quarter forecast for other income and investment related to 3scale, which is approximately $0.03 per share. 
For Q2 specifically, this implies the following outlook: we expect revenue to be in the range of $587 million to $593 million, which is up 18% in U.S. dollars at the high end of the range. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 22.8% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.54 per share, which includes a 1 penny impact for the 3scale acquisition in Q2. Consistent with prior practices, I will not forecast quarterly cash flow. But I will note that its important to consider that the AR balances to reflect the quarter over quarter change to cash flow. Also, although payments can fluctuation in the quarter, I would also anticipates AP balances to be approximately flat to slightly up with Q1 balances. 
Overall, we are very pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter and we believe we are off to a very good start for FY '17. We are excited about the company's long-term growth opportunity as we are uniquely positioned to further drive the adoption of open source technologies as IT organizations transition their application development and infrastructure to a hybrid cloud environment. Finally, we look forward to seeing many of you next week in San Francisco for the Red Hat Summit and for our Analyst Day on Thursday, June 30. 
Operator, I would now like to turn it back over to you for the first question."

I'm wondering what you consider the cloud business and the emerging portfolio that you have, and you look forward to the next few years, do you see the potential to maintain roughly that type of a mid teens glide path? Or if you don't want to comment on that, could you just walk us through what you think would determine whether the next move there is slightly higher slightly lower."

So the issue is, as these other businesses that continue to grow a lot faster, A, can they continue that momentum? And can RHEL continue to grow in the low double-digits? And if so, at some point, those other businesses will rate the overall growth rate up, not down. I think we feel confident the RHEL can continue to grow double-digit. I think the other businesses, we're confident can continue to grow especially in things like OpenStack and OpenShift and storage continue to scale. And so as we do that, you put that together, I feel pretty good about the weighted average of those, keeping our growth rate where it is or taking it up, not down. I think there's better odds of it accelerating than decelerating. Again, as you start to see the other products become a larger percentage of the total and those are obviously, have a lot faster growth rate."

You start -- you put applications on it and you grow with it over time. So the deployments are still, 5 figures, may be 6 figures and they'll scale when the applications go there. So it's still -- this is not having a significant impact on our revenue. But you can kind of start to see the traction that as the application portfolios that are running on the structured growth, we'll see it impacting over the next year or 2."

As we've gotten bigger and we've become a larger point park portion of their infrastructure, these structures get really, really big. And as companies get more used to subscription type models, they are becoming more comfortable with the kind of pay as you go model. And so now, they pay upfront, they want a discount. And we have plenty of cash in the bank as Frank talked about. We're not going to do abnormal things to get someone to pay upfront. And so now, we still have multi year commitments, but there are people who are less likely to pay upfront as those deals have gotten bigger and people got more used to pay-as-you-go type models.

If you look at containers, 100% are on Linux because it's a Linux-native kind of technology. So as you start seeing so many of these new technologies, they're 100% on Linux. So Linux overall are taking share vis-à-vis Windows and UNIX because that's where the new workloads are going. So you wouldn't see within Linux, how is our share doing. And I've not seen a lot of customers that have actually transition from RHEL to free. So we feel very, very good about how we're doing in that environment. Obviously, as these contracts get big, they go up a further level in purchasing. And so we have more negotiation on some of those as you would expect as they get bigger.

Developers are one kind of low friction and they want to be able to try things quickly. And so even LEAP have now have developer subscription that's free, so people can use our -- developers can use our production quality products for free. So again, I think as we go forward as the dollars get bigger, of course, people are going to go through vendor management product to try to get the best possible deal.

The reason that we identified the government deals was to kind of give a sense for the impact that they had. And as I said in the earlier comments, we do tend to see that from time to time from some of the government deals side, that's why I wanted to put that aside. As far as the 110%, we can continue to see a very good response from customers as it relates to our emerging technologies. And this year in particular, we're emphasizing that even more, and we've been making much more investment in our sales organization and supporting customers around that. So the 100% that you mentioned in previous quarters were sort of tied to 120. I don't see that as being an issue. It's just something that may be more specific to some of the agreements and the contracts that we had in Q1. We're optimistic as far as the pipeline and the types of transactions and the focus that we have around the emerging technology as we continue throughout FY '17."

Some people buy that product and therefore, they stay flat and therefore, they get a separate deal to grow and others, it's kind of a one big thing. So there's nothing in the trend that looks like any change from the past. I feel pretty good about continuing growth in those renewables. Relating to our share on Amazon or on cloud in general. Again, as we talked about in the past. Certainly, if you looked at our overall share, it is lower on cloud than it is on-premise. But tying to tease out how much of that is nature of workload versus something different about the cloud deployment model is one that's a lot harder to break out. When we talk to customers and they talk about moving workload from on-prem to cloud, the RHEL value proposition is really, really strong because of the kind of common technology, common support model. So we feel like our kind of share of production workload on cloud is -- feels like it's as high as our share of production workload on premise. It's harder for us to have quite as much visibility as we don't see all that. In the same way that, that in dev and test environments, people will pay for RHEL typically there. I think that same thing happens on cloud. And so there are more dev and test type workload on cloud. But as we're seeing more production workloads move to cloud, we're seeing continued growth and accelerating kind of our business on the cloud provider. So we feel pretty good that the value proposition holds up. We haven't seen anything or any kind of customers saying, oh, I'm moving to cloud, so I'm not buying RHEL. Our customers as they move to cloud or they're using our stack there as well."

Recognize, containers they are a form of virtualization, but what they basically do is slice the operating system between the kernel space and user space, right? So all of the user space aspect of the operating system are in a container. And the reason we actually see this as a positive driver of our business is first off,l containers in general are 100% Linux. Containers are not -- do not run in Windows, they run in Azure today in -- of Linux running on Azure. So first off, Linux gets a 100% of those today, at some point, I'm sure Microsoft will support it, but my guess is it will be like Hadoop where it's 1% or less of those workload. So first off, we get all of it. And within that, the cost is you have the user space in container then 2 things. First off, you need to make sure that you are life cycle managing that. And so most of the big security vulnerabilities that happen in Linux, the bash bug et cetera, happen in user space. So it becomes extremely important to have an operating system vendor that can push updates into the user space to the container. And Red Hat is particularly good at that. So as containers go into production, as ISVs want to deliver their applications in a container format, unless they want to go into the Linux business and develop their own Linux security response team to patch and push those updates, the role of the Linux gets to be even more important, and so we actually see containers the great opportunity for us to continue to differentiate around A, the kernel space and the user space being consistent so having the same host and technology in container itself. And then secondly, just the ability to lifecycle manage against that. So containers overall are good for Linux because it helps us our overall share versus Windows, and within that, we think we have a definitely differentiated position given our position in the. So that's why we can see continued double-digit growth in general than the LS technology, which includes containers."

We are, as I talked about before, if I step back with the acquisition and I look at the investment portfolio, we have needs within the company, related to a lot of the emerging technologies as you continue to start see that ramp from both engineering and then also from a go-to-market perspective. The opportunity we feel is there, the investment required especially we have leadtimes that can go from 12 to 24 months as far as working with customers. We feel the investment to make in those areas is extremely critical for us to drive the growth that Jim referred to earlier that we're looking forward to, not only this year but in the next several years. And so we're also trying to put that in perspective to try to make sure that we can balance it as it relates margin. We know that investors are always interested in looking at the operating margin and how that's performing. So it's difficult when we also want to look at an acquisition especially in the near term. That's not the same we expect this to be dilutive forever. Jim talked about Ansible and how we strongly feel about the performance so far. So as these acquisitions start to show some traction, especially as part of Red Hat, we expect them to start to drive not only upside, but also improving the bottom line. But in the near term, with all the other competing priority that we have in the company and an acquisition or 2 like we have done right now, it's hard to kind of balance that within the overall portfolio. If you step back and look at the margin, I did some analysis earlier and if you go back to FY -- the operating margin, if you look at FY '15, we had about 23% and if you adjust both '16 and '17 looking at how much we're spending for the acquisition of Ansible and 3scale, we're actually look at 22% [ph], in '15, 23.6% [ph], in '16 and if you look at the guidance that we provided for FY '17 adjusted it will be about 23.6 as well. So despite all the needs that we have internally, we're kind of holding the margins and therefore, adding a bit, I think for both of those acquisitions is reasonable."

The piece where we sometimes lose data is our business through OEMs. If somebody buys a server with a 3 years SKU, runs RHEL for 3 years,l that has RHEL on there, that first one would've been considered not renewed and then the new server would be new business. So if you leave that out and you look at what we have visibility into, our renewal rates has increased pretty consistently over the last several years. How much of that's dynamic a larger deal versus how much of that is we've been focused on it, especially we have a very high renewal rates of larger deals, right? Very high close to 100% for our larger customers. As you go down to some of the smaller customers, it's been lower and we've had more of a focus on that. We worked with partners, we built programs with our distributors, so our renewal rate continues to expand. If your question though, I'd say a lot of that is because of better execution, in terms of just strategic dynamic around that I guess, we get to be a bit more strategic to people, that probably helps as well, but the renewal rate is still in the 80s, but it continues to creep up."

And the majority of the rev that we've seen has been more -- hey, I'm adding net new workloads and I'm going to do that on rev because it's cheaper than the alternative. But we haven't had the normal, I would say kind of rip and replace share take that we have of web screen logic to JBoss or Windows or a Linux to RHEL. The big question, I think we have in all of our minds is, will that change as OpenStack continues to grow when people say, I have a set of workloads that aren't really immutable to OpenStack. Once you have KVM as the underlying hypervisor, and you have a set of management tools that look kind of similar across, that seems to be what's driving incremental rev growth at this point.

Digital transformation and cloud computing are changing the way companies compete in virtually every industry today. Organizations that rapidly embrace agile IT technology are succeeding as industry innovation accelerates around them. With our open source-based technologies, we are helping customers to capture the business benefits associated with this rapid rate of change. Strong adoption of our technologies is evidenced in our financial results, where we delivered our highest Q1 total revenue growth rate in U.S. dollars in 3 years, grew both Q1 total revenue and subscription revenue at 18% year-over-year and had strong sales execution that led to a record number of yields over $1 million in a Q1.
With that overview, let me discuss some of our recent business and technology highlights from the quarter. Starting with OpenShift, our PaaS solution, where we made a number of recent announcements. First, our OpenShift Commons membership crossed 200 organizations from over 40 countries and includes Global 2000 enterprises, ISVs and SaaS providers, system integrator partners and public sector institutions. OpenShift Commons is an open community that encourages collaboration, contribution and best practices for open source technologies in PaaS and containers.
Second, we announced the next generation of OpenShift Online that was made available for -- in developer preview this week. OpenShift Online has had over 3 million applications deployed to it and has now been updated to become the industry's first multi-tenant Docker container and Kubernetes powered public cloud platform.
And lastly, our OpenShift technology won a CODiE award for best Platform-as-a-Service for a second year in a row. This is a prestigious peer-reviewed award presented by the SIIA. OpenShift also received InfoWorld's 2016 Technology of the Year earlier in the year for a second time.
As a headline sponsor of the OpenStack Summit in Austin, we announced the general availability of 2 new technologies that help bridge the gap between development and operations teams at the scale of -- for cloud computing. First, we launched Cloud Suite that is designed to offer an integrated hybrid cloud stack with a container application platform, a scalable infrastructure based on OpenStack and unified management tools.
Second and in conjunction with the event, we released the general availability of the latest version of our OpenStack distribution, Red Hat OSP 8, which is based on the OpenStack Community Liberty release. A co-engineered solution, Red Hat OSP 8 integrates the foundation of the RHEL with Red Hat's OpenStack technology to form a production-ready cloud platform. Red Hat's core OpenStack offering now natively includes additional automation for upgrades and updates, infrastructure and workload management and software-defined storage.
Our new offerings further solidify Red Hat's early leadership position in OpenStack. This is exciting given the considerable growth in OpenStack interest level among enterprises, growing levels of customer adoption and further signs of market maturation as more enterprises are moving to live production each quarter. Importantly, we believe that Red Hat OSP is increasingly being recognized as the gold standard for large-scale production OpenStack deployments.
We have hundreds of production deployments across the globe. And even more proof of concepts are underway, including recent wins with Cambridge University, Paddy Power Betfair, Fastweb, NASA JPL and Produban, the IT services division of Santander bank. A broadening group of enterprise and service provider customers that have deployed Red Hat OpenStack platform include Verizon and C.A. Mobile and a strong ecosystem of industry leaders that have rallied around RHEL or Red Hat OSP for a transformative network function virtualization and software-defined networking deployments. 
Of course, Red Hat OSP and Cloud Suite are just part of a portfolio of technologies that customers are deploying to address their digital transformation needs. To this point, we had an important new win in Q1 with a global financial services provider, BBVA, that speaks to the power and breadth and depth of Red Hat's offerings. This global strategic collaboration with BBVA establishes Red Hat as one of their priority partners. The partnership is designed to focus on business and technical alignment, enabling BBVA to accelerate innovation, manage the growth of financial transactions on digital devices and deliver digital banking services through its global customers.
Moreover, new IaaS and PaaS-based platforms, utilizing Red Hat technology will enable BBVA to focus on developing applications that can support the heavy demands of those global digital banking services and provide customers with the service and information they want when it is needed.
BBVA is a fantastic example of a global enterprise that has turned to an open source-based cloud solution and Red Hat in particular to drive business innovation through technology. We're thrilled to collaborate with them on this journey to transform their business and to help them reach their goal of becoming the world's first truly digital global bank.
More broadly, we believe that Red Hat is seeing and winning a growing number of large deal opportunities due to the breadth and depth of our stack. As customers move workloads to the cloud and develop innovative new applications, they are turning to open source-based solutions to provide them with speed, agility, security, reliability and enterprise features. They're turning to Red Hat, and we believe we are well positioned to benefit as organizations invest in private, hybrid and public clouds.
Today, we announced the acquisition of a JBoss middleware partner, 3scale. 3scale was founded in 2007 with a goal of enabling organizations of all sizes to successfully create, manage and use API in a web-enabled world where APIs are paramount. It offers a hybrid cloud-based API management solution that separates the cloud management layer from the API gateway, offering customers more flexibility, performance and scale. The company powers more than 700 APIs for more than 500 organizations across many industries, including Coldwell Banker, Johnson Controls, SITA, CrunchBase and the University of California Berkeley. 3scale has offices in Barcelona and San Francisco, and I want to formally welcome the 3scale associates to Red Hat.
Next week, we will be showcasing more of our portfolio of technologies, customer success stories and customer traction at the Red Hat Summit in San Francisco. Once again, we're expecting strong attendance in our premier user event, which is also one of the largest annual open source events. I hope many of you will be able to join us.
In summary, we are excited about our strong start to the fiscal year. We remain optimistic about our outlook for the remainder of the year, as Frank will detail in a moment.
As a final note, I want to thank all Red Hat associates around the globe for the innovative ideas and technologies that led Red Hat to being recognized by SD Times as a top 10 influencer in 2016 along with companies like Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft. SD Times publishes that these companies are making their mark on the entire industry and whose work has made a significant impact on what others build, how they build it and ultimately who uses it.
With that let me turn the call over to Frank."

This enabled us to deliver results that exceeded our guidance across a number of metrics. At the same time, we continued to invest in our high-growth application development platform and emerging technologies, which are responding to our customers' needs to enable cloud computing and digital transformation.
Let me begin with the financial highlights of our Q1 performance. For a more detailed view of our results and reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to GAAP, please refer to our press release. I am pleased to announce total revenue of $568 million, above the high end of our guidance and representing growth of 18% in U.S. dollars and in constant currency on a year-on-year basis. In general, currency rate volatility has stabilized to a point where many of our USD and constant currency growth rates are essentially equivalent. So for this quarter, I will keep my prepared remarks focused on our reported U.S. dollar results where appropriate, and you will find a table of constant currency results in our press release.
Subscription revenue continue to be the largest driver of our growth at $502 million for the quarter, an increase of 18% year-over-year. This renewable revenue stream now constitutes 88% of total revenue, providing a large base for future renewals and upselling opportunities for new technologies. We continued to drive high growth across our technology portfolio. Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $403 million, an increase of 14% year-over-year. Our application development-related and emerging technology subscription revenue was $98 million, an increase of 39% year-over-year. Application development-related and emerging technologies revenue was approximately 17% of total revenue, up 260 basis points from the year-ago quarter.
We are pleased to see that we have reached an annualized run rate of nearly $400 million a year as customers continue to adopt our portfolio of technologies like Middleware, the Red Hat OpenStack platform, OpenShift, cloud management and storage.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $124 million grew 9% year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating margin was 21.8%. This is consistent with the 22% operating margin direction we provided on our last call, which included the investment in the Ansible acquisition. As a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjusts for noncash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combinations.
Using our non-GAAP estimated annual effective tax rate of 27%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.50, consistent with our guidance and up 14% year-over-year.
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2.1 billion. We returned $66 million to shareholders in the quarter through the repurchase of approximately 900,000 shares of stock. Given our strong cash position, ability to generate meaningful cash flow and firm belief in our long-term prospects for the business, I am pleased to announce a new $1 billion stock repurchase program that will replace our previous $500 million plan. We believe this new plan will contribute further value for our shareholders.
Total deferred revenue at quarter-end was $1.7 billion, an increase of $256 million or 18% over the same quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, total deferred revenue was up 17%. The total change in deferred revenue from our cash flow statement, which neutralizes most of the impact of currency fluctuation, decreased $46 million compared to the end of 2016. This follows the pattern we've seen historically in Q1.
Operating cash flow of $232 million for the quarter was up 8% year-over-year and was at a record for a Q1. Strong collections contributed to these results with FX-adjusted days sales outstanding at 56 days. That's down from 59 days in the year-ago quarter.
In addition, during the first quarter, we made the decision to adopt Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 earlier than required related to accounting for stock compensation. The impact to operating cash flow in Q1 FY '17 was a benefit of $8 million, and it was a benefit of $6 million when adjusting Q1 FY '16. In Q2, we currently expect this benefit to be only $1 million. Also, a schedule with historical adjustments for ASU 2016-09 to FY '16 operating cash flows can be found in the supplemental data presentation that we provided with this call.
On a rolling 4 quarters basis, the billings proxy was $596 million. That's up 16% on a constant currency basis and 13% U.S. dollars year-over-year. The rolling 4 quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters. 
I will now review the metrics for business momentum and large deals in the quarter. Our geographies saw a continued growth in bookings. This quarter, 60% of bookings came from the Americas, 21% from EMEA and 19% from Asia Pacific versus a 55-25-20 split in Q1 of last year. Although some companies have pointed to geographic weakness, we continue to see strong growth across all our major geographies. In fact, while EMEA's relative contribution to our total bookings was lower than the prior year, its underlying momentum was strong. In Q1, the EMEA sales team was faced with a smaller number of multi-year deals in its renewable base when compared to Q1 of last year. There was a focus on driving significant new business and a higher growth rate in single-year bookings. Congratulations to the EMEA team on great execution in Q1 in renewing existing deals and growing a new business.
The Q1 route-to-market mix was 78% from the channel, 22% from our direct sales force compared to 75-25 percent split in Q1 of last year. Our proxy for bookings duration was 21 months, which was in line with historic duration.
Within our top largest deals, all of them were $1 million or more dollars. And we had record 6 deals in Q1 that were in excess of $5 million, and of these deals, 2 were over $10 million. This was a record first quarter for large deals with 45 deals over $1 million, which was up 50% year-over-year. This traction highlights Red Hat's growing strategic importance in our customers' data centers and our talented sales team's ability to land and expand our wallet share of IT dollars.
Cross-selling was strong with a record-high of 80% of the top 30 deals, including one or more components from our group of application development and emerging technologies offerings.
Mainstream customers in sectors such as health care, industrial and agricultural products and retail were the top verticals, followed by government and financial services customers.
With our renewal business, we once again renewed all of the top 25 deals that we were expecting. The total subscription value of these top 25 renewals was approximately 105% of the prior value. Similar to what we experienced a couple of years ago, we had a -- we had several large U.S. government deals that renewed at approximately 100% of their original values weighing on this metric for Q1. Excluding these government renewals, the subscription value of our other top renewals was approximately 110%. It's important to note that overall, our government sales team delivered double-digit growth across the federal segment in Q1.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and the impact of the acquisition of 3scale and foreign exchange. We are reaffirming our full year revenue guidance of $2,380,000,000 to $2,420,000,000, up approximately 18% in U.S. dollars at the high end of the range. We are modestly decreasing operating margin to approximately 23% due to a $5 million impact from the 3scale acquisition. We are reaffirming the operating cash flow in the range from $800 million to $820 million. We are also adjusting our target for full year non-GAAP earnings per share to approximately $2.19 to $2.23 per share, assuming a 27% non-GAAP annual effective tax rate, approximately a $1 million to $2 million per quarter forecast for other income and the investment related to 3scale, which is approximately $0.03 per share.
For Q2 specifically, this implies the following outlook. We expect revenue to be in the range of $587 million to $593 million, which is up 18% in U.S. dollars at the high end of the range. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 22.8% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.54 per share, which includes a $0.01 impact for the 3scale acquisition in Q2. Consistent with prior practices, I will not forecast quarterly cash flow. But I will note that it is important to consider that -- the AR balances to reflect the quarter-over-quarter change to cash flow. Also, although payments can fluctuate in a quarter, I would also anticipate AP balances to be approximately flat to slightly up with Q1 balances.
Overall, we are very pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter, and we believe we are off to a very good start for FY '17. We are excited about the company's long-term growth opportunity as we are uniquely positioned to further drive the adoption of open source technologies as IT organizations transition their application development and infrastructure to a hybrid cloud environment.
Finally, we look forward to seeing many of you next week in San Francisco for the Red Hat Summit and for our Analyst Day on Thursday, June 30.

I'm wondering, when you consider the cloud business and the emerging portfolio that you have and you look forward to the next few years, do you see the potential to maintain roughly that type of a mid-teens glide path? Or if you don't want to comment on that, could you just walk us through what you think would determine whether the next move there is slightly higher slightly lower?"

RHEL continues to grow in the teens kind of nicely. And the other businesses, even as they scale and get pretty large, continue to grow in the high 30s to high 40s-ish percent. So the issue is as those other businesses that continue to grow a lot faster, A, can they continue that momentum? And can RHEL continue to grow in the low double digits? And if so, at some point, those other businesses will weight the overall growth rate up, not down. I think we feel confident that RHEL can continue to grow double digit. I think the other businesses, we're confident, can continue to grow especially if things like OpenStack and OpenShift and storage continue to scale. And so as we do that, you put that together, I feel pretty good about the weighted average of those, keeping our growth rate where it is or taking it up, not down. I think there's better odds of it accelerating than decelerating, again, as you start to see the other products become a larger percentage of the total, and those are obviously in a lot faster growth rate."

In terms of revenue, it's still -- immaterial might be too strong a word, but it's still quite small. Again, even when you put something in production, nobody buys a $1 million or rarely do you see a $1 million initial deployment of OpenStack. You start -- you put applications on it and you grow with it over time. So the deployments are still 5 figures, maybe 6 figures, and they'll scale as the applications go on there. So it's still -- this is not having a significant impact on our revenue. But you can kind of start to see the traction that as the application portfolios that are running on the infrastructure grows, we'll see it impacting over the next year or 2."

I touched about this a little bit in Q4. It used to be when our large deals weren't quite as large as they are now, people often paid upfront because they had budget for a project and they had the budget that year and they paid upfront even though for us we recognize that revenue over time over multiple years. As we've gotten bigger and we've become a larger portion of their infrastructure, these numbers get really, really, really big. And as companies get more used to subscription type models, they're becoming more comfortable with kind of pay-as-you-go model. And so now to pay upfront, they want a discount. And we have plenty of cash in the bank, as Frank talked about. We're not going to do abnormal things to get someone to pay upfront. And so now, we still have multi-year commitments, but there are people who are less likely to pay upfront as those deals have gotten bigger and people have gotten more used to pay-as-you-go type models. So I think that's just their -- just those trends worked slightly against people paying the outyear portion."

But the majority of the share take that we're seeing is that Linux wins the majority of net new workloads, right? So if you look at something like Hadoop, I think it would be very, very, very rare to find a Hadoop workload that's running on Windows, right? It's 90 something percent Linux. If you look at containers, 100% are on Linux because it's a Linux-native kind of technology. So as you start seeing so many of these new technologies, they're 100% on Linux. So Linux overall is taking share vis-à-vis Windows and UNIX because that's where the new workloads are going. So you didn't say within Linux how is our share doing. And I have not seen a lot of customers that have actually transitioned from RHEL to free. So we feel very, very good about how we're doing in that environment. Obviously, as these contracts get big, they go up a further level in purchasing. And so we have more negotiation on some of those, as you would expect, as they get bigger. But we have a pretty strong value proposition. The one area I would say you see particular pushback would be of developers. Developers want kind of low friction, and they want to be able to try things quickly. And so even we now have developer subscription that's free, so people can use our -- developers can use our production-quality products for free. So again, I think as we go forward, as the dollars get bigger, of course, people are going to go through a vendor management perspective to try to get the best possible deal. But so far, again, we haven't lost anyone. We talked about all our renewals renew, and they renew it more than 100%. So we feel good about how we're doing there."

And Heather, obviously, when you take out the Fed deals, which are particularly heavy in Q1, you just get some lumpiness around which deals and what are they. And some people buy by project, and therefore, those stay flat and you get a separate deal to grow and others kind of is one big thing. And so -- but there's nothing in the trend that looks like any change from the past. I feel pretty good about continuing growth in those renewals. Related to our share on Amazon or on cloud in general, again, as we talked about in the past, certainly if you looked at our overall share, it is lower on cloud than it is on premise. But trying to tease out how much of that is nature of workload versus something different about the cloud deployment model is one that's a lot harder to break out. When we talk to customers and they talk about moving workload from on-prem to cloud, the RHEL value proposition is really, really strong because of the kind of common technology, common support model. So we feel like our kind of share of production workload on cloud is -- feels like it's as high as our share of production workload on premise. It's harder for us to have quite as much visibility because we don't see all that. In the same way that in dev and test environments, people don't pay for RHEL typically there, I think the same thing happens on cloud. And so there are more dev and test-ish type workloads on cloud. But as we're seeing more production workloads move to cloud, we're seeing continuing growth and accelerating kind of our business on the cloud provider. So we feel pretty good that the value proposition holds up. We haven't seen anything or any kind of customers saying, ""Oh, I'm moving to cloud, so I'm not buying RHEL."" Our customers, as they move to cloud, are using our stack there as well."

I'm not sure if I fully answered your question. If not, next week, we can go through that in a fair amount of detail."

Recognize, containers, they are a form of virtualization, but what they basically do is slice the operating system between the kernel space and user space, right? So all of the user space aspects of the operating system are in a container. And the reason we actually see this as a positive driver of our business is, first off, containers in general are 100% Linux. Containers are not -- do not run in Windows. They run in Azure today in -- on Linux running on Azure. So first off, Linux gets a 100% of those today. At some point, I'm sure Microsoft will support it. But my guess is it will be like Hadoop where it's 1% or less of those workload. So first off, we get all of it. And then within that, because it is -- you have the user space in the container, then 2 things. First off, you need to make sure that you are life cycle managing that. And so most of the big security vulnerabilities that have happened in Linux, the Bash bug, et cetera, happen in user space. So it becomes extremely important to have an operating system vendor that can push updates into the user space to the container. And Red Hat is particularly good at that. So as containers go into production, as ISVs want to deliver their applications in a containerized format, unless they want to go into the Linux business and develop their own Linux security response team to patch and push those updates, the role of the Linux vendor gets to be even more important. So we actually see containers as a great opportunity for us to continue to differentiate around, A, kernel space and user space being consistent, so having the same host and technology in container itself; and then secondly, just the ability to life cycle manage against that. So containers overall are good for Linux because it helps us grow overall share versus Windows, and then within that, we think we have a definitely differentiated position given our position in the OS. So that's why we can see continued double-digit growth in general in the OS technology, which includes containers."

We are -- as I talked about before, if I step back, separate from the acquisitions and look at the investment portfolio, we have needs within the company related to a lot of the emerging technologies as we continue to start see that ramp both from an engineering and then also from a go-to-market perspective. The opportunity we feel is there, the investment required and especially when you have lead times that can go from 12 to 24 months as far as working with customers. We feel the investment to make in those areas is extremely critical for us to drive the growth that Jim referred to earlier that we're looking forward to not only this year but in the next several years. And so we're also kind of putting that in perspective of trying to make sure that we can balance it as it relates to margin. We know that investors are always interested in looking at the operating margin and how that's performing. So it's difficult when we want to also look at an acquisition, especially in the near term. It's not to say that we expect this to be dilutive forever. And Jim talked about Ansible and how we strong we feel about the performance so far. So as these acquisitions start to show some traction, especially as part of Red Hat, we expect them to start to drive not only upside but also improvement in the bottom line. But in the near term, with all the other competing priority that we have in the company, if you add an acquisition or 2 like we have done right now, it's hard to kind of balance that within the overall portfolio. If you step back and look at the margin, I did some analysis earlier, and if you go back to FY -- the operating margin, you look at FY '15, we had about 23%. And if you adjust both '16 and '17, looking at how much we're spending for the acquisition of Ansible and 3scale, we're actually looking at about 23% in '15, 23.6% in '16. And if you look at the guidance that we provided for FY '17 adjusted, it will be about 23.6% as well. So despite all of the needs that we have internally, we're kind of holding the margins. And therefore, adding a bit, I think, for both of those acquisitions is reasonable."

So there are a couple of issues in measuring that. Actually, we believe it's a fair amount better than that. The piece where we sometimes lose data is our business through OEMs. If somebody buys a server with a 3-year SKU, runs RHEL for 3 years, throws away the server and buys another one that has RHEL on there, that first one would have been considered not renewed and then the new server would be new business. So if you leave that out and you look at what we have visibility into, our renewal rates have increased pretty consistently over the last several years. How much of that is dynamic and larger deal versus how much of that is we've been focused on it, especially -- we have a very high renewal rate on larger deals, right? Very high, close to 100% for our larger customers. As you go down to some of the smaller customers, it's been lower and we've had more of a focus on that. We've worked with partners. We've built programs with our distributors. So our renewal rate continues to expand. If your question though -- I'd say a lot of that is because of better execution. In terms of just strategic dynamic around that, I -- yes, we get to be more strategic to people. That probably helps as well. But the renewal rate is still in the 80s, but it continues to creep up."

But frankly, a lot of people had other issues to worry about. We're comfortable with their VMware infrastructure, and so we didn't get the same share take that we got as we've gotten, say, in the Middleware portfolio where certainly UNIX is the Linux. And the majority of the RHEV that we've seen has been more, hey, I'm adding net new workload and I'm going to do that on RHEV because it's cheaper than the alternative. But we haven't had the normal, I would say, kind of rip and replace share take that we have of WebSphere and WebLogic to JBoss or Windows or UNIX and Linux to RHEL. The big question I think we have in all of our minds is, will that change as OpenStack continues to grow when people say, ""But I have a set of workloads that aren't really immutable to OpenStack""? Once you have KVM as the underlying hypervisor and you have a set of management tools that look kind of similar across, that seems to be what's driving incremental RHEV growth at this point. So yes, I think that, that can kind of continue to pick up nicely. That's where we're seeing pretty fast growth in that overall. I think that -- does hit an inflection point or not?

Digital transformation and cloud computing are changing the way companies compete in virtually every industry today. Organizations that rapidly embrace agile IT technology are succeeding as industry innovation accelerates around them. With our open source-based technologies, we are helping customers to capture the business benefits associated with this rapid rate of change. Strong adoption of our technologies is evidenced in our financial results, where we delivered our highest Q1 total revenue growth rate in U.S. dollars in 3 years, grew both Q1 total revenue and subscription revenue at 18% year-over-year and had strong sales execution that led to a record number of deals over $1 million in a Q1.
With that overview, let me discuss some of our recent business and technology highlights from the quarter. Starting with OpenShift, our PaaS solution, where we made a number of recent announcements. First, our OpenShift Commons membership crossed 200 organizations from over 40 countries and includes Global 2000 enterprises, ISVs and SaaS providers, system integrator partners and public sector institutions. OpenShift Commons is an open community that encourages collaboration, contribution and best practices for open source technologies in PaaS and containers.
Second, we announced the next generation of OpenShift Online that was made available for -- in developer preview this week. OpenShift Online has had over 3 million applications deployed to it and has now been updated to become the industry's first multi-tenant Docker container and Kubernetes-powered public cloud platform.
And lastly, our OpenShift technology won a CODiE award for best Platform-as-a-Service for a second year in a row. This is a prestigious peer-reviewed award presented by the SIIA. OpenShift also received InfoWorld's 2016 Technology of the Year earlier in the year for a second time.
As a headline sponsor of the OpenStack Summit in Austin, we announced the general availability of 2 new technologies that help bridge the gap between development and operations teams to scale for cloud computing. First, we launched Cloud Suite that is designed to offer an integrated hybrid cloud stack with a container application platform, a scalable infrastructure based on OpenStack and unified management tools.
Second and in conjunction with the event, we released the general availability of the latest version of our OpenStack distribution, Red Hat OSP 8, which is based on the OpenStack Community Liberty release. A co-engineered solution, Red Hat OSP 8 integrates the foundation of the RHEL with Red Hat's OpenStack technology to form a production-ready cloud platform. Red Hat's core OpenStack offering now natively includes additional automation for upgrades and updates, infrastructure and workload management and software-defined storage.
Our new offerings further solidify Red Hat's early leadership position in OpenStack. This is exciting given the considerable growth in OpenStack interest level among enterprises, growing levels of customer adoption and further signs of market maturation as more enterprises are moving to live production each quarter. Importantly, we believe that Red Hat OSP is increasingly being recognized as the gold standard for large-scale production OpenStack deployments.
We have hundreds of production deployments across the globe. And even more proof of concepts are underway, including recent wins with Cambridge University, Paddy Power Betfair, Fastweb, NASA JPL and Produban, the IT services division of Santander bank. A broadening group of enterprise and service provider customers that have deployed Red Hat OpenStack platform include Verizon and C.A. Mobile and a strong ecosystem of industry leaders that have rallied around RHEL or Red Hat OSP for a transformative network function virtualization and software-defined networking deployments. 
Of course, Red Hat OSP and Cloud Suite are just part of a portfolio of technologies that customers are deploying to address their digital transformation needs. To this point, we had an important new win in Q1 with a global financial services provider, BBVA, that speaks to the power and breadth and depth of Red Hat's offerings. This global strategic collaboration with BBVA establishes Red Hat as one of their priority partners. The partnership is designed to focus on business and technical alignment, enabling BBVA to accelerate innovation, manage the growth of financial transactions on digital devices and deliver digital banking services through its global customers.
Moreover, new IaaS and PaaS-based platforms utilizing Red Hat technology will enable BBVA to focus on developing applications that can support the heavy demands of those global digital banking services and provide customers with the service and information they want when it is needed.
BBVA is a fantastic example of a global enterprise that has turned to an open source-based cloud solution, and Red Hat in particular, to drive business innovation through technology. We're thrilled to collaborate with them on this journey to transform their business and to help them reach their goal of becoming the world's first truly digital global bank.
More broadly, we believe that Red Hat is seeing and winning a growing number of large deal opportunities due to the breadth and depth of our stack. As customers move workloads to the cloud and develop innovative new applications, they are turning to open source-based solutions to provide them with speed, agility, security, reliability and enterprise features. They're turning to Red Hat, and we believe we are well positioned to benefit as organizations invest in private, hybrid and public clouds.
Today, we announced the acquisition of a JBoss Middleware partner, 3scale. 3scale was founded in 2007 with the goal of enabling organizations of all sizes to successfully create, manage and use APIs in a web-enabled world where APIs are paramount. It offers a hybrid cloud-based API management solution that separates the cloud management layer from the API gateway, offering customers more flexibility, performance and scale. The company powers more than 700 APIs for more than 500 organizations across many industries, including Coldwell Banker, Johnson Controls, SITA, CrunchBase and the University of California Berkeley. 3scale has offices in Barcelona and San Francisco, and I want to formally welcome the 3scale associates to Red Hat.
Next week, we will be showcasing more of our portfolio of technologies, customer success stories and partner traction at the Red Hat Summit in San Francisco. Once again, we're expecting strong attendance at our premier user event, which is also one of the largest annual open source events. I hope many of you will be able to join us.
In summary, we are excited about our strong start to the fiscal year. We remain optimistic about our outlook for the remainder of the year, as Frank will detail in a moment.
As a final note, I want to thank all Red Hat associates around the globe for the innovative ideas and technologies that led Red Hat to being recognized by SD Times as a top 10 influencer in 2016 along with companies like Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft. SD Times publishes that these companies are making their mark on the entire industry and whose work has made a significant impact on what others build, how they build it and ultimately, who uses it.
With that let me turn the call over to Frank."

At the same time, we continued to invest in our high-growth application development platform and emerging technologies, which are responding to our customers' needs to enable cloud computing and digital transformation.
Let me begin with the financial highlights of our Q1 performance. For a more detailed view of our results and reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to GAAP, please refer to our press release. I am pleased to announce total revenue of $568 million, above the high end of our guidance and representing growth of 18% in U.S. dollars and in constant currency on a year-on-year basis. In general, currency rate volatility has stabilized to a point where many of our USD and constant currency growth rates are essentially equivalent. So for this quarter, I will keep my prepared remarks focused on our reported U.S. dollar results where appropriate, and you will find a table of constant currency results in our press release.
Subscription revenue continued to be the largest driver of our growth at $502 million for the quarter, an increase of 18% year-over-year. This renewable revenue stream now constitutes 88% of total revenue, providing a large base for future renewals and upselling opportunities for new technologies. We continued to drive high growth across our technology portfolio. Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $403 million, an increase of 14% year-over-year. Our application development-related and emerging technology subscription revenue was $98 million, an increase of 39% year-over-year. Application development-related and emerging technologies revenue was approximately 17% of total revenue, up 260 basis points from the year-ago quarter.
We are pleased to see that we have reached an annualized run rate of nearly $400 million a year as customers continue to adopt our portfolio of technologies like Middleware, the Red Hat OpenStack platform, OpenShift, cloud management and storage.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $124 million grew 9% year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating margin was 21.8%. This is consistent with the 22% operating margin direction we provided on our last call, which included the investment in the Ansible acquisition. As a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjusts for noncash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combinations.
Using our non-GAAP estimated annual effective tax rate of 27%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.50, consistent with our guidance and up 14% year-over-year.
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2.1 billion. We returned $66 million to shareholders in the quarter through the repurchase of approximately 900,000 shares of stock. Given our strong cash position, ability to generate meaningful cash flow and firm belief in our long-term prospects for the business, I am pleased to announce a new $1 billion stock repurchase program that will replace our previous $500 million plan. We believe this new plan will contribute further value for our shareholders.
Total deferred revenue at quarter-end was $1.7 billion, an increase of $256 million or 18% over the same quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, total deferred revenue was up 17%. The total change in deferred revenue from our cash flow statement, which neutralizes most of the impact of currency fluctuation, decreased $46 million compared to the end of 2016. This follows the pattern we've seen historically in Q1.
Operating cash flow of $232 million for the quarter was up 8% year-over-year and was at a record for a Q1. Strong collections contributed to these results with FX-adjusted days sales outstanding at 56 days. That's down from 59 days in the year-ago quarter.
In addition, during the first quarter, we made the decision to adopt Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 earlier than required related to accounting for stock compensation. The impact to operating cash flow in Q1 FY '17 was a benefit of $8 million, and it was a benefit of $6 million when adjusting Q1 FY '16. In Q2, we currently expect this benefit to be only $1 million. Also, a schedule with historical adjustments for ASU 2016-09 to FY '16 operating cash flows can be found in the supplemental data presentation that we provided with this call.
On a rolling 4-quarters basis, the billings proxy was $596 million. That's up 16% on a constant currency basis and 13% U.S. dollars year-over-year. The rolling 4 quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters. 
I will now review the metrics for business momentum and large deals in the quarter. Our geographies saw a continued growth in bookings. This quarter, 60% of bookings came from the Americas, 21% from EMEA and 19% from Asia Pacific versus a 55-25-20 split in Q1 of last year. Although some companies have pointed to geographic weakness, we continue to see strong growth across all our major geographies. In fact, while EMEA's relative contribution to our total bookings was lower than the prior year, its underlying momentum was strong. In Q1, the EMEA sales team was faced with a smaller number of multi-year deals in its renewal base when compared to Q1 of last year. There was a focus on driving significant new business and a higher growth rate in single-year bookings. Congratulations to the EMEA team on great execution in Q1 in renewing existing deals and growing their new business.
The Q1 route-to-market mix was 78% from the channel, 22% from our direct sales force compared to 75-25 percent split in Q1 of last year. Our proxy for bookings duration was 21 months, which was in line with historic duration.
Within our top largest deals, all of them were $1 million or more dollars. And we had record 6 deals in Q1 that were in excess of $5 million, and of these deals, 2 were over $10 million. This was a record first quarter for large deals with 45 deals over $1 million, which was up 50% year-over-year. This traction highlights Red Hat's growing strategic importance in our customers' data centers and our talented sales team's ability to land and expand our wallet share of IT dollars.
Cross-selling was strong with a record-high of 80% of the top 30 deals, including one or more components from our group of application development and emerging technologies offerings.
Mainstream customers in sectors such as health care, industrial and agricultural products and retail were the top verticals, followed by government and financial services customers.
With our renewal business, we once again renewed all of the top 25 deals that we were expecting. The total subscription value of these top 25 renewals was approximately 105% of the prior value. Similar to what we experienced a couple of years ago, we had a -- we had several large U.S. government deals that renewed at approximately 100% of their original values weighing on this metric for Q1. Excluding these government renewals, the subscription value of our other top renewals was approximately 110%. It's important to note that overall, our government sales team delivered double-digit growth across the federal segment in Q1.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and the impact of the acquisition of 3scale and foreign exchange. We are reaffirming our full year revenue guidance of $2,380,000,000 to $2,420,000,000, up approximately 18% in U.S. dollars at the high end of the range. We are modestly decreasing operating margin to approximately 23% due to a $5 million impact from the 3scale acquisition. We are reaffirming the operating cash flow in the range from $800 million to $820 million. We are also adjusting our target for full year non-GAAP earnings per share to approximately $2.19 to $2.23 per share, assuming a 27% non-GAAP annual effective tax rate; approximately a $1 million to $2 million per quarter forecast for other income and the investment related to 3scale, which is approximately $0.03 per share.
For Q2 specifically, this implies the following outlook. We expect revenue to be in the range of $587 million to $593 million, which is up 18% in U.S. dollars at the high end of the range. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 22.8% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.54 per share, which includes a $0.01 impact for the 3scale acquisition in Q2. Consistent with prior practices, I will not forecast quarterly cash flow. But I will note that it is important to consider that -- the AR balances to reflect the quarter-over-quarter change to cash flow. Also, although payments can fluctuate in a quarter, I would also anticipate AP balances to be approximately flat to slightly up with Q1 balances.
Overall, we are very pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter, and we believe we are off to a very good start for FY '17. We are excited about the company's long-term growth opportunity as we are uniquely positioned to further drive the adoption of open source technologies as IT organizations transition their application development and infrastructure to a hybrid cloud environment.
Finally, we look forward to seeing many of you next week in San Francisco for the Red Hat Summit and for our Analyst Day on Thursday, June 30.

So it has been very stable and consistent at an increasing scale. I'm wondering, when you consider the cloud business and the emerging portfolio that you have and you look forward to the next few years, do you see the potential to maintain roughly that type of a mid-teens glide path? Or if you don't want to comment on that, could you just walk us through what you think would determine whether the next move there is slightly higher or slightly lower?"

Look, I certainly don't want to get into providing any type of a long-term view, so let me just talk about kind of the components and how we think about it, right? RHEL continues to grow in the teens kind of nicely. And the other businesses, even as they scale and get pretty large, continue to grow in the high 30s to high 40s-ish percent. So the issue is as those other businesses that continue to grow a lot faster, A, can they continue that momentum? And can RHEL continue to grow in the low double digits? And if so, at some point, those other businesses will weight the overall growth rate up, not down. I think we feel confident that RHEL can continue to grow double digit. I think the other businesses we're confident can continue to grow especially if things like OpenStack and OpenShift and storage continue to scale. And so as we do that, you put that together, I feel pretty good about the weighted average of those, keeping our growth rate where it is or taking it up, not down. I think there's better odds of it accelerating than decelerating, again, as you start to see the other products become a larger percentage of the total, and those are obviously at a lot faster growth rate."

In terms of revenue, it's still -- immaterial might be too strong a word, but it's still quite small. Again, even when you put something in production, nobody buys a $1 million -- or rarely do you see a $1 million initial deployment of OpenStack. You start, you put applications on it and you grow with it over time. So the deployments are still 5 figures, maybe 6 figures, and they'll scale as the applications go on there. So it's still -- this is not having a significant impact on our revenue. But you can kind of start to see the traction that as the application portfolios that are running on the infrastructure grows, we'll see it impacting over the next year or 2."

As we've gotten bigger and we've become a larger portion of their infrastructure, these numbers get really, really, really big. And as companies get more used to subscription-type models, they're becoming more comfortable with kind of pay-as-you-go model. And so now to pay upfront, they want a discount. And we have plenty of cash in the bank, as Frank talked about. We're not going to do abnormal things to get someone to pay upfront. And so now, we still have multi-year commitments, but there are people who are less likely to pay upfront as those deals have gotten bigger and people have gotten more used to pay-as-you-go type models.

So if you look at something like Hadoop, I think it would be very, very, very rare to find a Hadoop workload that's running on Windows, right? It's 90-something percent Linux. If you look at containers, 100% are on Linux because it's a Linux-native kind of technology. So as you start seeing so many of these new technologies, they're 100% on Linux. So Linux overall is taking share vis-à-vis Windows and [indiscernible] UNIX, because that's where the new workloads are going. So you didn't say within Linux how is our share doing. And I have not seen a lot of customers that have actually transitioned from RHEL to free. So we feel very, very good about how we're doing in that environment. Obviously, as these contracts get big, they go up a further level in purchasing. And so we have more negotiation on some of those, as you would expect, as they get bigger. But we have a pretty strong value proposition. The one area I would say you see particular pushback would be with developers. Developers want kind of low friction, and they want to be able to try things quickly. And so even we now have developer subscription that's free, so people can use our -- developers can use our production-quality products for free. So again, I think as we go forward, as the dollars get bigger, of course, people are going to look from a vendor management perspective to try to get the best possible deal. But so far, again, we haven't lost anyone. We talked about all our renewals renew, and they renew it more than 100%. So we feel good about how we're doing there."

And so -- but there's nothing in the trend that looks like any change from the past. I feel pretty good about continuing growth in those renewals. Related to our share on Amazon or on cloud in general, again, as we talked about in the past, certainly if you looked at our overall share, it is lower on cloud than it is on premise. But trying to tease out how much of that is nature of workload versus something different about the cloud deployment model is one that's a lot harder to break out. When we talk to customers and they talk about moving workload from on-prem to cloud, the RHEL value proposition is really, really strong because of the kind of common technology, common support model. So we feel like our kind of share of production workload on cloud is -- feels like it's as high as our share of production workload on premise. It's harder for us to have quite as much visibility because we don't see all that. In the same way that in dev and test environments, people don't pay for RHEL typically there, I think the same thing happens on cloud. And so there are more dev and test-ish type workloads on cloud. But as we're seeing more production workloads move to cloud, we're seeing continuing growth and accelerating kind of our business on the cloud provider. So we feel pretty good that the value proposition holds up. We haven't seen anything or any kind of customers saying, ""Oh, I'm moving to cloud, so I'm not buying RHEL."" Our customers, as they move to cloud, are using our stack there as well."

Recognize, containers, they are a form of virtualization, but what they basically do is slice the operating system between kernel space and user space, right? So all of the user space aspects of the operating system are in a container. And the reason we actually see this as a positive driver of our business is, first off, containers in general are 100% Linux. Containers are not -- do not run in Windows. They run in Azure today in -- on Linux running on Azure. So first off, Linux gets a 100% of those today. At some point, I'm sure Microsoft will support it. But my guess is it will be like Hadoop, where it's 1% or less of those workloads. So first off, we get all of it. And then within that, because it is -- you have the user space in the container, then 2 things. First off, you need to make sure that you are life cycle managing that. And so most of the big security vulnerabilities that have happened in Linux, the Bash bug, et cetera, happen in user space. So it becomes extremely important to have an operating system vendor that can push updates into the user space to the container. And Red Hat is particularly good at that. So as containers go into production, as ISVs want to deliver their applications in a containerized format, unless they want to go into the Linux business and develop their own Linux security response team to patch and push those updates, the role of the Linux vendor gets to be even more important. So we actually see containers as a great opportunity for us to continue to differentiate around, A, kernel space and user space being consistent, so having the same host and technology in the container itself; and then secondly, just the ability to life cycle manage against that. So containers overall are good for Linux because it helps us grow overall share versus Windows, and then within that, we think we have a definitely differentiated position given our position in the OS. So that's why we can see continued double-digit growth in general in the OS category, which includes containers."

We are -- as I talked about before, if I step back, separate from the acquisitions and look at the investment portfolio, we have needs within the company related to a lot of the emerging technologies as we continue to start see that ramp both from an engineering and then also from a go-to-market perspective. The opportunity we feel is there, the investment required and especially when you have lead times that can go from 12 to 24 months as far as working with customers. We feel the investment to make in those areas is extremely critical for us to drive the growth that Jim referred to earlier that we're looking forward to not only this year but in the next several years. And so we're also kind of putting that in perspective of trying to make sure that we can balance it as it relates to margin. We know that investors are always interested in looking at the operating margin and how that's performing. So it's difficult when we want to also look at an acquisition, especially in the near term. It's not to say that we expect this to be dilutive forever. And Jim talked about Ansible and how we strong we feel about the performance so far. So as these acquisitions start to show some traction, especially as part of Red Hat, we expect them to start to drive not only upside but also improvement in the bottom line. But in the near term, with all the other competing priorities that we have in the company, if you add an acquisition or 2 like we have done right now, it's hard to kind of balance that within the overall portfolio. If you step back and look at the margin, I did some analysis earlier, and if you go back to FY -- the operating margin, you look at FY '15, we had about 23%. And if you adjust both '16 and '17, looking at how much we're spending for the acquisition of Ansible and 3scale, we're actually looking at about 23% in '15, 23.6% in '16. And if you look at the guidance that we provided for FY '17 adjusted, it will be about 23.6% as well. So despite all of the needs that we have internally, we're kind of holding the margins. And therefore, adding a bit, I think, for both of those acquisitions is reasonable."

We've built programs with our distributors. So our renewal rate continues to expand. If your question though -- I'd say a lot of that is because of better execution. In terms of just the strategic dynamic around that, I -- yes, we get to be more strategic to people, that probably helps as well. But the renewal rate is still in the 80s, but it continues to creep up."

When we first entered years ago, we thought, okay, well, this is a great alternative to VMware. But frankly, a lot of people had other issues to worry about, were comfortable with their VMware infrastructure, and so we didn't get the same share take that we got there as we've gotten, say, in the Middleware portfolio, or certainly UNIX to Linux. And the majority of the RHEV that we've seen has been more, hey, I'm adding net new workload and I'm going to do that on RHEV because it's cheaper than the alternative. But we haven't had the normal, I would say, kind of rip-and-replace share take that we have of WebSphere and WebLogic to JBoss or Windows or UNIX and Linux to RHEL. The big question I think we have in all of our minds is, will that change as OpenStack continues to grow when people say, ""But I have a set of workloads that aren't really amenable to OpenStack."" Once you have KVM as the underlying hypervisor and you have a set of management tools that look kind of similar across, that seems to be what's driving incremental RHEV growth at this point. So yes, I think that, that can kind of continue to pick up nicely and that's why we're seeing pretty fast growth in that overall. I think that -- does hit an inflection point or not? It's generally kind of we're selling it as part of a portfolio, again, with our other technologies."

Digital transformation and cloud computing are changing the way companies compete in virtually every industry today. Organizations that rapidly embrace agile IT technology are succeeding as industry innovation accelerates around them. With our open source-based technologies, we are helping customers to capture the business benefits associated with this rapid rate of change. Strong adoption of our technologies is evidenced in our financial results, where we delivered our highest Q1 total revenue growth rate in U.S. dollars in 3 years, grew both Q1 total revenue and subscription revenue at 18% year-over-year and had strong sales execution that led to a record number of deals over $1 million in a Q1.
With that overview, let me discuss some of our recent business and technology highlights from the quarter. Starting with OpenShift, our PaaS solution, where we made a number of recent announcements. First, our OpenShift Commons membership crossed 200 organizations from over 40 countries and includes Global 2000 enterprises, ISVs and SaaS providers, system integrator partners and public sector institutions. OpenShift Commons is an open community that encourages collaboration, contribution and best practices for open source technologies in PaaS and containers.
Second, we announced the next generation of OpenShift Online that was made available for -- in developer preview this week. OpenShift Online has had over 3 million applications deployed to it and has now been updated to become the industry's first multi-tenant Docker container and Kubernetes-powered public cloud platform.
And lastly, our OpenShift technology won a CODiE award for best Platform-as-a-Service for a second year in a row. This is a prestigious peer-reviewed award presented by the SIIA. OpenShift also received InfoWorld's 2016 Technology of the Year earlier in the year for a second time.
As a headline sponsor of the OpenStack Summit in Austin, we announced the general availability of 2 new technologies that help bridge the gap between development and operations teams to scale for cloud computing. First, we launched Cloud Suite that is designed to offer an integrated hybrid cloud stack with a container application platform, a scalable infrastructure based on OpenStack and unified management tools.
Second and in conjunction with the event, we released the general availability of the latest version of our OpenStack distribution, Red Hat OSP 8, which is based on the OpenStack Community Liberty release. A co-engineered solution, Red Hat OSP 8 integrates the foundation of the RHEL with Red Hat's OpenStack technology to form a production-ready cloud platform. Red Hat's core OpenStack offering now natively includes additional automation for upgrades and updates, infrastructure and workload management and software-defined storage.
Our new offerings further solidify Red Hat's early leadership position in OpenStack. This is exciting given the considerable growth in OpenStack interest level among enterprises, growing levels of customer adoption and further signs of market maturation as more enterprises are moving to live production each quarter. Importantly, we believe that Red Hat OSP is increasingly being recognized as the gold standard for large-scale production OpenStack deployments.
We have hundreds of production deployments across the globe. And even more proof of concepts are underway, including recent wins with Cambridge University, Paddy Power Betfair, Fastweb, NASA JPL and Produban, the IT services division of Santander bank. A broadening group of enterprise and service provider customers that have deployed Red Hat OpenStack platform include Verizon and C.A. Mobile and a strong ecosystem of industry leaders that have rallied around RHEL or Red Hat OSP for a transformative network function virtualization and software-defined networking deployments. 
Of course, Red Hat OSP and Cloud Suite are just part of a portfolio of technologies that customers are deploying to address their digital transformation needs. To this point, we had an important new win in Q1 with a global financial services provider, BBVA, that speaks to the power and breadth and depth of Red Hat's offerings. This global strategic collaboration with BBVA establishes Red Hat as one of their priority partners. The partnership is designed to focus on business and technical alignment, enabling BBVA to accelerate innovation, manage the growth of financial transactions on digital devices and deliver digital banking services through its global customers.
Moreover, new IaaS and PaaS-based platforms utilizing Red Hat technology will enable BBVA to focus on developing applications that can support the heavy demands of those global digital banking services and provide customers with the service and information they want when it is needed.
BBVA is a fantastic example of a global enterprise that has turned to an open source-based cloud solution, and Red Hat in particular, to drive business innovation through technology. We're thrilled to collaborate with them on this journey to transform their business and to help them reach their goal of becoming the world's first truly digital global bank.
More broadly, we believe that Red Hat is seeing and winning a growing number of large deal opportunities due to the breadth and depth of our stack. As customers move workloads to the cloud and develop innovative new applications, they are turning to open source-based solutions to provide them with speed, agility, security, reliability and enterprise features. They're turning to Red Hat, and we believe we are well positioned to benefit as organizations invest in private, hybrid and public clouds.
Today, we announced the acquisition of a JBoss Middleware partner, 3scale. 3scale was founded in 2007 with the goal of enabling organizations of all sizes to successfully create, manage and use APIs in a web-enabled world where APIs are paramount. It offers a hybrid cloud-based API management solution that separates the cloud management layer from the API gateway, offering customers more flexibility, performance and scale. The company powers more than 700 APIs for more than 500 organizations across many industries, including Coldwell Banker, Johnson Controls, SITA, CrunchBase and the University of California Berkeley. 3scale has offices in Barcelona and San Francisco, and I want to formally welcome the 3scale associates to Red Hat.
Next week, we will be showcasing more of our portfolio of technologies, customer success stories and partner traction at the Red Hat Summit in San Francisco. Once again, we're expecting strong attendance at our premier user event, which is also one of the largest annual open source events. I hope many of you will be able to join us.
In summary, we are excited about our strong start to the fiscal year. We remain optimistic about our outlook for the remainder of the year, as Frank will detail in a moment.
As a final note, I want to thank all Red Hat associates around the globe for the innovative ideas and technologies that led Red Hat to being recognized by SD Times as a top 10 influencer in 2016 along with companies like Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft. SD Times publishes that these companies are making their mark on the entire industry and whose work has made a significant impact on what others build, how they build it and ultimately, who uses it.
With that let me turn the call over to Frank."

This enabled us to deliver results that exceeded our guidance across a number of metrics. At the same time, we continued to invest in our high-growth application development platform and emerging technologies, which are responding to our customers' needs to enable cloud computing and digital transformation.
Let me begin with the financial highlights of our Q1 performance. For a more detailed view of our results and reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to GAAP, please refer to our press release. I am pleased to announce total revenue of $568 million, above the high end of our guidance and representing growth of 18% in U.S. dollars and in constant currency on a year-on-year basis. In general, currency rate volatility has stabilized to a point where many of our USD and constant currency growth rates are essentially equivalent. So for this quarter, I will keep my prepared remarks focused on our reported U.S. dollar results where appropriate, and you will find a table of constant currency results in our press release.
Subscription revenue continued to be the largest driver of our growth at $502 million for the quarter, an increase of 18% year-over-year. This renewable revenue stream now constitutes 88% of total revenue, providing a large base for future renewals and upselling opportunities for new technologies. We continued to drive high growth across our technology portfolio. Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $403 million, an increase of 14% year-over-year. Our application development-related and emerging technology subscription revenue was $98 million, an increase of 39% year-over-year. Application development-related and emerging technologies revenue was approximately 17% of total revenue, up 260 basis points from the year-ago quarter.
We are pleased to see that we have reached an annualized run rate of nearly $400 million a year as customers continue to adopt our portfolio of technologies like Middleware, the Red Hat OpenStack platform, OpenShift, cloud management and storage.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $124 million grew 9% year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating margin was 21.8%. This is consistent with the 22% operating margin direction we provided on our last call, which included the investment in the Ansible acquisition. As a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjusts for noncash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combinations.
Using our non-GAAP estimated annual effective tax rate of 27%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.50, consistent with our guidance and up 14% year-over-year.
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2.1 billion. We returned $66 million to shareholders in the quarter through the repurchase of approximately 900,000 shares of stock. Given our strong cash position, ability to generate meaningful cash flow and firm belief in our long-term prospects for the business, I am pleased to announce a new $1 billion stock repurchase program that will replace our previous $500 million plan. We believe this new plan will contribute further value for our shareholders.
Total deferred revenue at quarter-end was $1.7 billion, an increase of $256 million or 18% over the same quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, total deferred revenue was up 17%. The total change in deferred revenue from our cash flow statement, which neutralizes most of the impact of currency fluctuation, decreased $46 million compared to the end of 2016. This follows the pattern we've seen historically in Q1.
Operating cash flow of $232 million for the quarter was up 8% year-over-year and was at a record for a Q1. Strong collections contributed to these results with FX-adjusted days sales outstanding at 56 days. That's down from 59 days in the year-ago quarter.
In addition, during the first quarter, we made the decision to adopt Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 earlier than required related to accounting for stock compensation. The impact to operating cash flow in Q1 FY '17 was a benefit of $8 million, and it was a benefit of $6 million when adjusting Q1 FY '16. In Q2, we currently expect this benefit to be only $1 million. Also, a schedule with historical adjustments for ASU 2016-09 to FY '16 operating cash flows can be found in the supplemental data presentation that we provided with this call.
On a rolling 4-quarters basis, the billings proxy was $596 million. That's up 16% on a constant currency basis and 13% U.S. dollars year-over-year. The rolling 4 quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters. 
I will now review the metrics for business momentum and large deals in the quarter. Our geographies saw a continued growth in bookings. This quarter, 60% of bookings came from the Americas, 21% from EMEA and 19% from Asia Pacific versus a 55-25-20 split in Q1 of last year. Although some companies have pointed to geographic weakness, we continue to see strong growth across all our major geographies. In fact, while EMEA's relative contribution to our total bookings was lower than the prior year, its underlying momentum was strong. In Q1, the EMEA sales team was faced with a smaller number of multi-year deals in its renewal base when compared to Q1 of last year. There was a focus on driving significant new business and a higher growth rate in single-year bookings. Congratulations to the EMEA team on great execution in Q1 in renewing existing deals and growing their new business.
The Q1 route-to-market mix was 78% from the channel, 22% from our direct sales force compared to 75-25 percent split in Q1 of last year. Our proxy for bookings duration was 21 months, which was in line with historic duration.
Within our top largest deals, all of them were $1 million or more dollars. And we had record 6 deals in Q1 that were in excess of $5 million, and of these deals, 2 were over $10 million. This was a record first quarter for large deals with 45 deals over $1 million, which was up 50% year-over-year. This traction highlights Red Hat's growing strategic importance in our customers' data centers and our talented sales team's ability to land and expand our wallet share of IT dollars.
Cross-selling was strong with a record-high of 80% of the top 30 deals, including one or more components from our group of application development and emerging technologies offerings.
Mainstream customers in sectors such as health care, industrial and agricultural products and retail were the top verticals, followed by government and financial services customers.
With our renewal business, we once again renewed all of the top 25 deals that we were expecting. The total subscription value of these top 25 renewals was approximately 105% of the prior value. Similar to what we experienced a couple of years ago, we had a -- we had several large U.S. government deals that renewed at approximately 100% of their original values weighing on this metric for Q1. Excluding these government renewals, the subscription value of our other top renewals was approximately 110%. It's important to note that overall, our government sales team delivered double-digit growth across the federal segment in Q1.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and the impact of the acquisition of 3scale and foreign exchange. We are reaffirming our full year revenue guidance of $2,380,000,000 to $2,420,000,000, up approximately 18% in U.S. dollars at the high end of the range. We are modestly decreasing operating margin to approximately 23% due to a $5 million impact from the 3scale acquisition. We are reaffirming the operating cash flow in the range from $800 million to $820 million. We are also adjusting our target for full year non-GAAP earnings per share to approximately $2.19 to $2.23 per share, assuming a 27% non-GAAP annual effective tax rate; approximately a $1 million to $2 million per quarter forecast for other income and the investment related to 3scale, which is approximately $0.03 per share.
For Q2 specifically, this implies the following outlook. We expect revenue to be in the range of $587 million to $593 million, which is up 18% in U.S. dollars at the high end of the range. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 22.8% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.54 per share, which includes a $0.01 impact for the 3scale acquisition in Q2. Consistent with prior practices, I will not forecast quarterly cash flow. But I will note that it is important to consider that -- the AR balances to reflect the quarter-over-quarter change to cash flow. Also, although payments can fluctuate in a quarter, I would also anticipate AP balances to be approximately flat to slightly up with Q1 balances.
Overall, we are very pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter, and we believe we are off to a very good start for FY '17. We are excited about the company's long-term growth opportunity as we are uniquely positioned to further drive the adoption of open source technologies as IT organizations transition their application development and infrastructure to a hybrid cloud environment.
Finally, we look forward to seeing many of you next week in San Francisco for the Red Hat Summit and for our Analyst Day on Thursday, June 30.

I'm wondering, when you consider the cloud business and the emerging portfolio that you have and you look forward to the next few years, do you see the potential to maintain roughly that type of a mid-teens glide path?

So the issue is as those other businesses that continue to grow a lot faster, A, can they continue that momentum? And can RHEL continue to grow in the low double digits? And if so, at some point, those other businesses will weight the overall growth rate up, not down. I think we feel confident that RHEL can continue to grow double digit. I think the other businesses we're confident can continue to grow especially if things like OpenStack and OpenShift and storage continue to scale. And so as we do that, you put that together, I feel pretty good about the weighted average of those, keeping our growth rate where it is or taking it up, not down.

Again, even when you put something in production, nobody buys a $1 million -- or rarely do you see a $1 million initial deployment of OpenStack. You start, you put applications on it and you grow with it over time. So the deployments are still 5 figures, maybe 6 figures, and they'll scale as the applications go on there. So it's still -- this is not having a significant impact on our revenue. But you can kind of start to see the traction that as the application portfolios that are running on the infrastructure grows, we'll see it impacting over the next year or 2."

It used to be when our large deals weren't quite as large as they are now, people often paid upfront because they had budget for a project and they had the budget that year and they paid upfront, even though for us, we recognize that revenue over time over multiple years. As we've gotten bigger and we've become a larger portion of their infrastructure, these numbers get really, really, really big. And as companies get more used to subscription-type models, they're becoming more comfortable with kind of pay-as-you-go model. And so now to pay upfront, they want a discount. And we have plenty of cash in the bank, as Frank talked about. We're not going to do abnormal things to get someone to pay upfront. And so now, we still have multi-year commitments, but there are people who are less likely to pay upfront as those deals have gotten bigger and people have gotten more used to pay-as-you-go type models.

So if you look at something like Hadoop, I think it would be very, very, very rare to find a Hadoop workload that's running on Windows, right? It's 90-something percent Linux. If you look at containers, 100% are on Linux because it's a Linux-native kind of technology. So as you start seeing so many of these new technologies, they're 100% on Linux. So Linux overall is taking share vis-à-vis Windows and [indiscernible] UNIX, because that's where the new workloads are going. So you didn't say within Linux how is our share doing. And I have not seen a lot of customers that have actually transitioned from RHEL to free. So we feel very, very good about how we're doing in that environment. Obviously, as these contracts get big, they go up a further level in purchasing. And so we have more negotiation on some of those, as you would expect, as they get bigger. But we have a pretty strong value proposition. The one area I would say you see particular pushback would be with developers. Developers want kind of low friction, and they want to be able to try things quickly. And so even we now have developer subscription that's free, so people can use our -- developers can use our production-quality products for free. So again, I think as we go forward, as the dollars get bigger, of course, people are going to look from a vendor management perspective to try to get the best possible deal.

And Heather, obviously, when you take out the fed deals, which are particularly heavy in Q1, you just get some lumpiness around which deals and what are they. And some people buy by project, and therefore, those stay flat and you get a separate deal to grow, and others, kind of it's one big thing. And so -- but there's nothing in the trend that looks like any change from the past. I feel pretty good about continuing growth in those renewals. Related to our share on Amazon or on cloud in general, again, as we talked about in the past, certainly if you looked at our overall share, it is lower on cloud than it is on premise. But trying to tease out how much of that is nature of workload versus something different about the cloud deployment model is one that's a lot harder to break out. When we talk to customers and they talk about moving workload from on-prem to cloud, the RHEL value proposition is really, really strong because of the kind of common technology, common support model. So we feel like our kind of share of production workload on cloud is -- feels like it's as high as our share of production workload on premise. It's harder for us to have quite as much visibility because we don't see all that. In the same way that in dev and test environments, people don't pay for RHEL typically there, I think the same thing happens on cloud. And so there are more dev and test-ish type workloads on cloud. But as we're seeing more production workloads move to cloud, we're seeing continuing growth and accelerating kind of our business on the cloud provider. So we feel pretty good that the value proposition holds up. We haven't seen anything or any kind of customers saying, ""Oh, I'm moving to cloud, so I'm not buying RHEL."" Our customers, as they move to cloud, are using our stack there as well."

Recognize, containers, they are a form of virtualization, but what they basically do is slice the operating system between kernel space and user space, right? So all of the user space aspects of the operating system are in a container. And the reason we actually see this as a positive driver of our business is, first off, containers in general are 100% Linux. Containers are not -- do not run in Windows. They run in Azure today in -- on Linux running on Azure. So first off, Linux gets a 100% of those today. At some point, I'm sure Microsoft will support it. But my guess is it will be like Hadoop, where it's 1% or less of those workloads. So first off, we get all of it. And then within that, because it is -- you have the user space in the container, then 2 things. First off, you need to make sure that you are life cycle managing that. And so most of the big security vulnerabilities that have happened in Linux, the Bash bug, et cetera, happen in user space. So it becomes extremely important to have an operating system vendor that can push updates into the user space to the container. And Red Hat is particularly good at that. So as containers go into production, as ISVs want to deliver their applications in a containerized format, unless they want to go into the Linux business and develop their own Linux security response team to patch and push those updates, the role of the Linux vendor gets to be even more important. So we actually see containers as a great opportunity for us to continue to differentiate around, A, kernel space and user space being consistent, so having the same host and technology in the container itself; and then secondly, just the ability to life cycle manage against that. So containers overall are good for Linux because it helps us grow overall share versus Windows, and then within that, we think we have a definitely differentiated position given our position in the OS. So that's why we can see continued double-digit growth in general in the OS category, which includes containers."

We are -- as I talked about before, if I step back, separate from the acquisitions and look at the investment portfolio, we have needs within the company related to a lot of the emerging technologies as we continue to start see that ramp both from an engineering and then also from a go-to-market perspective. The opportunity we feel is there, the investment required and especially when you have lead times that can go from 12 to 24 months as far as working with customers. We feel the investment to make in those areas is extremely critical for us to drive the growth that Jim referred to earlier that we're looking forward to not only this year but in the next several years. And so we're also kind of putting that in perspective of trying to make sure that we can balance it as it relates to margin. We know that investors are always interested in looking at the operating margin and how that's performing. So it's difficult when we want to also look at an acquisition, especially in the near term. It's not to say that we expect this to be dilutive forever. And Jim talked about Ansible and how we strong we feel about the performance so far. So as these acquisitions start to show some traction, especially as part of Red Hat, we expect them to start to drive not only upside but also improvement in the bottom line. But in the near term, with all the other competing priorities that we have in the company, if you add an acquisition or 2 like we have done right now, it's hard to kind of balance that within the overall portfolio. If you step back and look at the margin, I did some analysis earlier, and if you go back to FY -- the operating margin, you look at FY '15, we had about 23%. And if you adjust both '16 and '17, looking at how much we're spending for the acquisition of Ansible and 3scale, we're actually looking at about 23% in '15, 23.6% in '16. And if you look at the guidance that we provided for FY '17 adjusted, it will be about 23.6% as well. So despite all of the needs that we have internally, we're kind of holding the margins. And therefore, adding a bit, I think, for both of those acquisitions is reasonable."

So there are a couple of issues in measuring that. Actually, we believe it's a fair amount better than that. The piece where we sometimes lose data is our business through OEMs. If somebody buys a server with a 3-year SKU, runs RHEL for 3 years, throws away the server and buys another one that has RHEL on there, that first one would have been considered not renewed and then the new server would be new business. So if you leave that out and you look at what we have visibility into, our renewal rates have increased pretty consistently over the last several years. How much of that's dynamic of larger deal versus how much of that is we've been focused on it, especially -- we have a very high renewal rate on larger deals, right? Very high, close to 100% for our larger customers. As you go down to some of the smaller customers, it's been lower and we've had more of a focus on that. We've worked with partners. We've built programs with our distributors. So our renewal rate continues to expand. If your question though -- I'd say a lot of that is because of better execution. In terms of just the strategic dynamic around that, I -- yes, we get to be more strategic to people, that probably helps as well.

When we first entered years ago, we thought, okay, well, this is a great alternative to VMware. But frankly, a lot of people had other issues to worry about, were comfortable with their VMware infrastructure, and so we didn't get the same share take that we got there as we've gotten, say, in the Middleware portfolio, or certainly UNIX to Linux. And the majority of the RHEV that we've seen has been more, hey, I'm adding net new workload and I'm going to do that on RHEV because it's cheaper than the alternative. But we haven't had the normal, I would say, kind of rip-and-replace share take that we have of WebSphere and WebLogic to JBoss or Windows or UNIX and Linux to RHEL. The big question I think we have in all of our minds is, will that change as OpenStack continues to grow when people say, ""But I have a set of workloads that aren't really amenable to OpenStack."" Once you have KVM as the underlying hypervisor and you have a set of management tools that look kind of similar across, that seems to be what's driving incremental RHEV growth at this point.

We continued business momentum in Q2, which showed what strong revenues above our guidance driven mainly by subscription revenue, which grew 20% in U.S. dollars. This growth was highlighted by 18% growth for our infrastructure offerings combined with 33% growth for our application development and emerging technologies. 
Our growth was driven in part by expanding our footprint with customers as we closed a record number of deals over $1 million, up approximately 60% year-over-year. Digital transformation and hybrid cloud computing are changing how applications are built, deployed and managed. As organizations adopt agile application development technologies such as Linux Containers, they are increasingly relying on Red Hat as their strategic partner to monetize -- to modernize their infrastructure and application development platforms. 
These trends are reflected in our results. With that overview, let me discuss some of the recent business and technology highlights for the quarter. At the beginning of Q2, we held our largest ever Red Hat Summit event, with record attendance, up 10% compared to last year. We showcased our portfolio of technologies, customer success stories and partner traction. Let me summarize some of the exciting announcements from the Summit.
Starting with Linux Containers. This year's summit was all about containers. We expanded our offerings around OpenShift, which is our container platform so it's now available across a number of environments. We have OpenShift for developers that can be run on laptops. We have OpenShift for the lab that enables developers to move easily from desk to test, and then applications move into production, we have OpenShift Enterprise. We have a life cycle of an application with our end-to-end platform and because these 3 offerings are the same platform, customers will not have to retool on their platform to build their container applications. 
The developer experience is designed to be similar from the day they first start writing code for their new application until they provision and manage mission-critical application for live deployment. In Middleware, we released JBoss EAP 7. It is an optimized for hybrid cloud computing environment and when deployed with red Red Hat OpenShift, EAP 7 offers the benefits of containers, load-balancing, elastic scaling, health monitoring and ability to deploy a containers directly, which can improve the developer experience and productivity. 
In addition, JBoss EAP with OpenShift contributes to a more architecturally efficient DevOps environment and so overlapping features are no longer needed. We also announced the general availability of Red Hat JBoss datagrid 7, the latest version of Red Hat's in-memory data management technology, introduces enhancements to help organizations generate insights for continues business optimization through real-time data analytics, contributing to greater agility and competitiveness. 
In our storage portfolio, we announced Red Hat SaaS Storage 2, with several new capabilities that enhance support for optic storage workloads and promotes greater ease-of-use. This latest version of the product is the most significant update to Red Hat substorage to date. We believe our customers will find Red Hat SaaS Storage 2 to be a fully-featured, technically-advanced storage platform that's easier to use that helps them manage this vast quantities of data. 
On the management side, we continue to evolve our offerings with new versions of answerable tower 3 and the Red Hat insights launched at Summit. Following up on these announcements, we recently launched Red Hat Virtualization 4, which introduces new and enhanced capabilities around performance, management and automation. RAV4 introduces support for OpenStack and Linux Containers to run with enhanced security and reliability. These type of leadership and innovation enabled us to be recognized as the only company included in the visionary squadron of Gartner's Magic Quadrant for x86 server virtualization infrastructure. We believe that this position reinforces our continued innovation, momentum and strong vision for an open high-performance virtualization alternative.
On the outer portfolio of hybrid cloud solutions, we recently introduced OpenStack Platform 9 or OSP 9. It builds on the proven trusted foundation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux to provide critical dependencies needed in production OpenStack environments. It is a production-ready OpenStack distribution that offers automated upgrade and update tasks for mission-critical operations. OSP 9 brings significant updates to the mainstream -- the version of OpenStack. Overall, OSP backed by a robust ecosystem of partners including Cisco, Dell, Intel and Lenovo has emerged as a proven solution to power private clouds across hundreds of customers worldwide, such as BBVA, Cambridge University, FICO, NASA's jet propulsion laboratory, power, Santander bank and Verizon. 
In the summer, we're pleased to close out the first half of our fiscal year on a strong note and we're even more excited about Red Hat's future. We believe that Red Hat is uniquely positioned to benefit from long-term secular changes in IT infrastructure that companies are deploying to support their businesses. We're delivering innovation and enterprise capabilities to the open source marketplace at a rapid pace. And in doing so, we continue to build out a portfolio of technologies and capabilities to enable our customers to enjoy the benefits associated with the digital transformation and hybrid cloud computing as they develop their applications. 
We remain optimistic about our outlook for the remainder of the year as Frank will detail in a moment. As a final note, this past quarter, Linux celebrated its 25th year since its creation and I want to recognize and thank the creative energy of the open-source community, including the many Red Hat associates that have continued to drive innovation and helped to build Red Hat. Collaboration with the open-source community and the focused efforts of associates around the globe has enabled Red Hat to be recognized once again as one of Forbes most innovative companies. This is the key reason that Red Hat is trusted as one of the strategic technology providers to enterprises around the world. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Frank."
33679,382458172,1049529,"Red Hat, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Sep 21, 2016",2016-09-21,"Earnings Calls","Red Hat, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Our business continues to demonstrate good momentum and strong execution by our global teams. We exceeded our guidance across a number of metrics in Q2. The strength in our subscription revenue continued to drive our results, highlighted b",1452,"Thank you, Jim. Our business continues to demonstrate good momentum and strong execution by our global teams. We exceeded our guidance across a number of metrics in Q2. The strength in our subscription revenue continued to drive our results, highlighted by accelerated revenue growth in our core infrastructure offering and high revenue growth in our portfolio of new technology that enable hybrid cloud computing and digital transformation.
Let me begin with the financial highlights of our Q2 performance. For a more detailed view of our results and for reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to GAAP, please refer to our earnings press release and the slide deck with financial highlights and supplemental metrics. These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results or rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results.
Similar to Q1, currency rate volatility has stabilized year-over-year, for example, on a constant currency basis using rates from Q2 last year, total revenue growth would've been 18% or approximately 70 basis points lower. I will keep my prepared remarks focused on our reported USD results where appropriate, and you will find a table of constant currency results in our press release. 
I'm pleased to announce total revenue of $600 million, above the high end of our guidance and representing growth of 19% in U.S. dollars. This result was driven mainly by modestly better-than-expected sales performance and additional revenue related to our education and compliance program.
As I discussed, subscription revenue continued to be the largest driver of our growth as $531 million for the quarter, an increase of 20% year-over-year. This mainly renewable revenue stream now constitutes 89% of total revenue, providing us with a large base to expand our relationships with our customers. 
We continue to drive high growth across our technology portfolio. Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $427 million, an increase of 18% year-over-year. Our application development-related and emerging technologies subscription revenue was $104 million, an increase of 33% year-over-year. Application development related and emerging technologies revenue was approximately 17% of total revenue, and that's up 180 basis points from a year ago quarter.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $137 million grew 11% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating margin was 22.8%, which is consistent with the operating margin direction we provided on our last call and up 100 basis points from Q1. As a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjusts for noncash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combinations.
Using our estimated annual effective tax rate of 27%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.55, which was $0.01 above our guidance and up 17% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2 billion. We returned $127 million to shareholders in the quarter through the repurchase of approximately 1.8 million shares of stock. This is one of our largest direct repurchases and the porter and reflects our commitment to return value to shareholders with our recent $1 billion repurchase authorization.
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $1.7 billion, an increase of $267 million or 19% over the same quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, total deferred revenue was up 17%. Operating cash flow was $97 million for the quarter compared to $123 million in the year ago quarter. Comparing the 2 quarters, our days sales outstanding was 1-day better than Q2 last year at 57 days on an FX-adjusted basis. However, the majority of our strong second quarter billings performance occurred in the last month of the quarter and contributed to a sequential increase of $31 million in our accounts receivable balance.
In addition, our first half investments in our hybrid cloud technologies and sales capabilities led to an increase in expense of $20 million year-over-year. Some of these expense led to a higher use of operating cash flow. Although predicting the timing of cash inflows and outflows can be a difficult ability on a quarterly basis, we remain comfortable with our full year cash flow guidance, which includes our assumption of higher revenue, seasonally higher billings, increased non-GAAP operating margin for the remainder of the fiscal year and the slightly different linearity of cash flows.
The rolling 4 quarter billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement to the last 4 quarters. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, the billings proxy was $620 million, up 17% on constant currency basis and 15% U.S. dollars year-over-year.
I will now review the metrics for the business momentum and large deals in the quarter. All of our geographies saw double-digit growth in bookings with particular growth in EMEA and Asia Pacific. This quarter, 57% of bookings came from the Americas, 24% from EMEA, and 19% from Asia Pacific. And this is versed as a 60, 22, 18 split in Q2 last year. The Q2 route to market mix was 81% from the channel and 19% from our direct sales force, and this compares to a 75/25 split in Q2 of last year. This is the large portion of channel business in a quarter and reflects channel strength across our major geographies.
A proxy for bookings duration was 22 months and that's up approximately 1.5 months from Q2 of last year and that's driven in part by growth in deals over $1 million. In fact, this was a record second quarter for large deals, with 55 deals over $1 million, which was up 60% year-over-year. This traction highlights Red Hat's growing strategic importance in our customers data centers and our talented sales team's ability to land and expand our wallet share of IT dollars.
Looking sequentially at our top 30 largest deal metrics, all of the deals were $1 million or more and 5 of those deals were in excess of $5 million. Cross-selling was strong with over 70% of the top 30 deals, including 1 or more components from 1 group of application development and emerging technologies offerings.
Financial services and government were our top verticals in Q2. Within our top 25 renewal business, we renewed 23 of the top 25 deals that we were expecting. The total subscription value of these top 25 renewals was approximately 105% of the prior value. One of the 2 deals that did not renew was related to a government agency project that was canceled. This agency continues to rely on Red Hat technologies including a 6-figure deal that closed in the quarter. The second deal that did not renew was lost to an on premise legacy Linux distribution. We are still engaged with this customer in other areas of their business. And as with a few times in the past, this has happened. We are optimistic that we can win back the lost portion over time as a result of our award-winning service and innovation.
Substituting these 2 deals within the next 2 deals up for renewal, the revised top 25 deals that did renew were approximately 115% higher than the prior year value. Given the growth in million dollar deals this quarter, we are clearly driving larger wallet share by taking a number of 6-figure deals and expanding them to million dollar plus renewals.
Now I'd like to turn to the guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and foreign exchange. We are raising our full year revenue guidance to $2,415,000,000 to $2.435 billion, which is up approximately $15 million in U.S. dollars at the high end of the previous range. We are reaffirming our non-GAAP operating margin at approximately 23%. We are reaffirming the operating cash flow in the range from $800 million to $820 million. Given our revenue guidance, our target for full year non-GAAP earnings per share is estimated to be approximately $2.23 to $2.25 per share, assuming a 27% annual effective tax rate, approximately $1 million to $2 million per quarter forecast for other income.
For Q3 specifically, this implies the following outlook: we expect revenue to be in the range of $613 million to $623 million, which is up 19% in U.S. dollars at the high end of the range or 18% in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 23.3%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58. Consistent with prior practices, I will not forecast quarterly cash flow given the variability of cash inflows and outflows.
Overall, we are very pleased with our financial performance in the first half of FY '17. We continue to see strong global demand for our hybrid cloud technology as organizations continue to modernize their infrastructure platforms and their application development platform.

You're right in that we have some customers are coming to us and asking for a true consumption model, kind of pay-as-you-go. And we're working through the detail. I'm actually encouraged. The very large customer that we talked to about that said will even say, we recognized that will cost us more than we are paying you today because we're not committing to volumes.

So you have acceleration in the revenue growth, the acceleration in the EPS growth, acceleration in the billings growth, et cetera. But I wanted to ask you specifically just about the acceleration and the upside in the subscription revenue. It's a little unusual to see that much upside in that line. And so Jim, I'm curious if the public cloud adoption through Azure and AWS and all of the other public clouds is playing a larger role in that. Because we had heard some very strong feedback on the adoption and uptake in that specific area. And as kind of a part B, is the transition from the test and dev activity to the production environments kind of giving you a larger opportunity set there?"

As enterprises look to move their application portfolio of kind of production workload, that certainly helps us. I think there's a couple of things that helps us in a hybrid cloud environment. If you look purely on premise, roughly half the workloads run on Windows, right? I mean just -- and so I don't want to say we're locked out because we don't compete for that because kind of half workloads we didn't quite address because they're Windows. As soon as you start thinking about a hybrid cloud work i.e. workload might run on premise or they might run on cloud, that by definition is going to be -- but it's the highly likely 90% of those are going to be on Linux. So that helps us both to see obviously very significant growth on public cloud, but more broadly I think it helps us with our adoption in been in core Linux in kind of hybrid cloud environments, which is both on premise as well as in public cloud. So the hybrid cloud model in the fact that public clouds are starting to take share of workloads is actually kind of a -- is a tailwind for our business."

So as you look at kind of the dynamics of what we saw in the first half of the year, our constant currency revenue grew about 18%. This is for the first half of the year. Our constant currency expenses grew at 22%. And as we talked about in the past, coming off of the end of last year, our objective for the first half of this year was to frontload a lot of our investments. And really focus those investments on application development and deposition technology. And so throughout the first half, and you can see that with some of our headcount numbers as well, we added probably in addition 1,000 employees. So that headcount is up about 25% year-on-year in the first half, primarily in sales, driving capacity to help support future growth around the app dev and emerging technology. We also delivered strong feelings growth, right, 18% in the first half, which I think is a good indication of business momentum. Now in the second half, so that's pretty much if you look at what I just laid out especially on the expense, that had an impact on the cash for the second quarter with the $97 million that we announced. It also -- we mentioned earlier that some of the transactions that we had, especially the larger ones, came in later in the quarter. And so that increased the AER, so there was a lighter amount of collections in the quarter to the magnitude of about $31 million. So that's kind of the dynamics for the first half. If we look at the second half of the year, aligned with the guidance that we just gave, we're expecting our seasonally stronger billings to contribute to cash flow as you would expect especially in Q4. We're forecasting about 16% constant currency revenue growth when you look at the second half, based on  that's at the low end, 16% to kind of 18% range. And we're also forecasting 16% operating expense growth. And that's really driven by kind of offset to the amount of investment that we made in the first half of the year. So we're bringing the investment levels down that path and pretty much leveraging the investments that we've made, as I said, and the application this and emerging technologies. So with those dynamics, we feel comfortable with the guidance that we gave both at the top line for our expense as well as our cash flow, and that cash flow is in the $800 million to $820 million."

And so that just accelerates their share of production applications that are running on Linux.

And so we will continue to look for ways to continue to build our container platform. So Ansible, clearly is a strong standalone automation business. A key driver for that was the need to have an was way to do an automation in the microservices world. So we'll continue to do the vast majority via kind of organic.

That has been the complete opposite for us, great alignment across Red Hat and the Ansible team globally. And it's been a leading element of our management portfolio in such a short period of time.

It's hard to be a little cynical on that. I would say larger deals take a while and our sales will probably take a breadth in Q4 and then start large deals and then it'll close in Q2. But as we're seeing especially a lot of traction around OpenShift in financial services, which is great to see. As you think about the container platform and the need to understand the provenance of the content to think about the software development lifecycle around that, to think about orchestration, these large customers are really gravitating towards OpenShift, and that was I think reflected as well with some of the strength that you saw in financial services. Overall, in macro, I think there's a huge change that we've seen in the last couple of quarters.

From a sales perspective, we don't encourage or measure the sales team based on whether they sell one or the other from the standpoint of the profitability. I'm on the profitability piece. What they do focus on under sales organization is the capital customer and looking at what the needs of the customer sustaining that account over a period of time.

So anybody, including incumbents who look to make a shift in their -- considering alternatives, that's good for us. So the more focus on talk about PaaS broadly, ultimately it's good for us because it's just increases the number of add backs we have to win. So we feel really, really good about where we are.

The vast majority of our engineering expense around Linux is our downstream sustaining engineering around our new releases. It's not necessarily upstream future development for the exact reason that you mentioned, which is the upstream community does a lot of the upstream future development. We're obviously involved in a number of those components but the majority of our risks expenses is sustaining engineering. We certainly would expect that as we think about the products across the board. Again, going back to profitability, sales and marketing is a larger share of the expense. So that's one where whenever we have a new product, there's a higher expense associated with that. We've just looked structurally against any of our products, that maturity, that we don't have any reason to believe that any of our products will be less profitable than Linux. And if you look at renewal rates that those are typically similar overtime across product lines. I think we look at the relative engineering against that sustaining engineering just looks similar. So I think at similar levels of maturity, so far we think the portfolio will look similar. It's just obviously the different stages of maturity across the portfolio."

Because at the Analyst Day, I talked about the 3 different options, want to go more heavily towards as Jim was just talking about, our operating system on RHEL and that beauty will have better leverage model in the short term. The other extreme would go more heavily toward emerging market. I think that will accelerate the growth with cause a margin deterioration in the short-term. We are going with a balanced approach. This year, as I just mentioned, it's to invest in the first half of the year. Clearly if you look at the margin profile, first of of this year versus the second half of this year, you'll start to see any improvement in the margin in the back half of the year. I think that pretty much the dynamics of how we're making the investment progress we continue to continue to get momentum on the app dev and emerging technology product as we go into '18, I think that will allow us a better view of where we think to what extent we really think we can get potentially some slack margin improvement. So I would say we want to close out the back half of the year with guidance that we just gave. We're in the midst right now up already starting our planning for the -- relate the next couple of years and I think as we get into the beginning of next year, it will have a better view of what that model might look like over a period of 2 years, and we'll be more than happy to share that.

This",1003,"Thank you, Tom, and let me add my welcome to all of you joining us on today's call. We continued business momentum in Q2, which showed -- with strong revenues above our guidance, driven mainly by subscription revenue, which grew 20% in U.S. dollars. This growth was highlighted by 18% growth for our infrastructure offerings, combined with 33% growth for our application development and emerging technologies. 
Our growth was driven in part by expanding our footprint with customers as we closed a record number of deals over $1 million, up approximately 60% year-over-year. Digital transformation and hybrid cloud computing are changing how applications are built, deployed and managed. As organizations adopt agile application development technologies, such as Linux Containers, they are increasingly relying on Red Hat as their strategic partner to monetize -- to modernize their infrastructure and application development platforms. These trends are reflected in our results. 
With that overview, let me discuss some of the recent business and technology highlights for the quarter. At the beginning of Q2, we held our largest ever Red Hat Summit event, with record attendance, up 10% compared to last year. We showcased our portfolio of technologies, customer success stories and partner traction. Let me summarize some of the exciting announcements from the Summit.
Starting with Linux Containers. This year's summit was all about containers. We extended our offerings around OpenShift, which is our container platform, so it is now available across a number of environments. We have OpenShift for developers that can be run on laptops. We have OpenShift for the lab that enables developers to move easily from desk to dev to test. And as the application moves into production, we have OpenShift Enterprise. We cover the life cycle of an application with our end-to-end platform, and because these 3 offerings are the same platform, customers will not have to retool their platform to build their container applications. 
The developer experience is designed to be similar from the day they first start writing code for their new application until they provision and manage mission-critical application for live deployment. 
In Middleware, we released JBoss EAP 7. It has been optimized for hybrid cloud computing environments, and when deployed with Red Hat OpenShift, EAP 7 offers the benefits of containers, load balancing, elastic scaling, health monitoring and the ability to deploy containers directly, which can improve the developer experience and productivity. 
In addition, JBoss EAP with OpenShift contributes to a more architecturally efficient DevOps environment since overlapping features are no longer needed. We also announced the general availability of Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 7. The latest version of Red Hat's in-memory data management technology introduces enhancements to help organizations generate insights for continuous business optimization through real-time data analytics, contributing to greater agility and competitiveness. 
In our storage portfolio, we announced Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 with several new capabilities that enhance support for object storage workloads and promote greater ease-of-use. This latest version of the product is the most significant update to Red Hat Ceph Storage to date. We believe our customers will find Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 to be a fully featured, technically advanced storage platform that's easier to use and helps them manage this vast quantities of data. 
On the management side, we continue to evolve our offerings with new versions of Ansible Tower 3 and Red Hat Insights launched at Summit. Following up on these announcements, we recently launched Red Hat Virtualization 4, which introduces new and enhanced capabilities around performance, management and automation. RHEV 4 introduces support for OpenStack and Linux Containers to run with enhanced security and reliability. This type of leadership in innovation enabled us to be recognized as the only company included in the Visionaries quadrant of Gartner's Magic Quadrant for x86 Server Virtualization Infrastructure. We believe that this position reinforces our continued innovation, momentum and strong vision for an open, high-performance virtualization alternative.
Rounding out our portfolio of hybrid cloud solutions, we recently introduced OpenStack Platform 9 or OSP 9. It builds on the proven, trusted foundation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux to provide critical dependencies needed in production OpenStack environments. It is a production-ready OpenStack distribution that offers automated upgrade and update paths for mission-critical operations. OSP 9 brings significant updates to the mainstream -- the  Mitaka [ph] version of the -- of OpenStack. Overall, OSP, backed by a robust ecosystem of partners, including Cisco, Dell, Intel and Lenovo, has emerged as a proven solution to power private clouds across hundreds of customers worldwide, such as BBVA, Cambridge University, FICO, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Paddy Power Betfair, Santander Bank and Verizon. 
In summer, we are pleased to close out the first half of our fiscal year on a strong note, and we're even more excited about Red Hat's future. We believe that Red Hat is uniquely positioned to benefit from long-term secular changes in IT infrastructure that companies are deploying to support their businesses. We are delivering innovation and enterprise capabilities to the open source marketplace at a rapid pace. In doing so, we continue to build out a portfolio of technologies and capabilities to enable our customers to enjoy the benefits associated with the digital transformation and hybrid cloud computing as they develop their applications. 
We remain optimistic about our outlook for the remainder of the year, as Frank will detail in a moment. As a final note, this past quarter, Linux celebrated its 25th year since its creation. And I want to recognize and thank the creative energy of the open-source community, including the many Red Hat associates that have continued to drive innovation and helped to build Red Hat. Collaboration with the open-source community and the focused efforts of associates around the globe has enabled Red Hat to be recognized once again as one of Forbes Most Innovative Companies. This is a key reason that Red Hat is trusted as one of the strategic technology providers to enterprises around the world. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Frank."
33679,382458172,1049594,"Red Hat, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Sep 21, 2016",2016-09-21,"Earnings Calls","Red Hat, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Our business continues to demonstrate good momentum and strong execution by our global teams. We exceeded our guidance across a number of metrics in Q2. The strength in our subscription revenue continued to drive our results, highlighted b",1435,"Thank you, Jim. Our business continues to demonstrate good momentum and strong execution by our global teams. We exceeded our guidance across a number of metrics in Q2. The strength in our subscription revenue continued to drive our results, highlighted by accelerated revenue growth in our core infrastructure offerings and high revenue growth in our portfolio of new technology that enable hybrid cloud computing and digital transformation.
Let me begin with the financial highlights of our Q2 performance. For a more detailed view of our results and for reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to GAAP, please refer to our earnings press release and the slide deck with financial highlights and supplemental metrics. These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results or rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results.
Similar to Q1, currency rate volatility has stabilized year-over-year, for example, on a constant-currency basis, using rates from Q2 last year, total revenue growth would've been 18% or approximately 70 basis points lower. I will keep my prepared remarks focused on our reported USD results where appropriate, and you will find a table of constant-currency results in our press release. 
I'm pleased to announce total revenue of $600 million, above the high end of our guidance and representing growth of 19% in U.S. dollars. This result was driven mainly by modestly better-than-expected sales performance and additional revenue related to our education and compliance program.
As I discussed, subscription revenue continued to be the largest driver of our growth as $531 million for the quarter, an increase of 20% year-over-year. This mainly renewable revenue stream now constitutes 89% of total revenue, providing us with a large base to expand our relationships with our customers. 
We continue to drive high growth across our technology portfolio. Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $427 million, an increase of 18% year-over-year. Our application development-related and emerging technologies subscription revenue was $104 million, an increase of 33% year-over-year. Application development-related and emerging technologies revenue was approximately 17% of total revenue, and that's up 180 basis points from a year-ago quarter.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $137 million grew 11% year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating margin was 22.8%, which is consistent with the operating margin direction we provided on our last call, and up 100 basis points from Q1. As a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjusts for noncash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combinations.
Using our estimated annual effective tax rate of 27%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.55, which was $0.01 above our guidance and up 17% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2 billion. We returned $127 million to shareholders in the quarter through the repurchase of approximately 1.8 million shares of stock. This is one of our largest direct repurchases in the quarter and reflects our commitment to return value to shareholders with our recent $1 billion repurchase authorization.
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $1.7 billion, an increase of $267 million or 19% over the same quarter a year ago. On a constant-currency basis, total deferred revenue was up 17%. Operating cash flow was $97 million for the quarter compared to $123 million in the year-ago quarter. Comparing the 2 quarters, our days sales outstanding was 1 day better than Q2 last year at 57 days on an FX-adjusted basis. However, the majority of our strong second quarter billings performance occurred in the last month of the quarter and contributed to a sequential increase of $31 million in our accounts receivable balance.
In addition, our first-half investments in our hybrid cloud technologies and sales capabilities led to an increase in expense of $20 million year-over-year. Some of this expense led to a higher use of operating cash flow. Although predicting the timing of cash inflows and outflows can be a difficult ability on a quarterly basis, we remain comfortable with our full year cash flow guidance, which includes our assumption of higher revenue, seasonally higher billings, increased non-GAAP operating margin for the remainder of the fiscal year and the slightly different linearity of cash flows.
The rolling 4-quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement to the last 4 quarters. On a rolling 4-quarters basis, the billings proxy was $620 million, up 17% on a constant-currency basis and 15% U.S. dollars year-over-year.
I will now review the metrics for the business momentum and large deals in the quarter. All of our geographies saw double-digit growth in bookings, with particular strength in EMEA and Asia Pacific. This quarter, 57% of bookings came from the Americas, 24% from EMEA, and 19% from Asia Pacific. And this is versus a 60/22/18 split in Q2 last year. 
The Q2 route-to-market mix was 81% from the channel and 19% from our direct sales force, and this compares to a 75/25 split in Q2 of last year. This is the large portion of channel business in a quarter and reflects channel strength across our major geographies.
Our proxy for bookings duration was 22 months, and that's up approximately 1.5 months from Q2 of last year, and that's driven in part by growth in deals over $1 million. In fact, this was a record second quarter for large deals, with 55 deals over $1 million, which was up 60% year-over-year. This traction highlights Red Hat's growing strategic importance in our customers' data centers and our talented sales teams' ability to land and expand our wallet share of IT dollars.
Looking sequentially at our top 30 largest deal metrics, all of the deals were $1 million or more, and 5 of those deals were in excess of $5 million. Cross-selling was strong, with over 70% of the top 30 deals, including one or more components from one group of application development and emerging technologies offerings.
Financial services and government were our top verticals in Q2. Within our top 25 renewal business, we renewed 23 of the top 25 deals that we were expecting. The total subscription value of these top 25 renewals was approximately 105% of the prior value. 1 of the 2 deals that did not renew was related to a government agency project that was canceled. This agency continues to rely on Red Hat technologies, including a 6-figure deal that closed in the quarter. The second deal that did not renew was lost to an on-premise legacy Linux distribution. We are still engaged with this customer in other areas of their business. And as with a few times in the past this has happened, we are optimistic that we can win back the lost portion over time as a result of our award-winning service and innovation.
Substituting these 2 deals within the next 2 deals up for renewal, the revised top 25 deals that did renew were approximately 115% higher than the prior year value. Given the growth in million-dollar deals this quarter, we are clearly driving larger wallet share by taking a number of 6-figure deals and expanding them to million-dollar-plus renewals.
Now I'd like to turn to the guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and foreign exchange. We are raising our full year revenue guidance to $2,415,000,000 to $2.435 billion, which is up approximately $15 million in U.S. dollars at the high end of the previous range. We are reaffirming our non-GAAP operating margin at approximately 23%. We are reaffirming the operating cash flow in the range from $800 million to $820 million. Given our revenue guidance, our target for full year non-GAAP earnings per share is estimated to be approximately $2.23 to $2.25 per share, assuming a 27% annual effective tax rate, approximately $1 million to $2 million per quarter forecast for other income.
For Q3 specifically, this implies the following outlook: we expect revenue to be in the range of $613 million to $623 million, which is up 19% in U.S. dollars at the high end of the range or 18% in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 23.3% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58. Consistent with prior practices, I will not forecast quarterly cash flow given the variability of cash inflows and outflows.
Overall, we are very pleased with our financial performance in the first half of FY '17. We continue to see strong global demand for our hybrid cloud technology as organizations continue to modernize their infrastructure platform and their application development platform.

So you have acceleration in the revenue growth, the acceleration in the EPS growth, acceleration in the billings growth, et cetera. But I wanted to ask you specifically just about the acceleration and the upside in the subscription revenue. It's a little unusual to see that much upside in that line. And so Jim, I'm curious if the public cloud adoption through Azure and AWS and all of the other public clouds is playing a larger role in that. Because we had heard some very strong feedback on the adoption and uptake in that specific area. And as kind of a part B, is the transition from the test and dev activity to the production environments kind of giving you a larger opportunity set there?"

As enterprises look to move their application portfolio of kind of production workload, that certainly helps us. I think there's a couple of things that helps us in a hybrid cloud environment. If you look purely on premise, roughly half the workloads run on Windows, right? I mean it's just -- and so -- I don't want to think we're locked out because we didn't compete for that, but kind of half of traditional workloads we just didn't quite address because they're Windows. As soon as you start thinking about a hybrid cloud world i.e. workloads might run on premise, so they might run on cloud, that by definition is going to be -- I don't want to say, but it's the highly likely 90% of those are going to be on Linux. So that helps us both to see obviously very significant growth on public cloud, but more broadly, I think it helps us with our adoption even of core Linux in kind of hybrid cloud environments, which is both on-premise as well as in public cloud. So the hybrid cloud model and the fact that public clouds are starting to take share of workloads is actually kind of a -- it's a tailwind for our business."

And through the second quarter, it totally confirms that the large customers that are actually using the public cloud with us are also growing substantially their business on the private side, too. So really reinforces the whole hybrid cloud model that we have with our customers and how it's growing. So that's I think a good indication, and we support of the hybrid cloud environment for the majority, if not all of our customers."

Our constant-currency expenses grew at 22%. And as we talked about in the past",429,"Sure. So if you look at kind of the dynamics of what we saw in the first half of the year, our constant-currency revenue grew about 18%. This is for the first half of the year. Our constant-currency expenses grew at 22%. And as we talked about in the past, coming off of the end of last year, our objective for the first half of this year was to front-load a lot of our investments and really focus those investments on application development and emerging technology. And so throughout the first half, and you can see that with some of our headcount numbers as well, we added probably, in addition, 1,000 employees. So that headcount is up about 25% year-on-year in the first half, primarily in sales, driving capacity to help support future growth around the app dev and emerging technology. We also delivered strong billings growth, right, 18% for the first half, which I think is a good indication of the business momentum. Now in the second half, so that's pretty much -- if you look at what I just laid out especially with the expense, that had an impact on the cash for the second quarter with the $97 million that we announced. It also -- we mentioned earlier that some of the transactions that we had, especially large ones, came in later in the quarter. And so that increased the AR [ph] , so there was a lighter amount of collections in the quarter to the magnitude of about $31 million. So that's kind of the dynamics for the first half. If we look at the second half of the year, aligned with the guidance that we just gave, we're expecting our seasonally stronger billings to contribute to cash flow, as you would expect especially in Q4. We're forecasting about 16% constant-currency revenue growth when you look at the second half, based on -- that's at the low end, 16% to kind of 18% range. And we're also forecasting 16% operating expense growth. And that's really driven by -- kind of offset to the amount of investment that we made in the first half of the year. So we're bringing the investment levels down in the back half and pretty much leveraging the investments that we've made, as I said, in the application dev and emerging technology. So with those dynamics, we feel comfortable with the guidance that we gave, both to the top line for our expense as well as our cash flow, and that cash flow is in that $800 million to $820 million."

And I think those things are helping as well. Even with core Linux, we're -- I know we talked about where we are in relative adoption but there's what I'll call the late majority, which is just going from using it in components to making it their mainstream operating system. I think especially again that's the tailwind we're getting as those companies prepare to move to cloud or starting to move to cloud, most likely, they're not going to go with Windows, they're going to go with Linux. And so that just accelerates the share of their production applications that are running on Linux.

As you think about a container platform and the need to understand the provenance or the content as you think about the software development lifecycle around that, to think about orchestration, these large, sophisticated customers are really gravitating towards OpenShift. And that was, I think, reflected as well with some of the strength that you saw in financial services. Overall, in macro, I think there's a huge change that we've seen in the last couple of quarters. I think budgets are relatively tight in IT but that's in many ways, good for us as we're seeing that they partner to help carve out costs."

So was it -- can we infer that the cloud contribution which obviously doesn't come off your balance sheet was part of the reason for that? I guess, was there something else going on this quarter that had subscription sort of outperformed so much more than what we would thought given it's a recurring revenue number?

And then if the infrastructure doing really well, you think that it comes with a higher margin associated with it, given it's a more mature business? But I assume your sales guys can sell either, so maybe thinking about infrastructure accelerating doesn't necessarily coalesce as the kind of margin upside you would think about normally. Can you just -- I don't know, maybe I'm not thinking about it correctly but I think you understand the point I'm trying to get out."

And therefore, with that, you would expect that, that's driving more of the profit and the cash, true. So as that grows at a faster rate, that is contributing more. On the other side, we're making investments to help, as I said before, to grow the portfolio so that we can better balance and think about the growth for the future on the emerging and the app dev. From a sales perspective, we don't encourage or measure the sales team based on whether they sell one or the other from the standpoint of the profitability, I'm on the profitability piece. What they do focus on in the sales organization is looking at the total customer and looking at what the needs of the customer is sustaining that account over a period of time. And again, the objective in all our customers from their side and also from our side is to continue to sell a broader portfolio. So the emphasis on yes, RHEL is important and we do need to continue to sell RHEL, but that helps build the platform for the additional products that we leverage on top of that."

It's not necessarily upstream feature development for the exact reason that you mentioned which is the upstream community does a lot of the upstream feature development. We're obviously involved in a number of those components but the majority of our expense is sustaining engineering. We certainly would expect that as we think about the products across the board. Again, coming back to profitability, sales and marketing is a larger share of the expense. So that's one where whenever we have a new product, there's a higher expense associated with that. Well, we've just looked this up structurally against any of our products, that maturity, I don't -- we don't have any reason to believe that any of our products will be less profitable than Linux. And if we look at renewal rates, those are typically similar over time across product lines. I think we look at kind of the relative engineering against that sustaining engineers looks similar.

Because at the Analyst Day, I talked about the 3 different options. Wanted to go more heavily towards, as Jim was just talking about, operating system or RHEL and that clearly would have a better leverage model in the short term. The other extreme would go more heavily toward emerging market. I think that would accelerate the growth but cause a margin deterioration in the short-term. We are going with a balanced approach. This year, as I've just mentioned, it's to invest in the first half of the year. Clearly if you look at the margin profile, first of this year versus the second half of this year, you'll start to see an improvement in the margin in the back half of the year. I think that's pretty much the dynamics of how we're making the investment. As we continue to continue to get momentum on the, let's say, the app dev and the emerging technology products as we go into '18, I think that will allow us a better view of where we think to what extent we really think we can get potentially, some slight margin improvement. So I would say we want to close out the back half of the year with guidance that we just gave. We're in the midst right now of already starting our planning for re-upping the next couple of years. And I think as we get into the beginning of next year, I think we'll have a better view of what that model may look like over a period of years, and we'll be more than happy to share that.

This",999,"Thank you, Tom, and let me add my welcome to all of you joining us on today's call. We continued business momentum in Q2, which showed -- with strong revenues above our guidance, driven mainly by subscription revenue, which grew 20% in U.S. dollars. This growth was highlighted by 18% growth for our infrastructure offerings, combined with 33% growth for our application development and emerging technologies. 
Our growth was driven in part by expanding our footprint with customers as we closed a record number of deals over $1 million, up approximately 60% year-over-year. Digital transformation and hybrid cloud computing are changing how applications are built, deployed and managed. As organizations adopt agile application development technologies, such as Linux Containers, they are increasingly relying on Red Hat as their strategic partner to monetize -- to modernize their infrastructure and application development platforms. These trends are reflected in our results. 
With that overview, let me discuss some of the recent business and technology highlights for the quarter. At the beginning of Q2, we held our largest ever Red Hat Summit event, with record attendance, up 10% compared to last year. We showcased our portfolio of technologies, customer success stories and partner traction. Let me summarize some of the exciting announcements from the Summit.
Starting with Linux Containers. This year's summit was all about containers. We extended our offerings around OpenShift, which is our container platform, so it is now available across a number of environments. We have OpenShift for developers that can be run on laptops. We have OpenShift for the lab that enables developers to move easily from dev to test. And as applications move into production, we have OpenShift Enterprise. We cover the life cycle of an application with our end-to-end platform, and because these 3 offerings are the same platform, customers will not have to retool their platform to build their container applications. 
The developer experience is designed to be similar from the day they first start writing code for their new application until they provision and manage a mission-critical application for live deployment. 
In Middleware, we released JBoss EAP 7. It has been optimized for hybrid cloud computing environments, and when deployed with Red Hat OpenShift, EAP 7 offers the benefits of containers, load balancing, elastic scaling, health monitoring and the ability to deploy containers directly, which can improve the developer experience and productivity. 
In addition, JBoss EAP with OpenShift contributes to a more architecturally efficient DevOps environment since overlapping features are no longer needed. We also announced the general availability of Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 7. The latest version of Red Hat's in-memory data management technology introduces enhancements to help organizations generate insights for continuous business optimization through real-time data analytics, contributing to greater agility and competitiveness. 
In our storage portfolio, we announced Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 with several new capabilities that enhance support for object storage workloads and promote greater ease-of-use. This latest version of the product is the most significant update to Red Hat Ceph Storage to date. We believe our customers will find Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 to be a fully featured, technically advanced storage platform that's easier to use and helps them manage vast quantities of data. 
On the management side, we continue to evolve our offerings with new versions of Ansible Tower 3 and Red Hat Insights launched at Summit. Following up on these announcements, we recently launched Red Hat Virtualization 4, which introduces new and enhanced capabilities around performance, management and automation. RHEV 4 introduces support for OpenStack and Linux Containers to run with enhanced security and reliability. This type of leadership in innovation enabled us to be recognized as the only company included in the Visionaries quadrant of Gartner's Magic Quadrant for x86 Server Virtualization Infrastructure. We believe that this position reinforces our continued innovation, momentum and strong vision for an open, high-performance virtualization alternative.
Rounding out our portfolio of hybrid cloud solutions, we recently introduced OpenStack Platform 9 or OSP 9. It builds on the proven, trusted foundation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux to provide critical dependencies needed in production OpenStack environments. It is a production-ready OpenStack distribution that offers automated upgrade and update paths for mission-critical operations. OSP 9 brings significant updates to the mainstream -- the Mikata version of the -- of OpenStack. Overall, OSP, backed by a robust ecosystem of partners, including Cisco, Dell, Intel and Lenovo, has emerged as a proven solution to power private clouds across hundreds of customers worldwide, such as BBVA, Cambridge University, FICO, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Paddy Power Betfair, Santander Bank and Verizon. 
In summary, we are pleased to close out the first half of our fiscal year on a strong note, and we're even more excited about Red Hat's future. We believe that Red Hat is uniquely positioned to benefit from long-term secular changes in IT infrastructure that companies are deploying to support their businesses. We are delivering innovation and enterprise capabilities to the open source marketplace at a rapid pace. In doing so, we continue to build out a portfolio of technologies and capabilities to enable our customers to enjoy the benefits associated with the digital transformation and hybrid cloud computing as they develop their applications. 
We remain optimistic about our outlook for the remainder of the year, as Frank will detail in a moment. As a final note, this past quarter, Linux celebrated its 25th year since its creation. And I want to recognize and thank the creative energy of the open-source community, including the many Red Hat associates that have continued to drive innovation and helped to build Red Hat. Collaboration with the open-source community and the focused efforts of associates around the globe has enabled Red Hat to be recognized once again as one of Forbes Most Innovative Companies. This is a key reason that Red Hat is trusted as one of the strategic technology providers to enterprises around the world. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Frank."
33679,382458172,1049617,"Red Hat, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Sep 21, 2016",2016-09-21,"Earnings Calls","Red Hat, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Our business continues to demonstrate good momentum and strong execution by our global teams. We exceeded our guidance across a number of metrics in Q2. The strength in our subscription revenue continued to drive our results, highlighted b",1436,"Thank you, Jim. Our business continues to demonstrate good momentum and strong execution by our global teams. We exceeded our guidance across a number of metrics in Q2. The strength in our subscription revenue continued to drive our results, highlighted by accelerated revenue growth in our core infrastructure offerings and high revenue growth in our portfolio of new technology that enable hybrid cloud computing and digital transformation.
Let me begin with the financial highlights of our Q2 performance. For a more detailed view of our results and for reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to GAAP, please refer to our earnings press release and the slide deck with financial highlights and supplemental metrics. These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results or rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results.
Similar to Q1, currency rate volatility has stabilized year-over-year, for example, on a constant-currency basis, using rates from Q2 last year, total revenue growth would've been 18% or approximately 70 basis points lower. I will keep my prepared remarks focused on our reported USD results where appropriate, and you will find a table of constant-currency results in our press release. 
I'm pleased to announce total revenue of $600 million, above the high end of our guidance and representing growth of 19% in U.S. dollars. This result was driven mainly by modestly better-than-expected sales performance and additional revenue related to our education and compliance program.
As I discussed, subscription revenue continued to be the largest driver of our growth as $531 million for the quarter, an increase of 20% year-over-year. This mainly renewable revenue stream now constitutes 89% of total revenue, providing us with a large base to expand our relationships with our customers. 
We continue to drive high growth across our technology portfolio. Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $427 million, an increase of 18% year-over-year. Our application development-related and emerging technologies subscription revenue was $104 million, an increase of 33% year-over-year. Application development-related and emerging technologies revenue was approximately 17% of total revenue, and that's up 180 basis points from a year-ago quarter.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $137 million grew 11% year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating margin was 22.8%, which is consistent with the operating margin direction we provided on our last call, and up 100 basis points from Q1. As a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjusts for noncash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combinations.
Using our estimated annual effective tax rate of 27%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.55, which was $0.01 above our guidance and up 17% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2 billion. We returned $127 million to shareholders in the quarter through the repurchase of approximately 1.8 million shares of stock. This is one of our largest direct repurchases in the quarter and reflects our commitment to return value to shareholders with our recent $1 billion repurchase authorization.
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $1.7 billion, an increase of $267 million or 19% over the same quarter a year ago. On a constant-currency basis, total deferred revenue was up 17%. Operating cash flow was $97 million for the quarter compared to $123 million in the year-ago quarter. Comparing the 2 quarters, our days sales outstanding was 1 day better than Q2 last year at 57 days on an FX-adjusted basis. However, the majority of our strong second quarter billings performance occurred in the last month of the quarter and contributed to a sequential increase of $31 million in our accounts receivable balance.
In addition, our first-half investments in our hybrid cloud technologies and sales capabilities led to an increase in expense of $20 million year-over-year. Some of this expense led to a higher use of operating cash flow. Although predicting the timing of cash inflows and outflows can be a difficult ability on a quarterly basis, we remain comfortable with our full year cash flow guidance, which includes our assumption of higher revenue, seasonally higher billings, increased non-GAAP operating margin for the remainder of the fiscal year and the slightly different linearity of cash flows.
The rolling 4-quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on a cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters. On a rolling 4-quarters basis, the billings proxy was $620 million, up 17% on a constant-currency basis and 15% U.S. dollars year-over-year.
I will now review the metrics for the business momentum and large deals in the quarter. All of our geographies saw double-digit growth in bookings, with particular strength in EMEA and Asia Pacific. This quarter, 57% of bookings came from the Americas, 24% from EMEA, and 19% from Asia Pacific. And this is versus a 60/22/18 split in Q2 of last year. 
The Q2 route-to-market mix was 81% from the channel and 19% from our direct sales force, and this compares to a 75/25 split in Q2 of last year. This is the large portion of channel business in a quarter and reflects channel strength across our major geographies.
Our proxy for bookings duration was 22 months, and that's up approximately 1.5 months from Q2 of last year, and that's driven in part by growth in deals over $1 million. In fact, this was a record second quarter for large deals, with 55 deals over $1 million, which was up 60% year-over-year. This traction highlights Red Hat's growing strategic importance in our customers' data centers and our talented sales teams' ability to land and expand our wallet share of IT dollars.
Looking sequentially at our top 30 largest deal metrics, all of the deals were $1 million or more, and 5 of those deals were in excess of $5 million. Cross-selling was strong, with over 70% of the top 30 deals, including one or more components from one group of application development and emerging technologies offerings.
Financial services and government were our top verticals in Q2. Within our top 25 renewal business, we renewed 23 of the top 25 deals that we were expecting. The total subscription value of these top 25 renewals was approximately 105% of the prior value. 1 of the 2 deals that did not renew was related to a government agency project that was canceled. This agency continues to rely on Red Hat technologies, including a 6-figure deal that closed in the quarter. The second deal that did not renew was lost to an on-premise legacy Linux distribution. We are still engaged with this customer in other areas of their business. And as with a few times in the past this has happened, we are optimistic that we can win back the lost portion over time as a result of our award-winning service and innovation.
Substituting these 2 deals within the next 2 deals up for renewal, the revised top 25 deals that did renew were approximately 115% higher than the prior year value. Given the growth in million-dollar deals this quarter, we are clearly driving larger wallet share by taking a number of 6-figure deals and expanding them to million-dollar-plus renewals.
Now I'd like to turn to the guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and foreign exchange. We are raising our full year revenue guidance to $2,415,000,000 to $2.435 billion, which is up approximately $15 million in U.S. dollars at the high end of the previous range. We are reaffirming our non-GAAP operating margin at approximately 23%. We are reaffirming the operating cash flow in the range from $800 million to $820 million. Given our revenue guidance, our target for full year non-GAAP earnings per share is estimated to be approximately $2.23 to $2.25 per share, assuming a 27% annual effective tax rate, approximately $1 million to $2 million per quarter forecast for other income.
For Q3 specifically, this implies the following outlook: we expect revenue to be in the range of $613 million to $623 million, which is up 19% in U.S. dollars at the high end of the range or 18% in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 23.3% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58. Consistent with prior practices, I will not forecast quarterly cash flow given the variability of cash inflows and outflows.
Overall, we are very pleased with our financial performance in the first half of FY '17. We continue to see strong global demand for our hybrid cloud technology as organizations continue to modernize their infrastructure platform and their application development platform.

And we make it very easy with Cloud Access, where people use those subscriptions on-premise or across public cloud. And so we really already have a pretty good hybrid cloud mode. You're right in that we have some customers are coming to us and asking for a true consumption model, kind of pay-as-you-go, and we're working through the details. I'm actually encouraged. The very large customers that we've talked to about that said -- will even say, we recognize that will cost us more than we are paying you today because we're not committing to volumes. But we still think that, that flexibility is worth it for us. And so we're in active discussions with a number of customers as we work out exactly what that model is.

But I wanted to ask you specifically just about the acceleration and the upside in the subscription revenue. It's a little unusual to see that much upside in that line. And so, Jim, I'm curious if the public cloud adoption through Azure and AWS and all of the other public clouds is playing a larger role in that. Because we had heard some very strong feedback on the adoption and uptake in that specific area. And as kind of a part B, is the transition from the test and dev activity to the production environments kind of giving you a larger opportunity set there?"

As enterprises look to move their application portfolio of kind of production workloads, that certainly helps us. I think there's a couple of things that helps us in a hybrid cloud environment. If you look purely on premise, roughly half the workloads run on Windows, right? I mean it's just -- and so -- I don't want to say we're locked out because we do compete for that, but kind of half of traditional workloads we just didn't quite address because they're Windows. As soon as you start thinking about a hybrid cloud world, i.e. workloads that might run on premise or they might run on cloud, that by definition is going to be -- I don't want to say, but it's highly likely 90% of those are going to be on Linux. So that helps us both to see obviously very significant growth on public cloud, but more broadly, I think it helps us with our adoption even of core Linux in kind of hybrid cloud environments, which is both on-premise as well as in public cloud. So the hybrid cloud model and the fact that public clouds are starting to take share of workloads is actually kind of a -- it's a tailwind for our business."

So if you look at kind of the dynamics of what we saw in the first half of the year, our constant-currency revenue grew about 18%. This is for the first half of the year. Our constant-currency expenses grew at 22%. And as we talked about in the past, coming off of the end of last year, our objective for the first half of this year was to front-load a lot of our investments and really focus those investments on application development and emerging technologies. And so throughout the first half, and you can see that with some of our headcount numbers as well, we added probably, in addition, 1,000 employees. So that headcount was up about 25% year-on-year in the first half, primarily in sales, driving capacity to help support future growth around the app dev and emerging technologies. We also delivered strong billings growth, right, 18% for the first half, which I think is a good indication of the business momentum. Now in the second half, so that's pretty much -- if you look at what I just laid out especially with the expense, that had an impact on the cash for the second quarter with the $97 million that we announced. It also -- we mentioned earlier that some of the transactions that we had, especially the larger ones, came in later in the quarter. And so that increased the AR, so there was a lighter amount of collections in the quarter to the magnitude of about $31 million. So that's kind of the dynamics for the first half. If we look at the second half of the year, aligned with the guidance that we just gave, we're expecting our seasonally stronger billings to contribute to cash flow, as you would expect especially in Q4. We're forecasting about 16% constant-currency revenue growth when you look at the second half, based on -- that's at the low end, 16% to kind of 18% range. And we're also forecasting 16% operating expense growth. And that's really driven by -- kind of offset to the amount of investment that we made in the first half of the year. So we're bringing the investment levels down in the back half and pretty much leveraging the investments that we've made, as I said, in the application dev and emerging technologies. So with those dynamics, we feel comfortable with the guidance that we gave, both for the top line for our expense as well as our cash flow, and that cash flow is in that $800 million to $820 million."

I think especially again that's the tailwind we're getting as those companies prepare to move to cloud or starting to move to cloud, most likely, they're not going to go with Windows, they're going to go with Linux.

In terms of channel, some of our larger deals, and particularly in EMEA where the vast majority of our business goes through channels. When it's stronger, you see the channel mix pick up there. And so I think one of the things you're seeing there are some of the larger deals were fulfilled via distribution, which kind of ticked it up. I wouldn't expect it to stay at 81% over the next couple of quarters. Some of that was just some of the larger deals that just happened to fulfill that way."

We have had a substantial increase in the business since the acquisition. We've seen great alignment. Many companies, as they do acquisitions, struggle as far as the integration. That has been the complete opposite for us, great alignment across Red Hat and the Ansible team globally. And it's been a leading element of our management portfolio in such a short period of time. On the 3scale side, it's fairly new. But in the short period of time, again, the integration is going well.

We need to work as we go forward to potentially come up with a better measure for you so you can better gauge the trend around that. What would we say overall is the fact that we grew the number of deals over $1 million by 60%. None of those were net new customers, I don't think.

If I had to be a little cynical on that, I would say some of these larger deals take a while and our sales force probably took a breath at the end of Q4 and then started working on some of these large deals and they didn't close until Q2. But as we're seeing, especially a lot of traction around OpenShift in financial services, which is great to see. As you think about a container platform and the need to understand the provenance of the content as you think about the software development lifecycle around that, to think about orchestration, these large, sophisticated customers are really gravitating towards OpenShift. And that was, I think, reflected as well with some of the strength that you saw in financial services.

On the other side, we're making investments to help, as I said before, to grow the portfolio so that we can better balance and think about the growth for the future on the emerging and the app dev. From a sales perspective, we don't encourage or measure the sales team based on whether they sell one or the other from the standpoint of the profitability, I'm on the profitability piece. What they do focus on in the sales organization is looking at the total customer and looking at what the needs of the customer is sustaining that account over a period of time. And again, the objective in all our customers from their side and also from our side is to continue to sell a broader portfolio.

And again, as people think about modern, whether that's PaaS or just more modern types of Middleware microservices, all of that's a net positive for us."

The vast majority of our engineering expense around Linux is the downstream sustaining engineering around our releases. It's not necessarily upstream feature development for the exact reason that you mentioned which is the upstream community does a lot of the upstream feature development. We're obviously involved in a number of those components but the majority of our expense is sustaining engineering. We certainly would expect that as we think about the products across the board. Again, coming back to profitability, sales and marketing is a larger share of the expense. So that's one where whenever you have a new product, there's a higher expense associated with that. Well, we've just looked this up structurally against any of our products, at maturity, I don't -- we don't have any reason to believe that any of our products will be less profitable than Linux. And if we look at renewal rates, those are typically similar over time across product lines. I think we look at kind of the relative engineering against that sustaining engineering, it should look similar. So I think at similar levels of maturity, so far, we think the portfolio will look similar. It's just obviously, we're in different stages of maturity across the portfolio."

Because at the Analyst Day, I talked about the 3 different options. Wanted to go more heavily towards, as Jim was just talking about, operating system or RHEL and that clearly would have a better leverage model in the short term. The other extreme would go more heavily toward emerging markets. I think that would accelerate the growth but cause a margin deterioration in the short-term. We are going with a balanced approach. This year, as I've just mentioned, it's to invest in the first half of the year. Clearly if you look at the margin profile, first half of this year versus the second half of this year, you'll start to see an improvement in the margin in the back half of the year. I think that's pretty much the dynamics of how we're making the investment. As we continue to continue to get momentum on the, let's say, the app dev and the emerging technology products as we go into '18, I think that will allow us a better view of where we think to what extent we really think we can get potentially, some slight margin improvement. So I would say we want to close out the back half of the year with the guidance that we just gave. We're in the midst right now of already starting our planning for re-upping the next couple of years. And I think as we get into the beginning of next year, I think we'll have a better view of what that model may look like over a period of years, and we'll be more than happy to share that. And that's pretty much the takeaway coming off of a lot of conversations that many of you and I and Tom had, following the Analyst Day. So we're working on that as far as our planning and we'll bring that forward when we think about the start of the new year."

This",999,"Thank you, Tom, and let me add my welcome to all of you joining us on today's call. We continued business momentum in Q2, which showed -- with strong revenues above our guidance, driven mainly by subscription revenue, which grew 20% in U.S. dollars. This growth was highlighted by 18% growth for our infrastructure offerings, combined with 33% growth for our application development and emerging technologies. 
Our growth was driven in part by expanding our footprint with customers as we closed a record number of deals over $1 million, up approximately 60% year-over-year. Digital transformation and hybrid cloud computing are changing how applications are built, deployed and managed. As organizations adopt agile application development technologies, such as Linux Containers, they are increasingly relying on Red Hat as their strategic partner to monetize -- to modernize their infrastructure and application development platforms. These trends are reflected in our results. 
With that overview, let me discuss some of the recent business and technology highlights for the quarter. At the beginning of Q2, we held our largest ever Red Hat Summit event, with record attendance, up 10% compared to last year. We showcased our portfolio of technologies, customer success stories and partner traction. Let me summarize some of the exciting announcements from the Summit.
Starting with Linux Containers. This year's summit was all about containers. We extended our offerings around OpenShift, which is our container platform, so it is now available across a number of environments. We have OpenShift for developers that can be run on laptops. We have OpenShift for the lab that enables developers to move easily from dev to test. And as applications move into production, we have OpenShift Enterprise. We cover the life cycle of an application with our end-to-end platform, and because these 3 offerings are the same platform, customers will not have to retool their platform to build their container applications. 
The developer experience is designed to be similar from the day they first start writing code for their new application until they provision and manage a mission-critical application for live deployment. 
In Middleware, we released JBoss EAP 7. It has been optimized for hybrid cloud computing environments, and when deployed with Red Hat OpenShift, EAP 7 offers the benefits of containers, load balancing, elastic scaling, health monitoring and the ability to deploy containers directly, which can improve the developer experience and productivity. 
In addition, JBoss EAP with OpenShift contributes to a more architecturally efficient DevOps environment since overlapping features are no longer needed. We also announced the general availability of Red Hat JBoss Data Grid 7. The latest version of Red Hat's in-memory data management technology introduces enhancements to help organizations generate insights for continuous business optimization through real-time data analytics, contributing to greater agility and competitiveness. 
In our storage portfolio, we announced Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 with several new capabilities that enhance support for object storage workloads and promote greater ease-of-use. This latest version of the product is the most significant update to Red Hat Ceph Storage to date. We believe our customers will find Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 to be a fully featured, technically advanced storage platform that's easier to use and helps them manage vast quantities of data. 
On the management side, we continue to evolve our offerings with new versions of Ansible Tower 3 and Red Hat Insights launched at Summit. Following up on these announcements, we recently launched Red Hat Virtualization 4, which introduces new and enhanced capabilities around performance, management and automation. RHEV 4 introduces support for OpenStack and Linux Containers to run with enhanced security and reliability. This type of leadership in innovation enabled us to be recognized as the only company included in the Visionaries quadrant of Gartner's Magic Quadrant for x86 Server Virtualization Infrastructure. We believe that this position reinforces our continued innovation, momentum and strong vision for an open, high-performance virtualization alternative.
Rounding out our portfolio of hybrid cloud solutions, we recently introduced OpenStack Platform 9 or OSP 9. It builds on the proven, trusted foundation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux to provide critical dependencies needed in production OpenStack environments. It is a production-ready OpenStack distribution that offers automated upgrade and update paths for mission-critical operations. OSP 9 brings significant updates to the mainstream -- the Mikata version of the -- of OpenStack. Overall, OSP, backed by a robust ecosystem of partners, including Cisco, Dell, Intel and Lenovo, has emerged as a proven solution to power private clouds across hundreds of customers worldwide, such as BBVA, Cambridge University, FICO, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Paddy Power Betfair, Santander Bank and Verizon. 
In summary, we are pleased to close out the first half of our fiscal year on a strong note, and we're even more excited about Red Hat's future. We believe that Red Hat is uniquely positioned to benefit from long-term secular changes in IT infrastructure that companies are deploying to support their businesses. We are delivering innovation and enterprise capabilities to the open source marketplace at a rapid pace. In doing so, we continue to build out a portfolio of technologies and capabilities to enable our customers to enjoy the benefits associated with the digital transformation and hybrid cloud computing as they develop their applications. 
We remain optimistic about our outlook for the remainder of the year, as Frank will detail in a moment. As a final note, this past quarter, Linux celebrated its 25th year since its creation. And I want to recognize and thank the creative energy of the open-source community, including the many Red Hat associates that have continued to drive innovation and helped to build Red Hat. Collaboration with the open-source community and the focused efforts of associates around the globe has enabled Red Hat to be recognized once again as one of Forbes Most Innovative Companies. This is a key reason that Red Hat is trusted as one of the strategic technology providers to enterprises around the world. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Frank."

Our business continues to demonstrate good momentum and strong execution by our global teams. We exceeded our guidance across a number of metrics in Q2.

Our business continues to demonstrate good momentum and strong execution by our global teams. We exceeded our guidance across a number of metrics in Q2. The strength in our subscription revenue continued to drive our results, highlighted by accelerated revenue growth in our core infrastructure offerings and high revenue growth in our portfolio of new technology that enable hybrid cloud computing and digital transformation.
Let me begin with the financial highlights of our Q2 performance. For a more detailed view of our results and for reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to GAAP, please refer to our earnings press release and the slide deck with financial highlights and supplemental metrics. These non-GAAP disclosures should not be used as a substitute for our GAAP results or rather read in conjunction with our GAAP results.
Similar to Q1, currency rate volatility has stabilized year-over-year, for example, on a constant-currency basis, using rates from Q2 last year, total revenue growth would've been 18% or approximately 70 basis points lower. I will keep my prepared remarks focused on our reported USD results where appropriate, and you will find a table of constant-currency results in our press release. 
I'm pleased to announce total revenue of $600 million, above the high end of our guidance and representing growth of 19% in U.S. dollars. This result was driven mainly by modestly better-than-expected sales performance and additional revenue related to our education and compliance program.
As I discussed, subscription revenue continued to be the largest driver of our growth as $531 million for the quarter, an increase of 20% year-over-year. This mainly renewable revenue stream now constitutes 89% of total revenue, providing us with a large base to expand our relationships with our customers. 
We continue to drive high growth across our technology portfolio. Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $427 million, an increase of 18% year-over-year. Our application development-related and emerging technologies subscription revenue was $104 million, an increase of 33% year-over-year. Application development-related and emerging technologies revenue was approximately 17% of total revenue, and that's up 180 basis points from a year-ago quarter.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $137 million grew 11% year-over-year, and non-GAAP operating margin was 22.8%, which is consistent with the operating margin direction we provided on our last call, and up 100 basis points from Q1. As a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjusts for noncash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combinations.
Using our estimated annual effective tax rate of 27%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.55, which was $0.01 above our guidance and up 17% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2 billion. We returned $127 million to shareholders in the quarter through the repurchase of approximately 1.8 million shares of stock. This is one of our largest direct repurchases in the quarter and reflects our commitment to return value to shareholders with our recent $1 billion repurchase authorization.
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $1.7 billion, an increase of $267 million or 19% over the same quarter a year ago. On a constant-currency basis, total deferred revenue was up 17%. Operating cash flow was $97 million for the quarter compared to $123 million in the year-ago quarter. Comparing the 2 quarters, our days sales outstanding was 1 day better than Q2 last year at 57 days on an FX-adjusted basis. However, the majority of our strong second quarter billings performance occurred in the last month of the quarter and contributed to a sequential increase of $31 million in our accounts receivable balance.
In addition, our first-half investments in our hybrid cloud technologies and sales capabilities led to an increase in expense of $20 million year-over-year. Some of this expense led to a higher use of operating cash flow. Although predicting the timing of cash inflows and outflows can be a difficult ability on a quarterly basis, we remain comfortable with our full year cash flow guidance, which includes our assumption of higher revenue, seasonally higher billings, increased non-GAAP operating margin for the remainder of the fiscal year and the slightly different linearity of cash flows.
The rolling 4-quarters billings proxy is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on a cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters. On a rolling 4-quarters basis, the billings proxy was $620 million, up 17% on a constant-currency basis and 15% U.S. dollars year-over-year.
I will now review the metrics for the business momentum and large deals in the quarter. All of our geographies saw double-digit growth in bookings, with particular strength in EMEA and Asia Pacific. This quarter, 57% of bookings came from the Americas, 24% from EMEA, and 19% from Asia Pacific. And this is versus a 60/22/18 split in Q2 of last year. 
The Q2 route-to-market mix was 81% from the channel and 19% from our direct sales force, and this compares to a 75/25 split in Q2 of last year. This is the large portion of channel business in a quarter and reflects channel strength across our major geographies.
Our proxy for bookings duration was 22 months, and that's up approximately 1.5 months from Q2 of last year, and that's driven in part by growth in deals over $1 million. In fact, this was a record second quarter for large deals, with 55 deals over $1 million, which was up 60% year-over-year. This traction highlights Red Hat's growing strategic importance in our customers' data centers and our talented sales teams' ability to land and expand our wallet share of IT dollars.
Looking sequentially at our top 30 largest deal metrics, all of the deals were $1 million or more, and 5 of those deals were in excess of $5 million. Cross-selling was strong, with over 70% of the top 30 deals, including one or more components from one group of application development and emerging technologies offerings.
Financial services and government were our top verticals in Q2. Within our top 25 renewal business, we renewed 23 of the top 25 deals that we were expecting. The total subscription value of these top 25 renewals was approximately 105% of the prior value. 1 of the 2 deals that did not renew was related to a government agency project that was canceled. This agency continues to rely on Red Hat technologies, including a 6-figure deal that closed in the quarter. The second deal that did not renew was lost to an on-premise legacy Linux distribution. We are still engaged with this customer in other areas of their business. And as with a few times in the past this has happened, we are optimistic that we can win back the lost portion over time as a result of our award-winning service and innovation.
Substituting these 2 deals within the next 2 deals up for renewal, the revised top 25 deals that did renew were approximately 115% higher than the prior year value. Given the growth in million-dollar deals this quarter, we are clearly driving larger wallet share by taking a number of 6-figure deals and expanding them to million-dollar-plus renewals.
Now I'd like to turn to the guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and foreign exchange. We are raising our full year revenue guidance to $2,415,000,000 to $2.435 billion, which is up approximately $15 million in U.S. dollars at the high end of the previous range. We are reaffirming our non-GAAP operating margin at approximately 23%. We are reaffirming the operating cash flow in the range from $800 million to $820 million. Given our revenue guidance, our target for full year non-GAAP earnings per share is estimated to be approximately $2.23 to $2.25 per share, assuming a 27% annual effective tax rate, approximately $1 million to $2 million per quarter forecast for other income.
For Q3 specifically, this implies the following outlook: we expect revenue to be in the range of $613 million to $623 million, which is up 19% in U.S. dollars at the high end of the range or 18% in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 23.3% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.58. Consistent with prior practices, I will not forecast quarterly cash flow given the variability of cash inflows and outflows.
Overall, we are very pleased with our financial performance in the first half of FY '17. We continue to see strong global demand for our hybrid cloud technology as organizations continue to modernize their infrastructure platform and their application development platform.

You're right in that we have some customers are coming to us and asking for a true consumption model, kind of pay-as-you-go, and we're working through the details. I'm actually encouraged. The very large customers that we've talked to about that said -- will even say, we recognize that will cost us more than we are paying you today because we're not committing to volumes.

As enterprises look to move their application portfolio of kind of production workloads, that certainly helps us. I think there's a couple of things that helps us in a hybrid cloud environment. If you look purely on premise, roughly half the workloads run on Windows, right? I mean it's just -- and so -- I don't want to say we're locked out because we do compete for that, but kind of half of traditional workloads we just didn't quite address because they're Windows. As soon as you start thinking about a hybrid cloud world, i.e. workloads that might run on premise or they might run on cloud, that by definition is going to be -- I don't want to say, but it's highly likely 90% of those are going to be on Linux. So that helps us both to see obviously very significant growth on public cloud, but more broadly, I think it helps us with our adoption even of core Linux in kind of hybrid cloud environments, which is both on-premise as well as in public cloud. So the hybrid cloud model and the fact that public clouds are starting to take share of workloads is actually kind of a -- it's a tailwind for our business."

Our constant-currency expenses grew at 22%. And as we talked about in the past",428,"Sure. So if you look at kind of the dynamics of what we saw in the first half of the year, our constant-currency revenue grew about 18%. This is for the first half of the year. Our constant-currency expenses grew at 22%. And as we talked about in the past, coming off of the end of last year, our objective for the first half of this year was to front-load a lot of our investments and really focus those investments on application development and emerging technologies. And so throughout the first half, and you can see that with some of our headcount numbers as well, we added probably, in addition, 1,000 employees. So that headcount was up about 25% year-on-year in the first half, primarily in sales, driving capacity to help support future growth around the app dev and emerging technologies. We also delivered strong billings growth, right, 18% for the first half, which I think is a good indication of the business momentum. Now in the second half, so that's pretty much -- if you look at what I just laid out especially with the expense, that had an impact on the cash for the second quarter with the $97 million that we announced. It also -- we mentioned earlier that some of the transactions that we had, especially the larger ones, came in later in the quarter. And so that increased the AR, so there was a lighter amount of collections in the quarter to the magnitude of about $31 million. So that's kind of the dynamics for the first half. If we look at the second half of the year, aligned with the guidance that we just gave, we're expecting our seasonally stronger billings to contribute to cash flow, as you would expect especially in Q4. We're forecasting about 16% constant-currency revenue growth when you look at the second half, based on -- that's at the low end, 16% to kind of 18% range. And we're also forecasting 16% operating expense growth. And that's really driven by -- kind of offset to the amount of investment that we made in the first half of the year. So we're bringing the investment levels down in the back half and pretty much leveraging the investments that we've made, as I said, in the application dev and emerging technologies. So with those dynamics, we feel comfortable with the guidance that we gave, both for the top line for our expense as well as our cash flow, and that cash flow is in that $800 million to $820 million."

And I think those things are helping, as well as even with core Linux, we're -- I know we talked about where we are in relative adoption but there's what I'll call the late majority, which is just going from using it in components to making it their mainstream operating system. I think especially again that's the tailwind we're getting as those companies prepare to move to cloud or starting to move to cloud, most likely, they're not going to go with Windows, they're going to go with Linux. And so that just accelerates the share of their production applications that are running on Linux.

But as we're seeing, especially a lot of traction around OpenShift in financial services, which is great to see. As you think about a container platform and the need to understand the provenance of the content as you think about the software development lifecycle around that, to think about orchestration, these large, sophisticated customers are really gravitating towards OpenShift. And that was, I think, reflected as well with some of the strength that you saw in financial services.

Obviously, the infrastructure product had a really nice quarter from a growth perspective. When we think about infrastructure versus the emerging, should we think about the sort of margin -- I guess, how should we think about those in terms of margin? Meaning, if infrastructure is doing really well, you'd think that it comes with a higher margin associated with it, given it's a more mature business? But I assume your sales guys can sell either, so maybe thinking about infrastructure accelerating doesn't necessarily pull with the kind of margin upside you would think about normally. Can you just -- I don't know, maybe I'm not thinking about it correctly but I think you understand the point I'm trying to get out."

And therefore, with that, you would expect that, that's driving more of the profit and the cash, true. So as that grows at a faster rate, that is contributing more. On the other side, we're making investments to help, as I said before, to grow the portfolio so that we can better balance and think about the growth for the future on the emerging and the app dev. From a sales perspective, we don't encourage or measure the sales team based on whether they sell one or the other from the standpoint of the profitability, I'm on the profitability piece. What they do focus on in the sales organization is looking at the total customer and looking at what the needs of the customer is sustaining that account over a period of time. And again, the objective in all our customers from their side and also from our side is to continue to sell a broader portfolio. So the emphasis on yes, RHEL is important and we do need to continue to sell RHEL, but that helps build the platform for the additional products that we leverage on top of that."

It's not necessarily upstream feature development for the exact reason that you mentioned which is the upstream community does a lot of the upstream feature development. We're obviously involved in a number of those components but the majority of our expense is sustaining engineering. We certainly would expect that as we think about the products across the board. Again, coming back to profitability, sales and marketing is a larger share of the expense. So that's one where whenever you have a new product, there's a higher expense associated with that. Well, we've just looked this up structurally against any of our products, at maturity, I don't -- we don't have any reason to believe that any of our products will be less profitable than Linux. And if we look at renewal rates, those are typically similar over time across product lines.

Because at the Analyst Day, I talked about the 3 different options. Wanted to go more heavily towards, as Jim was just talking about, operating system or RHEL and that clearly would have a better leverage model in the short term. The other extreme would go more heavily toward emerging markets. I think that would accelerate the growth but cause a margin deterioration in the short-term. We are going with a balanced approach. This year, as I've just mentioned, it's to invest in the first half of the year. Clearly if you look at the margin profile, first half of this year versus the second half of this year, you'll start to see an improvement in the margin in the back half of the year. I think that's pretty much the dynamics of how we're making the investment. As we continue to continue to get momentum on the, let's say, the app dev and the emerging technology products as we go into '18, I think that will allow us a better view of where we think to what extent we really think we can get potentially, some slight margin improvement. So I would say we want to close out the back half of the year with the guidance that we just gave. We're in the midst right now of already starting our planning for re-upping the next couple of years. And I think as we get into the beginning of next year, I think we'll have a better view of what that model may look like over a period of years, and we'll be more than happy to share that. And that's pretty much the takeaway coming off of a lot of conversations that many of you and I and Tom had, following the Analyst Day.

In Q3, solid execution allowed us to continue to deliver double-digit growth in a number of our financial metrics, including revenue, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP EPS. 
Some key highlights of the quarter include: strong demand for our cloud-enabling technologies, which is reflected in the 32% constant currency growth in our application development-related and other emerging technologies revenue; our continuing customer traction is evident in our top 25 renewals that were up for renewal this quarter. All 25 renewed, and they did so at more than 120% of their prior annual commitment. As Frank will describe, we closed many large deals including some of the largest deals in Red Hat's history, with strong cross-selling and longer-term commitments from our customers.
Our customers are increasingly adopting the cloud as part of their overall IT strategy and are using Red Hat as a partner. We see customers deploying our cloud-enabling technologies both on-premise and in the public cloud. This group of hybrid cloud customers is growing revenue in the aggregate faster than customers that have not yet embraced these technologies. In fact in Q3, we added hundreds of customer wins with products from our hybrid cloud portfolio, including several OpenStack deals that were over $1 million. Also of note, we closed our second OpenShift deal over $10 million and another OpenShift deal over $5 million. In spite of the many positives in the quarter, we faced a few challenges that tempered the growth of some of the items in our reported results.
First, some sizable November deals in the U.S. federal space have taken longer than initially expected to close, though we expect them to ultimately move forward in the fourth quarter. In addition, similar to the first half of the fiscal year, we were able to secure large multiyear commitments from customers. However, as these deals continue to get larger, sales activity was again more concentrated in the last month of the quarter. And in this quarter, there was a lower level of customers paying upfront for their multiyear deals.
We're adjusting our revenue and cash flow outlook for the year based on these factors, but it's important to note that we continue to expect full year total revenue growth of approximately 17%, with subscription revenue, which is renewable, growing even faster. We are reaffirming our operating margin for the full year of 23%, and we are forecasting cash flow in Q4 up 22% to approximately 28% from Q4 last year based on the confidence of our outlook. 
Importantly, for the long run, we remain confident in our competitive position and our ability to drive future growth. In fact, given our visibility into our pipeline and what has already closed to date, we are confident that we will see a re-acceleration of billings in Q4 into the mid-teens growth rate range and we will end the year with a strong total backlog. 
Before turning the call over to Frank to discuss the details of the quarter and our outlook, let me provide some additional business highlights for the quarter. We continue to see momentum with customers and community around our cloud-enabling technologies, including OpenStack, OpenShift, CloudForm and related offerings that our customers are using to build hybrid clouds. Within our top 30 deals, 7 included Red Hat OpenStack platform, 5 included OpenShift and 5 included storage.
Starting with an OpenStack customer win. Swisscom has deployed Red Hat OpenStack platform and Red Hat virtualization to build their newest technology platform providing the flexibility needed to support ongoing innovation and development across its own organization as well as its customer base. We continue to improve scalability and usability of OpenStack with our recent release of Red Hat OSP 10. Based on the upstream Newton release, OSP 10 drives new features that increase system-wide scalability, ease infrastructure management and improve orchestration while also enhancing network performance and platform security. A new 5-year life cycle support offering for Red Hat OSP 10 can help customers achieve the long-term stability required for mission-critical operations.
We also announced the broad alliance with Ericsson to deliver fully open source and production-ready cloud infrastructure, spanning OpenStack, containers, NFV, SDN and SDI. Through the collaboration, we plan to work together to certify Ericsson's platform and portfolio of solutions.
Red Hat 3scale API management platform was positioned in the leaders quadrant of Gartner's October 16 Full Life Cycle API Management Magic Quadrant. Red Hat 3scale API management platform complements our existing application development related and other emerging technologies and strengthens our ability to help simplify and accelerate customers' digital transformation initiatives.
In our storage portfolio, Red Hat Ceph and Gluster storage were posed positioned in the Visionaries quadrant of Gartner's October 16 Distributed File Systems and Object Storage Magic Quadrant. Red Hat Ceph and Red Hat Gluster storage are both highly agile solutions that are built to handle different types of demanding workloads.
Before my final remarks, I'd like to talk about the leadership transition at the CFO level. Effective in late January, Frank will be resigning to join another company as its CEO. Frank has been able to accomplish a great deal to help advance and scale our enterprise, as we continue to experience significant growth. 
I'm grateful that Frank has agreed to stay on until late January and assist with the transition as needed. Upon his resignation, Eric Shander, Vice President, Finance and Accounting, and our Principal Accounting Officer, will assume the role of acting CFO. Eric will bring a rich and solid experience base to this role from his work at Red Hat and almost 25 years of experience at IBM and Lenovo. 
Frank, I've really enjoyed getting to know you and working side by side with you. You'll be greatly missed, and I wish you nothing but success in your new role. You're a talented business leader and executive, and you've left us stronger and well positioned to address the opportunities before us. Thank you, Frank.
In summary, we continue to be pleased with our progress in delivering on our mission to work with communities, customers and partners to create better technology the open source way. I want to thank all Red Hat associates for their continued focus on the success of our customers. I'm confident that this team will continue to deliver against our hybrid cloud growth strategy.
With that, let me turn the call over to Frank."
33679,411710062,1104696,"Red Hat, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 21, 2016",2016-12-21,"Earnings Calls","Red Hat, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim.

I would also like to thank everyone at Red Hat, including my teams within finance, accounting, operation, IT and global workforce solutions. These are some of the best people I've ever worked with, and I'm very grateful to have gotten to know each and every one of you. I received a compelling opportunity to be a CEO at another company, and I couldn't turn it down. However, I have thoroughly enjoyed my time as CFO of Red Hat, and I'm confident this company will have continued success.
Let me begin with a summary of our Q3 performance. Q3 was driven by strong renewals in our large deals, cross selling of our cloud-enabling technologies and lengthening of customer commitments to Red Hat. This sales traction is reflected in our deals greater than $1 million, which are up 20% year-over-year. This is also a reflection of our strategic position with customers as they look to deploy in the hybrid cloud environments using our technologies for years to come.
As Jim noted earlier, the quarter did come with a couple of challenges that affected our metrics. First, we saw a few deals in the federal space that didn't close on the time frame we expected. We believe the proximity of our quarter [ph] to the continuing resolution legislation relating to the federal budget was a factor. The continuing resolution legislation has been signed, and we do expect them to move forward in the fourth quarter.
Second, we closed several large multiyear deals, including 2 deals over $20 million, which did not build beyond the first year. As we have stated in the past, customers' desire to pay beyond 1 year can fluctuate and it has an impact on the long-term portion of our billings proxy when this occur. In Q2, we saw strong growth in our billings proxy due in part to more customers paying upfront for their multiyear contracts, whereas strength in multiyear contracts during Q3 continued more to growth in the backlog.
Third, as Jim noted, we saw our sales activity more concentrated in the last month of the quarter versus our historic norm, similar to the second quarter. We are focusing on improving -- making improvements in linearity, and we believe similar linearity could occur in Q4 from a forecasting perspective. As we build our FY '18 plan, we plan to drive better quarterly linearity.
Finally, foreign exchange volatility negatively impacted our Q3 revenue by more than $3 million, and our previously implied guidance for Q4 by $16 million due to the fact that the dollar has strengthened against some of our major currencies since we provided our guidance back in September.
With this information as a backdrop, let me provide you some additional information on our quarterly metrics and results. As I just noted, currency rate volatility returned in Q3. Although there has been some stabilization on rate year-over-year, rates used for Q3 guidance and full year guidance have weakened against the U.S. dollar. So for this quarter, I provided both U.S. dollar and constant currency as well as described the impact of currency rate volatility from our previous guidance assumptions. We have also provided a table of constant currency results in our earnings press release. In addition, for a more detailed view of our results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release.
We delivered total revenue of $615 million, up 18% or 17% in constant currency. Compared to our September guidance, our result was in the middle of our guidance range, excluding the $3 million impact of FX volatility.
Subscription revenue continued to be the largest driver of our growth at $543 million for the quarter, an increase of 19% year-over-year and 18% in constant currency. This renewable revenue stream now constitutes 88% of total revenue providing a large base of future renewals and up-selling opportunities for new technologies.
We continue to drive high growth across our technology portfolio. Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $431 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year or 14% in constant currency. Our application development related and other emerging technologies subscription revenue was $112 million, an increase of 33% year-over-year or 32% in constant currency. Application development related and other emerging technologies revenue was approximately 18% of total revenue. That's up 210 basis points from a year ago quarter.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $143 million grew 16% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating margin was 23.3%, which is consistent with the operating margin direction we provided on our last call. As a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjusts for noncash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and the transaction costs related to business combinations.
Using our non-GAAP estimated annual effective tax rate of 27%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came in at $0.58. This is in line with our guidance after excluding a $0.03 discrete tax benefit, which brought the EPS reported to $0.61 per share, that's up 27% year-over-year.
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2 billion. We returned $125 million to shareholders in the quarter through the repurchase of approximately 1.6 million shares of stock. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 23% more shares this year than for the full year last year.
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $1.7 billion, an increase of $221 million or 15% over the same quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, total deferred revenue was up 14%. The total change in deferred revenue from a cash flow statement, which neutralizes most of the impact of currency fluctuations increased by $64 million since the end of Q2.
The rolling 4-quarter billings proxy, which is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters, was $635 million, that's up 14% on a constant currency basis and 13% U.S. dollar year-over-year.
Operating cash flow of $136 million for the quarter decreased from a year ago's Q3 operating cash flow of $148 million. Year-to-date operating cash flow is $465 million. Although we continue to deliver strong collections resulting in FX-adjusted day sales outstanding at 58 days, which is down from 59 days in the year ago quarter, overall collections and cash flow were mainly impacted by the similar sales linearity we saw in Q2. I will now review the metrics for the business momentum and some of the large deals in the quarter.
Our geographies saw a continued growth in bookings. This quarter, 57% of the bookings came from the Americas, 27% in EMEA and 16% in Asia Pacific versus a 60%, 26%, 14% split in Q3 last year. The Q3 route-to-market mix was 72% from the channel, 28% from the direct sales force, and that compares to 67% and 33% split in Q3 of last year. This mix shift year-over-year is driven in part by our desire to leverage channel partners that influence customers' buying decisions.
Our proxy for bookings duration was 24 months, higher than the duration last year and our historic duration of 21 months. Customers' demand to extend the length of their commitment with Red Hat, combined with the strength in our cloud-enabling technologies, is an additional proof point of customers choosing to implement hybrid cloud strategies.
Within our 30 largest deals, this marks the first time for this metric that all 30 of them were $2 million or more. 8 of those deals were in excess of $5 million, 3 of those deals were in excess of $10 million. We also had 2 deals of $20 million in the same quarter.
Cross-selling was strong, with over 60% of the deals -- the top 30 deals including 1 or more components from our group of Application development related and other emerging technologies offerings.
Financial services and technology and media were our top verticals in Q3, followed by government and other mainstream customers in sectors such as health care and industrial products.
Looking beyond the top 30 deals to all deals over $1 million, this was a record third quarter for the large deals, with 73 deals over $1 million, which were up 20% year-over-year. For fiscal year 2017 year-to-date, we have seen a 40% increase in the number of deals over $1 million compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016. This traction highlights Red Hat's growing strategic importance in our customers' data centers. And finally, all 25 of the top 25 deals that renewed in the quarter did renew, and the average value of the top 25 deals up for renewal exceeded 120%.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and the foreign exchange rate that have weakened significantly since we last gave guidance in September. We're adjusting our full year revenue guidance to reflect the change in foreign currency rates, our Q3 performance and linearity impact. We are now forecasting $2.397 billion to $2.405 billion, which is up approximately 17% in U.S. dollars. We are reaffirming our non-GAAP operating margin to approximately 23%. We are adjusting the cash flow in the range from $770 million to $785 million to reflect the linearity impact and our forecast of collections and disbursements. We are forecasting full year non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $2.27 per share, assuming approximately $1 million to $2 million per quarter forecast for other income; a 27% non-GAAP annual tax rate; and fully diluted share count of 183 million shares.
For Q4 specifically, this implies the following outlook: we expect revenue to be in the range of $614 million to $622 million. This is up 14% in U.S. dollars or approximately 16% in constant currency at the high end of the range. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 24%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.61 and 181 million fully diluted shares. Based on my annual guidance, the implied cash flow for Q4 is $305 million to $320 million or up 22% to approximately 28%. That's a range of 22% to 28%.
Overall, we remain optimistic about the company's long-term growth opportunity with our position to serve our customers' demand for hybrid cloud solutions. We continue to see strong adoption of our hybrid cloud solutions that span both private and public clouds. And now I'd like to turn it back over to the operator to turn it over to the first question."

I think the flip side of that is customers are getting much more used to consumption-based models, and so those very, very large deals they're more comfortable paying a year at a time. I think 4 or 5 years ago when we did a [ph] 3-year deal, the majority of them paid upfront because they were used to budgeting like they would for a license deal. Now they're getting more used to consumption-ish type deals, and so they're happy to commit to annual payments and so that certainly causing, but they are committed deals. And the other thing I would say is as they get bigger, linearity, as Frank indicated, gets to be more of a challenge. [indiscernible] You get more people involved and there is a cycle we always try to break of people wanting to push to the end before they buy. And so as the deals get bigger, that's unfortunately been working against us."

Those -- let me start off the second one quickly. No those are locked-in commitments, right? It's part of a broad strategy we have to help us over time bring down our overall sales cost is to invest a little more time getting multiyear commitments. Our sales team committee they're going to sell other products or sell other accounts, so those are committed. What I would say overall is I don't think there's anything systemic. I think it really has to do with larger deals just because of their size or are more likely to pay upfront -- I mean, pay over time. And so I guess we see us as a trend in the sense that we have more large deals. And so typically, 8-figure deals want to pay over time versus pay upfront and we're having more and more of those. And so I wish I could give you a better sense because again, we don't have that many of those types of deals. And I would say overall, the kind of million-dollar level, those are typically not multiyear deals or if they are, they're still being upfront. So I think it has more to do with just the absolute size. And so again, it's -- we don't have enough deals to call it a trend but it wouldn't surprise me that as we do more $20-plus million deals that those will more likely decide to pay over time. I do believe and again, this isn't with great data, this is just talking to customers, I do believe that as customers get more used to some consumption models, they're used to being Amazon, they're used to paying to Salesforce and SaaS model they're getting more comfortable in their budget processes building in annual payments. Subscription but frankly I think a lot of our customers thought of it as a license and so they would buy long term and so they had budget for it that year and that project and you pay for a project upfront and yes, there was maintenance, but it was mainly budgeted for project. And so they wanted to pay us upfront. More and more as people you SaaS, they are paying over time. And that is anecdotal talking to customers. But I do think budget processes in idea recognizing that more spend is going into OpEx from CapEx. And so naturally, it's less of a discussion of -- check upfront people are getting more used to putting it in OpEx. And that's probably a trend you'll see across software companies."

I mean obviously our deals are bigger because the company is multiple the size it was 5 years ago. I don't believe the concentration's changed. We do look at that metric I get it every quarter and I haven't noticed anything with that material in that. I do think there's a dynamic and I heard -- talking to other CEOs and renewal businesses, it's possible that a deal might slip out of a Q1 into a Q2 or out of a Q2 into Q3 but nothing ever slips out of Q4. And so I think -- and then once it's in Q4, obviously it's a renewal that's going to happen on that same date either 1 year or 3 years from now. And so there's this kind of naturally, once something gets more backend loaded, it stays there. So things may slip from again a month 1 to a month 2, right? And so -- and then once it goes there, it never renews early, it renews on that date. And so I don't think there's just the dynamic that's causing a little bit more backend loading as just the deals happen and then they get stuck on that date for renewal. We've experimented around and talk to customers about an 11.5-month deal or a 13-month deal or something to move some of those around but that's kind of playing cute on the margin. I really do still think that because of the renewal nature, once you get the deal stuck towards the end of quarter or in the fourth quarter, it's just hard to build after that because the compelling event on that is the renewal to reup the deal."

There's no customer and comes in and spends $20 million on it. The typical nature of those large deals are they include a component of renewal for their existing infrastructure. And that's typically growing because we continues take share both in Middleware and then offering systems from our -- the other players, our competitors in those areas. But these large wins almost always include a significant new infrastructure component, that's what makes them big, either OpenStack or OpenShift. And so again, the deal of that size, it's not -- like we had a couple of 8-figure OpenShift-alone deals. But typically, the really big deals will be a combination of a renewal that is growing plus one of the big new infrastructure, again, OpenStack or OpenShift is kind of normal. In terms of the channel mix, I don't know if that really changes a lot. We recognize that's any measure around fulfillment. About half of the channel mix is truly kind of no touch where they're out selling. And that's, obviously we really like that because it's a recently low cost of sale. Another chunk of that is fulfillment. So many of our large customers choose to fulfill through a channel partner for ease of contracting, et cetera, et cetera. I don't really have a major impact on kind of billings or sales cycle in a major way unless, over time, part of our strategy we want to move more the channels in a kind of low touch or no touch way, and that's absolutely slowly happening over time."

Should have enough time. And then second, regarding OpenStack, in the last couple of months, we've seen several vendors actually exit or significantly reduce their investment in OpenStack area, HP did that. Merantis [ph] has done that with a lot of related to that. We're claiming that public cloud is now moved too fast for OpenStack to ever close the gap. I know it was one of your key selling points at the investor event earlier. And so I guess the question is how is your level of confidence today around OpenStack versus what it was during the Investor Day? And has anything changed with respect to the type of customers that you are seeing actually adopting it?"

So and again, the quarter started -- I mean, this is all September through November was our quarter, so the iffiness around that and how long it was going to go were all issues for us as well as the change in administration, which is frozen a lot. On your question around OpenStack, frankly, I think some of the pullback is related to exactly what we said in the past. Doing OpenStack and not being an operating system vendor is extremely difficult. And so not only should it should be surprising that the people you see still bullish on OpenStack or Red Hat, SUSE and Canonical, and we feel very good in our ability to compete with them. We're seeing, as we said, a lot of big deals traction along with it. These are large, technically sophisticated customers who are also large users of public cloud. They see -- out of workloads, they find it much more economic to run in their own data center. Again, these are typically things where they're not trying to call other services that might be public cloud and they are running at scale. And so they are very sophisticated that have a good sense of what makes sense to run on-premise versus what makes sense to run in the hybrid cloud. And so we're seeing really, really good traction there. And obviously now that we're down to fewer competitors in that space, that's also helped us with our pipeline and also as well. So we continue to be very bullish on its role in our portfolio."

In Q3, solid execution allowed us to continue to deliver double-digit growth in a number of our financial metrics, including revenue, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP EPS. 
Some key highlights of the quarter include: strong demand for our cloud-enabling technologies, which is reflected in the 32% constant currency growth in our application development-related and other emerging technologies revenue; our continuing customer traction is evident in our top 25 renewals that were up for renewal this quarter. All 25 renewed, and they did so at more than 120% of their prior annual commitment. As Frank will describe, we closed many large deals including some of the largest deals in Red Hat's history, with strong cross-selling and longer-term commitments from our customers.
Our customers are increasingly adopting the cloud as part of their overall IT strategy and are using Red Hat as a partner. We see customers deploying our cloud-enabling technologies both on-premise and in the public cloud. This group of hybrid cloud customers is growing revenue in the aggregate faster than customers that have not yet embraced these technologies. In fact in Q3, we added hundreds of customer wins with products from our hybrid cloud portfolio, including several OpenStack deals that were over $1 million. Also of note, we closed our second OpenShift deal over $10 million and another OpenShift deal over $5 million. In spite of the many positives in the quarter, we faced a few challenges that tempered the growth of some of the items in our reported results.
First, some sizable November deals in the U.S. federal space have taken longer than initially expected to close, though we expect them to ultimately move forward in the fourth quarter. In addition, similar to the first half of the fiscal year, we were able to secure large multiyear commitments from customers. However, as these deals continue to get larger, sales activity was again more concentrated in the last month of the quarter. And in this quarter, there was a lower level of customers paying upfront for their multiyear deals.
We're adjusting our revenue and cash flow outlook for the year based on these factors, but it's important to note that we continue to expect full year total revenue growth of approximately 17%, with subscription revenue, which is renewable, growing even faster. We are reaffirming our operating margin for the full year of 23%, and we are forecasting cash flow in Q4 up 22% to approximately 28% from Q4 last year based on the confidence of our outlook. 
Importantly, for the long run, we remain confident in our competitive position and our ability to drive future growth. In fact, given our visibility into our pipeline and what has already closed to date, we are confident that we will see a re-acceleration of billings in Q4 into the mid-teens growth rate range and we will end the year with a strong total backlog. 
Before turning the call over to Frank to discuss the details of the quarter and our outlook, let me provide some additional business highlights for the quarter. We continue to see momentum with customers and community around our cloud-enabling technologies, including OpenStack, OpenShift, CloudForm and related offerings that our customers are using to build hybrid clouds. Within our top 30 deals, 7 included Red Hat OpenStack platform, 5 included OpenShift and 5 included storage.
Starting with an OpenStack customer win. Swisscom has deployed Red Hat OpenStack platform and Red Hat virtualization to build their newest technology platform providing the flexibility needed to support ongoing innovation and development across its own organization as well as its customer base. We continue to improve scalability and usability of OpenStack with our recent release of Red Hat OSP 10. Based on the upstream Newton release, OSP 10 drives new features that increase system-wide scalability, ease infrastructure management and improve orchestration while also enhancing network performance and platform security. A new 5-year life cycle support offering for Red Hat OSP 10 can help customers achieve the long-term stability required for mission-critical operations.
We also announced the broad alliance with Ericsson to deliver fully open source and production-ready cloud infrastructure, spanning OpenStack, containers, NFV, SDN and SDI. Through the collaboration, we plan to work together to certify Ericsson's platform and portfolio of solutions.
Red Hat 3scale API management platform was positioned in the leaders quadrant of Gartner's October 16 Full Life Cycle API Management Magic Quadrant. Red Hat 3scale API management platform complements our existing application development related and other emerging technologies and strengthens our ability to help simplify and accelerate customers' digital transformation initiatives.
In our storage portfolio, Red Hat Ceph and Gluster storage were posed positioned in the Visionaries quadrant of Gartner's October 16 Distributed File Systems and Object Storage Magic Quadrant. Red Hat Ceph and Red Hat Gluster storage are both highly agile solutions that are built to handle different types of demanding workloads.
Before my final remarks, I'd like to talk about the leadership transition at the CFO level. Effective in late January, Frank will be resigning to join another company as its CEO. Frank has been able to accomplish a great deal to help advance and scale our enterprise, as we continue to experience significant growth. 
I'm grateful that Frank has agreed to stay on until late January and assist with the transition as needed. Upon his resignation, Eric Shander, Vice President, Finance and Accounting, and our Principal Accounting Officer, will assume the role of acting CFO. Eric will bring a rich and solid experience base to this role from his work at Red Hat and almost 25 years of experience at IBM and Lenovo. 
Frank, I've really enjoyed getting to know you and working side by side with you. You'll be greatly missed, and I wish you nothing but success in your new role. You're a talented business leader and executive, and you've left us stronger and well positioned to address the opportunities before us. Thank you, Frank.
In summary, we continue to be pleased with our progress in delivering on our mission to work with communities, customers and partners to create better technology the open source way. I want to thank all Red Hat associates for their continued focus on the success of our customers. I'm confident that this team will continue to deliver against our hybrid cloud growth strategy.
With that, let me turn the call over to Frank."
33679,411710062,1104727,"Red Hat, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 21, 2016",2016-12-21,"Earnings Calls","Red Hat, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim.

I would also like to thank everyone at Red Hat, including my teams within finance, accounting, operation, IT and global workforce solutions. These are some of the best people I've ever worked with, and I'm very grateful to have gotten to know each and every one of you. I received a compelling opportunity to be a CEO at another company, and I couldn't turn it down. However, I have thoroughly enjoyed my time as CFO of Red Hat, and I'm confident this company will have continued success.
Let me begin with a summary of our Q3 performance. Q3 was driven by strong renewals in our large deals, cross selling of our cloud-enabling technologies and lengthening of customer commitments to Red Hat. This sales traction is reflected in our deals greater than $1 million, which are up 20% year-over-year. This is also a reflection of our strategic position with customers as they look to deploy in the hybrid cloud environments using our technologies for years to come.
As Jim noted earlier, the quarter did come with a couple of challenges that affected our metrics. First, we saw a few deals in the federal space that didn't close on the time frame we expected. We believe the proximity of our quarter to the continuing resolution legislation relating to the federal budget was a factor. The continuing resolution legislation has been signed, and we do expect them to move forward in the fourth quarter.
Second, we closed several large multiyear deals, including 2 deals over $20 million, which did not build beyond the first year. As we have stated in the past, customers' desire to pay beyond 1 year can fluctuate and it has an impact on the long-term portion of our billings proxy when this occur. In Q2, we saw strong growth in our billings proxy due in part to more customers paying upfront for their multiyear contracts, whereas strength in multiyear contracts during Q3 continued more to growth in the backlog.
Third, as Jim noted, we saw our sales activity more concentrated in the last month of the quarter versus our historic norm, similar to the second quarter. We are focusing on improving -- making improvements in linearity, and we believe similar linearity could occur in Q4 from a forecasting perspective. As we build our FY '18 plan, we plan to drive better quarterly linearity.
Finally, foreign exchange volatility negatively impacted our Q3 revenue by more than $3 million, and our previously implied guidance for Q4 by $16 million due to the fact that the dollar has strengthened against some of our major currencies since we provided our guidance back in September.
With this information as a backdrop, let me provide you some additional information on our quarterly metrics and results. As I just noted, currency rate volatility returned in Q3. Although there has been some stabilization on rate year-over-year, rates used for Q3 guidance and full year guidance have weakened against the U.S. dollar. So for this quarter, I provided both U.S. dollar and constant currency as well as described the impact of currency rate volatility from our previous guidance assumptions. We have also provided a table of constant currency results in our earnings press release. In addition, for a more detailed view of our results and the reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release.
We delivered total revenue of $615 million, up 18% or 17% in constant currency. Compared to our September guidance, our result was in the middle of our guidance range, excluding the $3 million impact of FX volatility.
Subscription revenue continued to be the largest driver of our growth at $543 million for the quarter, an increase of 19% year-over-year and 18% in constant currency. This renewable revenue stream now constitutes 88% of total revenue providing a large base of future renewals and up-selling opportunities for new technologies.
We continue to drive high growth across our technology portfolio. Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $431 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year or 14% in constant currency. Our application development related and other emerging technologies subscription revenue was $112 million, an increase of 33% year-over-year or 32% in constant currency. Application development related and other emerging technologies revenue was approximately 18% of total revenue. That's up 210 basis points from a year ago quarter.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $143 million grew 16% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating margin was 23.3%, which is consistent with the operating margin direction we provided on our last call. As a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjusts for noncash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and the transaction costs related to business combinations.
Using our non-GAAP estimated annual effective tax rate of 27%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came in at $0.58. This is in line with our guidance after excluding a $0.03 discrete tax benefit, which brought the EPS reported to $0.61 per share, that's up 27% year-over-year.
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2 billion. We returned $125 million to shareholders in the quarter through the repurchase of approximately 1.6 million shares of stock. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 23% more shares this year than for the full year last year.
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $1.7 billion, an increase of $221 million or 15% over the same quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, total deferred revenue was up 14%. The total change in deferred revenue from a cash flow statement, which neutralizes most of the impact of currency fluctuations increased by $64 million since the end of Q2.
The rolling 4-quarter billings proxy, which is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters, was $635 million, that's up 14% on a constant currency basis and 13% U.S. dollar year-over-year.
Operating cash flow of $136 million for the quarter decreased from a year ago's Q3 operating cash flow of $148 million. Year-to-date operating cash flow is $465 million. Although we continue to deliver strong collections resulting in FX-adjusted day sales outstanding at 58 days, which is down from 59 days in the year ago quarter, overall collections and cash flow were mainly impacted by the similar sales linearity we saw in Q2. I will now review the metrics for the business momentum and some of the large deals in the quarter.
Our geographies saw a continued growth in bookings. This quarter, 57% of the bookings came from the Americas, 27% in EMEA and 16% in Asia Pacific versus a 60%, 26%, 14% split in Q3 last year. The Q3 route-to-market mix was 72% from the channel, 28% from the direct sales force, and that compares to 67% and 33% split in Q3 of last year. This mix shift year-over-year is driven in part by our desire to leverage channel partners that influence customers' buying decisions.
Our proxy for bookings duration was 24 months, higher than the duration last year and our historic duration of 21 months. Customers' demand to extend the length of their commitment with Red Hat, combined with the strength in our cloud-enabling technologies, is an additional proof point of customers choosing to implement hybrid cloud strategies.
Within our 30 largest deals, this marks the first time for this metric that all 30 of them were $2 million or more. 8 of those deals were in excess of $5 million, 3 of those deals were in excess of $10 million. We also had 2 deals of $20 million in the same quarter.
Cross-selling was strong, with over 60% of the deals -- the top 30 deals including 1 or more components from our group of Application development related and other emerging technologies offerings.
Financial services and technology and media were our top verticals in Q3, followed by government and other mainstream customers in sectors such as health care and industrial products.
Looking beyond the top 30 deals to all deals over $1 million, this was a record third quarter for the large deals, with 73 deals over $1 million, which were up 20% year-over-year. For fiscal year 2017 year-to-date, we have seen a 40% increase in the number of deals over $1 million compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016. This traction highlights Red Hat's growing strategic importance in our customers' data centers. And finally, all 25 of the top 25 deals that renewed in the quarter did renew, and the average value of the top 25 deals up for renewal exceeded 120%.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and the foreign exchange rate that have weakened significantly since we last gave guidance in September. We're adjusting our full year revenue guidance to reflect the change in foreign currency rates, our Q3 performance and linearity impact. We are now forecasting $2.397 billion to $2.405 billion, which is up approximately 17% in U.S. dollars. We are reaffirming our non-GAAP operating margin to approximately 23%. We are adjusting the cash flow in the range from $770 million to $785 million to reflect the linearity impact and our forecast of collections and disbursements. We are forecasting full year non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $2.27 per share, assuming approximately $1 million to $2 million per quarter forecast for other income; a 27% non-GAAP annual tax rate; and fully diluted share count of 183 million shares.
For Q4 specifically, this implies the following outlook: we expect revenue to be in the range of $614 million to $622 million. This is up 14% in U.S. dollars or approximately 16% in constant currency at the high end of the range. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 24%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.61 and 181 million fully diluted shares. Based on my annual guidance, the implied cash flow for Q4 is $305 million to $320 million or up 22% to approximately 28%. That's a range of 22% to 28%.
Overall, we remain optimistic about the company's long-term growth opportunity with our position to serve our customers' demand for hybrid cloud solutions. We continue to see strong adoption of our hybrid cloud solutions that span both private and public clouds. And now I'd like to turn it back over to the operator to turn it over to the first question."

I think the flip side of that is customers are getting much more used to consumption-based models, and so those very, very large deals they're more comfortable paying a year at a time. I think 4 or 5 years ago when we did a 3-year deal, the majority hadn't paid upfront because they were used to budgeting like they would for a license deal. Now they're getting more used to consumption-ish type deals, and so they're happy to commit to annual payments and so that certainly causing, but they are committed deals. And the other thing I would say is as they get bigger, linearity, as Frank indicated, gets to be more of a challenge. You get more people involved and there is a cycle we always try to break of people wanting to push to the end before they buy. And so as the deals get bigger, that's unfortunately been working against us."

Because I think some of the other questions are trying to get to is this just a couple of things or was this something that is -- might affect other companies, too. And I guess, Jim, for those deals, I just want to be clear. For the years beyond year 1, are they still locked in or are those years optional to pay?"

Those -- let me start off the second one quickly. No those are locked-in commitments, right? It's part of a broad strategy we have to help us over time bring down our overall sales cost is to invest a little more time getting multiyear commitments. Our sales team committee, they're going to sell other products or sell other accounts, so those are committed. What I would say overall is I don't think there's anything systemic. I think it really has to do with larger deals just because of their size or are more likely to pay upfront -- I mean, pay over time. And so I guess, we see it as a trend in the sense that we have more large deals. And so typically, 8-figure deals want to pay overtime versus pay upfront, and we're having more and more of those. And so I wish I could give you a better sense because, again, we don't have that many of those types of deals. And I would say overall, the kind of million-dollar level, those are typically not multiyear deals or if they are, they're still paying upfront. So I think it has more to do with just the absolute size. And so again, it's -- we don't have enough deals to call it a trend, but it wouldn't surprise me that as we do more $20-plus million deals that those will more likely decide to pay over time. I do believe and again, this isn't with great data, this is just talking to customers, I do believe that as customers get more used to consumption models, they're used to paying Amazon, they're used to paying Salesforce and SaaS model. They are getting more comfortable in their budget processes, building in annual payments. We've always sold the subscription but, frankly, I think a lot of our customers thought of it like a license and so they would buy long term and they had budget for it that year and that a project and you pay for a project upfront and yes, there was maintenance, but it was mainly budgeted for project. And so they wanted to pay us upfront. I think more and more as people use SaaS, they are paying over time. And that -- again, that's anecdotal talking to customers. But I do think budget processes in IT are recognizing that more spend is going to OpEx from CapEx. And so naturally, it's less of a discussion of let me write you a big check upfront, people are getting more used to putting it in OpEx. And that's probably a trend you'll see across software companies."

I mean, obviously our deals are bigger because the company is multiple to the size it was 5 years ago. I don't believe the concentration's changed. We do look at that metric, I get it every quarter and I haven't noticed anything material in that. I do think there's a dynamic and I heard us -- talking to other CEOs and renewal businesses, it's possible that a deal might slip out of a Q1 into a Q2 or out of a Q2 into Q3, but nothing ever slips out of Q4. And so I think -- and then once it's in the Q4, obviously it's a renewal that's going to happen on that same date either 1 year or 3 years from now. And so this is kind of naturally, once something gets more back-end loaded, it stays there. And so things may slip from again a month 1 to a month 2, right? And so -- and then once it gets there, it never renews early, it renews on that date. And so I do think there's just the dynamic that's causing a little bit more back-end loading as just the deals happen and then they get stuck on that date for renewal. We've experimented around and talk to customers about doing an 11.5-month deal or a 13-month deal or something to move some of those around, but that's kind of playing cute on the margin. I really do still think that because of the renewal nature, once you get a deal stuck towards the end of quarter or in the fourth quarter, it's just hard to move after that because the compelling event on that is the renewal to reup the deal."

We haven't want to take it out through the individual sales person because, at this point, we hadn't wanted to kind of get them worried so much about that if they're not worried about serving the customer. And so we've been trying to put in some compensation at kind of the sales manager level to try to drive that behavior. And we're still trying to experiment with getting it right, and we haven't quite gotten it right, which is why in Q4, we are assuming linearity that looks more like Q3, which is a little worse than our plan, which is the reason we pulled revenue down a bit for an assumption of worse linearity than we had originally planned."

To be blunt, part of that has to do with how we set our sales comp plans. Part of our strategy to over time be more efficient with our go to market is to sign more long-term deals, so we're not having to spend more time on renewals because they're locked in. And we emphasize that more in this year's plan. And so that kind of -- I guess one of the reasons we've gone from 21 to 24, we're still working on what we do for next year. But I do think as we get bigger and people are building things like OpenShift and OpenStack into their long-term infrastructures, they want to do long-term deals with us as well. So we had the commercial terms worked out. So I do think you're likely to see some elevation. Will it stay at 24 or turn into 23? I don't think that's hard for us to be able to say. Let me also come back -- so I missed the second part of the last question around consumption model. We typically do, at minimum, 1-year deals. There are a few specific instances where customers for whatever reason, want to be able to burst on to a cloud for specific types of workloads where we've done some consumption-ish type related deals.

There's no brand-new customer who comes in and spends $20 million on it. The typical nature of those large deals are they include a component of renewal for their existing infrastructure. And that's typically growing because we continue to take share both in Middleware and then operating systems from our -- the other players, our competitors in those areas. But these large wins almost always include a significant new infrastructure component, that's what makes them big, either OpenStack or OpenShift. And so again, a deal of that size, it's not -- like we had a couple of 8-figure OpenShift-alone deals. But typically, the really big deals will be a combination of a renewal that is growing plus one of the big new infrastructure, again, OpenStack or OpenShift is kind of normal. In terms of the channel mix, I don't know if that really changes a lot. Recognize that's a measure around fulfillment. And about half of the channel mix is truly kind of no touch where they're out selling. And that's -- obviously, we really like that because it's a recently low cost of sale. Another chunk of that is fulfillment. So many of our large customers choose to fulfill through a channel partner for ease of contracting, et cetera, et cetera. So I don't really have a major impact on kind of billings or sales cycle in a major way unless, and over time, as part of our strategy, we want to move more to channels in a kind of low-touch or no-touch way, and that's slowly happening over time."

So -- and again, the quarter started -- I mean, this is all September through November was our quarter, and so the iffiness around that and how long it was going to go were all issues for us as well as the change in administration, which is frozen a lot. On your question around OpenStack, frankly, I think some of the pullback is related to exactly what we've said in the past. Doing OpenStack and not being an operating system vendor is extremely difficult. And so I don't think it should be surprising that the people you see still bullish on OpenStack or Red Hat, SUSE and Canonical, and we feel very good in our ability to compete with them. We're seeing, as we said, a lot of big deals traction along with it. These are large, technically sophisticated customers who are also large users of public cloud. They see us set a workloads, they find it much more economic to run in their own data center. Again, these are typically things where they're not trying to call other services that might be in the public cloud and they are running at scale. And so they are very sophisticated and have a good sense of what makes sense to run on-premise versus what makes sense to run in a hybrid cloud. And so we're seeing really, really good traction there. And obviously, now that we're down to fewer competitors in that space, that's also helped us with our pipeline and outlook as well. So we continue to be very bullish on its role on our portfolio."

In Q3, solid execution allowed us to continue to deliver double-digit growth in a number of our financial metrics, including revenue, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP EPS. 
Some key highlights of the quarter include: strong demand for our cloud-enabling technologies, which is reflected in the 32% constant currency growth in our application development-related and other emerging technologies revenue; our continuing customer traction is evident in our top 25 renewals that were up for renewal this quarter. All 25 renewed, and they did so at more than 120% of their prior annual commitment. As Frank will describe, we closed many large deals including some of the largest deals in Red Hat's history, with strong cross-selling and longer-term commitments from our customers.
Our customers are increasingly adopting the cloud as part of their overall IT strategy and are using Red Hat as a partner. We see customers deploying our cloud-enabling technologies both on-premise and in the public cloud. This group of hybrid cloud customers is growing revenue in the aggregate faster than customers that have not yet embraced these technologies. In fact in Q3, we added hundreds of customer wins with products from our hybrid cloud portfolio, including several OpenStack deals that were over $1 million. Also of note, we closed our second OpenShift deal over $10 million and another OpenShift deal over $5 million. In spite of the many positives in the quarter, we faced a few challenges that tempered the growth of some of the items in our reported results.
First, some sizable November deals in the U.S. federal space have taken longer than initially expected to close, though we expect them to ultimately move forward in the fourth quarter. In addition, similar to the first half of the fiscal year, we were able to secure large multiyear commitments from customers. However, as these deals continue to get larger, sales activity was again more concentrated in the last month of the quarter. And in this quarter, there was a lower level of customers paying upfront for their multiyear deals.
We're adjusting our revenue and cash flow outlook for the year based on these factors, but it's important to note that we continue to expect full year total revenue growth of approximately 17%, with subscription revenue, which is renewable, growing even faster. We are reaffirming our operating margin for the full year of 23%, and we are forecasting cash flow in Q4 up 22% to approximately 28% from Q4 last year based on the confidence of our outlook. 
Importantly, for the long run, we remain confident in our competitive position and our ability to drive future growth. In fact, given our visibility into our pipeline and what has already closed to date, we are confident that we will see a re-acceleration of billings in Q4 into the mid-teens growth rate range and we will end the year with a strong total backlog. 
Before turning the call over to Frank to discuss the details of the quarter and our outlook, let me provide some additional business highlights for the quarter. We continue to see momentum with customers and community around our cloud-enabling technologies, including OpenStack, OpenShift, CloudForm and related offerings that our customers are using to build hybrid clouds. Within our top 30 deals, 7 included Red Hat OpenStack platform, 5 included OpenShift and 5 included storage.
Starting with an OpenStack customer win. Swisscom has deployed Red Hat OpenStack platform and Red Hat virtualization to build their newest technology platform providing the flexibility needed to support ongoing innovation and development across its own organization as well as its customer base. We continue to improve scalability and usability of OpenStack with our recent release of Red Hat OSP 10. Based on the upstream Newton release, OSP 10 drives new features that increase system-wide scalability, ease infrastructure management and improve orchestration while also enhancing network performance and platform security. A new 5-year life cycle support offering for Red Hat OSP 10 can help customers achieve the long-term stability required for mission-critical operations.
We also announced the broad alliance with Ericsson to deliver fully open source and production-ready cloud infrastructure, spanning OpenStack, containers, NFV, SDN and SDI. Through the collaboration, we plan to work together to certify Ericsson's platform and portfolio of solutions.
Red Hat 3scale API management platform was positioned in the leaders quadrant of Gartner's October 16 Full Life Cycle API Management Magic Quadrant. Red Hat 3scale API management platform complements our existing application development related and other emerging technologies and strengthens our ability to help simplify and accelerate customers' digital transformation initiatives.
In our storage portfolio, Red Hat Ceph and Gluster storage were posed positioned in the Visionaries quadrant of Gartner's October 16 Distributed File Systems and Object Storage Magic Quadrant. Red Hat Ceph storage and Red Hat Gluster storage are both highly agile solutions that are built to handle different types of demanding workloads.
Before my final remarks, I'd like to talk about the leadership transition at the CFO level. Effective in late January, Frank will be resigning to join another company as its CEO. Frank has been able to accomplish a great deal to help advance and scale our enterprise, as we continue to experience significant growth. 
I'm grateful that Frank has agreed to stay on until late January and assist with the transition as needed. Upon his resignation, Eric Shander, Vice President, Finance and Accounting, and our Principal Accounting Officer, will assume the role of acting CFO. Eric will bring a rich and solid experience base to this role from his work at Red Hat and almost 25 years of experience at IBM and Lenovo. 
Frank, I've really enjoyed getting to know you and working side by side with you. You'll be greatly missed, and I wish you nothing but success in your new role. You're a talented business leader and executive, and you've left us stronger and well positioned to address the opportunities before us. Thank you, Frank.
In summary, we continue to be pleased with our progress in delivering on our mission to work with communities, customers and partners to create better technology the open source way. I want to thank all Red Hat associates for their continued focus on the success of our customers. I'm confident that this team will continue to deliver against our hybrid cloud growth strategy.
With that, let me turn the call over to Frank."
33679,411710062,1104732,"Red Hat, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 21, 2016",2016-12-21,"Earnings Calls","Red Hat, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. I would also like to thank everyone at Red Hat, including my teams within finance, accounting, operations, IT and global workforce solutions. These are some of the best people I've ever worked with, and I'm very grateful to have gotten to",1734,"Thank you, Jim. I would also like to thank everyone at Red Hat, including my teams within finance, accounting, operations, IT and global workforce solutions. These are some of the best people I've ever worked with, and I'm very grateful to have gotten to know each and every one of you. I've received a compelling opportunity to be a CEO at another company, and I couldn't turn it down. However, I have thoroughly enjoyed my time as CFO of Red Hat, and I'm confident this company will have continued success.
Let me begin with a summary of our Q3 performance. Q3 was driven by strong renewals in our large deals, cross selling of our cloud-enabling technologies and lengthening of customer commitments to Red Hat. This sales traction is reflected in our deals greater than $1 million, which are up 20% year-over-year. This is also a reflection of our strategic position with customers as they look to deploy in the hybrid cloud environments using our technologies for years to come.
As Jim noted earlier, the quarter did come with a couple of challenges that affected our metrics. First, we saw a few deals in the federal space that didn't close on the time frame we expected. We believe the proximity of our quarter to the continuing resolution legislation relating to the federal budget was a factor. The continuing resolution legislation has been signed, and we do expect them to move forward in the fourth quarter.
Second, we closed several large multiyear deals, including 2 deals over $20 million, which did not build beyond the first year. As we have stated in the past, customers' desire to pay beyond 1 year can fluctuate and it has an impact on the long-term portion of our billings proxy when this occurs. In Q2, we saw strong growth in our billings proxy due in part to more customers paying upfront for their multiyear contracts, whereas strength in multiyear contracts during Q3 continued more to growth in the backlog.
Third, as Jim noted, we saw our sales activity more concentrated in the last month of the quarter versus our historic norm, similar to the second quarter. We are focusing on improving -- making improvements in linearity, and we believe similar linearity could occur in Q4 from a forecasting perspective. As we build our FY '18 plan, we plan to drive better quarterly linearity.
Finally, foreign exchange volatility negatively impacted our Q3 revenue by more than $3 million, and our previously implied guidance for Q4 by $16 million due to the fact that the dollar has strengthened against some of our major currencies since we provided our guidance back in September.
With this information as a backdrop, let me provide you some additional information on our quarterly metrics and results. As I just noted, currency rate volatility returned in Q3. Although there has been some stabilization on rates year-over-year, rates used for Q3 guidance and full year guidance have weakened against the U.S. dollar. So for this quarter, I provided both U.S. dollar and constant currency as well as described the impact of currency rate volatility from our previous guidance assumptions. We have also provided a table of constant currency results in our earnings press release. In addition, for a more detailed view of our results and the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release.
We delivered total revenue of $615 million, up 18% or 17% in constant currency. Compared to our September guidance, our result was in the middle of our guidance range, excluding the $3 million impact of FX volatility.
Subscription revenue continued to be the largest driver of our growth at $543 million for the quarter, an increase of 19% year-over-year and 18% in constant currency. This renewable revenue stream now constitutes 88% of total revenue providing a large base of future renewals and up-selling opportunities for new technologies.
We continue to drive high growth across our technology portfolio. Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $431 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year or 14% in constant currency. Our application development related and other emerging technologies subscription revenue was $112 million, an increase of 33% year-over-year or 32% in constant currency. Application development related and other emerging technologies revenue was approximately 18% of total revenue. That's up 210 basis points from a year ago quarter.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $143 million grew 16% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating margin was 23.3%, which is consistent with the operating margin direction we provided on our last call. As a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjusts for noncash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and the transaction costs related to business combinations.
Using our non-GAAP estimated annual effective tax rate of 27%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came in at $0.58. This is in line with our guidance after excluding a $0.03 discrete tax benefit, which brought the EPS reported to $0.61 per share, that's up 27% year-over-year.
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2 billion. We returned $125 million to shareholders in the quarter through the repurchase of approximately 1.6 million shares of stock. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 23% more shares this year than for the full year last year.
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $1.7 billion, an increase of $221 million or 15% over the same quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, total deferred revenue was up 14%. The total change in deferred revenue from a cash flow statement, which neutralizes most of the impact of currency fluctuations increased by $64 million since the end of Q2.
The rolling 4 quarter billings proxy, which is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters, was $635 million. That's up 14% on a constant currency basis and 13% U.S. dollar year-over-year.
Operating cash flow of $136 million for the quarter decreased from a year ago's Q3 operating cash flow of $148 million. Year-to-date operating cash flow is $465 million. Although we continue to deliver strong collections resulting in FX-adjusted day sales outstanding at 58 days, which is down from 59 days in the year ago quarter, overall collections and cash flow were mainly impacted by the similar sales linearity we saw in Q2. I will now review the metrics for the business momentum and some of the large deals in the quarter.
Our geographies saw a continued growth in bookings. This quarter, 57% of the bookings came from the Americas, 27% in EMEA and 16% in Asia Pacific versus a 60%, 26%, 14% split in Q3 last year. The Q3 route-to-market mix was 72% from the channel, 28% from the direct sales force, and that compares to 67% and 33% split in Q3 of last year. This mix shift year-over-year is driven in part by our desire to leverage channel partners that influence customers' buying decisions.
Our proxy for bookings duration was 24 months, higher than the duration last year and our historic duration of 21 months. Customers' demand to extend the length of their commitment with Red Hat, combined with the strength in our cloud-enabling technologies, is an additional proof point of customers choosing to implement hybrid cloud strategies.
Within our 30 largest deals, this marks the first time for this metric that all 30 of them were $2 million or more. 8 of those deals were in excess of $5 million, 3 of those deals were in excess of $10 million. We also had 2 deals of $20 million in the same quarter.
Cross-selling was strong, with over 60% of the deals -- the top 30 deals including 1 or more components from our group of Application development related and other emerging technologies offerings.
Financial services and technology and media were our top verticals in Q3, followed by government and other mainstream customers in sectors such as health care and industrial products.
Looking beyond the top 30 deals to all deals over $1 million, this was a record third quarter for the large deals, with 73 deals over $1 million, which were up 20% year-over-year. For fiscal year 2017 year-to-date, we have seen a 40% increase in the number of deals over $1 million compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016. This traction highlights Red Hat's growing strategic importance in our customers' data centers. And finally, all 25 of the top 25 deals that renewed in the quarter did renew, and the average value of the top 25 deals up for renewal exceeded 120%.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and the foreign exchange rates that have weakened significantly since we last gave guidance in September. We are adjusting our full year revenue guidance to reflect the change in foreign currency rates, our Q3 performance and linearity impact. We are now forecasting $2.397 billion to $2.405 billion, which is up approximately 17% in U.S. dollars. We are reaffirming our non-GAAP operating margin to approximately 23%. We are adjusting the cash flow in the range from $770 million to $785 million to reflect the linearity impact and our forecast of collections and disbursements. We are forecasting full year non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $2.27 per share, assuming approximately $1 million to $2 million per quarter forecast for other income; a 27% non-GAAP annual tax rate; and fully diluted share count of 183 million shares.
For Q4 specifically, this implies the following outlook: we expect revenue to be in the range of $614 million to $622 million. This is up 14% in U.S. dollars or approximately 16% in constant currency at the high end of the range. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 24%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.61 and 181 million fully diluted shares. Based on my annual guidance, the implied cash flow for Q4 is $305 million to $320 million or up 22% to approximately 28%. That's a range of 22% to 28%.
Overall, we remain optimistic about the company's long-term growth opportunity with our position to serve our customers' demand for hybrid cloud solutions. We continue to see strong adoption of our hybrid cloud solutions that span both private and public clouds. And now I'd like to turn it back over to the operator to turn it over to the first question."

As our portfolio has expanded, and as we had a focus selling beyond RHEL, we were becoming more strategic in customers' portfolios so their willing to commit longer periods of time, so those are committed deals. I think the flip side of that is customers are getting much more used to consumption-based models, and so those very, very large deals they're more comfortable paying a year at a time. I think 4 or 5 years ago when we did a 3-year deal, the majority of them paid upfront because they were used to budgeting like they would for a license deal. Now they're getting more used to consumption-ish type deals, and so they're happy to commit to annual payments and so that certainly causing, but they are committed deals. And the other thing I would say is as they get bigger, linearity, as Frank indicated, gets to be more of a challenge. You get more people involved and there is a cycle we always try to break of people wanting to push to the end before they buy. And so as the deals get bigger, that's unfortunately been working against us."

Those -- let me start off the second one quickly. No those are locked-in commitments, right? It's part of a broad strategy we have to help us over time bring down our overall sales cost is to invest a little more time getting multiyear commitments. Our sales teams can then either go sell other products or sell at other accounts, so those are committed. What I would say overall is I don't think there's anything systemic. I think it really has to do with larger deals just because of their size are more likely to pay upfront -- I mean, pay over time. And so I guess, we see it as a trend in the sense that we have more large deals. And so typically, 8-figure deals want to pay over time versus pay upfront, and we're having more and more of those. And so I wish I could give you a better sense because, again, we don't have that many of those types of deals. And I would say overall, the kind of million-dollar level, those are typically not multiyear deals or if they are, they're still paying upfront. So I think it has more to do with just the absolute size. And so again, it's -- we don't have enough deals to call it a trend, but it wouldn't surprise me that as we do more $20-plus million deals that those will more likely decide to pay over time. I do believe and again, this isn't with great data, this is just talking to customers, I do believe that as customers get more used to consumption models, they're used to paying Amazon, they're used to paying Salesforce and SaaS models. They are getting more comfortable in their budget processes, building in annual payments. We've always sold the subscriptions but, frankly, I think a lot of our customers thought of it like a license and so they would buy long term and they had budget for it that year and that a project and you pay for a project upfront and yes, there was maintenance, but it was mainly budgeted for project and so they wanted to pay us upfront. I think more and more as people use SaaS, they are paying over time. And that -- again, that's anecdotal talking to customers. But I do think budget processes in IT are recognizing that more spend is going to OpEx from CapEx. And so naturally, it's less of a discussion of let me write you a big check upfront, people are getting more used to putting it in OpEx.

I mean, obviously our deals are bigger because the company is multiples of the size it was 5 years ago. I don't believe the concentration's changed. We do look at that metric, I get it every quarter and I haven't noticed anything material in that. I do think there's a dynamic and I heard us -- talking to other CEOs of renewal businesses, it's possible that a deal might slip out of a Q1 into a Q2 or out of a Q2 into Q3, but nothing ever slips out of the Q4. And so I think -- and then once it's in the Q4, obviously it's a renewal that's going to happen on that same date either 1 year or 3 years from now. And so this is kind of naturally, once something gets more back-end loaded, it stays there. And so things may slip from again a month 1 to a month 2, right? And so -- and then once it gets there, it never renews early, it renews on that date. And so I do think there's just the dynamic that's causing a little bit more back-end loading as just the deals happen and then they get stuck on that date for renewal. We've experimented around and talked to customers about doing an 11.5-month deal or a 13-month deal or something to move some of those around, but that's kind of playing cute on the margin. I really do still think that because of the renewal nature, once you get a deal stuck towards the end of quarter or in the fourth quarter, it's just hard to move after that because the compelling event on that is the renewal to reup the deal."

There's no brand-new customer who comes in and spends $20 million on it. The typical nature of those large deals are they include the component of renewal for their existing infrastructure. And that's typically growing because we continue to take share both in middleware and then operating systems from our -- the other players, our competitors in those areas. But these large wins almost always include a significant new infrastructure component That's what makes them big, either OpenStack or OpenShift. And so again, a deal of that size, it's not -- like we had a couple of 8-figure OpenShift-alone deals. But typically, the really big deals will be a combination of a renewal that is growing plus one of the big new infrastructure, again, OpenStack or OpenShift is kind of normal.

And about half of the channel mix is truly kind of no touch where they're out selling. And that's -- obviously, we really like that because it's a reasonably low cost of sale. Another chunk of that is fulfillment. So many of our large customers choose to fulfill through a channel partner for ease of contracting, et cetera, et cetera. So I don't really have a major impact on kind of billings or sales cycles in a major way unless, and over time, as part of our strategy, we want to move more to channels in a kind of low-touch or no-touch way, and that's slowly happening over time."

That legislation was completed in late September if I remember correctly, so it's been 2.5 months now. Can you comment if those deals that have been delayed because of this have now closed, should have enough time? And then second, regarding OpenStack, in the last couple of months, we've seen several vendors actually exit or significantly reduce their investment in OpenStack area, HP did that, Mirantis did that, with a lot of layoffs related to that claiming that public cloud has now moved fast for OpenStack to ever close the gap. I know it was one of your key selling points at the investor event earlier. And so I guess the question is how is your level of confidence today around OpenStack versus what it was during the Investor Day? And has there anything changed with respect to the type of customers that you're seeing actually adopting it?"

And so we feel comfortable that will allow us to get those deals done. So -- and again, the quarter started -- I mean, this is all September through November was our quarter, and so the iffiness around that and how long it was going to go were all issues for us as well as the change in administration, which has frozen a lot. On your question around OpenStack, frankly, I think some of the pullback is related to exactly what we've said in the past. Doing OpenStack and not being an operating system vendor is extremely difficult. And so I don't think it should be surprising that the people you see still bullish on OpenStack or Red Hat, SUSE and Canonical, and we feel very good in our ability to compete with them. We're seeing, as we said, a lot of big deals traction along with it. These are large, technically sophisticated customers who are also large users of public cloud. They see a set a workloads they find it much more economic to run in their own data center. Again, these are typically things where they're not trying to call other services that might be in the public cloud and they are running at scale. And so they are very sophisticated and have a good sense of what makes sense to run on-premise versus what makes sense to run in a hybrid cloud. And so we're seeing really, really good traction there. And obviously, now that we're down to fewer competitors in that space, that's also helped us with our pipeline and outlook as well. So we continue to be very bullish on its role on our portfolio."

In Q3, solid execution allowed us to continue to deliver double-digit growth in a number of our financial metrics, including revenue, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP EPS. 
Some key highlights of the quarter include: strong demand for our cloud-enabling technologies, which is reflected in the 32% constant currency growth in our application development-related and other emerging technologies revenue; our continuing customer traction is evident in our top 25 renewals that were up for renewal this quarter. All 25 renewed, and they did so at more than 120% of their prior annual commitment. As Frank will describe, we closed many large deals including some of the largest deals in Red Hat's history, with strong cross-selling and longer-term commitments from our customers.
Our customers are increasingly adopting the cloud as part of their overall IT strategy and are using Red Hat as a partner. We see customers deploying our cloud-enabling technologies both on-premise and in the public cloud. This group of hybrid cloud customers is growing revenue in the aggregate faster than customers that have not yet embraced these technologies. In fact in Q3, we added hundreds of customer wins with products from our hybrid cloud portfolio, including several OpenStack deals that were over $1 million. Also of note, we closed our second OpenShift deal over $10 million and another OpenShift deal over $5 million. In spite of the many positives in the quarter, we faced a few challenges that tempered the growth of some of the items in our reported results.
First, some sizable November deals in the U.S. federal space have taken longer than initially expected to close, though we expect them to ultimately move forward in the fourth quarter. In addition, similar to the first half of the fiscal year, we were able to secure large multiyear commitments from customers. However, as these deals continue to get larger, sales activity was again more concentrated in the last month of the quarter. And in this quarter, there was a lower level of customers paying upfront for their multiyear deals.
We're adjusting our revenue and cash flow outlook for the year based on these factors, but it's important to note that we continue to expect full year total revenue growth of approximately 17%, with subscription revenue, which is renewable, growing even faster. We are reaffirming our operating margin for the full year of 23%, and we are forecasting cash flow in Q4 up 22% to approximately 28% from Q4 last year based on the confidence of our outlook. 
Importantly, for the long run, we remain confident in our competitive position and our ability to drive future growth. In fact, given our visibility into our pipeline and what has already closed to date, we are confident that we will see a re-acceleration of billings in Q4 into the mid-teens growth rate range and we will end the year with a strong total backlog. 
Before turning the call over to Frank to discuss the details of the quarter and our outlook, let me provide some additional business highlights for the quarter. We continue to see momentum with customers and community around our cloud-enabling technologies, including OpenStack, OpenShift, CloudForm and related offerings that our customers are using to build hybrid clouds. Within our top 30 deals, 7 included Red Hat OpenStack platform, 5 included OpenShift and 5 included storage.
Starting with an OpenStack customer win. Swisscom has deployed Red Hat OpenStack platform and Red Hat virtualization to build their newest technology platform providing the flexibility needed to support ongoing innovation and development across its own organization as well as its customer base. We continue to improve scalability and usability of OpenStack with our recent release of Red Hat OSP 10. Based on the upstream Newton release, OSP 10 drives new features that increase system-wide scalability, ease infrastructure management and improve orchestration while also enhancing network performance and platform security. A new 5-year life cycle support offering for Red Hat OSP 10 can help customers achieve the long-term stability required for mission-critical operations.
We also announced the broad alliance with Ericsson to deliver fully open source and production-ready cloud infrastructure, spanning OpenStack, containers, NFV, SDN and SDI. Through the collaboration, we plan to work together to certify Ericsson's platform and portfolio of solutions.
Red Hat 3scale API management platform was positioned in the leaders quadrant of Gartner's October 16 Full Life Cycle API Management Magic Quadrant. Red Hat 3scale API management platform complements our existing application development related and other emerging technologies and strengthens our ability to help simplify and accelerate customers' digital transformation initiatives.
In our storage portfolio, Red Hat Ceph and Gluster storage were posed positioned in the Visionaries quadrant of Gartner's October 16 Distributed File Systems and Object Storage Magic Quadrant. Red Hat Ceph storage and Red Hat Gluster storage are both highly agile solutions that are built to handle different types of demanding workloads.
Before my final remarks, I'd like to talk about the leadership transition at the CFO level. Effective in late January, Frank will be resigning to join another company as its CEO. Frank has been able to accomplish a great deal to help advance and scale our enterprise, as we continue to experience significant growth. 
I'm grateful that Frank has agreed to stay on until late January and assist with the transition as needed. Upon his resignation, Eric Shander, Vice President, Finance and Accounting, and our Principal Accounting Officer, will assume the role of acting CFO. Eric will bring a rich and solid experience base to this role from his work at Red Hat and almost 25 years of experience at IBM and Lenovo. 
Frank, I've really enjoyed getting to know you and working side by side with you. You'll be greatly missed, and I wish you nothing but success in your new role. You're a talented business leader and executive, and you've left us stronger and well positioned to address the opportunities before us. Thank you, Frank.
In summary, we continue to be pleased with our progress in delivering on our mission to work with communities, customers and partners to create better technology the open source way. I want to thank all Red Hat associates for their continued focus on the success of our customers. I'm confident that this team will continue to deliver against our hybrid cloud growth strategy.
With that, let me turn the call over to Frank."
33679,411710062,1104884,"Red Hat, Inc., Q3 2017 Earnings Call, Dec 21, 2016",2016-12-21,"Earnings Calls","Red Hat, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. I would also like to thank everyone at Red Hat, including my teams within finance, accounting, operations, IT and global workforce solutions. These are some of the best people I've ever worked with, and I'm very grateful to have gotten to",1734,"Thank you, Jim. I would also like to thank everyone at Red Hat, including my teams within finance, accounting, operations, IT and global workforce solutions. These are some of the best people I've ever worked with, and I'm very grateful to have gotten to know each and every one of you. I've received a compelling opportunity to be a CEO at another company, and I couldn't turn it down. However, I have thoroughly enjoyed my time as CFO of Red Hat, and I'm confident this company will have continued success.
Let me begin with a summary of our Q3 performance. Q3 was driven by strong renewals in our large deals, cross selling of our cloud-enabling technologies and lengthening of customer commitments to Red Hat. This sales traction is reflected in our deals greater than $1 million, which are up 20% year-over-year. This is also a reflection of our strategic position with customers as they look to deploy in the hybrid cloud environments using our technologies for years to come.
As Jim noted earlier, the quarter did come with a couple of challenges that affected our metrics. First, we saw a few deals in the federal space that didn't close on the time frame we expected. We believe the proximity of our quarter to the continuing resolution legislation relating to the federal budget was a factor. The continuing resolution legislation has been signed, and we do expect them to move forward in the fourth quarter.
Second, we closed several large multiyear deals, including 2 deals over $20 million, which did not build beyond the first year. As we have stated in the past, customers' desire to pay beyond 1 year can fluctuate and it has an impact on the long-term portion of our billings proxy when this occurs. In Q2, we saw strong growth in our billings proxy due in part to more customers paying upfront for their multiyear contracts, whereas strength in multiyear contracts during Q3 continued more to growth in the backlog.
Third, as Jim noted, we saw our sales activity more concentrated in the last month of the quarter versus our historic norm, similar to the second quarter. We are focusing on improving -- making improvements in linearity, and we believe similar linearity could occur in Q4 from a forecasting perspective. As we build our FY '18 plan, we plan to drive better quarterly linearity.
Finally, foreign exchange volatility negatively impacted our Q3 revenue by more than $3 million, and our previously implied guidance for Q4 by $16 million due to the fact that the dollar has strengthened against some of our major currencies since we provided our guidance back in September.
With this information as a backdrop, let me provide you some additional information on our quarterly metrics and results. As I just noted, currency rate volatility returned in Q3. Although there has been some stabilization on rates year-over-year, rates used for Q3 guidance and full year guidance have weakened against the U.S. dollar. So for this quarter, I provided both U.S. dollar and constant currency as well as described the impact of currency rate volatility from our previous guidance assumptions. We have also provided a table of constant currency results in our earnings press release. In addition, for a more detailed view of our results and the reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to GAAP measures, please refer to our earnings press release.
We delivered total revenue of $615 million, up 18% or 17% in constant currency. Compared to our September guidance, our result was in the middle of our guidance range, excluding the $3 million impact of FX volatility.
Subscription revenue continued to be the largest driver of our growth at $543 million for the quarter, an increase of 19% year-over-year and 18% in constant currency. This renewable revenue stream now constitutes 88% of total revenue providing a large base of future renewals and up-selling opportunities for new technologies.
We continue to drive high growth across our technology portfolio. Subscription revenue for our infrastructure-related offerings was $431 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year or 14% in constant currency. Our application development related and other emerging technologies subscription revenue was $112 million, an increase of 33% year-over-year or 32% in constant currency. Application development related and other emerging technologies revenue was approximately 18% of total revenue. That's up 210 basis points from a year ago quarter.
On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $143 million grew 16% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating margin was 23.3%, which is consistent with the operating margin direction we provided on our last call. As a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjusts for noncash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and the transaction costs related to business combinations.
Using our non-GAAP estimated annual effective tax rate of 27%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came in at $0.58. This is in line with our guidance after excluding a $0.03 discrete tax benefit, which brought the EPS reported to $0.61 per share, that's up 27% year-over-year.
We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2 billion. We returned $125 million to shareholders in the quarter through the repurchase of approximately 1.6 million shares of stock. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 23% more shares this year than for the full year last year.
Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $1.7 billion, an increase of $221 million or 15% over the same quarter a year ago. On a constant currency basis, total deferred revenue was up 14%. The total change in deferred revenue from a cash flow statement, which neutralizes most of the impact of currency fluctuations increased by $64 million since the end of Q2.
The rolling 4 quarter billings proxy, which is calculated by adding revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last 4 quarters, was $635 million. That's up 14% on a constant currency basis and 13% U.S. dollar year-over-year.
Operating cash flow of $136 million for the quarter decreased from a year ago's Q3 operating cash flow of $148 million. Year-to-date operating cash flow is $465 million. Although we continue to deliver strong collections resulting in FX-adjusted day sales outstanding at 58 days, which is down from 59 days in the year ago quarter, overall collections and cash flow were mainly impacted by the similar sales linearity we saw in Q2. I will now review the metrics for the business momentum and some of the large deals in the quarter.
Our geographies saw a continued growth in bookings. This quarter, 57% of the bookings came from the Americas, 27% in EMEA and 16% in Asia Pacific versus a 60%, 26%, 14% split in Q3 last year. The Q3 route-to-market mix was 72% from the channel, 28% from the direct sales force, and that compares to 67% and 33% split in Q3 of last year. This mix shift year-over-year is driven in part by our desire to leverage channel partners that influence customers' buying decisions.
Our proxy for bookings duration was 24 months, higher than the duration last year and our historic duration of 21 months. Customers' demand to extend the length of their commitment with Red Hat, combined with the strength in our cloud-enabling technologies, is an additional proof point of customers choosing to implement hybrid cloud strategies.
Within our 30 largest deals, this marks the first time for this metric that all 30 of them were $2 million or more. 8 of those deals were in excess of $5 million, 3 of those deals were in excess of $10 million. We also had 2 deals of $20 million in the same quarter.
Cross-selling was strong, with over 60% of the deals -- the top 30 deals including 1 or more components from our group of Application development related and other emerging technologies offerings.
Financial services and technology and media were our top verticals in Q3, followed by government and other mainstream customers in sectors such as health care and industrial products.
Looking beyond the top 30 deals to all deals over $1 million, this was a record third quarter for the large deals, with 73 deals over $1 million, which were up 20% year-over-year. For fiscal year 2017 year-to-date, we have seen a 40% increase in the number of deals over $1 million compared to the same period in fiscal year 2016. This traction highlights Red Hat's growing strategic importance in our customers' data centers. And finally, all 25 of the top 25 deals that renewed in the quarter did renew, and the average value of the top 25 deals up for renewal exceeded 120%.
Now I'd like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and the foreign exchange rates that have weakened significantly since we last gave guidance in September. We are adjusting our full year revenue guidance to reflect the change in foreign currency rates, our Q3 performance and linearity impact. We are now forecasting $2.397 billion to $2.405 billion, which is up approximately 17% in U.S. dollars. We are reaffirming our non-GAAP operating margin to approximately 23%. We are adjusting the cash flow in the range from $770 million to $785 million to reflect the linearity impact and our forecast of collections and disbursements. We are forecasting full year non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $2.27 per share, assuming approximately $1 million to $2 million per quarter forecast for other income; a 27% non-GAAP annual tax rate; and fully diluted share count of 183 million shares.
For Q4 specifically, this implies the following outlook: we expect revenue to be in the range of $614 million to $622 million. This is up 14% in U.S. dollars or approximately 16% in constant currency at the high end of the range. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 24%, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.61 and 181 million fully diluted shares. Based on my annual guidance, the implied cash flow for Q4 is $305 million to $320 million or up 22% to approximately 28%. That's a range of 22% to 28%.
Overall, we remain optimistic about the company's long-term growth opportunity with our position to serve our customers' demand for hybrid cloud solutions. We continue to see strong adoption of our hybrid cloud solutions that span both private and public clouds. And now I'd like to turn it back over to the operator to turn it over to the first question."

As our portfolio has expanded, and as we had a focus selling beyond RHEL, we were becoming more strategic in customers' portfolios so they're willing to commit longer periods of time, so those are committed deals. I think the flip side of that is customers are getting much more used to consumption-based models, and so those very, very large deals they're more comfortable paying a year at a time. I think 4 or 5 years ago when we did a 3-year deal, the majority of them paid upfront because they were used to budgeting like they would for a license deal. Now they're getting more used to consumption-ish type deals, and so they're happy to commit to annual payments and so that certainly causing, but they are committed deals. And the other thing I would say is as they get bigger, linearity, as Frank indicated, gets to be more of a challenge. You get more people involved and there is a cycle we always try to break of people wanting to push to the end before they buy. And so as the deals get bigger, that's unfortunately been working against us."

I think it really has to do with larger deals just because of their size are more likely to pay upfront -- I mean, pay over time. And so I guess, we see it as a trend in the sense that we have more large deals. And so typically, 8-figure deals want to pay over time versus pay upfront, and we're having more and more of those. And so I wish I could give you a better sense because, again, we don't have that many of those types of deals. And I would say overall, the kind of million-dollar level, those are typically not multiyear deals or if they are, they're still paying upfront. So I think it has more to do with just the absolute size. And so again, it's -- we don't have enough deals to call it a trend, but it wouldn't surprise me that as we do more $20-plus million deals that those will more likely decide to pay over time. I do believe and again, this isn't with great data, this is just talking to customers, I do believe that as customers get more used to consumption models, they're used to paying Amazon, they're used to paying Salesforce and SaaS models. They are getting more comfortable in their budget processes, building in annual payments. We've always sold the subscriptions but, frankly, I think a lot of our customers thought of it like a license and so they would buy long term and they had budget for it that year and that a project and you pay for a project upfront and yes, there was maintenance, but it was mainly budgeted for project and so they wanted to pay us upfront. I think more and more as people use SaaS, they are paying over time. And that -- again, that's anecdotal talking to customers. But I do think budget processes in IT are recognizing that more spend is going to OpEx from CapEx. And so naturally, it's less of a discussion of let me write you a big check upfront, people are getting more used to putting it in OpEx. And that's probably a trend you'll see across software companies."

You're talking about more seasonality in your quarters in 2Q that end up more in Q3 and we're talking a lot about really big deals. If we think about the Red Hat business overall, are we just that much more weighted towards big deals? I mean is there any sort of market that you can give us? What percentage of your business today is dependent on the big deals? And how has that trended from a year ago or 3 years ago? Is this just so much more big deal-oriented company than it was 3, 5 years ago?"

I mean, obviously our deals are bigger because the company is multiples of the size it was 5 years ago. I don't believe the concentration's changed. We do look at that metric, I get it every quarter and I haven't noticed anything material in that. I do think there's a dynamic and I heard us -- talking to other CEOs of renewal businesses, it's possible that a deal might slip out of a Q1 into a Q2 or out of a Q2 into Q3, but nothing ever slips out of the Q4. And so I think -- and then once it's in the Q4, obviously it's a renewal that's going to happen on that same date either 1 year or 3 years from now. And so this is kind of naturally, once something gets more back-end loaded, it stays there. And so things may slip from again a month 1 to a month 2, right? And so -- and then once it gets there, it never renews early, it renews on that date. And so I do think there's just the dynamic that's causing a little bit more back-end loading as just the deals happen and then they get stuck on that date for renewal. We've experimented around and talked to customers about doing an 11.5-month deal or a 13-month deal or something to move some of those around, but that's kind of playing cute on the margin. I really do still think that because of the renewal nature, once you get a deal stuck towards the end of quarter or in the fourth quarter, it's just hard to move after that because the compelling event on that is the renewal to reup the deal."

But is -- we've been paying down to the kind of manager, country manager level bonuses around linearity. We haven't want to take it out through the individual sales person because, at this point, we hadn't wanted to kind of get them worried so much about that, that they're not worried about serving the customer. And so we've been trying to put in some compensation at kind of the sales manager level to try to drive that behavior. And we're still trying to experiment with getting it right. And we haven't quite gotten it right, which is why in Q4, we are assuming linearity that looks more like Q3, which is a little worse than our plan, which is the reason we pulled revenue down a bit for an assumption of worse linearity than we had originally planned."

To be blunt, part of that has to do with how we set our sales comp plans. Part of our strategy to over time be more efficient with our go to market is to sign more long-term deals, so we're not having to spend more time on renewals because they're locked in. And we emphasize that more in this year's plan. And so that kind of -- I guess one of the reasons we've gone from 21 to 24, we're still working on what we do for next year. But I do think as we get bigger and people are building things like OpenShift and OpenStack into their long-term infrastructures, they want to do long-term deals with us as well so we have the commercial terms worked out. So I do think you're likely to see some elevation. Will it stay at 24 or turn into 23? I don't think that's hard for us to be able to say. Let me also come back -- so I missed the second part of the last question around consumption models. We typically do, at minimum, 1-year deals. There are a few specific instances where customers for whatever reason, want to be able to burst on to a cloud for specific types of workloads where we've done some consumption-ish type related deals. But that's a small handful of cases that are part of very, very large existing relationships."

There's no brand-new customer who comes in and spends $20 million on it. The typical nature of those large deals are they include the component of renewal for their existing infrastructure. And that's typically growing because we continue to take share both in middleware and then operating systems from our -- the other players, our competitors in those areas. But these large wins almost always include a significant new infrastructure component That's what makes them big, either OpenStack or OpenShift. And so again, a deal of that size, it's not -- like we had a couple of 8-figure OpenShift-alone deals. But typically, the really big deals will be a combination of a renewal that is growing plus one of the big new infrastructure, again, OpenStack or OpenShift is kind of normal. In terms of the channel mix, I don't know if that really changes a lot. Recognize that's a measure around fulfillment. And about half of the channel mix is truly kind of no touch where they're out selling. And that's -- obviously, we really like that because it's a reasonably low cost of sale. Another chunk of that is fulfillment. So many of our large customers choose to fulfill through a channel partner for ease of contracting, et cetera, et cetera. So I don't really have a major impact on kind of billings or sales cycles in a major way unless, and over time, as part of our strategy, we want to move more to channels in a kind of low-touch or no-touch way, and that's slowly happening over time."

Can you comment if those deals that have been delayed because of this have now closed, should have enough time? And then second, regarding OpenStack, in the last couple of months, we've seen several vendors actually exit or significantly reduce their investment in OpenStack area, HP did that, Mirantis did that, with a lot of layoffs related to that claiming that public cloud has now moved fast for OpenStack to ever close the gap. I know it was one of your key selling points at the investor event earlier.

So -- and again, the quarter started -- I mean, this is all September through November was our quarter, and so the iffiness around that and how long it was going to go were all issues for us as well as the change in administration, which has frozen a lot. On your question around OpenStack, frankly, I think some of the pullback is related to exactly what we've said in the past. Doing OpenStack and not being an operating system vendor is extremely difficult. And so I don't think it should be surprising that the people you see still bullish on OpenStack or Red Hat, SUSE and Canonical, and we feel very good in our ability to compete with them. We're seeing, as we said, a lot of big deals traction along with it. These are large, technically sophisticated customers who are also large users of public cloud. They see a set a workloads they find it much more economic to run in their own data center. Again, these are typically things where they're not trying to call other services that might be in the public cloud and they are running at scale. And so they are very sophisticated and have a good sense of what makes sense to run on-premise versus what makes sense to run in a hybrid cloud. And so we're seeing really, really good traction there. And obviously, now that we're down to fewer competitors in that space, that's also helped us with our pipeline and outlook as well. So we continue to be very bullish on its role on our portfolio."
