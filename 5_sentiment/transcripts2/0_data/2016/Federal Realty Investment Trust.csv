Thanks for joining us today. Again, I certainly look forward to seeing all of -- most of you in a few weeks Citi Conference in Florida, where we can talk more about our company and our industry.

Again, I certainly look forward to seeing all of -- most of you in a few weeks Citi Conference in Florida, where we can talk more about our company and our industry. I also want to thank so many of you for good wishes that you conveyed with the announcement of our admission into the S&P 500 late last month, makes our whole team feel particularly proud and made even sweeter. So thank you, all.
Now, lets talk about 2015 results and 2016 expectations, and start up by noting that FFO per share of a $1.37 in the quarter and $5.32 for the year for early are both all-time records for our company and represents 7% quarterly FFO per share growth and 7.7% annual FFO per share growth.
Now, let's just put that growth into context. We always try to walk the talk when we it comes taking the long-term view in of a business plan. And that includes sometimes in doing things that the certain quarterly metrics like same-store growth and occupancy for mid and long-term value enhancement. It's why we went out on a limb a few years back, before Assembly Row opened, to lay out a plan and double our income over the next decade. That was in 2013, when we subsequently finished the year with 7% earnings growth only to follow that with 7.2% growth in 2014 and now, 7.7% growth in 2015.
If you are aware the rule 72, you will know that are on or a bit ahead of schedule. So far so good. And with the first the big development projects coming into their own and the second phase is now underway, raw material for future growth that we acquired in Miami and California late we are as optimistic today, if not more so, than we were back in 2013 ability to double by 2023. To us, it's more important than ever to have and execute on a long-term consistent for sustainable plan that relies less on outside uncontrollable events and more on the execution within our own portfolio, really
All right. So what does it mean for 2016 expectations. Well first, it means that we're planning on 6% to 7% FFO growth this year, marginally lower where we've been, but strong nonetheless. Because of the conscious and aggressive approach that we spoke about on our last quarter's call, to actively create anchor vacancy by replacing weak tenants with stronger ones. And more importantly, unlocking redevelopment opportunities at number of our larger core shopping centers, that was before the most recent news about the sports authority, where we have 5 locations generating $3.4 million net annual rent. All good nws for the future, and providing more growth and value long before 2023, but dilutive to same-store growth in occupancy today.
Hopefully, you remember my remarks from last quarter's call that attempered to prepare investor for the impact that strategy would have come on those metrics in the fourth quarter that we just reported, and continuing into 2016. Well, I promised to spare you the 5-tool baseball on this call, I've heard plenty about from you -- for most of you over the last 3 months, I do want to update you on the plan.
To recap, when we broke the company up between core and mixed-use earlier in the year, and brought additional real estate talent to leave the core, which by the way caused the higher level of G&A. We did so, in order to ensure that the all-important core portfolio got the attention and aggressive Asset Management that it deserves. The objective is for the core to produce even more value and continue to act as the strongest possible foundation as the development and acquisition pipeline. In part, that means getting control of space that has long hindered value creation at certain shopping centers.
We remember that we spoke about the A&P which was the most obvious example, and we had four. One, AMP 1 Pat market all in New Jersey and Long Island. Four leases have significant value the multiple parties and certainly that we chose not to participate in that process I'm very confident that with four would have been bought by someone, which would have resulted in 0 downtime and 0 lost rent in any of those spaces. And if our business plan were one-dimensional, we might have let that happen. But we died. Nearly 185,000 square feet of space, that's nearly a full point of occupancy and over $3 million of annual same-store growth that went out the door with the bankruptcy. And by the way, we had to pay several millions of dollars to get the right to lose that income. Our assessment is that, that $7 million of investment plus a year of more downtime would pay down many times over, not only in terms of the four walls of the grocery stores, which is how a lot of people look at the lease value, but by unlocking more redevelopment opportunities that improved the entire shopping centers. While same-store growth in occupancy were negatively impacted in the fourth quarter, and will be in 2016, the future value of these and other centers where we a similar strategy will be far higher.
We are deep into exploring redevelopment plans on all of our newfound opportunities, and I'm excited about possibilities. Jim will summarize the impacts in his remarks in a few minutes. 
Now I don't know if we could have made that decision if we didn't have a clear long-term plan and same-store growth and year end were the only considerations. 
All right, let's back up and talk about leasing for a minute and there is plenty of it happening.
99 deals done in the quarter. 88 of them comparable for over 380,000 feet at an average rent of $31.88, 23% higher than the $26 per foot the prior tenants was paying. The leasing strength was broad with both anchor deals and small shopping rules registering double-digit growth. The tenant improvement dollars per square-foot associated with those leaders requires explanation, because most of it comes from two redevelopment projects: The deal at our headquarters side of Plaza, and the deck field in at Mall on Long Island. Capital for those deals are both included and considered in the overall returns of the project. So be careful not to double that capital as both leasing capital and redevelopment capital is one in the same. Anyway you look at it, these are strong leasing results.
In addition to the comparable deals, we also executed 11 non-comparable deals, largely on the new developments, representing an additional 58,000 square feet of space. So 440 square feet of deals in a three-month period. There's plenty of productive leasing been done these days in virtually all markets we do business. And, we're betting that that will continue in 2016 for our products in all locations. And that's why we're consciously trying to get back on the performing anchor space. We want to use these economic conditions to re-live them. We see a good sampling of that have been holding on for years or either give it up and payee Centrale City Sports or we will suite. We are fine with that. And as I said, are anxious to get to either release or redevelop.
So I haven't such an acquisition or development yet, so let me get to the highlights, may have a lot going up. From continued advancement of the construction and leasing at both Pike & Rose and Assembly to the continued opening of more and more tenants at the very successful point development in California.  To continue disciplined construction of fully leased 500 Santana Row set the house Mind Technology warehouse by the end of this year. So the closing on October 1 of Sunset Place in South Miami, where we are aggressively working to plan -- to develop a plan to better exploit its A1 location, to the unwind of our 11-year joint venture with Clariant through the acquisition of their 70% interest in 6 shopping centers in Suburban Boston, New York, which by the way creates more fresh powder for redeveloping.
So we got more going on to keep our 5 growth buckets fully productive, and I can remember my 18 years year. Let me give you a few more updates on those big projects and then I will turn it over to Jim. At Pike & Rose, residential lease up continues to progress quite well with over 40% of the building leased at the Palace as of today at rents that are in line or even better than our underwriting. The remainder of that residential leasing will require the rest of 2016 to reach stabilization, which again is consistent with our expectations. Secondly, we are well underway on the next phase. The Phase 2 garage is done in open, and we've just broken ground on the 2 largest buildings in Phase II this month. It will take 2 years to get it all open with a 700-foot plus long Main Street and a sense of mixing from
In Massachusetts, Assembly Row continues to get better and better, with one of our concerns during the second phase construction with adequate parking, since lots are now under construction. That's a high-class problem for the initial on mixed-use problem, but it's because this is already a very successful new in the Greater Boston area. It's about to get a whole lot better as partners employees begin occupying the new building by midyear of '16. Very exciting progress there, which is clearly spilled over to the tower center, where we hope to be making some important merchandising and economic upgrades in the next few quarters.
In San Jose, 500 Santana Row construction is progressing a bit better than we expected, in terms of both cost and potentially schedule, which as a whole, will result in a 9% cash on cost year on stabilization. That would make Santana, 500 Santana Row the third project in a row with Santana. Residential product, have been the first two, where the initial revenues exceeded our underwriting. That's not a fluke. It speaks to the big picture point about mixed use projects done well. While the initial phase that need to need to create the environment are complicated and also a little less smooth than we would like, the long-term value creation to maturation and incremental development for these ambitious projects is extremely rewarding and incredibly enduring.
Similarly, at the point El Segundo, the successful initial tenant opening at the end last summer had continued and grown as more and more tenants have opened. The final couple of spaces are expected to be leased and opened in 2016. Again, on-time, on budget. I don't have a significant update for you today on our property acquisitions in South Florida, which are performing as planned, as we them. Our most senior team, including Don Briggs, Chris Weilminster and Dawn Becker, along with our partnered, and Michael are fully immersed in redevelopment mode, exploit the possible the city officials, retailers and others. And that applies to both CocoWalk and Sunset. State tune now.
And finally, last month we concluded a very successful 11-year shopping center joint venture with Clariant fund by acquiring their 70 percentage interest in Plaza and Plaza in Suburban Boston, Greenlawn Plaza on Long Island, and Free State Shopping center, Plaza del Mercado and Plaza in suburban Washington, DC, what we felt was a very fair and favorable purchase price of $154 million. All of these assets are located in markets we know well, and have seen strong growth from. And we've got a number of redevelopment and releasing opportunities that these properties that are core team -- new core team is focused on. More raw material for future growth.
Okay. That's enough for me now. 2015 was a very fine year for us, full of not only measurable accomplishments, but as a more importantly, the of a plan and structure focused on accelerated value creation throughout the second half of this decade and beyond. Thank you all for your interest, support. And I'll now turn it over to Jim, and look forward to your questions afterwards."

As Don highlighted, our team delivered yet another record for the in terms of FFO per share, which is $1.37, represented 7% growth over the prior year quarter, or 7.7% for the full year. For the many of",1132,"Thank you, Don and Leah, and good morning, everyone. As Don highlighted, our team delivered yet another record for the in terms of FFO per share, which is $1.37, represented 7% growth over the prior year quarter, or 7.7% for the full year. For the many of you who parked at the top just or just above our guidance, that our 37 was just below the top end of our previously provided range.
In a quarter, where we continue to invest in the future by intentionally taking down additional box vacancy, adding to our team, selling non-core assets and transaction costs for favorable acquisition, we are particularly pleased that the bottom line results driven by our operation, leasing, acquisition and development team. 
Turning to the numbers. Overall, property operating income grew at 5.9% over the prior year. Even with the decline in occupancy, reflecting higher anchor rollover, our core portfolio continue to be a significant driver growth. That core grew at 2.6% or approximately 3.8% for the full year on a same-store basis including redevelopment.
As in prior quarters, allow me to again emphasize that our same-store pool represents approximately 94% of our total POI. In other words, it represents substantially all of our portfolio, and then truly reflects underlying core performance. This quarter, the downtime associated with the Assembly Row we discussed, as well as the other onetime items, produced about 150 basis points of drag. We highlighted this trend last quarter, and as I will discuss further guidance, we expect this rollover drag to begin to in the latter part of this year, resulting in 2015 same-store NOI growth including redevelopment of approximately 3% the 315%. 
Allow me to pause for a moment. I can think of very few portfolios actual growth, even while taking down occupancy. That speaks to the bumps embedded in of our leases, several quarters of double-digit rent rollover growth and the successful delivery of our redevelopment.
Our first phase of Assembly and Pike & Rose contributed approximately of POI in the quarter, down slightly on a sequential basis as the Palace high-rise opening in the office space deliveries triggered full operating expenses. The office lease-up is complete and tenants will continue to take through this year and early next. In addition, as Don mentioned, the lease up at Palace is going well, and we expect to hit a stabilize occupancy in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Finally, our acquisitions of CocoWalk and Sunset Place, which are performing well against our acquisition underwriting, also contributed significantly to our overall POI growth.
G&A remained stable at $8.1 million and interest expense declined $1 million, reflecting a lower average rate achieved through our refinancing during the year of 4.1%, offset by lower capitalized interest during the quarter as we continue to place development into Again, bottom line, FFO grew 7% for the quarter or 7.7% for the year.
That absolute bottom line performance while we continue to invest in the future, is something that team takes great pride in. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $53 million drawn under our $600 million revolver, net debt to EBITDA, 5.3x a weighted average debt tenure of 10 years, which together provides maximum flexibility and liquidity to fund all of our growth in any underway.
Turning to guidance for 2016, we affirmed that the previously provided range of $5.65 to $5.71 a share. Range of growth of approximately 6% to 7% or slightly below of our long-term plan. As we discussed last quarter, this is a true range that will be impacted by several variables during the year.
As Don covered in his remarks, targeted capture in all of a vacancy drives a significant amount of drag in the year. The targeted anchor roll-ower which represents approximately $6 million of downtime in the year, approximately $8 million of annualized rent. It's written by 10 of our properties. The notable spaces include the Antilles at former Hudson space at crossing and the former space and Grand Park.
In total, the targeted anchor rollover represents approximately 465,000 square feet at some of our very best assets, where the investment in downtime this year should pay significant in the future. And as Don discussed in his remarks, we are very excited about the opportunity to unlock value at these centers, the development, repositioning and re-leasing. Overall, we expect a significantly exceed the prior rent approximately 1350 a foot on three larger space. In short, we believe we will drive or deliver better retailers at better rents and significantly improve these assets.
In addition to this investment in future growth, there are several other investments in growth to consider from a timing perspective if you look at here. I mentioned and again, we expect to stabilization of that approximately $100 million investment to occur in the fourth quarter from an occupancy perspective. The office space at Pike & Rose and Assembly, which represents approximately $80 million of investment, is now fully commited and will continuously rent commencing throughout the year and early next as tenants take occupancy 
500 Santana Row, our 234,000 square foot office building that represents approximately $115 million of investment, is a 100% pre-lease and will deliver late in the fourth quarter and rent commence in 2017. The Point redevelopment at Plaza, El Segundo continues to perform exceptionally well, and is expected to stabilize in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Our acquisition of our joint venture partner 70% interest in the 6 core assets that Don discussed, is expected to be neutral to FFO this year after transaction cost and factoring in the sale of Courtyard Shops, which we completed in the fourth quarter. We do expect this acquisition to contribute approximately $0.02 to $0.03 in 2017. 
And finally, we are well underway on the second phases of the Pike & Rose and Assembly, to represent $600 million investment, and expect those phases to begin delivering in the latter part of '17 and 2018. From a capital standpoint, we expect to fund approximately $350 million of development and redevelopment with a mix of funds from operations, long-term debt and equity and our ATM. Finally, consistent with our practice, our guidance does not factor in any further acquisitions or dispositions that we may execute during the year.

And the idea of encumbering through restrictive anchor leases, things like  Troy, Montrose, Crossroads in Chicago shows you that we -- as you say, we have that appetite. I can tell was in Chicago for example, there's a Party City. The Party City for 2008, we would have done everything we can to keep them there. We would have lowered the rent, we would've done whatever was needed to do to keep the occupancy and to keep the income coming in the door. In 2016, we do that differently. We are certainly willing to play hardball on the lease terms effectively. You got to go, you got to go. Because we are much more confident with respect to where it is that we can release and what is it that we can do in terms of encumbering the shopping center. Is there a points, of course, to the extent the economy turns around and goes the other way, we are going to feel a whole lot different about that just like we did back then.

And that very much aligns with what we felt happened. And this is what we see. We have best in class assets, which we see located on markets that really align with the retailers, core customer portfolio, which is incredibly important to them. They know that's our to deliver best in class property level operation execution and maintenance and are focused on delivering really best tenant mix available aligned with their ability to be successful. That puts us in the best opportunity to take advantage of the growth that retailers are pursuing. And there clearly is growth demand from the retailers. They are just -- their outlook is just a lot more -- they are a lot more focused on finding sites that do algin with the core customer. The deals that they are doing are taking much longer. The lease negotiations are certainly more difficult. And there are a lot more selective. So we definitely see opportunity with regard to growth in retailers, and we think that they are looking in the markets where we have our real estate. So I think, from our perspective, we are set up to take advantage of what demand exist out there both on the as well as on the small shop segments. As John pointed out, I mean it's very important for us as we unlever some of the and these opportunities, to take advantage of putting a new relevant box retailers that also rising tide will allow us to really take advantage of the demand from the small shop tenants.

As Chris says, it's more deliberate. It's a tougher negotiation, all that. That's fine. The reality is, if you were to see or to know, if I took you for a ride over to Grant Park Plaza, which is inside the in Fairbanks, we've not been able to do anything with that property for a long time because of the leases in place. This is a particular point in time where we have a shop. If we think we released to -- or kept the same anchor in it and extended those existing leases, we would be losing the shot to create significant value for a decade or more. So when you overall take a look at it, I mean this is with the decision, with everything we've done, we are still 93% occupied. This is hardly, place. It does take a very measured and careful approach to a 10 shopping centers in particular, that we've been trying for ever to figure out a way, because demand is there to create value, but they've been unencumbered, whether is an A&P lease or an old lease or whatever it is that a particular shopping center that was it to get it back. That seems like a smart approach to me. It's not all the way over on one side, or all the way over on the another. Again, it's balanced."

We don't turn that on and off and as a continuation of that into '16. But the better tenant, there are better tenants and those better tenants are doing very well. There is more of a bifurcation is what I am saying between good and not so good, today, then they were 3, 4 years ago. That's the distinction. And that's why, I guess, I am talking my own book here, but it's what I believe. That's why the bifurcation between the desirable real estate and not desirable real estate is wider than it certainly was 3, 4 years ago. Those things work in tandem. And that's why we are a bit more optimistic with respect to our leasing and the strategy in '16 and '17 and some others are."

Again, I certainly look forward to seeing all of -- most of you in a few weeks at Citi Conference in Florida, where we can talk more about our company and our industry. I also want to thank so many of you for the recognition and good wishes that you conveyed with the announcement of our admission into the S&P 500 late last month, makes our whole team feel particularly proud and your nice words made it even sweeter. So thank you, all.
Now, lets talk about 2015 results and 2016 expectations, and start out by noting that FFO per share of $1.37 in the quarter and $5.32 for the year before  extinguishment of debt are both all-time records for our company and represents 7% quarterly FFO per share growth and 7.7% annual FFO per share growth.
Now, let's just put that growth into context. We always try to walk the talk when it comes to taking the long-term view on our business plan. And that includes sometimes doing things that diminish certain quarterly metrics like same-store growth and occupancy for mid and long-term value enhancement. It's why we went out on a limb a few years back, before Assembly Row opened, to lay out a plan and double our income over the next decade. That was in 2013, when we subsequently finished the year with 7% earnings growth only to follow that with 7.2% growth in 2014 and now, 7.7% growth in 2015.
If you are aware of the rule of 72, you will note that we're on or a bit ahead of schedule. So far so good. And with the first phases of the big development projects coming into their own and the second phase is now underway along with the raw material for future growth that we acquired in Miami and California we are as optimistic today, if not more so, than we were back in 2013 as for our ability to double by 2023. To us, it's more important than ever to have and execute on a long-term consistent and sustainable plan that relies less on outside uncontrollable events and more on the execution within our own portfolio, really proud of that.
All right. So what does it mean for 2016 expectations? Well first, it means that we're planning on 6% to 7% FFO growth this year, marginally lower where we've been, but strong nonetheless. Because of the conscious and aggressive efforts that we spoke about on our last quarter's call, to actively create anchor vacancy by replacing weak tenants with stronger ones. And more importantly, unlocking redevelopment opportunities at a number of our larger core shopping centers, and that was before the most recent news about sports authority, where we have 5 locations generating $3.4 million in annual rent. All good news for the future, and providing more growth and value long before 2023, but dilutive to same-store growth in occupancy today.
Hopefully, you remember my remarks from last quarter's call that attempered to prepare investors for the impact that strategy would have on those metrics in the fourth quarter that we just reported, and continuing into 2016. Well, I promised to spare you the 5-tool baseball player analogy on this call, I've heard plenty about that from you -- from most of you over the last 3 months, I do want to update you on the plan.
To recap, when we broke the company up between core and mixed-use earlier in the year, and brought in additional real estate talent to leave the core, which by the way caused a higher level of G&A. We did so, in order to ensure that the all-important core portfolio got the attention and aggressive asset management that it deserves. The objective is for the core to produce even more value and continue to act at the strongest possible foundation for the development and acquisition pipeline. In part, that means getting control of space that has long hindered value creation at certain shopping centers.
You'll remember that we spoke about the A&P bankruptcy which was the most obvious example, and we had 4: 1 A&P, 1 Pathmark, and 2 Waldbaums, all in New Jersey and Long Island. All 4 leases have significant value to multiple parties and certainly that we chose not to participate in that bankruptcy process. I'm very confident that with all 4 leases would have been bought by someone, which would have resulted in 0 downtime and 0 lost rent in any of those spaces. And if our business plan were one-dimensional, we might have let that happen. But we didn't. Nearly a 185,000 square feet of space, that's nearly a full point of occupancy and over $3 million of annual same-store growth that went out the door with the bankruptcy. And by the way, we had to pay several millions of dollars to get the right to lose all that income. Our assessment is that, that several million dollar investment plus a year more of downtime would payback many times over, not only in terms of the 4 walls of those grocery stores, which is how a lot of people look at the leases value, but by unlocking more redevelopment opportunities that improve the entire shopping centers. While same-store growth and occupancy were negatively impacted in the fourth quarter, and will be in 2016, the future value of these and other centers where we have employed a similar strategy will be far higher.
We are deep into exploring redevelopment plans on all of our newfound opportunities, and I'm excited about the possibilities. Jim will summarize the impacts in his remarks in a few minutes. 
Now I don't know if we could have made that decision if we didn't have a clear long-term plan in same-store growth and yearend occupancy were the only considerations. 
All right, let's back up and talk about leasing for a minute and there is plenty of it happening.
99 deals done in the quarter. 88 of them comparable for over 380,000 feet at an average rent of $31.88, 23% higher than the $26 per foot the prior tenant was paying. The leasing strength was broad with both anchor deals and small shopping ones registering double-digit growth. The tenant improvement dollars per square-foot associated with those leases requires explanation, because most of it comes from two redevelopment projects: The Saks OFF 5TH deal at our headquarter site at Congressional Plaza, and the Dicks Field & Stream deal at Melville Mall on Long Island. Capital for those deals are both included and considered in the overall return thresholds of the project, so -- but careful not to double count that capital as both leasing capital and redevelopment capital is one and the same. Anyway you look at it, these are strong leasing results.
In addition to the 88 comparable deals, we also executed 11 non-comparable deals, largely on the new developments, representing an additional 58,000 square feet of space. So 440 square feet of deals in a three-month period. There's plenty of productive leasing being done these days in virtually all markets we do business in. And, we're betting that that will continue in 2016 for our products in our locations. And it's why we're consciously trying to get back on the performing anchor space. We want to use these stable economic conditions to relieve them. We see a good sampling of mediocre retailers that have been holding on for years or either given up as Hudson Trail, City Sports or we will sue. We are fine with that. And as I said, are anxious to get it to either release or redevelop.
So I haven't touched on acquisitions or development yet, so let me get to the highlights, we have a lot going up. From continued advancement of the construction and leasing at both Pike & Rose and Assembly to the continued opening of more and more tenants at the very successful Point development in  El Segundo, California.  To continued disciplined construction of fully leased 500 Santana Row set to house data mining technology powerhouse Splunk by the end of this year. So the closing on October 1 of Sunset Place in South Miami, where we are aggressively working to plan -- to develop a plan to better exploit its A1 location, to the unwind of our 11-year joint venture with Clarion through the acquisition of their 70% interest in 6 shopping centers in Suburban Boston, New York, and D.C., which by the way creates more fresh powder for redevelopment.
So we got more going on to keep our 5 growth buckets fully productive, and I can remember my 18 years here. Let me give you a few more updates on those big projects and then I will turn it over to Jim. At Pike & Rose, residential lease up continues to progress quite well with over 40% of the building leased at the Pallas as of today at rents that are in line or even a bit better than our underwriting. The remainder of that residential leasing will require the rest of 2016 to reach stabilization, which again is consistent with our expectations. Secondly, we are well underway on the next phase. The Phase II garage is done and open, and we've just broken ground on the 2 largest buildings in Phase II this month. It will take 2 years to get it all open with a 700-foot plus long Main Street and a sense of place long missing from Rockville Pike.
In Somerville, Massachusetts, Assembly Row continues to get better and better, with one of our biggest concerns during the second phase construction being adequate parking, since surface lots are now under construction. That's a high-class problem for the initial phase of a mixed-use project, but it's because this is already a very successful new neighborhood in the Greater Boston area it's about to get a whole lot better as partners employees begin occupying the new building by midyear of '16. Very exciting progress there, which is clearly spilled over to the adjacent Tower Center, where we hope to be making some important merchandising and economic upgrades in the next few quarters.
In San Jose, 500 Santana Row construction is progressing a bit better than we expected, in terms of both cost and potentially schedule, which if it holds will result in a 9% cash on cost yield upon stabilization. That would make Santana, 500 Santana Row the third project in a row with Santana. Residential projects, Levare and Misora being the first two, where the initial revenues exceeded our underwriting. That's not a fluke. It speaks to the big picture point about mixed use projects done well. While the initial phases that need to create the environment are complicated and often a little less smooth than we would like, the long-term value creation to maturation and incremental development of these ambitious projects is extremely rewarding and incredibly enduring.
Similarly, at The Point in El Segundo, the successful initial tenant openings at the end last summer have continued and grown as more and more tenants have opened. The final couple of spaces are expected to be leased and opened in 2016. Again, on-time, on budget. I don't have a significant update for you today on our property acquisitions in South Florida, which are performing as planned, as we underwrote them. Our most senior team, including Don Briggs, Chris Weilminster and Dawn Becker, along with our partner  Grass River and Michael Comras are fully immersed in redevelopment mode exploring the art of the possible with city officials, retailers and others. And that applies to both CocoWalk and Sunset. Stay tuned there.
And finally, last month we concluded a very successful 11-year shopping center joint venture with Clarion Lion fund by acquiring their 70% interest in Atlantic Plaza and Campus Plaza in Suburban Boston, Greenlawn Plaza on Long Island, and Free State Shopping Center, Plaza del Mercado and Barcroft Plaza in suburban Washington, D.C. what we felt was a very fair and favorable purchase price of $154 million. All of these assets are located in markets we know well, and have seen strong growth from. And we've got a number of redevelopment and releasing opportunities at these properties that our core team -- new core team is focused on. More raw material for future growth.
Okay. That's enough for me now. 2015 was a very fine year for us, full of not only measurable accomplishments, but as more importantly, the solidification of a plan and structure focused on accelerated value creation throughout the second half of this decade and beyond. Thank you all for your interest and support. And I'll now turn it over to Jim, and look forward to your questions afterwards."

For the m",1163,"Thank you, Don and Leah, and good morning, everyone. As Don highlighted, our team delivered yet another record for the trots in terms of FFO per share, which is $1.37, represented 7% growth over the prior year quarter, or 7.7% for the full year. For the many of you who perch at the top or just above our guidance, that our 37 was just below the top end of our previously provided range.
In a quarter, where we continue to invest in the future by intentionally taking down additional box vacancy, adding to our team, selling non-core assets and incurring transactional costs for favorable acquisition, we are particularly pleased that the bottom line results driven by our operations, leasing, acquisition and development teams. 
Turning to the numbers. Overall, property operating income grew at 5.9% over the prior year. Even with the decline in occupancy, reflecting higher anchor rollover, our core portfolio continues to be a significant driver of POI growth. That core grew at 2.6% or approximately 3.8% for the full year on a same-store basis including redevelopment.
As in prior quarters, allow me to again emphasize that our same-store pool represents approximately 94% of our total POI. In other words, it represents substantially all of our portfolio, and then truly reflects underlying core performance. This quarter, the downtime associated with the anchor rollover we discussed as well as other onetime items, produced about 150 basis points of drag. We highlighted this trend last quarter, and as I will discuss further in guidance, we expect this rollover drag to begin to ameliorate in the latter part of this year, resulting in 2015 same-store NOI growth including redevelopment of approximately 3% to 3.5%. 
Allow me to pause for a moment. I can think of very few portfolios that show growth even while taking down occupancy. That speaks to the bumps embedded in our leases, several quarters of double-digit rent rollover growth and the successful delivery of our redevelopment.
Our first phases of Assembly and Pike & Rose contributed approximately 3 million of POI in the quarter, down slightly on a sequential basis as the Pallas high-rise opening and the office space deliveries triggered full operating expenses. The office lease-up is complete and tenants will continue to take occupancy through this year and early next. In addition, as Don mentioned, the lease-up at Pallas is going well, and we expect to hit a stabilized occupancy in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Finally, our acquisitions of CocoWalk and Sunset Place, which are performing well against our acquisition underwriting, also contributed significantly to our overall POI growth.
G&A remained stable at $8.1 million and interest expense declined $1 million, reflecting a lower average rate achieved through our refinancing during the year of 4.1%, offset by lower capitalized interest during the quarter as we continue to place development into service. Again, bottom line, FFO grew 7% for the quarter or 7.7% for the year.
That absolute bottom line performance while we continue to invest in the future, is something this team takes great pride in. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $53 million drawn under our $600 million revolver, net debt to EBITDA 5.3x, a weighted average debt tenure of 10 years, which together provides maximum flexibility and liquidity to fund all of our growth and NAV creation underway.
Turning to guidance for 2016, we affirmed that the previously provided range of $5.65 to $5.71 a share. Range of growth of approximately 6% to 7% or slightly below our long-term plan. As we discussed last quarter, this is a true range that will be impacted by several variables during the year.
As Don covered in his remarks, targeted box recapture in all of our vacancy drives a significant amount of drag in the year. The targeted anchor rollover which represented approximately $6 million of downtime in the year, approximately $8 million of annualized rent is driven by 10 of our properties. The notable spaces include the A&P leases at Troy, Melville, and Brick, the former Hudson Trail space at Montrose Crossing  and the former valley space at Graham Park.
In total, the targeted anchor rollover represents approximately 465,000 square feet at some of our very best assets, where the investment in downtime this year should pay significant dividends in the future. And as Don discussed in his remarks, we are very excited about the opportunity to unlock value at these centers to redevelopment, repositioning and re-leasing. Overall, we expect to significantly exceed the prior rent of approximately 1350 a foot on these larger space. In short, we believe we will drive or deliver better retailers at better rents and significantly improve these assets.
In addition to this investment in future growth, there are several other investments in growth to consider from a timing perspective as you look at here. I mentioned Pallas and again, we expect a stabilization of that, approximately $100 million investment to occur in the fourth quarter from an occupancy perspective. The office space at Pike & Rose and Assembly, which represents approximately $80 million of investment, is now fully commited and will continuously rent commencing throughout the year and early next as tenants take occupancy. 
500 Santana Row, our 234,000 square foot office building that represents approximately $115 million of investment, is 100% pre-leased and will deliver late in the fourth quarter and rent commences in 2017. The Point redevelopment at Plaza, El Segundo continues to perform exceptionally well, and is expected to stabilize in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Our acquisition of our joint venture partner 70% interest in the 6 core assets that Don discussed, is expected to be neutral to FFO this year after transaction cost and factoring in the sale of Courtyard Shops, which we completed in the fourth quarter. We do expect this acquisition to contribute approximately $0.02 to $0.03 in 2017. 
And finally, we are well underway on the second phases of Pike & Rose and Assembly, to represent another $600 million of investment, and expect those phases to begin delivering in the latter part of '17 and 2018. From a capital standpoint, we expect to fund approximately $350 million of development and redevelopment with a mix of funds from operations, long-term debt and equity under our ATM. Finally, consistent with our practice, our guidance does not factor in any further acquisitions or dispositions that we may execute during the year.
Before turning the call over to questions, I'd like to introduce,  Leah Andress, our new Investor Relations associate. Leah was formerly with Phillips Realty in D.C.,  and prior to that was an analyst with FBR Capital Markets. Unfortunately, she was also at Tar Heel. We look forward to having all of you to meet Leah very soon. We also look forward to seeing many of you at the Wells and Citi Conference in the next few weeks. With that operator, I would like to now turn the call over to questions."

So from our perspective, and I am feeling great about being able to actually get to something  we like to get to. Secondly, all that is just timing too.

And the idea of unencumbering through restrictive anchor leases, things like Willow Lawn, Brick, Troy, Montrose, Crossroads in Chicago shows you that we -- as you say, we have that appetite. I can tell you that  Crossroads in Chicago for example, there's a Party City. The Party City before 2008, we would have done everything we can to keep them there. We would have lowered the rent, we would've done whatever was needed to do to keep the occupancy and to keep the income coming in the door. In 2016, we do that differently. We are certainly willing to play hardball on the lease terms effectively. You got to go, you got to go. Because we are much more confident with respect to where it is that we can release and what is it that we can do in terms of unencumbering the shopping center.

And that very much aligns with what we felt realty have. And this is what we see. We have best of class assets, which we see located on markets that really align with the retailers, desire core customer portfolio, which is incredibly important to them. They know that's our realty's commitment to deliver best in class property level operation, execution, and maintenance and are focused on delivering really best tenant mix available aligned with their ability to be successful. That puts us in the best opportunity to take advantage of the growth that retailers are pursuing. And there clearly is growth in demand from the retailers. They are just -- their outlook is just a lot more -- they are a lot more focused on finding sites that do algin with the core customer. The deals that they are doing are taking much longer. The lease negotiations are certainly more difficult. And they are a lot more selective. So we definitely see opportunity with regard to growth in retailers, and we think that they are looking in the markets where we have our real estate. So I think, from our perspective, we are set out to take advantage of what demand exist out there both on the box side as well as on the small shop segments, its down $20. I mean its very important for us as we unlever some of the restrictions in these opportunities, to take advantage of putting a new relevant box retailers that also that rising tide will allow us to really take advantage of the demand from the small shop tenants.

And as Chris said, it's more deliberate. It's a tougher negotiation, all that. That's fine. The reality is, if you were to see or to know, if I took you for a ride over to Graham Park Plaza, which is inside the beltway in Fairfax, we've not been able to do anything with that property for a long time because of the leases in place. This is a particular point in time where we have a shop. If we think we released it to -- or kept the same anchor in and extended those existing leases, we would be losing the shot to create significant value for a decade or more. So when you overall take a look at it, I mean this is with the decision, with everything we've done, we are still 93% occupied. This is hardly, ""oh my god empty out the whole place "" right. But it does take a very measured and careful approach to a 10 shopping centers in particular, that we've been trying for ever to figure out a way, because demand is there to create value, but they've been encumbered by whether is an A&P lease or an old valley lease or whatever it is that a particular shopping center that was causing it to get it back. That seems like a smart approach to me. It's not all the way over on one side, or all the way over on the other. Again, it's balanced."

So that is the Dicks deal that was mentioned. And so a lot of it has to do with our making sure maximizing the opportunity within the space. Whether that's an expansion or shrinking and/or really is an improvements to some of the infrastructure that we see going beyond just the tenant. And so we are very proactive in analyzing every single step available to make sure that we're getting the best out of each space. When you think about the amount of our portfolio of 100-plus assets, we've got to squeeze every bit of juice out of each one of them. And so we do analyze them.

You're nervous with respect to what the -- what those tenants' business plans are going to be? How they're going to work in the new world? Are the cuts that they made in their staffing, gut their organizations, with respect to being able to do all that? And what had happened, and it's predictable, if you kind of take a look at it, is if you could be in every boardroom of all those major retailers and smaller retailers along the way, you would, some of them, with respect to what they changed and where they are moving, into a new economy, became extremely good at it and got stronger. A lot of them kind of found mediocrity. And the success of certain areas, not in other areas, but with an improving economy, they held on, they held on, they held on. There's only so long you can hold on, if your business plan is not effectively resonating. And I do think that what we saw, and we felt it in '15, not normal for what we're talking about for '16, was that those tenants that simply did not have business plans that resonated with consumers going forward, were not going to be able to hold on indefinitely. We started to see that in the second half of '15, we decided then to specifically aggressively target them. We don't turn that on and off and there's a continuation of that into '16. But the better tenants, there are better tenants, and those better tenants are doing very well. There's more of a bifurcation, is what I am saying, between good and not so good, today, then there was 3 or 4 years ago. That's the distinction. And that's why, I guess, I'm talking my own book here, but it's what I believe. That's why the bifurcation between desirable real estate and not desirable real estate is wider than it certainly was 3 or 4 years ago. Those things work in tandem. And that's why we're probably a bit more optimistic with respect to our leasing and this strategy in '16 and '17, than some others are."

I think that clearly is a box component that is looking for opportunity. We see the grocery category looking to get more nimble, and do more urban oriented stores or smaller. I think there's a new concept out by Ahold called bfresh, which is taking some of what they've learned over in the European market about providing more deliverables on home meal replacement and working the environment.

And you can see that when you look at our debt to EBITDA metric, which has remained low despite the fact that we have a lot of development that's not producing EBITDA yet.

Again, I certainly look forward to seeing all or most of you in a few weeks at Citi Conference in Florida, where we can talk more about our company and our industry. I also want to thank so many of you for the recognition and good wishes that you conveyed with the announcement of our admission into the S&P 500 late last month, it makes our whole team feel particularly proud and your nice words made it even sweeter. So thank you, all.
Now, lets talk about 2015 results and 2016 expectations, and start out by noting that FFO per share of $1.37 in the quarter and $5.32 for the year, before early extinguishment of debt costs, are both all-time records for our company and represents 7% quarterly FFO per share growth and 7.7% annual FFO per share growth.
Now, let's just put that growth into context. We always try to walk the talk when it comes to taking the long-term view on our business plan. And that includes sometimes doing things that diminish certain quarterly metrics like same-store growth and occupancy for mid and long-term value enhancement. It's why we went out on a limb a few years back, before Assembly Row opened, to lay out a plan to double our income over the next decade. That was in 2013, when we subsequently finished the year with 7% earnings growth only to follow that with 7.2% growth in 2014 and now, 7.7% growth in 2015.
If you are aware of the rule of 72, you will note that we're on or a bit ahead of schedule. So far so good. And with the first phases of the big development projects coming into their own and the second phases now underway, along with the raw material for future growth that we acquired in Miami and California lately, we are as optimistic today, if not more so, than we were back in 2013 as to our ability to double by 2023. To us, it's more important than ever to have and execute on a long-term consistent and sustainable plan that relies less on outside uncontrollable events and more on the execution within our own portfolio. We're really proud of that.
All right. So what does it mean for 2016 expectations? Well first, it means that we're planning on 6% to 7% FFO growth this year, marginally lower than where we've been, but strong nonetheless. Because of the conscious and aggressive effort that we spoke about on last quarter's call to actively create anchor vacancy by replacing weak tenants with stronger ones. And more importantly, unlocking redevelopment opportunities at a number of our larger core shopping centers, and that was before the most recent news about Sports Authority, where we have 5 locations generating $3.4 million in annual rent. All good news for the future, and providing more growth and value long before 2023, but dilutive to same-store growth and occupancy today.
Hopefully, you remember my remarks from last quarter's call that attempted to prepare investors for the impact that strategy would have on those metrics in the fourth quarter that we just reported and continuing through 2016. Well, I promised to spare you the 5-tool baseball player analogy on this call, I've heard plenty about that from you -- from most of you over the last 3 months, I do want to update you on the plan.
To recap, when we broke the company up between core and mixed-use earlier in the year, and brought in additional real estate talent to lead the core, which by the way caused a higher level of G&A. We did so, in order to ensure that the all-important core portfolio got the attention and aggressive asset management that it deserves. The objective is for the core to produce even more value and continue to act as the strongest possible foundation for the development and acquisition pipeline. In part, that means getting control of space that has long hindered value creation at certain shopping centers.
You'll remember that we spoke about the A&P bankruptcy which was the most obvious example, and we had 4: 1 A&P, 1 Pathmark, and 2 Waldbaums, all in New Jersey and Long Island. All 4 leases had significant value to multiple parties and certainly if we chose not to participate in that bankruptcy process, I'm very confident that all 4 leases would have been bought by someone, which would have resulted in 0 downtime and 0 lost rent in any of those spaces. And if our business plan were one-dimensional, we might have let that happen. But we didn't. Nearly a 185,000 square feet of space, that's nearly a full point of occupancy and over $3 million of annual same-store growth that went out the door with the bankruptcy. And by the way, we had to pay several millions of dollars to get the right to lose all that income. Our assessment is that, that several million dollar investment plus a year or more of downtime would pay back many times over, not only in terms of the 4 walls of those grocery stores, which is how a lot of people look at the lease's value, but by unlocking more redevelopment opportunities that improve the entire shopping centers. While same-store growth and occupancy were negatively impacted in the fourth quarter, and will be in 2016, the future value of these and other centers where we have employed a similar strategy will be far higher.
We are deep into exploring redevelopment plans on all of our newfound opportunities, and I'm excited about the possibilities. Jim will summarize the impacts in his remarks in a few minutes. 
Now I don't know if we could have made that decision if we didn't have a clear long-term plan and same-store growth and yearend occupancy were the only considerations. 
All right, let's back up and talk about leasing for a minute and there is plenty of it happening.
99 deals done in the quarter. 88 of them comparable for over 380,000 feet at an average rent of $31.88, 23% higher than the $26 per foot the prior tenant was paying. The leasing strength was broad with both anchor deals and small shop renewals registering double-digit growth. The tenant improvement dollars per square-foot associated with those leases requires explanation, because most of it comes from two redevelopment projects: The Saks OFF 5TH deal at our headquarter site at Congressional Plaza, and the Dicks Field & Stream deal at Melville Mall on Long Island. Capital for those deals are both included and considered in the overall return thresholds of the project, so -- but careful not to double count that capital as both leasing capital and redevelopment capital. It's one and the same. Anyway you look at it, these are strong leasing results.
In addition to the 88 comparable deals, we also executed 11 non-comparable deals, largely on the new developments, representing an additional 58,000 square feet of space. So 440,000 [ph] square feet of deals in a three-month period. There is plenty of productive leasing being done these days in virtually all markets we do business in. And, we're betting that that will continue in 2016 for our product type and our locations. And it's why we're consciously trying to get back underperforming anchor space. We want to use these favorable economic conditions to re-lease them. We see a good sampling of mediocre retailers that have been holding on for years, who have either given up: A&P, Hudson Trail, City Sports, or who will soon. We are fine with that. And as I said, are anxious to get it to either re-lease or redevelop.
So I haven't touched on acquisitions or development yet, so let me get to the highlights. Man, do we have a lot going on: from continued advancement of the construction and leasing at both Pike & Rose and Assembly; to the continued opening of more and more tenants at the very successful Point development in  El Segundo, California; to continued disciplined construction of fully leased 500 Santana Row, set to house data mining technology powerhouse Splunk by the end of this year; to the closing on October 1 of Sunset Place in South Miami, where we are aggressively working to plan -- to develop a plan to better exploit its A1 location; to the unwind of our 11-year joint venture with Clarion through the acquisition of their 70% interest in 6 shopping centers in Suburban Boston, New York, and D.C., which by the way creates more fresh powder for redevelopment.
So we've got more going on to keep our 5 growth buckets fully productive than I can remember in my 18 years here. Let me give you a few more updates on those big projects and then I will turn it over to Jim. At Pike & Rose, residential lease-up continues to progress quite well with over 40% of the building leased at Pallas, as of today, at rents that are in line or even a bit better than our underwriting. The remainder of that residential leasing will require the rest of 2016 to reach stabilization, which again is consistent with our expectations. Secondly, we are well underway on the next phase. The Phase II garage is done and open, and we've just broken ground on the 2 largest buildings in Phase II this month. It will take 2 years to get it all open with a 700-foot plus long Main Street and a sense of place long missing from Rockville Pike.
In Somerville, Massachusetts, Assembly Row continues to get better and better, with one of our biggest concerns during the second phase construction being adequate parking, since surface lots are now under construction. That's a high-class problem for the initial phase of a mixed-use project, but it's because this is already a very successful new neighborhood in the Greater Boston area it's about to get a whole lot better as partners employees begin occupying the new building by midyear '16. Very exciting progress there, which has clearly spilled over to the adjacent power center, where we hope to be making some important merchandising and economic upgrades in the next few quarters.
In San Jose, 500 Santana Row construction is progressing a bit better than we expected, in terms of both cost and, potentially, schedule, which if it holds will result in a 9% cash-on-cost yield upon stabilization. That would make Santana -- 500 Santana Row the third project in a row with Santana, residential projects Levare and Misora being the first 2, where the initial revenues exceeded our underwriting. That's not a fluke. It speaks to the big picture point about mixed-use projects done well. While the initial phases that need to create the environment are complicated and often a little less smooth than we would like, the long-term value creation through maturation and incremental development of these ambitious projects is extremely rewarding and incredibly enduring.
Similarly, at The Point in El Segundo, the successful initial tenant openings at the end last summer have continued and grown as more and more tenants have opened. A final couple of spaces are expected to be leased and opened in 2016. Again, on-time, on budget. I don't have a significant update for you today on our property acquisitions in South Florida, which are performing as planned, as we underwrote them. Our most senior team, including Don Briggs, Chris Weilminster and Dawn Becker, along with our partner, Grass River and Michael Comras, are fully immersed in redevelopment mode exploring the art of the possible with city officials, retailers and others. And that applies to both CocoWalk and Sunset. Stay tuned there.
And finally, last month we concluded a very successful 11-year shopping center joint venture with Clarion Lion Fund by acquiring their 70% interest in Atlantic Plaza and Campus Plaza in Suburban Boston, Greenlawn Plaza on Long Island, and Free State Shopping Center, Plaza del Mercado and Barcroft Plaza in suburban Washington, D.C. at what we felt was a very fair and favorable purchase price of $154 million. All of these assets are located in markets we know well, and have seen strong growth from. And we've got a number of redevelopment and releasing opportunities at these properties that our core team -- new core team is focused on. More raw material for future growth.
Okay. That's enough for me now. 2015 was a very gratifying year for us, full of not only measurable accomplishments, but as or more importantly, the solidification of a plan and structure focused on accelerated value creation throughout the second half of this decade and beyond. Thank you all for your interest and support. And I'll now turn it over to Jim, and look forward to your questions afterwards."

For th",1165,"Thank you, Don and Leah, and good morning, everyone. As Don highlighted, our team delivered yet another record for the trots [ph] in terms of FFO per share, which at $1.37 represented 7% growth over the prior year quarter or 7.7% for the full year. For the many of you who parked at the top or just above our guidance, that $1.37 was just below the top end of our previously provided range.
In a quarter where we continued to invest in the future by intentionally taking down additional box vacancy, adding to our team, selling non-core assets and incurring transactional costs for favorable acquisition, we are particularly pleased that the bottom line results driven by our operations, leasing, acquisition and development teams. 
Turning to the numbers. Overall, property operating income grew at 5.9% over the prior year. Even with the decline in occupancy, reflecting higher anchor rollover, our core portfolio continued to be a significant driver of POI growth. That core grew at 2.6% or approximately 3.8% for the full year on a same-store basis including redevelopment.
As in prior quarters, allow me to again emphasize that our same-store pool represents approximately 94% of our total POI. In other words, it represents substantially all of our portfolio, and then truly reflects underlying core performance. This quarter, the downtime associated with the anchor rollover we discussed as well as other onetime items, produced about 150 basis points of drag. We highlighted this trend last quarter and as I will discuss further in guidance, we expect this rollover drag to begin to ameliorate in the latter part of this year, resulting in 2015 same-store NOI growth including redevelopment of approximately 3% to 3.5%. 
Allow me to pause for a moment. I can think of very few portfolios that show growth even while taking down occupancy. That speaks to the bumps embedded in our leases, several quarters of double-digit rent rollover growth and the successful delivery of our redevelopment.
Our first phases of Assembly and Pike & Rose contributed approximately $3 million of POI in the quarter, down slightly on a sequential basis as the Pallas high-rise opening and the office space deliveries triggered full operating expenses. The office lease-up is complete and tenants will continue to take occupancy through this year and early next. In addition, as Don mentioned, the lease-up at Pallas is going well, and we expect to hit a stabilized occupancy in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Finally, our acquisitions of CocoWalk and Sunset Place, which are performing well against our acquisition underwriting, also contributed significantly to our overall POI growth.
G&A remained stable at $8.1 million and interest expense declined $1 million, reflecting the lower average rate achieved through our refinancings during the year of 4.1%, offset by lower capitalized interest during the quarter as we continue to place development into service. Again, bottom line, FFO grew 7% for the quarter or 7.7% for the year.
That absolute bottom line performance while we continue to invest in the future, is something this team takes great pride in. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with $53 million drawn under our $600 million revolver, net debt to EBITDA of 5.3x, a weighted average debt tenor of 10 years, which together provides maximum flexibility and liquidity to fund all of our growth and NAV creation underway.
Turning to guidance for 2016, we affirm the previously provided range of $5.65 to $5.71 a share. A range of growth of approximately 6% to 7% or slightly below our long-term plan. As we discussed last quarter, this is a true range that will be impacted by several variables during the year.
As Don covered in his remarks, targeted box recapture and rollover vacancy drives a significant amount of drag in the year. The targeted anchor rollover which represents approximately $6 million of downtime in the year, approximately $8 million of annualized rent is driven by 10 of our properties. The notable spaces include the A&P leases at Troy, Melville, and Brick, the former Hudson Trail space at Montrose Crossing and the former Valley space at Graham Park.
In total, the targeted anchor rollover represents approximately 465,000 square feet at some of our very best assets, where the investment in downtime this year should pay significant dividends in the future. And as Don discussed in his remarks, we are very excited about the opportunity to unlock value at these centers through redevelopment, repositioning and re-leasing. Overall, we expect to significantly exceed the prior in-place rent of approximately $13.50 a foot on these larger spaces. In short, we believe we will drive -- or deliver better retailers at better rents and significantly improve these assets.
In addition to this investment in future growth, there are several other investments in growth to consider from a timing perspective as you look at the year. I mentioned Pallas and again, we expect a stabilization of that approximately $100 million investment to occur in the fourth quarter, from an occupancy perspective. The office space at Pike & Rose and Assembly, which represents approximately $80 million of investment, is now fully committed and will continue to see rent commencing throughout the year and early next as tenants take occupancy. 
500 Santana Row, our 234,000 square foot office building that represents approximately $115 million of investment, is 100% pre-leased and will deliver late in the fourth quarter and rent commence in 2017. The Point redevelopment at Plaza, El Segundo continues to perform exceptionally well, and is expected to stabilize in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Our acquisition of our joint venture partner's 70% interest in the 6 core assets that Don discussed, is expected to be neutral to FFO this year after transaction costs and factoring in the sale of Courtyard Shops, which we completed in the fourth quarter. We do expect this acquisition to contribute approximately $0.02 to $0.03 in 2017. 
And finally, we are well underway on the second phases of Pike & Rose and Assembly that represent another $600 million of investment, and expect those phases to begin delivering in the latter part of '17 and 2018. From a capital standpoint, we expect to fund approximately $350 million of development and redevelopment with a mix of funds from operations, long-term debt and equity under our ATM. Finally, consistent with our practice, our guidance does not factor in any further acquisitions or dispositions that we may execute during the year.
Before turning the call over to questions, I'd like to introduce,  Leah Andress, our new Investor Relations associate. Leah was formerly with Phillips Realty in D.C.,  and prior to that was an analyst with FBR Capital Markets. Unfortunately, she was also a Tar Heel. We look forward to having all of you meet Leah very soon. We also look forward to seeing many of you at the Wells and Citi Conference in the next few weeks.

But the preponderance of what we're focused on and executing on, and what you see in the 8-K as we not only detail the projects that are underway, but then begin providing for you on that second page what the future pipeline is, is in real estate that we own."

It truly is about looking at it with a more broad real estate point of view to be able to take advantage of the skill set that we've grown and developed over the past decade or so in mixed-use and redevelopment, and apply them to the lens by which we look at those acquisitions. I mean, there aren't a lot of companies that are going to go take a shot on Sunset Place. But when we look at it, we may succeed or we may fail. We'll see. But we handicap it in such a way, we're looking at it such a way that provides opportunity that is consistent with the skill set that we learned all the way up from Bethesda Row till today. So that's the balance Jim is talking about."

These are shopping centers that we haven't talked much about. We've got 90 shopping centers. And the idea of unencumbering, through restrictive anchor leases, things like Willow Lawn, Brick, Troy, Montrose, Crossroads in Chicago shows you that we -- as we say, we have that appetite. I can tell you at Crossroads in Chicago for example, there's a Party City. The Party City -- if this were 2008, we would have done everything we can to keep them there. We would have lowered the rent, we would've done whatever was needed to do to keep the occupancy and to keep the income coming in the door. In 2016, we view that differently. We are certainly willing to play hardball on the lease terms effectively. You got to go, you got to go. Because we are much more confident with respect to where it is that we can re-lease and what is it that we can do in terms of unencumbering the shopping center. Is there a point that, that changes, of course, to the extent the economy turns around and goes the other way, we are going to feel a whole lot different about that just like we did back then. But it's not going be an overnight type of decision. You will have plenty of time and quarters for us to talk through what it is that we're doing with respect to these centers and what it is that we're -- the mantra with respect to future centers."

And that very much aligns with what we at Federal Realty have. And this is what we see. We have best of class assets, which we see located in markets that really align with the retailers' desired core customer portfolio, which is incredibly important to them. They know that Federal Realty's commitment to deliver best in class property level operation, execution, and maintenance and are focus on delivering really the best tenant mix available aligns with their ability to be successful. That puts us in the best opportunity to take advantage of the growth that retailers are pursuing. And there clearly is growth demand from the retailers. They are just -- their outlook is just a lot more -- they are a lot more focused on finding sites that do algin with the core customer. The deals that they are doing are taking much longer. The lease negotiations are certainly more difficult. And they are a lot more selective. So we definitely see opportunity with regard to growth in retailers, and we think that they are looking in the markets where we have our real estate. So I think, from our perspective, we are set up to take advantage of what demand exist out there, both on the box side as well as on the small shop segment. And as Don pointed out, I mean, its very important for us as we unlever some of the restrictions in these opportunities, to take advantage of putting a new relevant box retailers that also, that rising tide will allow us to really take advantage of the demand from the small shop tenants. And collectively that will make our assets much better."

And to the extent this was turning into 2008, you'd have a whole different perspective here in terms of what we think and what we're doing and the approach. There is not one sign that we see with our discussions with our retailers, at our properties, in our locations of anything like that. Worse, it's a take a deep -- it's more of a deep breath. And as Chris says, it's more deliberate. It's a tougher negotiation, all that. That's fine. The reality is, if you were to see or to know -- if I took you for a ride over to Graham Park Plaza, which is inside the beltway in Fairfax, we have not been able to do anything with that property for a long time because of the leases in place. This is a particular point in time where we have a shot. If we simply released it to -- or kept the same anchor in and extended those existing leases, we would be losing the shot to create significant value for a decade or more. So when you overall take a look at it, I mean this is with the decision, with everything we've done, we are still 93% occupied. This is hardly, ""oh my god empty out the whole place"" right. But it does take a very measured and careful approach toward 10 shopping centers in particular, that we've been trying forever to figure out a way, because demand is there, to create value, but they've been encumbered by, whether it's an A&P lease or an old Valley lease or whatever it is at a particular shopping center that was causing it, to get it back. That seems like a smart approach to me. It's not all the way over on one side or all the way over on the other. Again, it's balanced."

You're nervous with respect to what the -- what those tenants' business plans are going to be? How they're going to work in the new world? Did the cuts that they made in their staffing, gut their organizations with respect to being able to do all that? And what has happened, and it's predictable, if you kind of take a look at it, is if you could be in every boardroom of all those major retailers and smaller retailers along the way, you would, some of them, with respect to what they changed and where they are moving, into a new economy, became extremely good at it and got stronger. A lot of them kind of found mediocrity. And success in certain areas, not in other areas, but with an improving economy, they held on, they held on, they held on. There's only so long you can hold on, if your business plan is not effectively resonating. And I do think that what we saw, and we felt it in '15, not long before what we're talking about for '16, was that those tenants that simply did not have business plans that resonated with consumers going forward were not going to be able to hold on indefinitely. We started to see that in the second half of '15, we decided then to specifically aggressively target them. We don't turn that on and off and there's a continuation of that into '16. But the better tenants, there are better tenants, and those better tenants are doing very well. There's more of a bifurcation, is what I am saying, between good and not so good, today, than there was 3 or 4 years ago. That's the distinction. And that's why, I guess, I'm talking my own book here, but it's what I believe. That's why the bifurcation between desirable real estate and not desirable real estate is wider than it certainly was 3 or 4 years ago. Those things work in tandem. And that's why we're probably a bit more optimistic, with respect to our leasing and this strategy in '16 and '17, than some others are."

I think for Saks, be it Saks OFF 5TH brand, I think they're rolling out or talking about some brands as it relates to Lord & Taylor. I think that clearly is a box component that is looking for opportunity. We see the grocery category looking to get more nimble, and do more urban oriented stores, so smaller. I think there's a new concept out by Ahold called bfresh, which is taking some of what they've learned over in the European market about providing more deliverables on home meal replacement and a more convenient environment. That clearly provides opportunity. And then the QSR business, as we've been talking about for a long time on the smaller shop side, really continues to just amaze at how they're kind of gutting out the mid-tier casual dining category, and providing as quite -- as high a quality product, more curated by the consumer in a faster environment.

Clearly, a strategic decision. The one thing that we got comfortable with over the years a little bit, is what it is, where were the places in this country that were logical extensions for us, that we felt very, very good about the positive changes on a macro level over the next decade or two. The more we looked at, not Florida, but Miami in particular, within Florida, the more we felt that all the investment that's happening downtown, all the investment that's happening in that market place, was not -- was what it is, but it wasn't the same as what was happening where the full-time population lived. The more we looked into those areas, which included Coral Gables and included Coconut Grove, the more we got really excited about the possibilities of those being underserved places that were on a real upswing. Frankly, 6 months later or 12 months later from when we did it, and 2 years later from when we started thinking about it, we're actually more optimistic in terms of what's happening. If you look -- go look hard at the press and some of the deals that have been done in and around Coconut Grove over the past, 12 to 15 months, and I think you'll say, ""Oh man, maybe these guys are on to something.""

Thank you all for joining us today. I look forward to seeing all or most of you in a few weeks at the NAREIT conference in New York where we can talk more about our company and the many changes affecting our industry. 
As most of you are aware by now, this will be the last earnings call of my good friend and colleague, Jim Taylor, will be on as the CFO of Federal. His team is certainly going to miss him, but I, for one, am -- genuinely proud of him and the opportunities he's going to get . Their board made a great choice bit. I'm also personally grateful for his many contributions to the company, his wise counsel and most importantly, his friendship, however, fleeting that might have been. 
Well, enough about Jim for the moment. Onward to the quarterly results and to our prospects for the future.
Really good quarter all the way around for us: FFO per share of $1.38, highest quarterly result of all time and 9.5% better than last year's quarter. 
Same-center growth of 4.2%, again, validating how important our redevelopment program is to us, but we don't expect to maintain this level for the year given the significant investment for the future initiatives we have underway and lease termination fees that helped us this quarter by $600,000 or so. More on all that later. 
85 comparable deals done for nearly 400,000 feet of space at 33 53 per foot, 13% higher on a cash basis than the deals they replaced. That's up 23% on anchors, 10% on small shops. It's up 21% on new leases, 9% on renewals. It's up on all of those metrics in the core shopping center business, in the mixed-use division and on the West Coast. Strong consistent leasing progress throughout our operations is our trademark, and we don't expect that to falter.
Overall portfolio occupancy at 94.1% leased but only 92.7% occupied, those numbers are down by 130 and 180 basis points, respectively, from a year ago, much of that through the inclusion of our lower occupancy acquisitions in South Florida and from the Clarion acquisition. Together, that's 1.5 million square feet added with a combined occupancy in the mid-80s. And of course, it's also the planned A&P and other vacancies we talked about last quarter. 
Yet we still had a record quarter. Growing earnings with decreasing occupancy, whether planned or unplanned, speaks volumes of our business plan and our company. Speaking of that occupancy, we made strong progress as it relates to proactively taking advantage of sale tenants to improve the anchor merchandising assortment of our important shopping centers. That initiative took a big step forward this quarter with the signing of T.J. Maxx to take over the space on Pentagon Row; with the signing of Dick's Sporting Goods at Melville Mall which, along with last quarter's Field & Stream deal and some real good stuff to come I'm not ready to talk about yet, go a long way to returning Melville Mall on Long Island into something pretty special; and L.A. Fitness taking out a host of obsolete small shop space at Delmar Village in Boca Raton.  3 great deals all at far higher rents than they replaced, actually nearly 30% higher in total with far better retailers for our future is just the initial part of the redevelopment of these extremely well located shopping centers. Remember though, those are just signed leases, and the rent contributions won't start from them for some time as each particular center is being developed. All the evidence so far suggests that this proactive approach to creating vacancy is going to work out overall as we hoped in creating more relevant shopping centers, even though it will put pressure on same-store growth for the balance of '16 and '17.
I also want to report strong progress on the lease up and rent start of the Phase 1 completions of our 3 big and active development projects. Let's talk about them individually.
At Assembly Row, the first phase is basically finished now, with the last group of office tenants moving into our small office building and the retailers and restaurants solidifying their own success. We've really moved on to Phase 2 execution, the first sign of which begins next month as the first partners health care employees begin populating nearly complete 700,000-square-foot building. Assembly has been so thoroughly accepted by the community as the place to live, work and shop, and we expect long-term value creation here to exceed our expectations. 
At Pike & Rose, we've leased up a ton of apartments since the end of the year and now stand as a Phase 1 residential percentage leased at 73% heading into a strong summer leasing season. I couldn't be more pleased at the rate of lease that we are achieving. Pike & Rose is creating a lot of business and getting a lot of recognition in the community, and I'm optimistic that we'll have the building basically full by year-end or soon thereafter as we forecast. 
I'm not as optimistic that we'll hit our rent dollar forecast, given the rental rates we've been assuming for the higher floors in the Pallas building. So far we've enclosed our forecasted rents at $2.40, which are at a premium to the market. But because of construction, we basically have been leasing from the bottom up. So we're skeptical at this point that we'll be able to push rents on the higher floors to the extent we had hoped, given the significant supply in the market and the fact that we remain a major construction site. We'll see over the next 6 to 8 months, but our initial yield may be under pressure by 50 basis points or so. More on that with another quarter of leasing under our belt.
One thing that we're particularly confident about is the very real premium to market and we've been getting even during this initial lease up phase. Pallas average monthly rents to date of $2,500 a month or $2.40 a foot reflect a 20% premium over the north Rockville submarket. And 4 [ph] penthouses we've delivered over $6,000 a month are setting new high-water marks for this market. As I said earlier, the pace of leasing is outpacing at competitive product, too. 
While excess supply in the market caused us to miss our initial rent projections, and that is no doubt disappointing, it's also causing us to protect more conservatively in Phase 2 as you'll not in our K. The premium to the market, clearly obtainable because of the environment we are creating at Pike & Rose and the level of service we are providing, is both validating and encouraging. We are building the right products for the future. Pike & Rose is going to be around for a long time and gets more and more integral for community shopping, living and working habits every day. We'll have many opportunities to increase the residential income stream in the years ahead on these mostly 12-month leases.
And at the point in El Segundo California, we're done in the last few leases and last half-dozen rent starts in a shopping center that has so clearly hit the bull's eye of what was missing in the market. This property will do nothing but get better and better over the years. 
And at 500 Santana Row, actually known here as the [indiscernible] building, we've talked of the $112 million project and remain on time and on budget.
So as I look back at the quarter and execution in the business plan that we're also passionate about around here, I couldn't be more encouraged that we're on the right track to double our income in the next decade, but also realistic about the investment, people and real estate necessary to do it right and protect our downside in cyclical business. 
The latest curveball lies in the uncertain future of Sports Authority. As you know, we have 5 locations, and none of them are in the closure list in the first round. We reserved most of our prepetition [ph] bankruptcy receivables of $400,000 in the first quarter and have been fully paid for April's rent. Now the latest conjecture of liquidation is a different story, of course. And depending on how it plays out and the specifics of each location, a short-term hit is likely and might affect our existing guidance if leases were immediately rejected as opposed to be assumed by retail. Having said that, we're quite confident that we would more than replace the cumulative rent, which totals $3.4 million annually triple-net basis, about $17.65 a foot and $4.8 million gross. The average market rent for a triple-net box lease in these location exceeds $25. We're already in conversations with replacement tenants just in case.
The other thing evolving changes, of course, is the changing shopping, living, working entertainment habits of today's consumer. As we're all well aware, we have been, are and will continue to invest heavily in the best people, real estate and type of product that we believe puts us in the best position to capitalize on those changes. The downside is that in doing so, making investments that have and will continue to dilute current earnings. 
And a couple of things on that front. First, the decentralization effort that our company is in the middle of is progressing quite well. [indiscernible] settling into his role and is in the process of building 4 quasi-independent geographic teams to grow our core shopping center business. Investment in incremental talent and IT systems infrastructure is now underway, and we would expect an incremental $1.5 million to $2 million annual investment to support this effort. 
Secondly, plans for new Miami acquisitions, Sunset Place and CocoWalk, are progressing well and are being vetted by our senior team and partners. Decisions as to the direction of initial phases should go to investment committee later this year, at which point we'll lay out what we have in mind. In the meantime, we're heavily focused on grassroots engagement with the local communities and are increasingly optimistic that we'll be able to put forth viable and value creative changes in both location. At Sunset, we'll need zoning changes to permit more height to come up with a viable plan. Fingers crossed.
And finally, the search for a Senior business partner that carries a CFO title for Federal is in full swing. I'm grateful for the very robust interest in joining our team that has followed Jim's announcement, and I've met with a number of terrific prospects who will be awesome partners to me and our senior team. I just don't want to rush that important decision, and I'm giving the process the attention and serious consideration it deserves. I'd hoped to be prepared to make an announcement in this regard in the next 30 to 45 days. 
In the meantime, Melissa Solis is our Principal Accounting Officer. And as those of you who know Melissa know, we remain in very good hands from an accounting and overall financial point of view.
Separately, I know that many on this call are friends and colleagues of James Miles, portfolio analyst at APG. We hadn't put out a separate press release, but James will be joining us next month in the role of Vice President, Director of Finance for the mixed-use division and will be relocating our headquarters in Rockville, Maryland. We're thrilled to have him.
Now let me turn it over to Jim before answering your questions."

As Don highlighted, our team delivered yet another record for the trust in terms of FFO per share, which was $1.38 representing 9.5% growth over the prior year quarter. In a quarter where we continue to",1295,"Thank you, Don and Leah, and good morning, everyone. As Don highlighted, our team delivered yet another record for the trust in terms of FFO per share, which was $1.38 representing 9.5% growth over the prior year quarter. In a quarter where we continue to invest in the future through commencing future development phases, adding to our team, taking down box vacancy, et cetera, we are particularly pleased with the bottom line results driven by our operations leasing, acquisition and development team.
Turning to the numbers. Overall property operating income grew at 7.9% over the prior year even with the decline of 130 basis points of occupancy reflecting the higher anchor rollovers we've discussed, our core portfolio continued to be a significant driver of our COI growth. That core grew 4.2% on a same-store basis including redevelopment. This quarter, the downtime associated with anchor rollover produced about 130 basis points drag. We highlighted this trend the last 2 quarters. And as I will discuss further in guidance we expect this rollover drag to continue this year. 
Our first phases of Assembly Row and Pike & Rose contributed approximately $4.5 million of COI in the quarter, up on a sequential basis, as the Pallas high-rise opening approached breakeven occupancy and office spaces continue to rent commence. Finally, our acquisitions of Coco and Sunset Place, which are performing very well against our acquisition underwriting also contributed significantly to overall COI growth. 
G&A remains flat on a sequential basis at $8 million for the quarter and down year-over-year principally to higher transaction costs in 2015 with respect to our San Antonio Center acquisition. We do expect our G&A line item to grow as we continue to invest in our platform.
Interest expense declined $400,000, reflecting lower average rate achieved through our refinancings during the year, offset by lower capitalized interest during the quarter as we continue to place development in service. 
Again, bottom line, FFO grew at 9.5% for the quarter, which is above our long-term plan. an absolute bottom line performance while we continue to invest in the future, it's something we take great pride in. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we raised approximately $182 million of equity through an overnight [ph] as well as issuances under our ATM during the quarter at a weighted average price of $149.18. This represents over half of the equity we planned to raise this year. 
We ended the quarter with $53 million drawn under our $600 million revolver, which we upsized after the quarter to $800 million and extended into 2020 while reducing our borrowing costs by 10 basis points. Our net debt to EBITDA was 5.3x, and our weighted average tenor was almost 10 years versus the pure average closer to 5, providing us maximum flexibility and liquidity to fund all of the value creation that we have underway.
Turning to 2016, we affirm the previously given range of FFO per share of $5.65 to $5.71, a range of growth of approximately 6% to 7% or slightly below our long-term plan. As we discussed last quarter, this is a true range that will be impacted by several variables during the year. Again, the targeted box recapture and rollover vacancy drives a significant amount of drag in the year. That drag was offset this quarter by some positive timing items, which included marketing expense recoveries as well as higher year-over-year term fees of $600,00, as Don mentioned. Given that, we do expect same-store NOI will moderate in the second and third quarters of this year.
As Don discussed in his remarks, we are pleased to announce the signing of TJ Maxx, Pentagon, Dick's Sporting Goods lease at Melville and the L.A. Fitness lease at Delmar, all of which, as Don stated, will unlock significant value at these centers. Overall, our leasing team is making great progress under captured box phases, which we will continue to report on over the coming quarters. 
In addition to this rollovers, as discussed in prior quarters, there are several other investments in growth to consider from a timing perspective as you look at the year. First, leasing pace at Pallas continues to do well with occupancy in the building alone at just over 60% and expected stabilization occurring in the fourth quarter. The office space of Pike & Rose and Assembly, which represents approximately $80 million of investments, is fully committed and leased. And we'll start seeing the rent commencing throughout this year and early next as tenants take occupancy. 500 Santana Row, the building which represents approximately $115 million of investment, is of course 100% preleased and will deliver in the first quarter and rent commence in 2017. The Point redevelopment continues to perform exceptionally well and is expected to stabilize in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Our acquisition of our joint venture partner's 70% interest in 6 core assets is expected to be neutral this year after transaction costs in the sale of courtyard shops. We expect this acquisition to contribute approximately $0.02 to $0.03 in 2017.
We are well underway to the second phases of Pike & Rose and Assembly that represent another $600 million of investment and expect those phases to begin delivering in the latter part of '17 and early '18. 
From a capital standpoint, again, we expect to fund approximately $300 million of development and redevelopment with a mix of funds from operations, long-term debt and equity and our ATM, much of which we have taken care of the first quarter.  Finally, consistent with our practice, our guidance does not factor in any further acquisitions or dispositions that we may execute during the year. 
When you consider all that the company has going on, you will understand why we continue to emphasize that our guidance this year is a true range. factors that may drive us towards low end of that range include the timing of the anchor boxes to rent commencement; the potential for additional rent concessions at Pallas as lease the penthouses in the upper floor; the opportunistic capital raise that we completed the first quarter, front-ended a significant capital needs for the year. The ultimate resolution of the Sports Authority, as Don discussed, while none of our location made the initial closure list, we believe it is unlikely that The Sports Authority will continue to have this and that we may have the opportunity to get some of those locations back.
We continue to invest in our platform, as Don mentioned, both in systems and people as we drive decision-making closer to the real estate. These efforts may drive an additional $1 million to $2 million of annual G&A above our current run rate of $34 million to 35 million in annual basis. Even with that growth, it's still far below 5% of revenues.
And finally, the costs associated with back filling position have not been determined or forecast. Again, each one of these items that influence where we will come out in the range is a positive for the company and its long-term growth prospects, but they may impact where we land.
Before turning the call over to questions, I'd like to briefly thank Don. His friendship, counsel and support have meant a great deal to me over the last 18 years and now as I turn to the opportunity at Brixmore. Thank you, Don. 
I would also like to thank my partners at Federal, who are the best in the business: Chris Weilminster; Dawn Becker; Jeff Berkes; Jeff Malone; [indiscernible] Colson; John Pease, Deirdre Barry; and last, but certainty most, [ph] Melissa.

As you know, that first phase and the second phase has a significant residential component to it. The bottom line is, we were too aggressive in thinking what we were going to be able to get for residential rents. And the marketplace has an awful lot of supply on it, and the place is absolutely a construction zone and will be for some time. And so it's what I always worry about it with changing numbers like this is that there's a taint on the project itself, because there can't be. The project is going as well or better than we expected in terms of its acceptance, even in terms of its performance, rent performance on the residential side, compared to the marketplace. It's just that the marketplace is significantly lower than we had hoped and thought it would be when we underwrote this is. So it's all that. obviously the good side of that is we're not locking into 15-year deals or 20-year deals. These are 12-month leases, but it would be -- it just wouldn't be right for me to have the same expectations of being able to lease up the rest of the buildings we have on Phase 1 and the residential buildings in Phase 2 at rents that when I look at it right now with our team looks at it right now, we don't think we can hit. And that's what's causing that. I really don't want to see that as a failure of the project. It's market timing."

The -- look, the bottom line is this company grew and has grown pretty darn consistently over the last 15 years in terms of its value, in terms of what it does for a living, in terms of its breadth and growth. The -- we had to effectively get management closer to the real estate because the real estate is so different. Managing a Pike and Rose and managing an Assembly Row and managing and having an opportunity like Sunset and Coco is just very different than the core shopping center business. So we needed to needed to align management more closely with the real estate business. That's our business. We are really not a portfolio manager. We look at it asset by asset. Now when you do that, there's obviously going to be incremental overhead to be able to set it up that way. And that overhead is incremental, not only on to use the hotel vernacular, front of the house stuff, but also back of the house systems and reporting, accounting all of that. We're in the middle of that transition, and that transition take some time. If you think about incremental few million a year, basically, we got to more than make up for that in incremental value. Well, where did that incremental value come from? It comes from every part of our business, first and foremost, by getting to things more quickly, by getting tenants to through the process of leasing to tenant coordination, to opening their doors to rent start. That's done a whole lot better if the leasing agent and the asset manager and the developer, tenant working together, there's a lot of that. Secondly, at that level, we'll know our markets better. We do know our markets better and closer so that -- and I'll give a couple of examples. We're talking about Brick Township now, Brick Plaza. Well, Brick is a bit shopping center in Brick New Jersey that we've owned for a long time. Part of the reason that we have been able to get to doing a better job at Brick Plaza's because of the A&P lease and we tell to that about that. But another part of the reason is because it's geographically further away. This helps us focus more on it. It helps us create business, and -- I could say that about at least 20 or 25 shopping centers. So this is truly an evolution of our business. It's an investment in the next decade where the combination of great products in terms of a mixed-use development that we're doing, with a more active and proactively managed core, together should make the few million dollars of incremental G&A nothing compared to the incremental value that we create. So that's what it is that we're trying to do."

Obviously if it comes to something like that, which would add the most value inside the to the community and figuring out if something like that is viable. That's what we're working on there. So that would be the last one of the 3 that you'll hear anything about, I would think.  And Santana, let's go to Santana. oh Yes, Valley Fair does what they're doing. And Jeff's on the phone. absolutely impact. they're talking about adding hundreds of thousands of square feet in a great node at a great place that will perform a very different function than what we do. And I wouldn't think -- we're confident that it wouldn't have a long-term impact on the property. But if they are leasing up that much space for that period of time, that has to, I would think, impact us. I just don't know by how much yet, nothing in any significant way whether they actually haven't started construction yet, when they will, where they will, what the timing is, I still don't know the answer to that there. But there could be an impact. I just can't quantify for you today, again, a short-term impact."

So here are the 5 centers, Assembly Square in the marketplace, right? So you know what's happening to that marketplace. First is because of what we're doing in the mixed-use project adjacent to it, it's been a very positive thing.

Brick Plaza is the next one, again, in the middle of a complete redo. The timing of that would be great in terms of the future of Brick Plaza. Crow Canyon, which is out on the West Coast and that's a smaller store out there, and then the latest when we did we did some years back. But nonetheless, it the last one, smaller in a center that we had -- we've just redone, which is a good thing in terms of the demand characteristics that you would have. Montrose Crossing is the fourth. That's the one directly across from Pike and Rose. That's over 35 acres where the section of the shopping center where they are would be dramatically impacted to the extent we can better merchandise that. And the last one is East Bay Bridge out in Emeryville, which is the rent's in place there are extremely low, and the upside would be terrific. And that's another place that we just put into new -- we've really remerchandised the shopping center price. As I sit back and look at TSA, this is a good tenant to work through this portfolio, and it's a better thing in all of the location that we have. Well, it's a lot of rent in the meantime.

Now take bigger premise and this, I think, is really important in terms of the judgment that we should there. I think you're right, the way this Silver Line is working through Tyson's, there are winners and there are losers. The type of projects that are being built there, there are winners and there are losers. We did not jump in say, oh God, we got to the first one to market. We sat back. We renewed leases. We have pickup so that we were able to get space if we needed to. But we've created. We are disciplined. that particular asset has [indiscernible] to our benefit, that's only because we really ran it like a true real estate company would and real estate play, and not like a drunken sailor with respect to development, for Pete's sake, in terms of what it should be.

Thank you all for joining us today. I look forward to seeing all or most of you in a few weeks at the NAREIT conference in New York where we can talk more about our company and the many changes affecting our industry. 
As most of you are aware by now, this will be the last earnings call of my good friend and colleague, Jim Taylor, will be on as the CFO of Federal. His team is certainly going to miss him, but I, for one, am -- genuinely proud of him and the opportunities he's going to get . Their board made a great choice bit. I'm also personally grateful for his many contributions to the company, his wise counsel and most importantly, his friendship, however, fleeting that might have been. 
Well, enough about Jim for the moment. Onward to the quarterly results and to our prospects for the future.
Really good quarter all the way around for us: FFO per share of $1.38, highest quarterly result of all time and 9.5% better than last year's quarter. 
Same-center growth of 4.2%, again, validating how important our redevelopment program is to us, but we don't expect to maintain this level for the year given the significant investment for the future initiatives we have underway and lease termination fees that helped us this quarter by $600,000 or so. More on all that later. 
85 comparable deals done for nearly 400,000 feet of space at 33 53 per foot, 13% higher on a cash basis than the deals they replaced. That's up 23% on anchors, 10% on small shops. It's up 21% on new leases, 9% on renewals. It's up on all of those metrics in the core shopping center business, in the mixed-use division and on the West Coast. Strong consistent leasing progress throughout our operations is our trademark, and we don't expect that to falter.
Overall portfolio occupancy at 94.1% leased but only 92.7% occupied, those numbers are down by 130 and 180 basis points, respectively, from a year ago, much of that through the inclusion of our lower occupancy acquisitions in South Florida and from the Clarion acquisition. Together, that's 1.5 million square feet added with a combined occupancy in the mid-80s. And of course, it's also the planned A&P and other vacancies we talked about last quarter. 
Yet we still had a record quarter. Growing earnings with decreasing occupancy, whether planned or unplanned, speaks volumes of our business plan and our company. Speaking of that occupancy, we made strong progress as it relates to proactively taking advantage of sale tenants to improve the anchor merchandising assortment of our important shopping centers. That initiative took a big step forward this quarter with the signing of T.J. Maxx to take over the space on Pentagon Row; with the signing of Dick's Sporting Goods at Melville Mall which, along with last quarter's Field & Stream deal and some real good stuff to come I'm not ready to talk about yet, go a long way to returning Melville Mall on Long Island into something pretty special; and L.A. Fitness taking out a host of obsolete small shop space at Delmar Village in Boca Raton.  3 great deals all at far higher rents than they replaced, actually nearly 30% higher in total with far better retailers for our future is just the initial part of the redevelopment of these extremely well located shopping centers. Remember though, those are just signed leases, and the rent contributions won't start from them for some time as each particular center is being developed. All the evidence so far suggests that this proactive approach to creating vacancy is going to work out overall as we hoped in creating more relevant shopping centers, even though it will put pressure on same-store growth for the balance of '16 and '17.
I also want to report strong progress on the lease up and rent start of the Phase 1 completions of our 3 big and active development projects. Let's talk about them individually.
At Assembly Row, the first phase is basically finished now, with the last group of office tenants moving into our small office building and the retailers and restaurants solidifying their own success. We've really moved on to Phase 2 execution, the first sign of which begins next month as the first partners health care employees begin populating nearly complete 700,000-square-foot building. Assembly has been so thoroughly accepted by the community as the place to live, work and shop, and we expect long-term value creation here to exceed our expectations. 
At Pike & Rose, we've leased up a ton of apartments since the end of the year and now stand as a Phase 1 residential percentage leased at 73% heading into a strong summer leasing season. I couldn't be more pleased at the rate of lease that we are achieving. Pike & Rose is creating a lot of business and getting a lot of recognition in the community, and I'm optimistic that we'll have the building basically full by year-end or soon thereafter as we forecast. 
I'm not as optimistic that we'll hit our rent dollar forecast, given the rental rates we've been assuming for the higher floors in the Pallas building. So far we've enclosed our forecasted rents at $2.40, which are at a premium to the market. But because of construction, we basically have been leasing from the bottom up. So we're skeptical at this point that we'll be able to push rents on the higher floors to the extent we had hoped, given the significant supply in the market and the fact that we remain a major construction site. We'll see over the next 6 to 8 months, but our initial yield may be under pressure by 50 basis points or so. More on that with another quarter of leasing under our belt.
One thing that we're particularly confident about is the very real premium to market and we've been getting even during this initial lease up phase. Pallas average monthly rents to date of $2,500 a month or $2.40 a foot reflect a 20% premium over the north Rockville submarket. And 4 [ph] penthouses we've delivered over $6,000 a month are setting new high-water marks for this market. As I said earlier, the pace of leasing is outpacing at competitive product, too. 
While excess supply in the market caused us to miss our initial rent projections, and that is no doubt disappointing, it's also causing us to protect more conservatively in Phase 2 as you'll not in our K. The premium to the market, clearly obtainable because of the environment we are creating at Pike & Rose and the level of service we are providing, is both validating and encouraging. We are building the right products for the future. Pike & Rose is going to be around for a long time and gets more and more integral for community shopping, living and working habits every day. We'll have many opportunities to increase the residential income stream in the years ahead on these mostly 12-month leases.
And at the point in El Segundo California, we're done in the last few leases and last half-dozen rent starts in a shopping center that has so clearly hit the bull's eye of what was missing in the market. This property will do nothing but get better and better over the years. 
And at 500 Santana Row, actually known here as the [indiscernible] building, we've talked of the $112 million project and remain on time and on budget.
So as I look back at the quarter and execution in the business plan that we're also passionate about around here, I couldn't be more encouraged that we're on the right track to double our income in the next decade, but also realistic about the investment, people and real estate necessary to do it right and protect our downside in cyclical business. 
The latest curveball lies in the uncertain future of Sports Authority. As you know, we have 5 locations, and none of them are in the closure list in the first round. We reserved most of our prepetition [ph] bankruptcy receivables of $400,000 in the first quarter and have been fully paid for April's rent. Now the latest conjecture of liquidation is a different story, of course. And depending on how it plays out and the specifics of each location, a short-term hit is likely and might affect our existing guidance if leases were immediately rejected as opposed to be assumed by retail. Having said that, we're quite confident that we would more than replace the cumulative rent, which totals $3.4 million annually triple-net basis, about $17.65 a foot and $4.8 million gross. The average market rent for a triple-net box lease in these location exceeds $25. We're already in conversations with replacement tenants just in case.
The other thing evolving changes, of course, is the changing shopping, living, working entertainment habits of today's consumer. As we're all well aware, we have been, are and will continue to invest heavily in the best people, real estate and type of product that we believe puts us in the best position to capitalize on those changes. The downside is that in doing so, making investments that have and will continue to dilute current earnings. 
And a couple of things on that front. First, the decentralization effort that our company is in the middle of is progressing quite well. [indiscernible] settling into his role and is in the process of building 4 quasi-independent geographic teams to grow our core shopping center business. Investment in incremental talent and IT systems infrastructure is now underway, and we would expect an incremental $1.5 million to $2 million annual investment to support this effort. 
Secondly, plans for new Miami acquisitions, Sunset Place and CocoWalk, are progressing well and are being vetted by our senior team and partners. Decisions as to the direction of initial phases should go to investment committee later this year, at which point we'll lay out what we have in mind. In the meantime, we're heavily focused on grassroots engagement with the local communities and are increasingly optimistic that we'll be able to put forth viable and value creative changes in both location. At Sunset, we'll need zoning changes to permit more height to come up with a viable plan. Fingers crossed.
And finally, the search for a Senior business partner that carries a CFO title for Federal is in full swing. I'm grateful for the very robust interest in joining our team that has followed Jim's announcement, and I've met with a number of terrific prospects who will be awesome partners to me and our senior team. I just don't want to rush that important decision, and I'm giving the process the attention and serious consideration it deserves. I'd hoped to be prepared to make an announcement in this regard in the next 30 to 45 days. 
In the meantime, Melissa Solis is our Principal Accounting Officer. And as those of you who know Melissa know, we remain in very good hands from an accounting and overall financial point of view.
Separately, I know that many on this call are friends and colleagues of James Miles, portfolio analyst at APG. We hadn't put out a separate press release, but James will be joining us next month in the role of Vice President, Director of Finance for the mixed-use division and will be relocating our headquarters in Rockville, Maryland. We're thrilled to have him.
Now let me turn it over to Jim before answering your questions."

As Don highlighted, our team delivered yet another record for the trust in terms of FFO per share, which was $1.38 representing 9.5% growth over the prior year quarter. In a quarter where we continue to",1295,"Thank you, Don and Leah, and good morning, everyone. As Don highlighted, our team delivered yet another record for the trust in terms of FFO per share, which was $1.38 representing 9.5% growth over the prior year quarter. In a quarter where we continue to invest in the future through commencing future development phases, adding to our team, taking down box vacancy, et cetera, we are particularly pleased with the bottom line results driven by our operations leasing, acquisition and development team.
Turning to the numbers. Overall property operating income grew at 7.9% over the prior year even with the decline of 130 basis points of occupancy reflecting the higher anchor rollovers we've discussed, our core portfolio continued to be a significant driver of our COI growth. That core grew 4.2% on a same-store basis including redevelopment. This quarter, the downtime associated with anchor rollover produced about 130 basis points drag. We highlighted this trend the last 2 quarters. And as I will discuss further in guidance we expect this rollover drag to continue this year. 
Our first phases of Assembly Row and Pike & Rose contributed approximately $4.5 million of COI in the quarter, up on a sequential basis, as the Pallas high-rise opening approached breakeven occupancy and office spaces continue to rent commence. Finally, our acquisitions of Coco and Sunset Place, which are performing very well against our acquisition underwriting also contributed significantly to overall COI growth. 
G&A remains flat on a sequential basis at $8 million for the quarter and down year-over-year principally to higher transaction costs in 2015 with respect to our San Antonio Center acquisition. We do expect our G&A line item to grow as we continue to invest in our platform.
Interest expense declined $400,000, reflecting lower average rate achieved through our refinancings during the year, offset by lower capitalized interest during the quarter as we continue to place development in service. 
Again, bottom line, FFO grew at 9.5% for the quarter, which is above our long-term plan. an absolute bottom line performance while we continue to invest in the future, it's something we take great pride in. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we raised approximately $182 million of equity through an overnight [ph] as well as issuances under our ATM during the quarter at a weighted average price of $149.18. This represents over half of the equity we planned to raise this year. 
We ended the quarter with $53 million drawn under our $600 million revolver, which we upsized after the quarter to $800 million and extended into 2020 while reducing our borrowing costs by 10 basis points. Our net debt to EBITDA was 5.3x, and our weighted average tenor was almost 10 years versus the pure average closer to 5, providing us maximum flexibility and liquidity to fund all of the value creation that we have underway.
Turning to 2016, we affirm the previously given range of FFO per share of $5.65 to $5.71, a range of growth of approximately 6% to 7% or slightly below our long-term plan. As we discussed last quarter, this is a true range that will be impacted by several variables during the year. Again, the targeted box recapture and rollover vacancy drives a significant amount of drag in the year. That drag was offset this quarter by some positive timing items, which included marketing expense recoveries as well as higher year-over-year term fees of $600,00, as Don mentioned. Given that, we do expect same-store NOI will moderate in the second and third quarters of this year.
As Don discussed in his remarks, we are pleased to announce the signing of TJ Maxx, Pentagon, Dick's Sporting Goods lease at Melville and the L.A. Fitness lease at Delmar, all of which, as Don stated, will unlock significant value at these centers. Overall, our leasing team is making great progress under captured box phases, which we will continue to report on over the coming quarters. 
In addition to this rollovers, as discussed in prior quarters, there are several other investments in growth to consider from a timing perspective as you look at the year. First, leasing pace at Pallas continues to do well with occupancy in the building alone at just over 60% and expected stabilization occurring in the fourth quarter. The office space of Pike & Rose and Assembly, which represents approximately $80 million of investments, is fully committed and leased. And we'll start seeing the rent commencing throughout this year and early next as tenants take occupancy. 500 Santana Row, the building which represents approximately $115 million of investment, is of course 100% preleased and will deliver in the first quarter and rent commence in 2017. The Point redevelopment continues to perform exceptionally well and is expected to stabilize in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Our acquisition of our joint venture partner's 70% interest in 6 core assets is expected to be neutral this year after transaction costs in the sale of courtyard shops. We expect this acquisition to contribute approximately $0.02 to $0.03 in 2017.
We are well underway to the second phases of Pike & Rose and Assembly that represent another $600 million of investment and expect those phases to begin delivering in the latter part of '17 and early '18. 
From a capital standpoint, again, we expect to fund approximately $300 million of development and redevelopment with a mix of funds from operations, long-term debt and equity and our ATM, much of which we have taken care of the first quarter.  Finally, consistent with our practice, our guidance does not factor in any further acquisitions or dispositions that we may execute during the year. 
When you consider all that the company has going on, you will understand why we continue to emphasize that our guidance this year is a true range. factors that may drive us towards low end of that range include the timing of the anchor boxes to rent commencement; the potential for additional rent concessions at Pallas as lease the penthouses in the upper floor; the opportunistic capital raise that we completed the first quarter, front-ended a significant capital needs for the year. The ultimate resolution of the Sports Authority, as Don discussed, while none of our location made the initial closure list, we believe it is unlikely that The Sports Authority will continue to have this and that we may have the opportunity to get some of those locations back.
We continue to invest in our platform, as Don mentioned, both in systems and people as we drive decision-making closer to the real estate. These efforts may drive an additional $1 million to $2 million of annual G&A above our current run rate of $34 million to 35 million in annual basis. Even with that growth, it's still far below 5% of revenues.
And finally, the costs associated with back filling position have not been determined or forecast. Again, each one of these items that influence where we will come out in the range is a positive for the company and its long-term growth prospects, but they may impact where we land.
Before turning the call over to questions, I'd like to briefly thank Don. His friendship, counsel and support have meant a great deal to me over the last 18 years and now as I turn to the opportunity at Brixmore. Thank you, Don. 
I would also like to thank my partners at Federal, who are the best in the business: Chris Weilminster; Dawn Becker; Jeff Berkes; Jeff Malone; [indiscernible] Colson; John Pease, Deirdre Barry; and last, but certainty most, [ph] Melissa.

As you know, that first phase and the second phase has a significant residential component to it. The bottom line is, we were too aggressive in thinking what we were going to be able to get for residential rents. And the marketplace has an awful lot of supply on it, and the place is absolutely a construction zone and will be for some time. And so it's what I always worry about it with changing numbers like this is that there's a taint on the project itself, because there can't be. The project is going as well or better than we expected in terms of its acceptance, even in terms of its performance, rent performance on the residential side, compared to the marketplace. It's just that the marketplace is significantly lower than we had hoped and thought it would be when we underwrote this is. So it's all that. obviously the good side of that is we're not locking into 15-year deals or 20-year deals. These are 12-month leases, but it would be -- it just wouldn't be right for me to have the same expectations of being able to lease up the rest of the buildings we have on Phase 1 and the residential buildings in Phase 2 at rents that when I look at it right now with our team looks at it right now, we don't think we can hit. And that's what's causing that. I really don't want to see that as a failure of the project. It's market timing."

The -- look, the bottom line is this company grew and has grown pretty darn consistently over the last 15 years in terms of its value, in terms of what it does for a living, in terms of its breadth and growth. The -- we had to effectively get management closer to the real estate because the real estate is so different. Managing a Pike and Rose and managing an Assembly Row and managing and having an opportunity like Sunset and Coco is just very different than the core shopping center business. So we needed to needed to align management more closely with the real estate business. That's our business. We are really not a portfolio manager. We look at it asset by asset. Now when you do that, there's obviously going to be incremental overhead to be able to set it up that way. And that overhead is incremental, not only on to use the hotel vernacular, front of the house stuff, but also back of the house systems and reporting, accounting all of that. We're in the middle of that transition, and that transition take some time. If you think about incremental few million a year, basically, we got to more than make up for that in incremental value. Well, where did that incremental value come from? It comes from every part of our business, first and foremost, by getting to things more quickly, by getting tenants to through the process of leasing to tenant coordination, to opening their doors to rent start. That's done a whole lot better if the leasing agent and the asset manager and the developer, tenant working together, there's a lot of that. Secondly, at that level, we'll know our markets better. We do know our markets better and closer so that -- and I'll give a couple of examples. We're talking about Brick Township now, Brick Plaza. Well, Brick is a bit shopping center in Brick New Jersey that we've owned for a long time. Part of the reason that we have been able to get to doing a better job at Brick Plaza's because of the A&P lease and we tell to that about that. But another part of the reason is because it's geographically further away. This helps us focus more on it. It helps us create business, and -- I could say that about at least 20 or 25 shopping centers. So this is truly an evolution of our business. It's an investment in the next decade where the combination of great products in terms of a mixed-use development that we're doing, with a more active and proactively managed core, together should make the few million dollars of incremental G&A nothing compared to the incremental value that we create. So that's what it is that we're trying to do."

One of those was assumed and is underway in terms of being billed out on Long Island at Fremont, which leaves 3 more. Melville Mall also on the island and I did not mention -- when I talked about the good stuff that's happening at Melville Mall with the signing of Dicks, for example, the last we have Melville Mall is this announced box. And we're making real good progress, but we are not a place where I can tell you it's a signed deal yet. And you'll like everything about that. The next one is at Brick, and we are again in spite of a much beaver redevelopment and remerchandising of the entire is center. And we're not as close as Melville, but making real good progress over the next couple of quarters there, I think. the final one is Troy, which is in New Jersey. And we're hopeful -- I shouldn't say exactly this way yet. I don't know whether we're going to backfill it or whether it is going to be a bigger redevelopments possibility there, which would include some residential and a more densely populated shopping center. Obviously if it comes to something like that, which would add the most value inside the to the community and figuring out if something like that is viable. That's what we're working on there. So that would be the last one of the 3 that you'll hear anything about, I would think.  And Santana, let's go to Santana. oh Yes, Valley Fair does what they're doing. And Jeff's on the phone. absolutely impact. they're talking about adding hundreds of thousands of square feet in a great node at a great place that will perform a very different function than what we do. And I wouldn't think -- we're confident that it wouldn't have a long-term impact on the property. But if they are leasing up that much space for that period of time, that has to, I would think, impact us. I just don't know by how much yet, nothing in any significant way whether they actually haven't started construction yet, when they will, where they will, what the timing is, I still don't know the answer to that there. But there could be an impact. I just can't quantify for you today, again, a short-term impact."

Brick Plaza is the next one, again, in the middle of a complete redo. The timing of that would be great in terms of the future of Brick Plaza. Crow Canyon, which is out on the West Coast and that's a smaller store out there, and then the latest when we did we did some years back. But nonetheless, it the last one, smaller in a center that we had -- we've just redone, which is a good thing in terms of the demand characteristics that you would have. Montrose Crossing is the fourth. That's the one directly across from Pike and Rose. That's over 35 acres where the section of the shopping center where they are would be dramatically impacted to the extent we can better merchandise that. And the last one is East Bay Bridge out in Emeryville, which is the rent's in place there are extremely low, and the upside would be terrific. And that's another place that we just put into new -- we've really remerchandised the shopping center price.

Thank you all for joining us today, and I look forward to seeing all or most of you in a few weeks at the NAREIT Conference in New York where we can talk more about our company and the many changes affecting our industry. 
As most of you're aware by now, this will be the last earnings call of my good friend and colleague, Jim Taylor, will be on as the CFO of Federal. His team is certainly going to miss him, but I, for one, am generally -- genuinely proud of him and the opportunities he's going to get at Brixmor. Their board made a great choice. I'm also personally grateful for his many contributions to the company, his wise counsel and most importantly, his friendship; however, fleeting that [indiscernible]. 
Well, enough about Jim for the moment. Onward to the quarterly results and to our prospects for the future.
Really good quarter all the way around for us. FFO per share of $1.38, highest quarterly result of all time and 9.5% better than last year's quarter. 
Same-center growth of 4.2%, again, validating how important our redevelopment program is to us, but we don't expect to maintain this level for the year given the significant investment for the future initiatives that we have underway and lease termination fees that helped us this quarter by $600,000 or so. More on all that later. 
85 comparable deals done for nearly 400,000 feet of space at $33.53 per foot, 13% higher on a cash basis than the deals they replaced. That's up 23% on anchors, 10% on small shops. It's up 21% on new leases, 9% on renewals. It's up on all those metrics in the core shopping center business, in the mixed-use division and on the West Coast. Strong consistent leasing progress throughout our operations is our trademark, and we don't expect that to falter.
Overall portfolio occupancy at 94.1% leased, but only 92.7% occupied. Those numbers are down by 130 and 180 basis points, respectively, from a year ago, much of that through the inclusion of our lower occupancy acquisitions in South Florida and from the Clarion acquisition. Together, that's 1.5 million square feet added with a combined occupancy in the mid-80s. And of course, it's also the planned A&P and other vacancies that we talked about last quarter. 
Yet, we still had a record quarter. Growing earnings with decreasing occupancy, whether planned or unplanned, speaks volumes about our business plan and our company. Speaking of that occupancy, we made strong progress as it relates to proactively taking advantage of weak and failed tenants to improve the anchor merchandising assortment of our important shopping centers. That initiative took a big step forward this quarter, with the signing of T.J. Maxx to take over the failed Hudson Trail Outfitters space at Pentagon Row; with the signing of Dick's Sporting Goods at Melville Mall, which along with last quarter's Field & Stream deal and some real good stuff to come and not ready to talk about it yet, go a long way to returning Melville Mall on Long Island into something pretty special; and L.A. Fitness taking out a host of obsolete small shop space at Del Mar Village in Boca Raton. 3 great deals all at far higher rents than they replaced, actually nearly 30% higher in total, with far better retailers for our future and just the initial part of the redevelopment of these extremely well located shopping centers. Remember though, those are just signed leases, and the rent contributions won't start from them for some time as each particular center is being developed. All the evidence so far suggest that this proactive approach toward creating vacancy is going to work out overall as we'd hoped in creating far more relevant shopping centers, even though it will put pressure on same-store growth for the balance of '16 and '17.
I also want to report on strong progress on the lease up and rent start for the Phase 1 completions of our 3 big and active development projects. Let's talk about them individually.
At Assembly Row, the first phase is basically finished now, with the last group of office tenants moving into our small office building and the retailers and restaurants solidifying their only success. We've really moved on to Phase 2 execution, the first sign of which begins next month as the first Partners Healthcare employees begin populating the nearly complete 700,000 square foot building. Assembly has been so thoroughly accepted by the community as the place to live, work and shop. And we expect long-term value creation here to exceed our expectations. 
At Pike & Rose, we've leased up a ton of apartments since the end of the year and now stand at a Phase 1 residential percentage leased at 73%, heading into a strong summer leasing season. I couldn't be more pleased that the rate of lease up that we're achieving. Pike & Rose is creating a lot of buzz and getting a lot of recognition in the community, and I'm optimistic that we'll have the building basically full by year-end or soon thereafter as we forecasted. 
I'm not as optimistic that we'll hit our rent dollar forecast, given the rental rates we've been assuming for the higher floors in the Pallas Building. So far we've been close to our forecasted rents at $2.40, which are at a premium to the market. But because of construction, we basically have been leasing from the bottom up. But we're skeptical at this point that we'll be able to push rents on the higher floors to the extent we'd hoped, given the significant supply in the market and the fact that we remain a major construction site. We'll see over the next 6 to 8 months, but our initial yield may be under pressure by 50 basis points or so more on that with another quarter of leasing under our belt.
One thing that we're particularly confident about is the very real premium to market that we've been getting even during this initial phase -- lease up phase. Pallas average monthly rents to date of $2,500 a month or $2.40 a foot reflect a 20% premium over the North Bethesda, Rockville submarket. And for penthouses that we delivered at over $6,000 a month are setting new high watermarks for this market. As I said earlier, the pace of leasing is outpacing that competitive product, too. 
While excess supply in the market has caused us to miss our initial rent projections, and that is no doubt disappointing. It's also causing us to project more conservatively on Phase 2 as you'll know in our 8-K. The premium to that market clearly attainable because of the environment we're creating at Pike & Rose and the level of service we're providing is both validating and encouraging. We're building the right products for the future. Pike & Rose is going to be around for a long time and gets more and more integral for the community shopping, living and working habits every day. We'll have many opportunities to increase the residential income stream in the years ahead on these mostly 12-month leases.
And as a point in El Segundo, California, we're down in the last few leases and last half-dozen rent starts in a shopping center that was so clearly hit the bull's eye of what was missing in the market. This property will do nothing but get better and better over the years. 
And at 500 Santana Row, affectionately around here know as the Splunk Building, we've topped off that the $112 million project and remain on time and on budget.
So as I look back at the quarter and the execution in the business plan that we're also passionate about rent here and couldn't be more encouraged that we're on the right track to double our income in the next decade, but also realistic about the investment in people and real estate necessary to do it right and protect our downside in an inevitably cyclical business. 
The latest curveball lies in the uncertain future of Sports Authority. As you know, we have 5 locations, and none of them are in the closure list in the first round. We reserved most of our prepetition bankruptcy receivables of $400,000 in the first quarter and have been fully paid for April's rent. Now the latest conjecture of liquidation is a different story, of course. And depending on how it playdown and the specifics of each location, a short-term hit is likely and might affect our existing guidance if leases were immediately rejected as opposed to being assumed by another retailer. Having said that, we're quite confident that we would more than replace the cumulative rent, which totals $3.4 million annually triple-net basis, about $17.65 a foot and $4.8 million gross. The average market rent for a triple-net box lease in these locations exceeds $25, and we're already in conversations with replacement tenants just in case.
The other thing evolving change is, of course, changing shopping, living, working and entertainment habits of today's consumer. As you're all well aware, we have been, are and will continue to invest heavily in the best people, real estate and type of product that we believe puts us in the best position to capitalize on those changes. Downside is that in doing so we're making investments that have and will continue to dilute current earnings. 
And a couple of things on that front. First, the centralization effort that our company is in the middle of is progressing quite well with Jeff Mooallem settling into his role and in the process of building 4 quasi-independent geographic teams to grow our core shopping center business. Investment in incremental talent and IT systems infrastructure is now underway, and we would expect an incremental $1.5 million to $2 million annual investment to support this effort. 
Secondly, plans for our new Miami acquisitions, Sunset Place and CocoWalk, are progressing well and are being vetted by our senior team and partners. Decisions as to the direction and initial phases should go to investment committee later this year, at which point we'll lay out what we have in mind. In the meantime, we're heavily focused on grassroots engagement with the local communities and are increasingly optimistic that we'll be able to put forth viable and value creative changes at both locations. At Sunset, we'll need zoning changes that permit more height to come up with a viable plan. Fingers crossed.
And finally, the search for a senior business partner that carries CFO title for Federal is in full swing. I'm grateful for the very robust interest in joining our team that has followed Jim's announcement, and I've met with a number of terrific prospects who will be awesome partners to me and our senior team. I just don't want to rush that important decision, and I'm giving the process the attention and serious consideration it deserves. I'd hope to be prepared to make an announcement in this regard in the next 30 to 45 days. 
In the meantime, Melissa Solis is our Principal Accounting Officer. And as those of you who know Melissa know we remain in very good hands from an accounting and overall financial point of view.
Separately, I know that many on this call are friends and colleagues of James Milan, portfolio analyst at APG. We haven't put out a separate press release, but James will be joining us next month in the role of Vice President, Director of Finance, for the mixed-use division and will be relocating to our headquarters in Rockville, Maryland. We're thrilled to have him.
Now let me turn it over to Jim before answering your questions."

As Don highlighted, our team delivered yet another record for the Trust in terms of FFO per share, which is $1.38, representing 9.5% growth over the prior year quarter. In a quarter where we continue to",1323,"Thank you, Don and Leah, and good morning, everyone. As Don highlighted, our team delivered yet another record for the Trust in terms of FFO per share, which is $1.38, representing 9.5% growth over the prior year quarter. In a quarter where we continue to invest in the future through commencing future development phases, adding to our team, taking down box vacancy, et cetera, we are particularly pleased with the bottom line results driven by our operations, leasing, acquisition and development teams.
Turning to the numbers. Overall property operating income grew at 7.9% over the prior year, even with the decline of 130 basis points of occupancy, reflecting the higher anchor rollovers we've discussed. Our core portfolio continued to be a significant driver of our COI growth. That core grew at 4.2% on a same-store basis, including redevelopment. This quarter, the downtime associated with anchor rollover produced about 130 basis points drag. We highlighted this trend the last 2 quarters. And as I will discuss further in guidance, we expect this rollover drag to continue this year. 
Our first phases of Assembly Row and Pike & Rose contributed approximately $4.5 million of POI in the quarter, up on a sequential basis, as the Pallas high-rise opening approached breakeven occupancy and office spaces continue to rent in that. Finally, our acquisitions of Coco and Sunset Place, which are performing very well against our acquisition underwriting, also contributed significantly to overall POI growth. 
G&A remains flat on a sequential basis at $8 million for the quarter and down year-over-year principally to higher transaction costs in 2015 with respect to our San Antonio Center acquisition. We do expect our G&A line item to grow as we continue to invest in our platform.
Interest expense declined $400,000, reflecting the lower average rate achieved through our refinancings during the year, offset by lower capitalized interest during the quarter as we continue to place development into service. 
Again, bottom line, FFO grew at 9.5% for the quarter, which is above our long-term plan. That absolute bottom line performance while we continue to invest in the future, it's something we take great pride in. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we raised approximately $182 million of equity through an overnight as well as issuances under our ATM during the quarter at a collective weighted average price of $149.18. This represents over half of equity we planned to raise this year. 
We ended the quarter with $53 million drawn under our $600 million revolver, which we upsized after the quarter to $800 million and extended to 2020 while reducing our borrowing costs by 10 basis points. Our net debt to EBITDA was 5.3x, and our weighted average tenor was almost 10 years versus the peer average closer to 5, providing us maximum flexibility and liquidity to fund all the value creation that we have underway.
Turning to 2016, we affirm the previously given range of FFO per share of $5.65 to $5.71, a range of growth of approximately 6% to 7% or slightly below our long-term plan. As we discussed last quarter, this is a true range that will be impacted by several variables during the year. Again, the targeted box recapture and rollover vacancy drives a significant amount of drag in the year. That drag was offset this quarter by some positive timing items, which included marketing expense recoveries as well as higher year-over-year term fees of $600,000, as Don mentioned. Given that, we do expect same-store NOI will moderate in the second and third quarters of this year.
As Don discussed in his remarks, we're pleased to announce the signing of T.J. Maxx at Pentagon, The Dick's Sporting Goods lease at Melville and the L.A. Fitness lease at Del Mar, all of which, as he stated, will unlock significant value at these centers. Overall, our leasing team is making great progress under a captured box basis, which we will continue to report on over the coming quarters. 
In addition to this rollover, as discussed in prior quarters, there are several other investments in growth to consider from a timing perspective as you look at the year. First, our leasing pace at Pallas continues to go well with current occupancy for the building alone at just over 60% and expected stabilization occurring in the fourth quarter. The office space at Pike & Rose and Assembly, which represents approximately $80 million of investments, is fully committed and leased. And we'll start seeing the rent commencing throughout this year and early next as tenants take occupancy. 500 Santana Row, the Splunk Building, which represents approximately $115 million of investment, is of course 100% preleased and will deliver in the first quarter and rent commence in 2017. The Point redevelopment at Plaza El Segundo continues to perform exceptionally well and is expected to stabilize in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Our acquisition of our joint venture partner's 70% interest in 6 core assets is expected to be neutral this year after transaction costs in the sale of Courtyard Shops. We expect this acquisition to contribute approximately $0.02 to $0.03 in 2017.
We are well underway of the second phases of Pike & Rose and Assembly that represent another $600 million of investment and expect those phases to begin delivering in the latter part of '17 and early '18. 
From a capital standpoint, again, we expect to fund approximately $300 million of development and redevelopment with a mix of funds from operations, long-term debt and equity under our ATM, much of which we have taken care of in the first quarter. Finally, consistent with our practice, our guidance does not factor in any further acquisitions or dispositions that we may execute during the year. 
When you consider all that the company has going on, you will understand why I continue to emphasize that our guidance this year is a true range. In fact, factors that may drive us towards the low end of that range include: The timing of the anchor box backfill to rent commencement; the potential for additional rent concessions at Pallas as lease penthouses in the upper floor; the opportunistic capital raise that we completed in the first quarter front ended a significant part of our capital needs for the year. The ultimate resolution of the Sports Authority, as Don discussed, while none of our locations have been on the initial closure list, we believe it is unlikely that The Sports Authority will continue as is and that we may have the opportunity to get some of those locations back.
We continue to invest in our platform, as Don mentioned, both in systems and people as we drive decision-making closer to the real estate. These efforts may drive an additional $1 million to $2 million of annual G&A above our current assumed run rate of $34 million to $35 million on an annual basis. Even with that growth, it's still far below 5% of revenues.
And finally, the costs associated with backfilling my position have not been determined or forecast. Again, each one of these items that influence where we will come out in the range is a positive for the company and its long-term growth prospects, but they may impact where we land.
Before turning the call over to questions, I'd like to briefly thank Don for his friendship, counsel and support have meant a great deal to me over the last 18 years and now as I turn to the opportunity at Brixmore. Thank you, Don. 
I would also like to thank my partners at Federal, who are the best in the business: Chris Weilminster; Dawn Becker; Jeff Berkes; Don Briggs; Jeff Mooallem; Wendy Seher; Debbie Colson; John T.; Deirdre; Barry; and last, but certainty most, Melissa. Thanks to each of you for inspiring me with your excellence and your commitment to the Trust and its shareholders.

As you know, that first phase and the second phase has a significant residential component to it. The bottom line is, we were too aggressive in thinking what we were going to be able to get for residential rents. And the marketplace has an awful lot of supply on it, and the place is absolutely a construction zone and will be for some time. And so it's what I always worry about with when changing numbers like this is that there's a taint on the project itself, because there can't be. The project is going as well or better than we expected in terms of its acceptance, even in terms of its performance -- rent performance on the residential side, compared to the marketplace. It's just that the marketplace is significantly lower than we had hoped and thought it would be when we underwrote this. So it's all that. obviously, the good side of that is we're not locking into 15-year deals or 20-year deals. These are 12-month leases, but it would be -- it just wouldn't be right for me to have the same expectations of being able to lease up the rest of the buildings we have in Phase 1 and the residential building in Phase 2 at rents that when I look at it right now, when our team looks at it right now, we don't think we can hit. And that's what's causing that. I really don't want you to see that as a failure of the project. It's market timing."

The -- look, the bottom line is this company grew and has grown pretty darn consistently over the last 15 years in terms of its value, in terms of what it does for a living, in terms of its breadth and growth. The -- we had to effectively get management closer to the real estate because the real estate is so different. Managing at Pike & Rose and managing at Assembly Row and managing and having an opportunity like Sunset and Coco is just very different than the core shopping center business. So we needed to needed to do, we needed to align management more closely with the real estate business. That's our business. We are really not a portfolio manager. We look at it asset by asset. Now when you do that, there's obviously going to be incremental overhead to be able to set it up that way. And that overhead is incremental, not only on to use the hotel vernacular front of the house stuff, but also back of the house, systems and reporting, accounting all of that. We're in the middle of that transition, and that transition take some time. If you think about an incremental few million a year, basically, we got to more than make up for that in incremental value. Well, where would that incremental value come from? It comes in every part of our business, first and foremost, by getting to things more quickly, by getting tenants to through the process of leasing to tenant coordinations, opening their doors to rent start. That's done a whole lot better if the leasing agent and the asset manager and the developer, tenant coordinator are all working together. There's a lot of that. Secondly, down at that that level, we'll know our markets better. We do know our markets better and closer so that -- and I'll give a couple of examples. We're talking about Brick Township right now, Brick Plaza. Well, Brick is a great shopping center in Brick, New Jersey, that we've owned for a long time. Part of the reason that we haven been able to get to doing a better job at Brick Plaza is because of the A&P lease, and we talk to that about that. But another part of the reason is because it's geographically further away. This helps us focus more on it. It helps us create business, and then -- I could say that about at least 20 or 25 shopping centers. So this is truly an evolution of our business. It's an investment in the next decade where the combination of great products in terms of a mixed-use development that we're doing with a more active and proactively managed core, together should make the few million dollars of incremental G&A nothing compared to the incremental value that we create. So that's what it is that we're trying to do."

One of those was assumed and is underway in terms of being built out on Long Island at Greenlawn, which leaves 3 more. Melville Mall also on the island and I did not mention -- when I talked about the good stuff that's happening at Melville Mall today with the signing of Dick's, for example, the last space that we have at Melville Mall is the former Waldbaum's box. We're making real good progress, but we are not a place where I can tell you it's a signed deal yet. And you'll like everything about that. The next one is at Brick where again it's part of a much much bigger redevelopment and remerchandising of the entire center. And we're not as close as Melville, but making real good progress. We'll have something to say over the next couple of quarters there, I think. And the final one is Troy, which is in New Jersey. And we're hopeful -- I shouldn't say exactly this way yet. I don't know whether we're going to backfill it or whether this is going to be a bigger redevelopment possibility there, which would include some residential and a more densely populated shopping center. Obviously, if it comes to something like that, which would add the most value which I would love. There's a lot of work to day with respect to the community and figuring out if something like that is viable. That's what we're working on there. So that would be the last one of the 3 that you'll hear anything about I would think. Oh then Santana, let's go to Santana. Oh yes, Valley Fair does what they're doing and Jeff's on the phone. There'll absolutely be an impact. They're talking about adding hundreds of thousands of square feet in a great node at a great place that will perform a very different function than what we do. And I wouldn't think -- we're confident that it wouldn't have a long-term impact on the property. But if they are leasing up that much space for that period of time, that has to, I would think, impact us. I just don't know by how much yet, nothing in any significant way whether they actually -- they haven't started construction yet, where they will, when they will, what the timing is that still I just don't know the answer to that. But there would be an impact. I just can't quantify it for you today; again, a short-term impact."

It's not perfect, but if you go back far enough, you're going to capture enough of a subset of the portfolio to look at that. And again, we've owned these assets for a long period of time. So we have vintage leases rolling every year. There isn't, as far as I can tell, not a particular year in which we got a lot of vintage closing coming to market, if you will.

So here are the 5 centers, Assembly Square in the marketplace, right? So you know what's happening today in marketplace versus because of what we're doing in the mixed-use project adjacent to it. It's been a very positive thing. And certainly, the interest in that power center that's adjacent is significantly higher than it was before we built the project. So if we got that back, that would be okay, good thing there. Brick Plaza is the next one, again, in the middle of a complete redo. The timing of that would be great in terms of the future of Brick Plaza. Crow Canyon, which is out on the West Coast and that's a smaller store out there. And then the latest when we did -- we did that some years back. But nonetheless, that was the last one, smaller in a center that we had just -- that we've just redone, which is a good thing in terms of the demand characteristics that you would have. Montrose Crossing is the fourth. That's the one directly across from Pike & Rose. That's over 35 acres where the section of the shopping center where they are would be dramatically impacted to the extent we can better merchandise that. And the last one is East Bay Bridge out in Emeryville, with the rents in place there are extremely low, and the upside would be terrific. And that's another place that we just put into new -- we've really remerchandised the shopping center. So as I sit back and I look at TSA, this is a good tenant to work through this portfolio, and it's a better thing in all of the locations that we have. But it's a lot of rent in the meantime.

Pike 7 is an amazing shopping center. Frankly, if sales were hit significantly during Pike 7, first of all, they would have happened during the construction of the Silver Line when basically the entrances were closed and they did in any significant way. But if they were, then we'd have a lower hurdle to be able to do a larger mixed-use project at the site, which would be great. Having said that, your point, your bigger point, so stopping right there, look, Pike 7 is a great asset for us. What we do there long term will only be positive. And part of the issue is it's so successful for what it is right now. And therefore, the hurdle is so high to do something better, financially better there. So that's Pike 7. Now take the bigger premise and this, I think, is really important in terms of the judgment that we showed there. I think you're right. The way the Silver Line is working through Tysons, there are winners and there are losers. The type of projects that are being built there, there are winners, there are losers. We did not jump and say, oh God, we got to be the first one to market. We sat back. We renewed leases. We kick out so that we were able to get the space if we needed to, but we've created. We are disciplined. That particular asset has so north to our benefit, that's only because we really ran it like a true real estate company would and real estate play and not like a drunken sailor with respect to development for Pete's sake in terms of what it should be. So I want a little -- I guess I really want a little bit of credit for the discipline that we showed in not jumping to what the new Tysons is going to be. Because as you just point out, it takes a long time with a major infrastructure change like the Silver Line is to figure out what Tysons should be. Thanks so much.

Thank you all for joining us today, and I look forward to seeing all or most of you in a few weeks at the NAREIT Conference in New York where we can talk more about our company and the many changes affecting our industry. 
As most of you are aware by now, this will be the last earnings call that my good friend and colleague, Jim Taylor, will be on as the CFO of Federal. His team is certainly going to miss him, but I, for one, am  genuinely proud of him and the opportunities he's going to get at Brixmor. Their board made a great choice. I'm also personally grateful for his many contributions to the company, his wise counsel and most importantly, his friendship; however, fleeting that might have been.
Well, enough about Jim for the moment. Onward to the quarterly results and to our prospects for the future.
Really good quarter all the way around for us. FFO per share of $1.38, highest quarterly result of all time and 9.5% better than last year's quarter. 
Same-center growth of 4.2%, again, validating how important our redevelopment program is to us, but we don't expect to maintain this level for the year given the significant investment for the future initiatives that we have underway and lease termination fees that helped us this quarter by $600,000 or so. More on all that later. 
85 comparable deals done for nearly 400,000 feet of space at $33.53 per foot, 13% higher on a cash basis than the deals they replaced. That's up 23% on anchors, 10% on small shops. It's up 21% on new leases, 9% on renewals. It's up on all those metrics in the core shopping center business, in the mixed-use division and on the West Coast. Strong consistent leasing progress throughout our operations is our trademark, and we don't expect that to falter.
Overall portfolio occupancy at 94.1% leased, but only 92.7% occupied. Those numbers are down by 130 and 180 basis points, respectively, from a year ago, much of that through the inclusion of our lower occupancy acquisitions in South Florida and from the Clarion acquisition. Together, that's 1.5 million square feet added with a combined occupancy in the mid-80s. And of course, it's also the planned A&P and other vacancies that we talked about last quarter. 
Yet, we still had a record quarter. Growing earnings with decreasing occupancy, whether planned or unplanned, speaks volumes about our business plan and our company. Speaking of that occupancy, we made strong progress as it relates to proactively taking advantage of weak and failed tenants to improve the anchor merchandising at certain of our important shopping centers. That initiative took a big step forward this quarter, with the signing of T.J. Maxx to take over the failed Hudson Trail Outfitters space at Pentagon Row; with the signing of Dick's Sporting Goods at Melville Mall, which along with last quarter's Field & Stream deal and some real good stuff to come, I'm not ready to talk about it yet, go a long way to returning Melville Mall on Long Island into something pretty special; and L.A. Fitness taking out a host of obsolete small shop space at Del Mar Village in Boca Raton. Three great deals all at far higher rents than they replaced, actually nearly 30% higher in total, with far better retailers for our future as just the initial part of the redevelopment of these extremely well located shopping centers. Remember though, those are just signed leases, and the rent contributions won't start from them for some time as each particular center is being developed. All the evidence so far suggests that this proactive approach toward creating vacancy is going to work out overall as we'd hoped in creating far more relevant shopping centers, even though it will put pressure on same-store growth for the balance of '16 and '17.
I also want to report on strong progress on the lease up and rent start for the Phase 1 completions of our 3 big and active development projects. Let's talk about them individually.
At Assembly Row, the first phase is basically finished now, with the last group of office tenants moving into our small office building and the retailers and restaurants solidifying their only success. We've really moved on to Phase 2 execution, the first sign of which begins next month as the first Partners Healthcare employees begin populating the nearly complete 700,000 square foot building. Assembly has been so thoroughly accepted by the community as the place to live, work and shop, that we expect long-term value creation here to exceed our expectations. 
At Pike & Rose, we've leased up a ton of apartments since the end of the year and now stand at a Phase 1 residential percentage leased at 73%, heading into a strong summer leasing season. I couldn't be more pleased that the rate of lease up that we're achieving. Pike & Rose is creating a lot of buzz and getting a lot of recognition in the community, and I'm optimistic that we'll have the building basically full by year-end or soon thereafter as we forecasted. 
I'm not as optimistic that we'll hit our rent dollar forecast, given the rental rates we've been assuming for the higher floors in the Pallas Building. So far we've been close to our forecasted rents at $2.40, which are at a premium to the market. But because of construction, we basically have been leasing from the bottom up. But we're skeptical at this point that we'll be able to push rents on the higher floors to the extent we'd hoped, given the significant supply in the market and the fact that we remain a major construction site. We'll see over the next 6 to 8 months, but our initial yield may be under pressure by 50 basis points or so, more on that with another quarter of leasing under our belt.
One thing that we're particularly confident about is the very real premium to market that we've been getting even during this initial lease up phase. Pallas average monthly rents to date of $2,500 a month or $2.40 a foot reflect a 20% premium over the North Bethesda, Rockville submarket. And for penthouses that we delivered at over $6,000 a month are setting new high watermarks for this market. As I said earlier, the pace of leasing is outpacing that competitive product, too. 
While excess supply in the market has caused us to miss our initial rent projections, and that is no doubt disappointing. It's also causing us to project more conservatively on Phase 2 as you'll note in our 8-K. The premium to that market clearly attainable because of the environment we're creating at Pike & Rose and the level of service we're providing is both validating and encouraging. We're building the right products for the future. Pike & Rose is going to be around for a long time and gets more and more integral to the community shopping, living and working habits every day. We'll have many opportunities to increase the residential income stream in the years ahead on these mostly 12-month leases.
And as a point in El Segundo, California, we're down to the last few leases and last half-dozen rent starts in a shopping center that was so clearly hit the bull's eye of what was missing in the market. This property will do nothing but get better and better over the years. 
And at 500 Santana Row, affectionately around here know as the Splunk Building, we've topped off that $112 million project and remain on time and on budget.
So as I look back at the quarter and the execution in the business plan that we're also passionate about around here I couldn't be more encouraged that we're on the right track to double our income in the next decade, but also realistic about the investment in people and real estate necessary to do it right and protect our downside in an inevitably cyclical business. 
The latest curveball lies in the uncertain future of Sports Authority. As you know, we have 5 locations, and none of them are on the closure list in the first round. We reserved most of our prepetition bankruptcy receivables out $400,000 in the first quarter and have been fully paid for April's rent. Now the latest conjecture of liquidation is a different story, of course. And depending on how it plays out and the specifics of each location, a short-term hit is likely and might affect our existing guidance if leases were immediately rejected as opposed to being assumed by another retailer. Having said that, we're quite confident that we would more than replace the cumulative rent, which totals $3.4 million annually triple-net basis, about $17.65 a foot and $4.8 million gross. The average market rent for a triple-net box lease in these locations exceeds $25, and we're already in conversations with replacement tenants just in case.
The other thing evolving change is, of course, changing shopping, living, working and entertainment habits of today's consumer. As you're all well aware, we have been, are and will continue to invest heavily in the best people, real estate and type of product that we believe puts us in the best position to capitalize on those changes. Downside is that in doing so we're making investments that have and will continue to dilute current earnings. 
And a couple of things on that front. First, the decentralization effort that our company is in the middle of is progressing quite well with Jeff Mooallem settling into his role and in the process of building 4 quasi-independent geographic teams to grow our core shopping center business. Investment in incremental talent and IT systems infrastructure is now underway, and we would expect an incremental $1.5 million to $2 million annual investment to support this effort. 
Secondly, plans for our new Miami acquisitions, Sunset Place and CocoWalk, are progressing well and are being vetted by our senior team and partners. Decisions as to the direction and initial phases should go to investment committee later this year, at which point we'll lay out what we have in mind. In the meantime, we're heavily focused on grassroots engagement with the local communities and are increasingly optimistic that we'll be able to put forth viable and value creative changes at both locations. At Sunset, we'll need zoning changes that permit more height to come up with a viable plan. Fingers crossed.
And finally, the search for a senior business partner that carries the CFO title for Federal is in full swing. I'm grateful for the very robust interest in joining our team that has followed Jim's announcement, and I've met with a number of terrific prospects who would be awesome partners to me and our senior team. I just don't want to rush that important decision, and I'm giving the process the attention and serious consideration it deserves. I'd hope to be prepared to make an announcement in this regard in the next 30 to 45 days. 
In the meantime, Melissa Solis is our Principal Accounting Officer. And as those of you who know Melissa know we remain in very good hands from an accounting and overall financial point of view.
Separately, I know that many on this call are friends and colleagues of James Milam, portfolio analyst at APG. We haven't put out a separate press release, but James will be joining us next month in the role of Vice President, Director of Finance, for the mixed-use division and will be relocating to our headquarters here in Rockville, Maryland. We're thrilled to have him.
Now let me turn it over to Jim before answering your questions."

As Don highlighted, our team delivered yet another record for the Trust in terms of FFO per share, which at $1.38, represented 9.5% growth over the prior year quarter. In a quarter where we continue to",1326,"Thank you, Don and Leah, and good morning, everyone. As Don highlighted, our team delivered yet another record for the Trust in terms of FFO per share, which at $1.38, represented 9.5% growth over the prior year quarter. In a quarter where we continue to invest in the future through commencing future development phases, adding to our team, taking down box vacancy, et cetera, we are particularly pleased with the bottom line results driven by our operations, leasing, acquisition and development teams.
Turning to the numbers. Overall property operating income grew at 7.9% over the prior year, even with the decline of 130 basis points of occupancy, reflecting the higher anchor rollovers we've discussed. Our core portfolio continued to be a significant driver of our COI growth. That core grew at 4.2% on a same-store basis, including redevelopment. This quarter, the downtime associated with anchor rollover produced about 130 basis points drag. We highlighted this trend the last 2 quarters. And as I will discuss further in guidance, we expect this rollover drag to continue this year. 
Our first phases of Assembly Row and Pike & Rose contributed approximately $4.5 million of POI in the quarter, up on a sequential basis, as the Pallas high-rise opening approached breakeven occupancy and office spaces continue to rent commence. Finally, our acquisitions of Coco and Sunset Place, which are performing very well against our acquisition underwriting, also contributed significantly to overall POI growth. 
G&A remains flat on a sequential basis at $8 million for the quarter and down year-over-year principally to higher transaction costs in 2015 with respect to our San Antonio Center acquisition. We do expect our G&A line item to grow as we continue to invest in our platform.
Interest expense declined $400,000, reflecting the lower average rate achieved through our refinancings during the year, offset by lower capitalized interest during the quarter as we continue to place development into service. 
Again, bottom line, FFO grew at 9.5% for the quarter, which is above our long-term plan. That absolute bottom line performance while we continue to invest in the future, is something we take great pride in. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we raised approximately $182 million of equity through an overnight as well as issuances under our ATM during the quarter at a collective weighted average price of $149.18. This represents over half of equity we planned to raise this year. 
We ended the quarter with $53 million drawn under our $600 million revolver, which we upsized after the quarter to $800 million and extended to 2020 while reducing our borrowing costs by 10 basis points. Our net debt to EBITDA was 5.3x, and our weighted average tenor was almost 10 years versus the peer average closer to 5, providing us maximum flexibility and liquidity to fund all the value creation that we have underway.
Turning to 2016, we affirm the previously given range of FFO per share of $5.65 to $5.71, a range of growth of approximately 6% to 7% or slightly below our long-term plan. As we discussed last quarter, this is a true range that will be impacted by several variables during the year. Again, the targeted box recapture and rollover vacancy drives a significant amount of drag in the year. That drag was offset this quarter by some positive timing items, which included marketing expense recoveries as well as higher year-over-year term fees of $600,000, as Don mentioned. Given that, we do expect same-store NOI will moderate in the second and third quarters of this year.
As Don discussed in his remarks, we're pleased to announce the signing of T.J. Maxx at Pentagon, The Dick's Sporting Goods lease at Melville and the L.A. Fitness lease at Del Mar, all of which, as he stated, will unlock significant value at these centers. Overall, our leasing team is making great progress under a captured box basis, which we will continue to report on over the coming quarters. 
In addition to this rollover, as discussed in prior quarters, there are several other investments in growth to consider from a timing perspective as you look at the year. First, our leasing pace at Pallas continues to go well with current occupancy for that building alone at just over 60% and expected stabilization occurring in the fourth quarter. The office space at Pike & Rose and Assembly, which represents approximately $80 million of investments, is fully committed and leased. And we'll start seeing the rent commencing throughout this year and early next as tenants take occupancy. 500 Santana Row, the Splunk Building, which represents approximately $115 million of investment, is of course 100% preleased and will deliver in the fourth quarter and rent commence in 2017. The Point redevelopment at Plaza El Segundo continues to perform exceptionally well and is expected to stabilize in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Our acquisition of our joint venture partner's 70% interest in 6 core assets is expected to be neutral this year after transaction costs in the sale of Courtyard Shops. We expect this acquisition to contribute approximately $0.02 to $0.03 in 2017.
We are well underway of the second phases of Pike & Rose and Assembly that represent another $600 million of investment and expect those phases to begin delivering in the latter part of '17 and early '18. 
From a capital standpoint, again, we expect to fund approximately $300 million of development and redevelopment with a mix of funds from operations, long-term debt and equity under our ATM, much of which we have taken care of in the first quarter. Finally, consistent with our practice, our guidance does not factor in any further acquisitions or dispositions that we may execute during the year. 
When you consider all that the company has going on, you will understand why I continue to emphasize that our guidance this year is a true range. In fact, factors that may drive us towards the low end of that range include: The timing of the anchor box backfill to rent commencement; the potential for additional rent concessions at Pallas as we lease penthouses in the upper floor; the opportunistic capital raise that we completed in the first quarter front ended a significant part of our capital needs for the year. The ultimate resolution of the Sports Authority, as Don discussed, while none of our locations have been on the initial closure list, we believe it is unlikely that The Sports Authority will continue as is and that we may have the opportunity to get some of those locations back.
We continue to invest in our platform, as Don mentioned, both in systems and people as we drive decision-making closer to the real estate. These efforts may drive an additional $1 million to $2 million of annual G&A above our current assumed run rate of $34 million to $35 million on an annual basis. Even with that growth, it's still far below 5% of revenues.
And finally, the costs associated with backfilling my position have not been determined or forecast. Again, each one of these items that influence where we will come out in the range is a positive for the company and its long-term growth prospects, but they may impact where we land.
Before turning the call over to questions, I'd like to briefly thank Don for his friendship, counsel and support, they have meant a great deal to me over the last 18 years and now as I turn to the opportunity at Brixmor. Thank you, Don. 
I would also like to thank my partners at Federal, who are the best in the business: Chris Weilminster; Dawn Becker; Jeff Berkes; Don Briggs; Jeff Mooallem; Wendy Seher; Debbie Colson; John T.; Deirdre [ph] ; Barry; and last, but certainty most, Melissa.

As you know, that first phase and the second phase has a significant residential component to it. The bottom line is, we were too aggressive in thinking what we were going to be able to get for residential rents. And the marketplace has an awful lot of supply on it, and the place is absolutely a construction zone and will be for some time. And so it's what I always worry about with -- when changing numbers like this is that there's a taint on the project itself, because there can't be. The project is going as well or better than we expected in terms of its acceptance, even in terms of its performance -- rent performance on the residential side, compared to the marketplace. It's just that the marketplace is significantly lower than we had hoped and thought it would be when we underwrote this. So it's all that. Now obviously, the good side of that is we're not locking into 15-year deals or 20-year deals. These are 12-month leases, but it would be -- it just wouldn't be right for me to have the same expectations of being able to lease up the rest of the buildings we have in Phase 1 and the residential building in Phase 2 at rents that when I look at it right now, when our team looks at it right now, we don't think we can hit. And that's what's causing that. I really don't want you to see that as a failure of the project. It's market timing."

The -- look, the bottom line is this company grew and has grown pretty darn consistently over the last 15 years in terms of its value, in terms of what it does for a living, in terms of its breadth and growth. The -- we had to effectively get management closer to the real estate because the real estate is so different. Managing at Pike & Rose and managing at Assembly Row and managing and having an opportunity like Sunset and Coco is just very different than the core shopping center business. So we needed to do, we needed to align management more closely with the real estate business. That's our business. We are really not a portfolio manager. We look at it asset by asset. Now when you do that, there's obviously going to be incremental overhead to be able to set it up that way. And that overhead is incremental, not only on the -- to use the hotel vernacular, front of the house stuff, but also back of the house, systems and reporting, accounting all of that. We're in the middle of that transition, and that transition takes some time. If you think about an incremental few million a year, basically, we got to more than make up for that in incremental value. Well, where would that incremental value come from? It comes in every part of our business, first and foremost, by getting to things more quickly, by getting tenants to -- through the process of leasing, to tenant coordinations, opening their doors to rent start. That's done a whole lot better if the leasing agent and the asset manager and the developer, tenant coordinator are all working together. There's a lot of that. Secondly, down at that level, we'll know our markets better. We do know our markets better and closer so that -- and I'll give a couple of examples. We're talking about Brick Township right now, Brick Plaza. Well, Brick is a great shopping center in Brick, New Jersey, that we've owned for a long time. Part of the reason that we haven't been able to get to doing a better job at Brick Plaza is because of the A&P lease, and we talk to that -- about that. But another part of the reason is because it's geographically further away. This helps us focus more on it. It helps us create business, and then -- I could say that about at least 20 or 25 shopping centers. So this is truly an evolution of our business. It's an investment in the next decade, where the combination of great products in terms of mixed-use development that we're doing with a more active and proactively managed core, together should make the few million dollars of incremental G&A nothing compared to the incremental value that we create. So that's what it is that we're trying to do."

One of those was assumed and is underway in terms of being built out on Long Island at Greenlawn, which leaves 3 more. Melville Mall also on the island and I did not mention -- when I talk about the good stuff that's happening at Melville Mall today with the signing of Dick's, for example, the last space that we have at Melville Mall is the former Waldbaum's box. We're making real good progress, but we are not a place where I can tell you it's a signed deal yet. And you'll like everything about that. The next one is at Brick where again it's part of a much, much bigger redevelopment and remerchandising of the entire center. And we're not as close as Melville, but making real good progress. We'll have something to say over the next couple of quarters there, I think. And the final one is Troy, which is in New Jersey. And we're hopeful -- I shouldn't say it exactly this way yet. I don't know whether we're going to backfill it or whether this is going to be a bigger redevelopment possibility there, which would include some residential and a more densely populated shopping center. Obviously, if it comes to something like that, which would add the most value, which I would love. There's a lot of work to do with respect to the community and figuring out if something like that is viable. That's what we're working on there. So that would be the last one of the 3 that you'll hear anything about I would think. Oh and then Santana, let's go to Santana. Oh yes, if Valley Fair does what they're doing and Jeff's on the phone, there'll absolutely be an impact. They're talking about adding hundreds of thousands of square feet in a great node at a great place that will perform a very different function than what we do. And I wouldn't think -- we're confident that it wouldn't have a long-term impact on the property. But if they are leasing up that much space for that period of time, that has to, I would think, impact us. I just don't know by how much yet, nothing in any significant way whether they actually -- they haven't started construction yet, where they will, when they will, what the timing is that still I just don't know the answer to that. But there would be an impact. I just can't quantify it for you today; again, a short-term impact."

It's not perfect, but if you go back far enough, you're going to capture enough of a subset of the portfolio to look at that. And again, we've owned these assets for a long period of time.

So here are the five centers, Assembly Square, in the marketplace, right? So you know what's happening to that marketplace versus -- because of what we're doing in the mixed-use project adjacent to it. It's been a very positive thing. And certainly, the interest in that power center that's adjacent is significantly higher than it was before we built the project. So if we got that back, that would be okay, a good thing there. Brick Plaza is the next one, again, in the middle of a complete redo. The timing of that would be great in terms of the future of Brick Plaza. Crow Canyon, which is out on the West Coast and that's a smaller store out there. And the latest one that we did -- we did that some years back. But nonetheless, that was the last one, smaller in a center that we'd just redone, which is a good thing in terms of the demand characteristics that you would have. Montrose Crossing is the fourth. That's the one directly across from Pike & Rose. That's over 35 acres where the section of the shopping center where they are would be dramatically impacted to the extent we can better merchandise that. And the last one is East Bay Bridge out in Emeryville, which is -- which the rents in place there are extremely low, and the upside would be terrific. And that's another place that we just put in 2 new -- we've really remerchandised the shopping center. So as I sit back and I look at TSA, this is a good tenant to work through this portfolio, and it's a better thing in all of the locations that we have. But it's a lot of rent in the meantime.

Frankly, if sales were hit significantly during Pike 7, first of all, they would have happened during the construction of the Silver Line when basically all the entrances were closed and they didn't in any significant way. But if they were, then we'd had a lower hurdle to be able to do a larger mixed-use project at the site, which would be great. Having said that, your point, your bigger point, so stopping right there, look, Pike 7 is a great asset for us. What we do there long term will only be positive. And part of the issue is it's so successful for what it is right now. And therefore, the hurdle is so high to do something better, financially better there. So that's Pike 7. Now take the bigger premise and this, I think, is really important in terms of the judgment that we showed there. I think you're right. The way the Silver Line is working through Tysons, there are winners and there are losers. The type of projects that are being built there, there are winners, there are losers. We did not jump and say, oh God, we got to be the first one to market. We sat back. We renewed leases -- we have kick outs so that we were able to get the space if we needed to -- but we've created, with our discipline that, that particular asset has so inured to our benefit, that's only because we really ran it like a true real estate company would and real estate play and not like a drunken sailor with respect to development for Pete's sake, in terms of what it should be. So I want a little -- I guess I really want a little bit of credit for the discipline that we showed in not jumping to what the new Tysons is going to be. Because as you just point out, it takes a long time with a major infrastructure change like the Silver Line is to figure out what Tysons should be. Thanks so much.

Thank you all for joining us today, and I look forward to seeing all or most of you in a few weeks at the NAREIT Conference in New York where we can talk more about our company and the many changes affecting our industry. 
As most of you are aware by now, this will be the last earnings call that my good friend and colleague, Jim Taylor, will be on as the CFO of Federal. His team is certainly going to miss him, but I, for one, am  genuinely proud of him and the opportunities he's going to get at Brixmor. Their board made a great choice. I'm also personally grateful for his many contributions to the company, his wise counsel and most importantly, his friendship; however, fleeting that might have been.
Well, enough about Jim for the moment. Onward to the quarterly results and to our prospects for the future.
Really good quarter all the way around for us. FFO per share of $1.38, highest quarterly result of all time and 9.5% better than last year's quarter. 
Same-center growth of 4.2%, again, validating how important our redevelopment program is to us, but we don't expect to maintain this level for the year given the significant investment for the future initiatives that we have underway and lease termination fees that helped us this quarter by $600,000 or so. More on all that later. 
85 comparable deals done for nearly 400,000 feet of space at $33.53 per foot, 13% higher on a cash basis than the deals they replaced. That's up 23% on anchors, 10% on small shops. It's up 21% on new leases, 9% on renewals. It's up on all those metrics in the core shopping center business, in the mixed-use division and on the West Coast. Strong consistent leasing progress throughout our operations is our trademark, and we don't expect that to falter.
Overall portfolio occupancy at 94.1% leased, but only 92.7% occupied. Those numbers are down by 130 and 180 basis points, respectively, from a year ago, much of that through the inclusion of our lower occupancy acquisitions in South Florida and from the Clarion acquisition. Together, that's 1.5 million square feet added with a combined occupancy in the mid-80s. And of course, it's also the planned A&P and other vacancies that we talked about last quarter. 
Yet, we still had a record quarter. Growing earnings with decreasing occupancy, whether planned or unplanned, speaks volumes about our business plan and our company. Speaking of that occupancy, we made strong progress as it relates to proactively taking advantage of weak and failed tenants to improve the anchor merchandising at certain of our important shopping centers. That initiative took a big step forward this quarter, with the signing of T.J. Maxx to take over the failed Hudson Trail Outfitters space at Pentagon Row; with the signing of Dick's Sporting Goods at Melville Mall, which along with last quarter's Field & Stream deal and some real good stuff to come, I'm not ready to talk about it yet, go a long way to returning Melville Mall on Long Island into something pretty special; and L.A. Fitness taking out a host of obsolete small shop space at Del Mar Village in Boca Raton. Three great deals all at far higher rents than they replaced, actually nearly 30% higher in total, with far better retailers for our future as just the initial part of the redevelopment of these extremely well located shopping centers. Remember though, those are just signed leases, and the rent contributions won't start from them for some time as each particular center is being developed. All the evidence so far suggests that this proactive approach toward creating vacancy is going to work out overall as we'd hoped in creating far more relevant shopping centers, even though it will put pressure on same-store growth for the balance of '16 and '17.
I also want to report on strong progress on the lease up and rent start for the Phase 1 completions of our 3 big and active development projects. Let's talk about them individually.
At Assembly Row, the first phase is basically finished now, with the last group of office tenants moving into our small office building and the retailers and restaurants solidifying their only success. We've really moved on to Phase 2 execution, the first sign of which begins next month as the first Partners Healthcare employees begin populating the nearly complete 700,000 square foot building. Assembly has been so thoroughly accepted by the community as the place to live, work and shop, that we expect long-term value creation here to exceed our expectations. 
At Pike & Rose, we've leased up a ton of apartments since the end of the year and now stand at a Phase 1 residential percentage leased at 73%, heading into a strong summer leasing season. I couldn't be more pleased that the rate of lease up that we're achieving. Pike & Rose is creating a lot of buzz and getting a lot of recognition in the community, and I'm optimistic that we'll have the building basically full by year-end or soon thereafter as we forecasted. 
I'm not as optimistic that we'll hit our rent dollar forecast, given the rental rates we've been assuming for the higher floors in the Pallas Building. So far we've been close to our forecasted rents at $2.40, which are at a premium to the market. But because of construction, we basically have been leasing from the bottom up. But we're skeptical at this point that we'll be able to push rents on the higher floors to the extent we'd hoped, given the significant supply in the market and the fact that we remain a major construction site. We'll see over the next 6 to 8 months, but our initial yield may be under pressure by 50 basis points or so, more on that with another quarter of leasing under our belt.
One thing that we're particularly confident about is the very real premium to market that we've been getting even during this initial lease up phase. Pallas average monthly rents to date of $2,500 a month or $2.40 a foot reflect a 20% premium over the North Bethesda, Rockville submarket. And for penthouses that we delivered at over $6,000 a month are setting new high watermarks for this market. As I said earlier, the pace of leasing is outpacing that competitive product, too. 
While excess supply in the market has caused us to miss our initial rent projections, and that is no doubt disappointing. It's also causing us to project more conservatively on Phase 2 as you'll note in our 8-K. The premium to that market clearly attainable because of the environment we're creating at Pike & Rose and the level of service we're providing is both validating and encouraging. We're building the right products for the future. Pike & Rose is going to be around for a long time and gets more and more integral to the community shopping, living and working habits every day. We'll have many opportunities to increase the residential income stream in the years ahead on these mostly 12-month leases.
And as a point in El Segundo, California, we're down to the last few leases and last half-dozen rent starts in a shopping center that was so clearly hit the bull's eye of what was missing in the market. This property will do nothing but get better and better over the years. 
And at 500 Santana Row, affectionately around here know as the Splunk Building, we've topped off that $112 million project and remain on time and on budget.
So as I look back at the quarter and the execution in the business plan that we're also passionate about around here I couldn't be more encouraged that we're on the right track to double our income in the next decade, but also realistic about the investment in people and real estate necessary to do it right and protect our downside in an inevitably cyclical business. 
The latest curveball lies in the uncertain future of Sports Authority. As you know, we have 5 locations, and none of them are on the closure list in the first round. We reserved most of our prepetition bankruptcy receivables out $400,000 in the first quarter and have been fully paid for April's rent. Now the latest conjecture of liquidation is a different story, of course. And depending on how it plays out and the specifics of each location, a short-term hit is likely and might affect our existing guidance if leases were immediately rejected as opposed to being assumed by another retailer. Having said that, we're quite confident that we would more than replace the cumulative rent, which totals $3.4 million annually triple-net basis, about $17.65 a foot and $4.8 million gross. The average market rent for a triple-net box lease in these locations exceeds $25, and we're already in conversations with replacement tenants just in case.
The other thing evolving change is, of course, changing shopping, living, working and entertainment habits of today's consumer. As you're all well aware, we have been, are and will continue to invest heavily in the best people, real estate and type of product that we believe puts us in the best position to capitalize on those changes. Downside is that in doing so we're making investments that have and will continue to dilute current earnings. 
And a couple of things on that front. First, the decentralization effort that our company is in the middle of is progressing quite well with Jeff Mooallem settling into his role and in the process of building 4 quasi-independent geographic teams to grow our core shopping center business. Investment in incremental talent and IT systems infrastructure is now underway, and we would expect an incremental $1.5 million to $2 million annual investment to support this effort. 
Secondly, plans for our new Miami acquisitions, Sunset Place and CocoWalk, are progressing well and are being vetted by our senior team and partners. Decisions as to the direction and initial phases should go to investment committee later this year, at which point we'll lay out what we have in mind. In the meantime, we're heavily focused on grassroots engagement with the local communities and are increasingly optimistic that we'll be able to put forth viable and value creative changes at both locations. At Sunset, we'll need zoning changes that permit more height to come up with a viable plan. Fingers crossed.
And finally, the search for a senior business partner that carries the CFO title for Federal is in full swing. I'm grateful for the very robust interest in joining our team that has followed Jim's announcement, and I've met with a number of terrific prospects who would be awesome partners to me and our senior team. I just don't want to rush that important decision, and I'm giving the process the attention and serious consideration it deserves. I'd hope to be prepared to make an announcement in this regard in the next 30 to 45 days. 
In the meantime, Melissa Solis is our Principal Accounting Officer. And as those of you who know Melissa know we remain in very good hands from an accounting and overall financial point of view.
Separately, I know that many on this call are friends and colleagues of James Milam, portfolio analyst at APG. We haven't put out a separate press release, but James will be joining us next month in the role of Vice President, Director of Finance, for the mixed-use division and will be relocating to our headquarters here in Rockville, Maryland. We're thrilled to have him.
Now let me turn it over to Jim before answering your questions."

As Don highlighted, our team delivered yet another record for the Trust in terms of FFO per share, which at $1.38, represented 9.5% growth over the prior year quarter. In a quarter where we continue to",1326,"Thank you, Don and Leah, and good morning, everyone. As Don highlighted, our team delivered yet another record for the Trust in terms of FFO per share, which at $1.38, represented 9.5% growth over the prior year quarter. In a quarter where we continue to invest in the future through commencing future development phases, adding to our team, taking down box vacancy, et cetera, we are particularly pleased with the bottom line results driven by our operations, leasing, acquisition and development teams.
Turning to the numbers. Overall property operating income grew at 7.9% over the prior year, even with the decline of 130 basis points of occupancy, reflecting the higher anchor rollovers we've discussed. Our core portfolio continued to be a significant driver of our COI growth. That core grew at 4.2% on a same-store basis, including redevelopment. This quarter, the downtime associated with anchor rollover produced about 130 basis points drag. We highlighted this trend the last 2 quarters. And as I will discuss further in guidance, we expect this rollover drag to continue this year. 
Our first phases of Assembly Row and Pike & Rose contributed approximately $4.5 million of POI in the quarter, up on a sequential basis, as the Pallas high-rise opening approached breakeven occupancy and office spaces continue to rent commence. Finally, our acquisitions of Coco and Sunset Place, which are performing very well against our acquisition underwriting, also contributed significantly to overall POI growth. 
G&A remains flat on a sequential basis at $8 million for the quarter and down year-over-year principally to higher transaction costs in 2015 with respect to our San Antonio Center acquisition. We do expect our G&A line item to grow as we continue to invest in our platform.
Interest expense declined $400,000, reflecting the lower average rate achieved through our refinancings during the year, offset by lower capitalized interest during the quarter as we continue to place development into service. 
Again, bottom line, FFO grew at 9.5% for the quarter, which is above our long-term plan. That absolute bottom line performance while we continue to invest in the future, is something we take great pride in. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we raised approximately $182 million of equity through an overnight as well as issuances under our ATM during the quarter at a collective weighted average price of $149.18. This represents over half of equity we planned to raise this year. 
We ended the quarter with $53 million drawn under our $600 million revolver, which we upsized after the quarter to $800 million and extended to 2020 while reducing our borrowing costs by 10 basis points. Our net debt to EBITDA was 5.3x, and our weighted average tenor was almost 10 years versus the peer average closer to 5, providing us maximum flexibility and liquidity to fund all the value creation that we have underway.
Turning to 2016, we affirm the previously given range of FFO per share of $5.65 to $5.71, a range of growth of approximately 6% to 7% or slightly below our long-term plan. As we discussed last quarter, this is a true range that will be impacted by several variables during the year. Again, the targeted box recapture and rollover vacancy drives a significant amount of drag in the year. That drag was offset this quarter by some positive timing items, which included marketing expense recoveries as well as higher year-over-year term fees of $600,000, as Don mentioned. Given that, we do expect same-store NOI will moderate in the second and third quarters of this year.
As Don discussed in his remarks, we're pleased to announce the signing of T.J. Maxx at Pentagon, The Dick's Sporting Goods lease at Melville and the L.A. Fitness lease at Del Mar, all of which, as he stated, will unlock significant value at these centers. Overall, our leasing team is making great progress under a captured box basis, which we will continue to report on over the coming quarters. 
In addition to this rollover, as discussed in prior quarters, there are several other investments in growth to consider from a timing perspective as you look at the year. First, our leasing pace at Pallas continues to go well with current occupancy for that building alone at just over 60% and expected stabilization occurring in the fourth quarter. The office space at Pike & Rose and Assembly, which represents approximately $80 million of investments, is fully committed and leased. And we'll start seeing the rent commencing throughout this year and early next as tenants take occupancy. 500 Santana Row, the Splunk Building, which represents approximately $115 million of investment, is of course 100% preleased and will deliver in the fourth quarter and rent commence in 2017. The Point redevelopment at Plaza El Segundo continues to perform exceptionally well and is expected to stabilize in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Our acquisition of our joint venture partner's 70% interest in 6 core assets is expected to be neutral this year after transaction costs in the sale of Courtyard Shops. We expect this acquisition to contribute approximately $0.02 to $0.03 in 2017.
We are well underway of the second phases of Pike & Rose and Assembly that represent another $600 million of investment and expect those phases to begin delivering in the latter part of '17 and early '18. 
From a capital standpoint, again, we expect to fund approximately $300 million of development and redevelopment with a mix of funds from operations, long-term debt and equity under our ATM, much of which we have taken care of in the first quarter. Finally, consistent with our practice, our guidance does not factor in any further acquisitions or dispositions that we may execute during the year. 
When you consider all that the company has going on, you will understand why I continue to emphasize that our guidance this year is a true range. In fact, factors that may drive us towards the low end of that range include: The timing of the anchor box backfill to rent commencement; the potential for additional rent concessions at Pallas as we lease penthouses in the upper floor; the opportunistic capital raise that we completed in the first quarter front ended a significant part of our capital needs for the year. The ultimate resolution of the Sports Authority, as Don discussed, while none of our locations have been on the initial closure list, we believe it is unlikely that The Sports Authority will continue as is and that we may have the opportunity to get some of those locations back.
We continue to invest in our platform, as Don mentioned, both in systems and people as we drive decision-making closer to the real estate. These efforts may drive an additional $1 million to $2 million of annual G&A above our current assumed run rate of $34 million to $35 million on an annual basis. Even with that growth, it's still far below 5% of revenues.
And finally, the costs associated with backfilling my position have not been determined or forecast. Again, each one of these items that influence where we will come out in the range is a positive for the company and its long-term growth prospects, but they may impact where we land.
Before turning the call over to questions, I'd like to briefly thank Don for his friendship, counsel and support, they have meant a great deal to me over the last 18 years and now as I turn to the opportunity at Brixmor. Thank you, Don. 
I would also like to thank my partners at Federal, who are the best in the business: Chris Weilminster; Dawn Becker; Jeff Berkes; Don Briggs; Jeff Mooallem; Wendy Seher; Debbie Colson; John T.; Deirdre [ph] ; Barry; and last, but certainty most, Melissa.

As you know, that first phase and the second phase has a significant residential component to it. The bottom line is, we were too aggressive in thinking what we were going to be able to get for residential rents. And the marketplace has an awful lot of supply on it, and the place is absolutely a construction zone and will be for some time. And so it's what I always worry about with -- when changing numbers like this is that there's a taint on the project itself, because there can't be. The project is going as well or better than we expected in terms of its acceptance, even in terms of its performance -- rent performance on the residential side, compared to the marketplace. It's just that the marketplace is significantly lower than we had hoped and thought it would be when we underwrote this. So it's all that. Now obviously, the good side of that is we're not locking into 15-year deals or 20-year deals. These are 12-month leases, but it would be -- it just wouldn't be right for me to have the same expectations of being able to lease up the rest of the buildings we have in Phase 1 and the residential building in Phase 2 at rents that when I look at it right now, when our team looks at it right now, we don't think we can hit. And that's what's causing that. I really don't want you to see that as a failure of the project. It's market timing."

The -- look, the bottom line is this company grew and has grown pretty darn consistently over the last 15 years in terms of its value, in terms of what it does for a living, in terms of its breadth and growth. The -- we had to effectively get management closer to the real estate because the real estate is so different. Managing at Pike & Rose and managing at Assembly Row and managing and having an opportunity like Sunset and Coco is just very different than the core shopping center business. So we needed to do, we needed to align management more closely with the real estate business. That's our business. We are really not a portfolio manager. We look at it asset by asset. Now when you do that, there's obviously going to be incremental overhead to be able to set it up that way. And that overhead is incremental, not only on the -- to use the hotel vernacular, front of the house stuff, but also back of the house, systems and reporting, accounting all of that. We're in the middle of that transition, and that transition takes some time. If you think about an incremental few million a year, basically, we got to more than make up for that in incremental value. Well, where would that incremental value come from? It comes in every part of our business, first and foremost, by getting to things more quickly, by getting tenants to -- through the process of leasing, to tenant coordinations, opening their doors to rent start. That's done a whole lot better if the leasing agent and the asset manager and the developer, tenant coordinator are all working together. There's a lot of that. Secondly, down at that level, we'll know our markets better. We do know our markets better and closer so that -- and I'll give a couple of examples. We're talking about Brick Township right now, Brick Plaza. Well, Brick is a great shopping center in Brick, New Jersey, that we've owned for a long time. Part of the reason that we haven't been able to get to doing a better job at Brick Plaza is because of the A&P lease, and we talk to that -- about that. But another part of the reason is because it's geographically further away. This helps us focus more on it. It helps us create business, and then -- I could say that about at least 20 or 25 shopping centers. So this is truly an evolution of our business. It's an investment in the next decade, where the combination of great products in terms of mixed-use development that we're doing with a more active and proactively managed core, together should make the few million dollars of incremental G&A nothing compared to the incremental value that we create. So that's what it is that we're trying to do."

One of those was assumed and is underway in terms of being built out on Long Island at Greenlawn, which leaves 3 more. Melville Mall also on the island and I did not mention -- when I talk about the good stuff that's happening at Melville Mall today with the signing of Dick's, for example, the last space that we have at Melville Mall is the former Waldbaum's box. We're making real good progress, but we are not a place where I can tell you it's a signed deal yet. And you'll like everything about that. The next one is at Brick where again it's part of a much, much bigger redevelopment and remerchandising of the entire center. And we're not as close as Melville, but making real good progress. We'll have something to say over the next couple of quarters there, I think. And the final one is Troy, which is in New Jersey. And we're hopeful -- I shouldn't say it exactly this way yet. I don't know whether we're going to backfill it or whether this is going to be a bigger redevelopment possibility there, which would include some residential and a more densely populated shopping center. Obviously, if it comes to something like that, which would add the most value, which I would love. There's a lot of work to do with respect to the community and figuring out if something like that is viable. That's what we're working on there. So that would be the last one of the 3 that you'll hear anything about I would think. Oh and then Santana, let's go to Santana. Oh yes, if Valley Fair does what they're doing and Jeff's on the phone, there'll absolutely be an impact. They're talking about adding hundreds of thousands of square feet in a great node at a great place that will perform a very different function than what we do. And I wouldn't think -- we're confident that it wouldn't have a long-term impact on the property. But if they are leasing up that much space for that period of time, that has to, I would think, impact us. I just don't know by how much yet, nothing in any significant way whether they actually -- they haven't started construction yet, where they will, when they will, what the timing is that still I just don't know the answer to that. But there would be an impact. I just can't quantify it for you today; again, a short-term impact."

It's not perfect, but if you go back far enough, you're going to capture enough of a subset of the portfolio to look at that. And again, we've owned these assets for a long period of time. So we have vintage leases rolling every year. There isn't, as far as I can tell, not a particular year in which we've got a lot of vintage closing coming to market, if you will.

So here are the five centers, Assembly Square, in the marketplace, right? So you know what's happening to that marketplace versus -- because of what we're doing in the mixed-use project adjacent to it. It's been a very positive thing. And certainly, the interest in that power center that's adjacent is significantly higher than it was before we built the project. So if we got that back, that would be okay, a good thing there. Brick Plaza is the next one, again, in the middle of a complete redo. The timing of that would be great in terms of the future of Brick Plaza. Crow Canyon, which is out on the West Coast and that's a smaller store out there. And the latest one that we did -- we did that some years back. But nonetheless, that was the last one, smaller in a center that we'd just redone, which is a good thing in terms of the demand characteristics that you would have. Montrose Crossing is the fourth. That's the one directly across from Pike & Rose. That's over 35 acres where the section of the shopping center where they are would be dramatically impacted to the extent we can better merchandise that. And the last one is East Bay Bridge out in Emeryville, which is -- which the rents in place there are extremely low, and the upside would be terrific. And that's another place that we just put in 2 new -- we've really remerchandised the shopping center. So as I sit back and I look at TSA, this is a good tenant to work through this portfolio, and it's a better thing in all of the locations that we have. But it's a lot of rent in the meantime.

Pike 7 is an amazing shopping center. Frankly, if sales were hit significantly during Pike 7, first of all, they would have happened during the construction of the Silver Line when basically all the entrances were closed and they didn't in any significant way. But if they were, then we'd had a lower hurdle to be able to do a larger mixed-use project at the site, which would be great. Having said that, your point, your bigger point, so stopping right there, look, Pike 7 is a great asset for us. What we do there long term will only be positive. And part of the issue is it's so successful for what it is right now. And therefore, the hurdle is so high to do something better, financially better there. So that's Pike 7. Now take the bigger premise and this, I think, is really important in terms of the judgment that we showed there. I think you're right. The way the Silver Line is working through Tysons, there are winners and there are losers. The type of projects that are being built there, there are winners, there are losers. We did not jump and say, oh God, we got to be the first one to market. We sat back. We renewed leases -- we have kick outs so that we were able to get the space if we needed to -- but we've created, with our discipline that, that particular asset has so inured to our benefit, that's only because we really ran it like a true real estate company would and real estate play and not like a drunken sailor with respect to development for Pete's sake, in terms of what it should be. So I want a little -- I guess I really want a little bit of credit for the discipline that we showed in not jumping to what the new Tysons is going to be. Because as you just point out, it takes a long time with a major infrastructure change like the Silver Line is to figure out what Tysons should be. Thanks so much.

Better than we expected of improved occupancy and strong collections effort and a ton leasing more than 100 deals and 467,000 feet of total square footage, all of which resulted in FFO per share of $1.42, nearly 7% [ph] better than last year's quarter and the highest quarterly result we've ever recorded. Remember, this is happening a time in our company when it were operations organization and adding a changing staff positions when we're building and stabilizing 2 major development initiatives that are in the throes of disruptive construction and a weak apartment rental market in D.C., when there's over $0.5 billion sitting on our balance sheet construction in progress that is not producing an income stream yet but certainly will be in some of the most sought after compelling product types in the country and some of the most sought-after real estate locations in the country. I'm really pleased with how our team is responding and the solid progress we're making. Our heads are down, and we're executing, and the long term looks as good as ever. And when you break down the components of that FFO quarter-over-quarter results, you'll see that it's broad-based. Top line revenue increase of over 9% and a property operating income increase of nearly 7.5% that had contributions from everywhere. Our contributions from the Sunset CocoWalk and Clarion joint venture acquisitions in for the full quarter, contributions from same-center growth beat our internal expectations at 3.5%, contributions from strong redevelopment results from The Point, from Bridge from Westgate, from Willow Lawn among others income contributions from Pike & Rose and Assembly Row of nearly $5 million up significantly over last year's quarter. lower interest expense despite higher borrowings continue to drive portfolio rate down and G&A that's well under control. Top to bottom, every piece of the business is contributing. And last month, as I'm sure you've heard, we've opportunistically access the 30-year unsecured by market at a spread of only 160 basis points over the 30-year treasury for a REIT record 3 5/8% coupon for 8.75% effective yield of $250 million. In effect, world economic dislocation and the quality both in real estate and credits like ours made the timing of that move really compelling. Now that money paid down the line completely with some leftover sitting for a few months so that yield is dilutive to earnings for the balance of the year by $0.03 to $0.04 per share, and we've adjusted our guidance by the low side of that amount in order to be prudent. But with current construction underway expected to return 300-plus basis points in excess of that money over the next couple of years, 30-year debt shortfall [indiscernible] 
Okay. A little more detail in the quarter and then off to the outlook. On a sequential quarter basis, the percentage of the entire portfolio that is leased ticked up to 94.5% at June 30 compared with 94.1% March 31. Melissa will talk about the Sports Authority in a few minutes but for purposes of occupancy and absent offsetting leasing, we would expect the 50 basis point hit by the end of the third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, leasing results for the quarter were strong. 91 comparable deals done for 373,000 feet of space at $38.21 a foot, 12% higher on a cash basis from the deals they replaced. That's up 17% on anchors, 10% on small shops. it's up 23% on new leases, 7% on renewals. A couple of the most consequential deals include an important merchandising upgrade at the power center portion of Assembly Square where Trader Joe's will replace more significantly higher rent beginning late in 2017 and should also help create even more tenant demand when the adjacent Sports Authority vacates later this year. Also, in the first couple of days in July, we were thrilled to complete the last piece of the puzzle for the leasing of the power center portion of Melville Mall in Long Island with an extremely well-regarded Italian specialty grocer called taking the former Melville Mall Fox at the higher rent. It's not a grocer that he would rather have been the deal with and these guys at this location on Long Island. Check out the website. I will set this along with the new Field & Stream deals and fixed deals in the last couple of quarters dis as transforming and with A&P out there, we're now actively working on adding additional for shops and restaurants, assuming we can get the entitlements. And so that's what we're working on. So stay tuned. By the way, I'm fresh off the trip to review the completion of 2 of our latest shopping center redevelopments, Tower Shops in Florida and Mercer Mall in New Jersey. I left thoroughly impressed with a real sense of pride in the transformation. Not only did they look great with full parking lots but consider this, total combined investment before redevelopment of those 2 shopping centers with $175 million producing property operating income of $14 million. Total combined investment after redevelopment was $215 million, $40 million more producing operating income of $21 million, $7 million more. Value creation at a simple 5 cap, both before and after redevelopment, so no assumed benefit from obvious cap rates and traction of $100 million over 4 years. Our ability to transform big profits like this, tower shop is 370,000 square feet, Mercer Mall 0.5 million square feet so one of the most important components of our business plan and one we are extremely proud. It's a good real estate and have a creative team that can also execute. On the big development side, no surprises, just continued execution at Assembly, Pike & Rose and Building 11 at building at Santana Row. A couple of points on each to consider.
At Assembly, Phase 1 done stabilized with every building at least 95% leased and occupied. Because of some free rent in the office tenants you have to burn off, income will continue to increase next year. Nearly 2,000 employees going to work each day at Healthcare as of today. Double that next year. Have already created higher shopping and restaurant traffic. Dust and noise are the players of the day is roughly 40% of the Phase 2 spend has been incurred and we remain on time and on budget. The office occupation that usage the Trader Joe's deals and the adjacent power center I talked about before, all these really show just how important this community has become through the north side of the city. By the way, check out the video featuring Assembly on reit.com. And as you would expect, it's also available on their website.
Good things happening at Pike & Rose to the pressure on residential rents throughout the market surely is Leasing pace, however, progressed as well with the big Pallas luxury tower now 84% leased and per se, the other residential building there remaining in the mid-80s. But our current pace of leasing, we expect to be stabilized occupancy by year-end as planned. Nike opens in the old City Sports base in a couple of weeks. And like at Assembly, nice and dust continue as about 1/3 of the Phase 2 construction budget has been spent. More than half of the retail spaces spoken for and the new Phase 2 at this point with tenants like Pinstripes, Porsche, H&M, Lucky, REI, Red Door Spots, Taylor Gourmet. The environment is shaping up as well or better than we what we had hoped. What we really could use here is a bit of firming on the price of the residential market, which is down 0.5 [ph] in [indiscernible] 
And on the West Coast, Splunk is expected to occupy the building by January, and the execution of this construction and buildout has been nearly flawless. We continue to see strength in Santana not only in terms of its desirability as an office location but also with respect to residential rents that continue to grow above our expectations. The tale of 2 cities by comparing Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. on the residential side.
In Florida, plans for our new Miami acquisitions, Sunset and CocoWalk, continue to progress well and are being vetted by our senior team partners. Decisions as a direction committee later this year at which point we'll what we have in mind. It is likely that will want to add office and residential components with some variation of these properties. In the meantime, we'll heavily focus on grassroots for the local communities and increasingly optimistic that we'll be able to the viable and value creative changes at both locations. At Sunset, we'll need zoning changes that permit more hype to come up with a viable plan, yet we would hope to start out of the retail renovation of the existing important sections of the project first.
On the acquisition front, we're working through a number of important deals and the pricing remains on We're not afraid to step up our play in the rate real estate. Nothing to report on this call but we're working hard and hope to have more talk in the next couple of calls. Jeff Berkes and I will be brief and engage Dan as one of his first orders of business.
I've asked Melissa to talk about The Sports Authority impact, our balance sheet activity, including yesterday's announced dividend hike for the record-setting 49th consecutive year. Big celebration for the [indiscernible] As well as our full year earnings expectations. And I am going to ask Dan G to introduce himself before we open up the line to your questions afterwards. But right now, Melissa."

First, all 5 of our spaces were occupied and rent-paying for June 30. But we said Montrose Crossing here in Rockville by value city furniture who have no downtime or lost rental at this one. With respect to the lease at Bridge and Emeryville California, Dick's Sporting Goods obtained designation rights for the lease, and we are currently in negotiations with this to take over the space. We'll know more on the next [ph] 60 days. The Crow Canyon was rejected as of July 1 and Assembly square marketplace vacant as of August 1. All outstanding ARs for these spaces was 100% reserved as of June 30. In total, we are losing 103,000 square feet of leased space, which results in a 50 basis point decline in occupancy that we will see in Q3. The spaces have a total base rent of $2.1 million or $20.50 per square foot, and we expect to be able to release these spaces at rents 10% to 20% higher. While we are in discussions with tenants for each of the spaces, final leases will, of course, take time. Typically a full year before new rent starts. For the rest of 2016, we expect these phases will impact FFO by approximately $0.02 and of course, be a drag to our Q3 and Q4 same-center metric. Enough about Sports Authority. Yesterday, we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share to a quarterly rate of $0.98 and an annual indicative rate of $3.92 per share. This is our 49th year consecutive increases the longest in the REIT sector and one of the longest for all public companies. While we talked a lot about it, this is something we couldn't be more proud of to be able to pay our shareholders more every year for almost half a century is pretty awesome.
Now turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we issued $59 million of equity on our ATM at a weighted average price of $156.24 per share, bringing our year-to-date ATM issuances to $92 million. In July, we opportunistically issued $250 million of 30-year senior unsecured debt at a coupon of 3.625% at an effective rate of 3.75%. We ended the quarter with 18% debt to market cap, net debt to EBITDA of 5.2x and a weighted average tenor of our debt of over 11 years after reflecting the July offering. This week lots of flexibility with respect to the balance sheet and locking in these historically low rates will benefit our company for a long time to come. From a capital standpoint, we expect to incur about $250 million in development and redevelopment spend in the second half of 2016 as both Phase 2s at Assembly Row and Pike & Rose are fully under construction. The cost will be funded with the remaining proceeds from the July bond offering, equity under our ATM and a line of credit, all with an eye towards maintaining net debt to EBITDA in the low to mid-5 range. significant acquisitions, we do not plan to issue additional long-term debt in 2016.
Now turning to guidance. We have adjusted our guidance range to reflect the incremental interest expense from the July bond offering. We have not anticipated accessing the long-term debt market until late in 2016 or early 2017 and consequently, had assumed funding on our line of credit. The impact is $0.03 to $0.04, and our updated FFO per diluted share guidance range adjusted the low end of that to a range of 5 62 to 5 68. A few additional items to note about our guidance range as well as items having an outside impact in the second half of '16 compared to the first half. First, consistent with our past practice, our guidance range does not include any future acquisition or disposition. The range includes the loss of the 3 Sports Authority spaces I discussed earlier, which is a drag of approximately $0.02 per share. We will have additional compensation cost associated with our new CFO of approximately a $0.015 in the second half of 2016. We still expect statements including the development for the year to be in the 3% area. Given our year-to-date metric as of 6/30 with 3.8%, we do expect some deceleration in the second half of the year as we feel the impact of the Sports Authority vacancies and rollover timing and expected more normalized levels of bad debt expense. We expect this to be concentrated more in Q3 as we will see additional rent starts late in the year for anchor tenants like Congressional, TJ Maxx at Pentagon Row and Golden Stream at Melville 
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dan to introduce himself before we open up the call to your questions. Dan?"

So this is something that's been out there for a while, and we think ultimately going to come to bear over the next few years. And from our perspective, we're doing what we do, which is being very aggressive about merchandising the street, making Santana a great place to come, the addition of the Splunk building with 670 more parking spaces, redoing some of the common areas, all that kind of stuff year and then thinking about the other parcels we have left to develop and how those are going to be developed out, and all of that is being rolled into our thinking. And maintaining Santana's uniqueness in the marketplace is a great place to come and spend time and meet friends and ease out and shop and live and work. And all that kind of stuff and so far everything has gone very, very well. we do expect some headwind, of course, 1 Valley Fair starts the expansion. That's going to be a little bit of a dogfight for a few years. But long term, we're not concerned about it. As it relates to city place, I don't know. There's still a lot to be written on that development. I would never bet against related, but they've got a long ways to go there. And geographically, it's a little bit difficult to figure out how that intercepts a lot of our primary shopping traffic. So more space in the market always affects everybody, and they're putting a lot of space into the market. But again long term, we're not overly concerned about that. Sanford has a huge benefit."

Our whole strategy and gross relates to not only the experience we provide people to come here to shop and also tenants say, same look, if it's your 400th store, you should probably be at Valley Fair. If it's your 10th, 20th or 50th story, you're very sensitive about the image you project your customer base, Santana's been very successful over the last 2 years bringing in some really great mergers like Kate Spade and Madewell and and the list goes on and on.

One will be part of that property that is the best functioning part of the property today needs to be fixed up. There will be effectively a innovation to create a good shopping center there. The second part of the property will -- in order to do what the real estate needs, needs to go vertical. We'll need entitlement changes to do that. The question will be due we do the first part without the entitlement for the second part. That, we're not sure about yet. In fact, we're leaning towards no until we know that we can get the entitlement to make the whole thing makes sense. That's why there's been -- I've been less forthcoming with respect to our plans.

Sure, Alex. And I think [indiscernible] painted with a broad brush, which I think everybody understands and probably expects, but I think things are a little bit different may be in San Francisco than they are in Silicon Valley right now particularly on the apartment side where there's a lot of product coming online in San Francisco. And when you think about what it costs to build a condo or an apartment in San Francisco, you got to get a pretty high sales price or pretty high rent some of those the stuff that's coming online is targeting the same customer, and there's definitely some softness up there from what we've seen and heard, both in condo sales prices and apartment rents, some concessions creeping back into the market. Down in the valley, I think it's probably a little bit different. Like in Don's comments, we're doing better on our rental increases that are apartment in Santana Row than we expected to be doing this time of the year as part of the cycle. And I think that goes to a couple of things, of course. One is supply and there's a little bit of the supply at the moment we'll see how long that continues but also job growth. And I think that's different between San Francisco and the valley as well. Things might be a little bit more choppy in San Francisco as it relates to that. Down here in Silicon Valley, they're very, very healthy. We look at job growth closely, and we're still seeing not only a lot of jobs being added, but the big Q of unskilled jobs at most of the major players. Now you're at subfrictional unemployment rates right now in both San Francisco and Silicon Valley, and there's a lot of competition still from the big firms to hire the right people. And the big firms here are still very, very profitable and they have a ton of cash on their balance sheets, and they're growing. And while that may not be at the same pace that it was a year or so ago, it still extremely strong from a historical perspective. So we're really bullish in Silicon Valley right now. Always cautious, as you know, but very bullish I think what you're hearing is more broadbrush effective than what we're seeing in our product."

The reality is similar to what you've seen on the East Coast. There is various -- the supply, it's around, particularly on the office side, is not necessarily what employers are looking for. So you see vacancy, you see ""softness"" in product that is in some respects not leasable. And what has happened at Santana, while there is no question in my mind that we will be under pressure in terms of the rents that we'll get on retail because of the Valley Fair expansion, because of any kind of expansion when you have that much space over the next few years. The place itself is so solidified and is so good at what it is that we do benefit big time on both the residential and on the office. Now at the end of that street, we're going to have to finish up one of these days, and we're working through an office plan for the end of that street with the retail on the ground floor and we're all busy boosted by the success that we've had with respect to Splunk. Now I'm not ready to announce that or to talk about that. But given the environment, all the comments you just heard from Jeff, we're going to have -- there's going to be support around here to add incremental office and retail space to small amount of retail restaurant primarily space to Santana Row that captures what it is that we've done.

You can't assume it is. It's not like a restaurant. [indiscernible] Not as much as LEGOLAND this kind of notion. It's not like a restaurant that gains in popularity all the way through.

The question is does it settle into a place with because it's a big draw from a large area where it is always something that people continue to go to once a month or one -- at first, they'll go a lot. And then over time, they go less. What we've seen there is the first was a huge opening, and that was so validating to the property that it was critical, and they have settled. And they've settled down at a number from the beginning in a place though that still works really, really well. Now what will be interesting to see us from this point, do they grow slowly like other retailers from here? Did they reprogram the space with different attractions and things like that? How does that work out? That's what we expect to happen. But the level that they're doing today is pretty darn impressive albeit not what it was when it opened up."

As most of you know, Dan joined us from Vornado where he served as Senior Vice President, Capital Markets and Acquisitions. He will have those roles here, too, in addition to oversight of accounting reporting and investor relations. He's going to do great here and play an important partnership role on executive committee, on investment committee and day-to-day interactions. Dan came in for the board meeting earlier this weekend and is here with us today on the call. We'll even make him available to answer your questions. He will be on full-time later this month and can be reached at Rockville extension 8232. Welcome, Dan.
Now the quarter. This is a really good one. Better than we expected with improved occupancy and strong collections effort and a ton of leasing more than 100 deals and 467,000 feet of total square footage, all of which resulted in FFO per share of $1.42, nearly 7% better than last year's quarter and the highest quarterly result we've ever recorded. Remember, this is happening at a transitional time in our company when we're realigning our operations organization and adding and changing staff positions. When we're building and stabilizing 2 major development initiatives that are in the throes of disruptive construction and a weak apartment rental market in D.C. When there's over $0.5 billion sitting on our balance sheet construction in progress that is not producing an income stream yet but certainly will be. And some of the most sought after compelling product types in the country. And some of the most sought-after real estate locations in the country. I'm really pleased with how our team is responding and the solid progress we're making. Our heads are down, and we're executing, and the long term looks as good as ever. And when you break down the components of that FFO quarter-over-quarter results, you'll see that it's broad-based. Top line revenue increase of over 9% and a property operating income increase of nearly 7.5% that had contributions from everywhere. Our contributions from the Sunset CocoWalk and Clarion joint venture acquisitions in for the full quarter, contributions from same-center growth that beat our internal expectations at 3.5%. Contributions from strong redevelopment results from The Point, from East Bay Bridge, from Westgate, from Willow Lawn among others. Income contributions from Pike & Rose and Assembly Row of nearly $5 million up significantly over last year's quarter. Marginally low interest expense despite higher borrowings as we continue to drive portfolio rate down and G&A that's well under control. Top to bottom, every piece of the business is contributing. And last month, as I'm sure you've heard, we've opportunistically accessed the 30-year unsecured bond market at a spread of only 160 basis points over the 30-year treasury for a REIT record setting 3 5/8% coupon, 3.75% effective yield on $250 million. In effect, world economic dislocation and a flight-to-quality, both in real estate and to credits like ours made the timing of that move really compelling. Now that money paid down the line completely with some leftover and sitting on bank for few months. So that yield is dilutive to earnings for the balance of the year by $0.03 to $0.04 per share. And we've adjusted our guidance by the low side of that amount in order to be prudent. But with current construction underway expected to return 300-plus basis points in excess of that money over the next couple of years, 30-year debt shortfall like a good call.
Okay. A little more detail on the quarter and now on to the outlook. On a sequential quarter basis, the percentage of the entire portfolio that is leased ticked up to 94.5% at June 30 compared with 94.1% at March 31. Melissa will talk about the Sports Authority in a few minutes, but for purposes of occupancy and absent offsetting leasing, we would expect the 50 basis point hit by the end of the third quarter.
As I mentioned earlier, leasing results for the quarter were strong. 91 comparable deals done for 373,000 feet of space at $38.21 a foot, 12% higher on a cash basis from the deals they replaced. That's up 17% on anchors, 10% on small shops. it's up 23% on new leases, 7% on renewals. A couple of the most consequential deals includes an important merchandising upgrade at the power center portion of Assembly Square where Trader Joe's will replace A.C. Moore, significantly higher rent beginning late in 2017 and should also help create even more tenant demand when the adjacent Sports Authority vacates later this year. 
Also, in the first couple of days in July, we were thrilled to complete the last piece of the puzzle for the leasing of the power center portion of Melville Mall on Long Island with an extremely well-regarded Italian specialty grocer called Uncle Giuseppe's, taking the former Waldbaum’s in Fox at a higher rent. It's not a grocer that he would have rather done a deal with and these guys at this location on Long Island. Check out the website.
I'm going to set these along with the new Field & Stream deals and fixed deals over the past couple of quarters is transforming this profit. And with A&P out of there, we're now actively working on adding additional GLA for shops and restaurants, assuming we can get the Entitlements. And that's what we're working on. So stay tuned. By the way, I'm fresh off the trip to review the completion of 2 of our latest shopping center redevelopments, Tower Shops in Florida and Mercer Mall in New Jersey. I left thoroughly impressed with a real sense of pride in the transformation. Not only did they look great with full parking lots but consider this, total combined investment before redevelopment of those 2 shopping centers with $175 million producing property operating income of $14 million. Total combined investment after redevelopment was $215 million, $40 million more producing operating income of $21 million, $7 million more. Value creation at a simple 5 cap, both before and after redevelopment, so no assumed benefit from obvious cap rate contraction of $100 million over 4 years. Our ability to transform big profits like this, Tower Shops is 370,000 square feet, Mercer Mall 0.5 million square feet. It's one of the most important components of our business plan and one we are extremely proud of. It's good to own great real estate and have a creative team that can also execute. On the big development side, no surprises, just continued execution at Assembly, Pike & Rose and Building 11 as a smart building at Santana Row. A couple of points on each for you to consider.
At Assembly, Phase 1 done stabilized with every building at least 95% leased and occupied. Because of some free rent in the office tenants you have to burn off, income will continue to increase next year. Nearly 2,000 employees going to work each day at Partners Healthcare as of today, double that next year, have already created higher shopping and restaurant traffic. Our Dust and Noise are the players of the day with roughly 40% of the Phase 2 spend has been incurred, and we remain on time and on budget. The office occupation, the T-stop usage, the Trader Joe's deals from the adjacent power center, I talked about before, all these really show just how important this community has become through the north side of the city. By the way, check out the video narrated featuring Assembly on reit.com and, as you would expect, it's also available on our website.
Good things happening at Pike & Rose, too, but the pressure on residential rents throughout the market surely isn't subsiding. Leasing pace, however, progressed as well with the big Pallas luxury tower now 84% leased and per se, the other residential building there remaining in the mid-90s. With our current pace of leasing, we expect to be at stabilized occupancy by year-end as planned. Nike opens in the old City Sports base in a couple of weeks. And like at Assembly, Noise and Dust continue as about 1/3 of the Phase 2 construction budget has been spent. More than half of the retail spaces spoken for in the new Phase 2 at this point with tenants like Pinstripes, Porsche, H&M, Lucky, REI, Red Door Spots, [indiscernible], Taylor Gourmet. The environment is shaping up as well or better than we what we had hoped. What we really could use here is a bit of firming on the pricing in the residential market, which is down to half in [indiscernible].
And on the West Coast, Splunk is expected to occupy the building by January, and the execution of this construction and build-out has been nearly flawless. We continue to see strength in Santana not only in terms of its desirability as an office location but also with respect to residential rents that continue to grow above our expectations. The tale of 2 cities when comparing Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. on the residential side.
In Florida, plans for our new Miami acquisitions, Sunset Place and CocoWalk, continue to progress well and are being vetted by our senior team partners. Decisions as a direction in initial phases should join investment committee later this year, at which point we'll have what we have in mind. It is likely that we want to add office and residential components in some variation at these properties. In the meantime, we're heavily focused on grassroots engaging with the local communities and are increasingly optimistic that we'll be able to the afford viable and value creative changes at both locations. At Sunset, we'll need zoning changes that permit more hype to come up with a viable plan, yet we would hope to start out with a retail renovation of the existing important sections of the project first, fingers crossed, let's see.
On the acquisition front, we're working through a number of important deals and the pricing remains uncomfortably rich. We're not afraid to step up the play for the right real estate. Nothing to report on this call, but we're working hard and hope to have more talk over the next couple of calls. Jeff Berkes and I will be brief and engage Dan as one of his first orders of business.
I've asked Melissa to talk about The Sports Authority impact, our balance sheet activity, including yesterday's announced dividend hike for the record-setting 49th consecutive year. Big celebration for 50th next, as well as our full year earnings expectations. And I am going to ask Dan G to introduce himself before we open up the line to your questions afterwards. But right now, Melissa."

We'll start with an update on Sports Authority. First, all 5 of our spaces were occupied and rent-paying through June 30. But we said Montrose Crossing here in Rockville, Maryland was assumed by Value City Furnitur",828,"Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. We'll start with an update on Sports Authority. First, all 5 of our spaces were occupied and rent-paying through June 30. But we said Montrose Crossing here in Rockville, Maryland was assumed by Value City Furniture, who have no downtime or lost rental on this one.
With respect to the lease at East Bay Bridge and Emeryville, California, Dick's Sporting Goods obtained designation rights for the lease. And we are currently in negotiations with Dick's to take over the space. We'll know more on the this within the next 60 days. So we saw Crow Canyon was rejected effective July 1 with Brick Plaza and Assembly Square marketplace vacant as of August 1.
All outstanding ARs for these spaces was 100% reserved as of June 30. In total, we are losing 103,000 square feet of leased space, which results in a 50 basis point decline in occupancy that we will see in Q3. The spaces have a total base rent of $2.1 million or $20.50 per square foot. And we expect to be able to release these spaces at rents 10% to 20% higher. While we are in discussions with tenants for each of the spaces, final leases will, of course, take time. Typically a full year before new rent starts. For the rest of 2016, we expect these 3 spaces will impact FFO by approximately $0.02 and of course, be a drag to our Q3 and Q4 same-center metric.
Enough about Sports Authority. Yesterday, we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share to a quarterly rate of $0.98 and an annual indicative rate of $3.92 per share. This is our 49th year consecutive increases, the longest in the REIT sector and one of the longest for all public companies. While we talked a lot about it, this is something we couldn't be more proud of to be able to pay our shareholders more every year for almost half a century is pretty awesome.
Now turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we issued $59 million of equity on our ATM at a weighted average price of $156.24 per share, bringing our year-to-date ATM issuances to 92 million. In July, we opportunistically issued $250 million of 30-year senior unsecured debt at a coupon of 3.625% at an effective rate of 3.75%. We ended the quarter with 18% debt to market cap, net debt to EBITDA of 5.2x and a weighted average tenor of our debt of over 11 years after reflecting the July offering. This leaves us lots of flexibility with respect to the balance sheet and locking in these historically low rates will benefit our company for a long time to come. 
From a capital standpoint, we expect to incur about $250 million in development and redevelopment spend in the second half of 2016 as both Phase 2s at Assembly Row and Pike & Rose are fully under construction. The cost will be funded with the remaining proceeds from the July bond offering, equity under our ATM and a line of credit, all with an eye towards maintaining net debt to EBITDA in the low to mid-5 range. Absent a significant acquisition, we do not plan to issue additional long-term debt in 2016.
Now turning to guidance. We have adjusted our guidance range to reflect the incremental interest expense from the July bond offering. We have not anticipated accessing the long-term debt market until late in 2016 or early 2017 and consequently, had assumed funding on our line of credit. The impact is $0.03 to $0.04, and our updated FFO per diluted share guidance range adjusted the low end of that to a range of $5.62 to $5.68. A few additional items to note about our guidance range as well as items having an outside impact in the second half of '16 compared to the first half. First, consistent with our past practice, our guidance range does not include any future acquisitions or dispositions. The range includes the loss of the 3 Sports Authority spaces I discussed earlier, which is a drag of approximately $0.02 per share. We will have additional compensation cost associated with our new CFO of approximately $0.015 in the second half of 2016. We still expect same-center, including redevelopment, for the year to be in the 3% area. Given our year-to-date metric as of 6/30 was 3.8%, we do expect some deceleration in the second half of the year as we feel the impact of the Sports Authority vacancies anchor rollover timing and expected more normalized levels of bad debt expense. We expect this to be concentrated more in Q3 as we will see additional rent starts late in the year for anchor tenants like Sakhs at Congressional, TJ Maxx at Pentagon Row and Golden Stream at Melville.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dan to introduce himself before we open up the call to your questions. Dan?"

[ph] And then thinking about the other parcels we have left to develop and how those are going to get developed out, all of that is being rolled into our thinking. And maintaining Santana's uniqueness in the marketplace is a great place to come and spend time and meet friends and ease out and shop and live and work and all that kind of stuff. And -- so far, everything has gone very, very well. We do expect some headwinds, of course, when Valley Fair starts the expansion. That's going to be a little bit of a dogfight for a few years. But long term, we're not concerned about it. As it relates to city place, I don't know. There's still a lot to be written on that development. I would never bet against related, but they've got a long ways to go there. And geographically, it's a little bit difficult to figure out how that intercepts a lot of our primary shopping traffic.

And I think that's somewhat consistent depending on the market and the asset over the last year or so, but I think things have strengthened in the last half year."

Sure, Alex. And I think bay area get painted with a broad brush, which I think everybody understands and probably expects, but I think things are a little bit different may be in San Francisco than they are in Silicon Valley right now, particularly on the apartment side where there's a lot of product coming online in San Francisco. And when you think about what it costs to build a condo or an apartment in San Francisco, you got to get a pretty high sales price or pretty high rent. So most of the stuff is coming online is targeting the same customer, and there's definitely some softness up there from what we've seen and heard, both in condo sales prices and in apartment rents, some concessions creeping back into the market. Down in the valley, I think it's probably a little bit different. I mean, like Don's said in his comments, we're doing better on our rental increases there are apartments here in Santana Row than we expected to be doing this time of the year as part of the cycle. And I think that goes to a couple of things, of course. One is supply and there's a little bit of a supply [indiscernible] at the moment, we'll see how long that continues but also job growth. And I think that's different between San Francisco and the valley as well. Things might be a little bit more choppy in San Francisco as it relates to that. Down here in Silicon Valley, they're very, very healthy. We look at job growth closely, and we're still seeing not only a lot of jobs being added, but in big Q of unskilled jobs at most of the major employers. Now you're at subfrictional unemployment rates right now in both San Francisco and Silicon Valley, and there's a lot of competition still from the big firms to hire the right people. And the big firms here are still very, very profitable and they have a ton of cash on their balance sheets, and they're growing. And while that may not be at the same pace that it was a year or so ago, it still extremely strong from a historical perspective. So we're really bullish on Silicon Valley right now. Always cautious, as you know, but very bullish and I think what you're hearing is more broadbrush effect than what we're seeing in our product."

So you see vacancy, you see ""softness"" in the product that is in some respects not leasable. And what has happened at Santana, while there is no question in my mind that we will be under pressure in terms of the rents that we'll get on retail because of the Valley Fair expansion, because of any kind of expansion when you have that much space over the next few years. The place itself is so solidified and is so good at what it is that we do benefit big time on both the residential and on the office. Now at the end of that street, we're going to have to finish up one of these days, and we're working through an office plan for the end of that street with the retail on the ground floor and we are obviously boosted by the success that we've had with respect to Splunk. Now I'm not ready to announce that or to talk about that. But given the environment, all the comments you just heard from Jeff, we're going to have -- there's going to be support around here to add incremental office and retail space to small amount of retail restaurant primarily space to Santana Row that captures what it is that we've done.

There is no doubt and I agree with the basic concept with experiential tenants, particularly, that, first of all, you know as soon as they open whether there is something that resonates or it doesn't. And LEGOLAND resonates in a big way. But the challenge then is to say, ""Well, okay. Is that the level of business that they're going to maintain throughout their leased life?"" You can't assume it is. It's not like a restaurant. [indiscernible] at least we found and as much as LEGOLAND is, this kind of notion. It's not like a restaurant that gains in popularity all the way through. And it's a lot of small visits that continues to happen. The question is does it settle into a place with because if it's big draw from a large area where it is always something that people continue to go to once a month or one a -- at first, they'll go a lot. And then over time, they go less. What we've seen there is, first of all, a huge opening, and that was so validating through the property that was critical, and they have settled. And they've settled down at a number from the beginning in a place though that still works really, really well. Now what will be interesting to see is from this point, do they grow slowly like other retailers from here? Do they reprogram the space with different attractions and things like that? How does that work out? That's what we expect to happen. But the level that they're doing today is pretty darn impressive albeit not what it was when it opened up."

We got all the same program as the [indiscernible] I mean the [indiscernible] towards besides [indiscernible] and so that those constituents coming in change to Assembly to drive traffic to every other use we have there. So there is the business answer, and think that will drive growth, but there was also a very defined purpose as to why we did it, which was creating a use and then -- that attracted a regional draw. There, if you talk to them it dropped from about 120-mile radius. We see field-trip buses there all the time. And I've got 3 kids, I remember when they were younger the same destination at the point in time [indiscernible] local for birthday parties. I think I probably went there 30 times or [indiscernible] times. I just think that Lego is also serving that same purpose of families and bringing that recognition.

I want to be the first to publicly welcome new CFO, Dan Guglielmone, best to just call him Dan G, to the Federal Realty senior team. As most of you know, Dan joined us from Vornado where he served as Senior Vice President, Capital Markets and Acquisitions. He will have those roles here, too, in addition to oversight of accounting reporting and investor relations. He's going to do great here and play an important partnership role on executive committee, on investment committee and day-to-day interactions. Dan came in for the board meeting earlier this week and is here with us today on the call. We'll even make him available to answer your questions. He will be on full-time later this month and can be reached in Rockville at extension 8232. Welcome, Dan.
Now the quarter. It was a really good one. Better than we expected with improved occupancy, a strong collections effort and a ton of leasing more than 100 deals and 467,000 feet of total square footage, all of which resulted in FFO per share of $1.42, nearly 7% better than last year's quarter and the highest quarterly result we've ever recorded. Remember, this is happening at a transitional time in our company when we're realigning our operations organization and adding and changing staff positions. When we're building and stabilizing 2 major development initiatives that are in the throes of disruptive construction and a weak apartment rental market in D.C. When there's over $0.5 billion sitting on our balance sheet, construction in progress, that is not producing an income stream yet but certainly will be. And some of the most sought after compelling product types in the country. And some of the most sought-after real estate locations in the country. I'm really pleased with how our team is responding and the solid progress we're making. Our heads are down, and we're executing, and the long term looks as good as ever. And when you break down the components of that FFO quarter-over-quarter results, you'll see that it's broad-based. Top line revenue increase of over 9% and a property operating income increase of nearly 7.5% that had contributions from everywhere. It had contributions from the Sunset CocoWalk and Clarion joint venture acquisitions in for the full quarter, contributions from same-center growth that beat our internal expectations at 3.5%. Contributions from strong redevelopment results from The Point, from East Bay Bridge, from Westgate, from Willow Lawn among others. Income contributions from Pike & Rose and Assembly Row of nearly $5 million, up significantly over last year's quarter. Marginally lower interest expense despite higher borrowings as we continue to drive portfolio rate down. And G&A that's well under control. Top to bottom, every piece of the business is contributing. And last month, as I'm sure you've heard, we've opportunistically accessed the 30-year unsecured bond market at a spread of only 160 basis points over the 30-year treasury for a REIT record setting 3 5/8% coupon, 3.75% effective yield on $250 million. In effect, world economic dislocation and a flight-to-quality, both in real estate and to credits like ours made the timing of that move really compelling. Now that money paid down the line completely with some leftover and sitting in the bank for few months. So that yield is dilutive to earnings for the balance of the year by $0.03 to $0.04 per share. And we've adjusted our guidance by the low side of that amount in order to be prudent. But with current construction underway expected to return 300-plus basis points in excess of that money over the next couple of years, 30-year debt sure felt like a good call.
Okay. A little more detail on the quarter and now on to the outlook. On a sequential quarter basis, the percentage of the entire portfolio that is leased ticked up to 94.5% at June 30 compared with 94.1% at March 31. Melissa will talk about Sports Authority in a few minutes, but for purposes of occupancy and absent offsetting leasing, we would expect a 50 basis point hit by the end of the third quarter.
As I mentioned earlier, leasing results for the quarter were strong. 91 comparable deals done for 373,000 feet of space at $38.21 a foot, 12% higher on a cash basis from the deals they replaced. That's up 17% on anchors, 10% on small shops. it's up 23% on new leases, 7% on renewals. A couple of the most consequential deals include an important merchandising upgrade at the power center portion of Assembly Square where Trader Joe's will replace A.C. Moore at significantly higher rent beginning late in 2017 and should also help create even more tenant demand when the adjacent Sports Authority vacates later this year. 
Also, in the first couple of days in July, we were thrilled to complete the last piece of the puzzle for the leasing of the power center portion of Melville Mall on Long Island with an extremely well-regarded Italian specialty grocer called Uncle Giuseppe's, taking the former Waldbaum’s box at a higher rent. There's not a grocer that he would rather have done a deal with than these guys at this location on Long Island. Check out their website.
Uncle Giuseppe's along with the new Field & Stream deals and Dick's deals over the past couple of quarters is transforming this property. And with A&P out of there, we're now actively working on adding additional GLA for shops and restaurants, assuming we can get the entitlements. That's what we're working on, so stay tuned. By the way, I'm fresh off a trip to review the completion of 2 of our latest shopping center redevelopments, Tower Shops in Florida and Mercer Mall in New Jersey. I left thoroughly impressed with a real sense of pride in the transformation. Not only did they look great with full parking lots but consider this, total combined investment before redevelopment of those 2 shopping centers with $175 million producing property operating income of $14 million. Total combined investment after redevelopment was $215 million, $40 million more, producing operating income of $21 million, $7 million more. Value creation at a simple 5 cap, both before and after redevelopment, so no assumed benefit from obvious cap rate contraction of $100 million over 4 years. Our ability to transform big properties like this -- Tower Shops is 370,000 square feet, Mercer Mall 0.5 million square feet -- is one of the most important components of our business plan and one we are extremely proud of. It's good to own great real estate and have a creative team that can also execute. On the big development side, no surprises, just continued execution at Assembly, Pike & Rose and building 11 (that's the Splunk building) at Santana Row. A couple of points on each for you to consider.
At Assembly, Phase 1 done, stabilized with every building at least 95% leased and occupied. Because of some free rent in the office tenants you have to burn off, income will continue to increase next year. Nearly 2,000 employees going to work each day at Partners HealthCare as of today -- double that next year -- have already created higher shopping and restaurant traffic. Dust and noise are the players of the day as roughly 40% of the Phase 2 spend has been incurred, and we remain on time and on budget. The office occupation, the T-stop usage, the Trader Joe's deals in the adjacent power center I talked about before, all these really show just how important this community has become for the north side of the city. By the way, check out the video that NAREIT did featuring Assembly on reit.com, and, as you would expect, it's also available on our website.
Good things happening at Pike & Rose, too, though the pressure on residential rents throughout the market surely isn't subsiding. Leasing pace, however, progressed as well with the big Pallas luxury tower now 84% leased and per se, the other residential building there, remaining in the mid-90s. With our current pace of leasing, we expect to be at stabilized occupancy by year-end as planned. Nike opens in the old City Sports space in a couple of weeks. And like at Assembly, noise and dust continue as about 1/3 of the Phase 2 construction budget has been spent. More than half of the retail spaces spoken for in the new Phase 2 at this point with tenants like Pinstripes, Porsche, H&M, Lucky, REI, Red Door Spa, [indiscernible], Taylor Gourmet. The environment is shaping up as well or better than we what we had hoped. What we really could use here is a bit of firming on the pricing in the residential market, which is bound to happen sooner or later.
And on the West Coast, Splunk is expected to occupy the building by January, and the execution of this construction and build-out has been nearly flawless. We continue to see strength in Santana not only in terms of its desirability as an office location but also with respect to residential rents that continue to grow above our expectations. It's a tale of two cities when comparing Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. on the residential side.
In Florida, plans for our new Miami acquisitions, Sunset Place and CocoWalk, continue to progress well and are being vetted by our senior team and partners. Decisions as a to direction in initial phases should go on to our investment committee later this year, at which point we'll layout what we have in mind. It is likely that we want to add office and residential components in some variation at these properties. In the meantime, we're heavily focused on grassroots engagement with the local communities and are increasingly optimistic that we'll be able to work toward viable and value creative changes at both locations. At Sunset, we'll need zoning changes that permit more heighth to come up with a viable plan, yet we would hope to start out with a retail renovation of the existing important sections of the project first. Fingers crossed, we'll see.
On the acquisition front, we're working through a number of important deals and though pricing remains uncomfortably rich, we're not afraid to step up the play for the right real estate. Nothing to report on this call, but we're working hard and hope to have more talk over the next couple of calls. Jeff Berkes and I will be brief and engage Dan as one of his first orders of business.
I've asked Melissa to talk about the Sports Authority impact, our balance sheet activity, including yesterday's announced dividend hike for the record-setting 49th consecutive year (big celebration for 50th next) as well as our full year earnings expectations. And I am going to ask Dan G. to introduce himself before we open up the line to your questions afterwards. But right now, Melissa."

We'll start with an update on Sports Authority. First, all 5 of our spaces were occupied and rent-paying through June 30. The lease at Montrose Crossing here in Rockville, Maryland, was assumed by Value City Furnit",832,"Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. We'll start with an update on Sports Authority. First, all 5 of our spaces were occupied and rent-paying through June 30. The lease at Montrose Crossing here in Rockville, Maryland, was assumed by Value City Furniture -- we'll have no downtime or lost rent on this one.
With respect to the lease at East Bay Bridge in Emeryville, California, Dick's Sporting Goods obtained designation rights for the lease. And we are currently in negotiations with Dick's to take over the space. We'll know more on the this one in the next 60 days. The lease at Crow Canyon was rejected effective July 1 with Brick Plaza and Assembly Square marketplace vacant as of August 1.
All outstanding AR for these spaces was 100% reserved as of June 30. In total, we are losing 103,000 square feet of leased space, which results in a 50 basis point decline in occupancy that we will see in Q3. The spaces have a total base rent of $2.1 million or $20.50 per square foot. And we expect to be able to re-lease these spaces at rents 10% to 20% higher. Though we are in discussions with tenants for each of the spaces, final leases will, of course, take time. Typically a full year before new rent starts. For the rest of 2016, we expect these 3 spaces will impact FFO by approximately $0.02 and of course, be a drag to our Q3 and Q4 same-center metrics.
Enough about Sports Authority. Yesterday, we announced an increase to our quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share to a quarterly rate of $0.98 and an annual indicative rate of $3.92 per share. This is our 49th year of consecutive increases, the longest in the REIT sector and one of the longest for all public companies. While we talk a lot about it, this is something we couldn't be more proud of to be able to pay our shareholders more every year for almost half a century is pretty awesome.
Now turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we issued $59 million of equity on our ATM at a weighted average price of $156.24 per share, bringing our year-to-date ATM issuances to 92 million. In July, we opportunistically issued $250 million of 30-year senior unsecured debt at a coupon of 3.625% at an effective rate of 3.75%. We ended the quarter with 18% debt to market cap, net debt to EBITDA of 5.2x and a weighted average tenor of our debt of over 11 years after reflecting the July offering. This leaves us lots of flexibility with respect to the balance sheet and locking in these historically low rates will benefit our company for a long time to come. 
From a capital standpoint, we expect to incur about $250 million in development and redevelopment spend in the second half of 2016 as both Phase 2s at Assembly Row and Pike & Rose are fully under construction. The cost will be funded with the remaining proceeds from the July bond offering, equity under our ATM and a line of credit, all with an eye towards maintaining net debt to EBITDA in the low to mid-5 range. Absent a significant acquisition, we do not plan to issue additional long-term debt in 2016.
Now turning to guidance. We have adjusted our guidance range to reflect the incremental interest expense from the July bond offering. We have not anticipated accessing the long-term debt market until late in 2016 or early 2017 and consequently, had assumed funding on our line of credit. The impact is $0.03 to $0.04, and our updated FFO per diluted share guidance range adjusted the low end of that to a range of $5.62 to $5.68. A few additional items to note about our guidance range as well as items having an outsized impact in the second half of '16 compared to the first half. First, consistent with our past practice, our guidance range does not include any future acquisitions or dispositions. The range includes the loss of the 3 Sports Authority spaces I discussed earlier, which is a drag of approximately $0.02 per share. We will have additional compensation cost associated with our new CFO of approximately $0.015 in the second half of 2016. We still expect same-center, including redevelopment, for the year to be in the 3% area. Given our year-to-date metric as of 6/30 was 3.8%, we do expect some deceleration in the second half of the year as we feel the impact of the Sports Authority vacancies, anchor rollover timing and expected more normalized levels of bad debt expense. We expect this to be concentrated more in Q3 as we will see additional rent starts late in the year for anchor tenants like Saks at Congressional, TJ Maxx at Pentagon Row and Field & Stream at Melville.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dan to introduce himself before we open up the call to your questions. Dan?"

Valley Fair at Westfield has had those entitlements since prerecession. So this is something that's been out there for a while, and we think ultimately going to come to bear over the next few years. And from our perspective, we're doing what we can do, which is being very aggressive about merchandising the street, making Santana a great place to come, the addition of the Splunk building with 670 more parking spaces, redoing some of the common areas, all that kind of stuff there. And then thinking about the other parcels we have left to develop and how those are going to get developed out, all of that is being rolled into our thinking. And maintaining Santana's uniqueness in the marketplace as a great place to come and spend time and meet friends and eat out and shop and live and work and all that kind of stuff. And so far, everything has gone very, very well. We do expect some headwinds, of course, when Valley Fair starts the expansion. That's going to be a little bit of a dogfight for a few years. But long term, we're not concerned about it. As it relates to City Place, I don't know. There's still a lot to be written on that development. I would never bet against Related, but they've got a long ways to go there. And geographically, it's a little bit difficult to figure out how that intercepts a lot of our primary shopping traffic. So more space in the market always affects everybody, and they're putting a lot of space into the market. But again long term, we're not overly concerned about that. Stanford's redo is a huge benefit."

So the high-end going across the street to Valley Fair and continuing to do so I don't think matters. Our whole strategy with Santana Row as it relates to not only the experience we provide people that come here to shop but also tenants is to say look, if it's your 400th store, you should probably be at Valley Fair. If it's your 10th, 20th or 50th store, you're very sensitive about the image you project to your customer base, Santana is where you should be. And we've been very successful over the last few years bringing in some really great merchants like Kate Spade and Madewell and the Bonobos and Warby Parker and the list goes on and on. And that's continuing to happen in spite of the fact that everybody knows that the Valley Fair expansion is going to happen. So like I said and like Don said in his comments, our heads are down and we're doing what we need to do on a day-to-day basis to continue to maintain our position in the marketplace."

One will be part of that property is that -- is the best-functioning part of the property today, needs to be fixed up. There will be effectively a renovation to create a good shopping center there. The second part of the property will -- in order to do what that -- what the real estate needs, needs to go vertical. We'll need entitlement changes to do that. The question will be do we do the first part without the entitlements for the second part. That we're not sure about yet. In fact, we're leaning towards no until we know that we can get the entitlements to make the whole thing makes sense. That's why there's been -- I've been less forthcoming with respect to our plans. We know we're trying to get to, but it really is going to depend upon the ability to get the entitlements to do so.

We've come down a little bit in terms of what -- when we are willing to be more aggressive on acquisitions for the right property, and a lot of that, frankly, has -- is around where we're able to do 30-year money. That's changed things for us. I mean your ability to do that, not everybody can do 30-year. But I do believe you got to match the left side with the right side, and I don't think 10 years is long enough, frankly. So that has helped us an awful lot in thinking that through. But I have to say, it's not about can you do acquisitions or not do acquisitions, in my view. It's about where could -- where do you allocate capital and how do you allocate capital? As you know and Melissa just said, we've got a $0.25 billion to spend in the balance of this year on development projects that are expected to yield 300 basis points plus over what we're borrowing at. And so when you sit and you think about capital allocation, it's not so much about is there an acquisition to do. It's about, is there a way to grow? I mean, we -- any public REIT has to continue to grow. We just feel fortunate that we have development opportunities to be able to do that. And there certainly will be an occasional acquisition and we'll certainly stretch to do -- to step-up to do what we need to step up to do for that occasional acquisition, but I stress occasional."

Sure, Alex. And I think the Bay Area gets painted with a broad brush, which I think everybody understands and probably expects, but I think things are a little bit different may be in San Francisco than they are in Silicon Valley right now, particularly on the apartment side where there's a lot of product coming online in San Francisco. And when you think about what it costs to build a condo or an apartment in San Francisco, you got to get a pretty high sales price or pretty high rent. So most of the stuff is coming online is targeting the same customer, and there's definitely some softness up there from what we've seen and heard, both in condo sales prices and in apartment rents, some concessions creeping back into the market. Down in the valley, I think it's probably a little bit different. I mean, like Don said in his comments, we're doing better on our rental increases at our apartments here in Santana Row than we expected to be doing this time of the year, this part of the cycle. And I think that goes to a couple of things, of course. One is supply, and there's a little bit of a supply lull at the moment, we'll see how long that continues. But also job growth. And I think that's different between San Francisco and the valley as well. Things might be a little bit more choppy in San Francisco as it relates to that. Down here in Silicon Valley, they're very, very healthy. We look at job growth closely, and we're still seeing not only a lot of jobs being added, but a big queue of unfilled jobs at most of the major employers. Now you're at sub-frictional unemployment rates right now in both San Francisco and Silicon Valley, and there's a lot of competition still from the big firms to hire the right people. And the big firms here are still very, very profitable and they have a ton of cash on their balance sheets, and they're growing. And while that may not be at the same pace that it was a year or so ago, it still extremely strong from a historical perspective. So we're really bullish on Silicon Valley right now. Always cautious, as you know, but very bullish. And I think what you're hearing is more broadbrush effect than what we're seeing in our product."

The reality is, similar to what you've seen on the East Coast, there is various -- the supply, that's around, particularly on the office side, is not necessarily what employers are looking for. So you see vacancy, you see ""softness"" in product that is in some respects not leasable. And what has happened at Santana, while there is no question in my mind that we will be under pressure in terms of the rents that we'll get on retail because of the Valley Fair expansion, because of any kind of expansion when you have that much space over the next few years. The place itself is so solidified and is so good at what it is, that we do benefit big time on both the residential and on the office. Now at the end of that street, we're going to have to finish out one of these days, and we're working through an office plan for the end of that street with the retail on the ground floor and we are obviously boosted by the success that we've had with respect to Splunk. Now I'm not ready to announce that or to talk about that. But given the environment, all the comments you just heard from Jeff, we're going to have -- there's going to be support around here to add incremental office and retail space to (small amount of retail, restaurant primarily) space to Santana Row that captures what it is that we've done.

There is no doubt and I agree with the basic concept with experiential tenants, particularly, that, first of all, you know as soon as they open whether there is something that resonates or it doesn't. And LEGOLAND resonated in a big way. But the challenge then is to say, ""Well, okay. Is that the level of business that they're going to maintain throughout their lease life?"" You can't assume it is. It's not like a restaurant. And at least we found and as much as LEGOLAND is, this kind of notion. It's not like a restaurant that gains in popularity all the way through. And it's a lot of small visits that continues to happen. The question is does it settle into a place with -- because if of its big draw from a large area, where it is always something that people continue to go to once a month or -- at first, they'll go a lot. And then over time, they go less. What we've seen there is, first of all, it was a huge opening, and that was so validating to the property that it was critical. And they have settled. And they've settled down at a number from the beginning in a place though that still works really, really well. Now what will be interesting to see is from this point, do they grow slowly like other retailers from here? Do they reprogram the space with different attractions and things like that? How does that work out? That's what we expect to happen. But the level that they're doing today is pretty darn impressive albeit not what it was when it opened up."

And I would just add, I think Don answered the business side of it, from our perspective on why we did LEGO there, and why this experiential use was really important, was that it provided a daily draw to -- or provided a draw to the 18 million tourists that come into Boston every year. We got on the same program as the aquarium and the Duck Tours and the science museum so that those constituents coming in came to Assembly, to drive traffic to every other use we have there. So there is the business answer, and think that will drive growth, but there was also a very defined purpose as to why we did it, which was creating a use and a need that attracted a regional draw. There, if you talk to them they draw from about a 120-mile radius. We see field-trip buses there all the time. And I've got 3 kids, I remember when they were younger the same destination at the point in time Chuck E. Cheese local for birthday parties. I think I probably went there 30 times over a window of time. So I just think that LEGO is also serving that same purpose of families and bringing back that recognition. And -- so we're thrilled with LEGOLAND there. Which we just had a [indiscernible] at the white marsh, which is same kind of thing.

But to the extent it continues to soften, yes, there will be pressure on the yield. That's just, matter of fact, the way it is."

Now the quarter. It was a really good one. Better than we expected with improved  
occupancy, a strong collections effort and a ton of leasing more than 100 deals and  
467,000 feet of total square footage, all of which resulted in FFO per share of $1.42,  
nearly 7% better than last year's quarter and the highest quarterly result we've ever  
recorded. Remember, this is happening at a transitional time in our company when we're  
realigning our operations organization and adding and changing staff positions. When we're  
building and stabilizing 2 major development initiatives that are in the throes of  
disruptive construction and a weak apartment rental market in D.C. When there's over $0.5  
billion sitting on our balance sheet, construction in progress, that is not producing an  
income stream yet but certainly will be. And some of the most sought after compelling  
product types in the country. And some of the most sought-after real estate locations in  
the country. I'm really pleased with how our team is responding and the solid progress  
we're making. Our heads are down, and we're executing, and the long term looks as good as  
ever. And when you break down the components of that FFO quarter-over-quarter results,  
you'll see that it's broad-based. Top line revenue increase of over 9% and a property  
operating income increase of nearly 7.5% that had contributions from everywhere. It had  
contributions from the Sunset CocoWalk and Clarion joint venture acquisitions in for the  
full quarter, contributions from same-center growth that beat our internal expectations at  
3.5%. Contributions from strong redevelopment results from The Point, from East Bay  
Bridge, from Westgate, from Willow Lawn among others. Income contributions from Pike &  
Rose and Assembly Row of nearly $5 million, up significantly over last year's quarter.  
Marginally lower interest expense despite higher borrowings as we continue to drive  
portfolio rate down. And G&A that's well under control. Top to bottom, every piece of the  
business is contributing. And last month, as I'm sure you've heard, we've  
opportunistically accessed the 30-year unsecured bond market at a spread of only 160 basis  
points over the 30-year treasury for a REIT record setting 3 5/8% coupon, 3.75% effective  
yield on $250 million. In effect, world economic dislocation and a flight-to-quality, both  
in real estate and to credits like ours made the timing of that move really compelling.  
Now that money paid down the line completely with some leftover and sitting in the bank  
for few months. So that yield is dilutive to earnings for the balance of the year by $0.03  
to $0.04 per share. And we've adjusted our guidance by the low side of that amount in  
order to be prudent. But with current construction underway expected to return 300-plus  
basis points in excess of that money over the next couple of years, 30-year debt sure felt  
like a good call.
Okay. A little more detail on the quarter and now on to the outlook. On a sequential  
quarter basis, the percentage of the entire portfolio that is leased ticked up to 94.5% at  
June 30 compared with 94.1% at March 31. Melissa will talk about Sports Authority in a few  
minutes, but for purposes of occupancy and absent offsetting leasing, we would expect a 50  
basis point hit by the end of the third quarter.
As I mentioned earlier, leasing results for the quarter were strong. 91 comparable deals  
done for 373,000 feet of space at $38.21 a foot, 12% higher on a cash basis from the deals  
they replaced. That's up 17% on anchors, 10% on small shops. it's up 23% on new leases, 7%  
on renewals. A couple of the most consequential deals include an important merchandising  
upgrade at the power center portion of Assembly Square where Trader Joe's will replace  
A.C. Moore at significantly higher rent beginning late in 2017 and should also help create  
even more tenant demand when the adjacent Sports Authority vacates later this year. 
Also, in the first couple of days in July, we were thrilled to complete the last piece of  
the puzzle for the leasing of the power center portion of Melville Mall on Long Island  
with an extremely well-regarded Italian specialty grocer called Uncle Giuseppe's, taking  
the former Waldbaum’s box at a higher rent. There's not a grocer that he would rather have  
done a deal with than these guys at this location on Long Island. Check out their website.
Uncle Giuseppe's along with the new Field & Stream deals and Dick's deals over the past  
couple of quarters is transforming this property. And with A&P out of there, we're now  
actively working on adding additional GLA for shops and restaurants, assuming we can get  
the entitlements. That's what we're working on, so stay tuned. By the way, I'm fresh off a  
trip to review the completion of 2 of our latest shopping center redevelopments, Tower  
Shops in Florida and Mercer Mall in New Jersey. I left thoroughly impressed with a real  
sense of pride in the transformation. Not only did they look great with full parking lots  
but consider this, total combined investment before redevelopment of those 2 shopping  
centers with $175 million producing property operating income of $14 million. Total  
combined investment after redevelopment was $215 million, $40 million more, producing  
operating income of $21 million, $7 million more. Value creation at a simple 5 cap, both  
before and after redevelopment, so no assumed benefit from obvious cap rate contraction of  
$100 million over 4 years. Our ability to transform big properties like this -- Tower  
Shops is 370,000 square feet, Mercer Mall 0.5 million square feet -- is one of the most  
important components of our business plan and one we are extremely proud of. It's good to  
own great real estate and have a creative team that can also execute. On the big  
development side, no surprises, just continued execution at Assembly, Pike & Rose and  
building 11, that's the Splunk building at Santana Row. A couple of points on each for you  
to consider.
At Assembly, Phase 1 done, stabilized with every building at least 95% leased and  
occupied. Because of some free rent in the office tenants you have to burn off, income  
will continue to increase next year. Nearly 2,000 employees going to work each day at  
Partners HealthCare as of today -- double that next year -- have already created higher  
shopping and restaurant traffic. Dust and noise are the players of the day as roughly 40%  
of the Phase 2 spend has been incurred, and we remain on time and on budget. The office  
occupation, the T-stop usage, the Trader Joe's deals in the adjacent power center I talked  
about before, all these really show just how important this community has become for the  
north side of the city. By the way, check out the video that NAREIT did featuring Assembly  
on reit.com, and, as you would expect, it's also available on our website.
Good things happening at Pike & Rose, too, though the pressure on residential rents  
throughout the market surely isn't subsiding. Leasing pace, however, progressed as well  
with the big Pallas luxury tower now 84% leased and per se, the other residential building  
there, remaining in the mid-90s. With our current pace of leasing, we expect to be at  
stabilized occupancy by year-end as planned. Nike opens in the old City Sports space in a  
couple of weeks. And like at Assembly, noise and dust continue as about 1/3 of the Phase 2  
construction budget has been spent. More than half of the retail spaces spoken for in the  
new Phase 2 at this point with tenants like Pinstripes, Porsche, H&M, Lucky, REI, Red Door  
Spa, [indiscernible], Taylor Gourmet. The environment is shaping up as well or better than  
we what we had hoped. What we really could use here is a bit of firming on the pricing in  
the residential market, which is bound to happen sooner or later.
And on the West Coast, Splunk is expected to occupy the building by January, and the  
execution of this construction and build-out has been nearly flawless. We continue to see  
strength in Santana not only in terms of its desirability as an office location but also  
with respect to residential rents that continue to grow above our expectations. It's a  
tale of two cities when comparing Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C. on the residential  
side.
In Florida, plans for our new Miami acquisitions, Sunset Place and CocoWalk, continue to  
progress well and are being vetted by our senior team and partners. Decisions as a to  
direction in initial phases should go on to our investment committee later this year, at  
which point we'll layout what we have in mind. It is likely that we want to add office and  
residential components in some variation at these properties. In the meantime, we're  
heavily focused on grassroots engagement with the local communities and are increasingly  
optimistic that we'll be able to work toward viable and value creative changes at both  
locations. At Sunset, we'll need zoning changes that permit more height to come up with a  
viable plan, yet we would hope to start out with a retail renovation of the existing  
important sections of the project first. Fingers crossed, we'll see.
On the acquisition front, we're working through a number of important deals and though  
pricing remains uncomfortably rich, we're not afraid to step up the play for the right  
real estate. Nothing to report on this call, but we're working hard and hope to have more  
talk over the next couple of calls. Jeff Berkes and I will be brief and engage Dan as one  
of his first orders of business.
I've asked Melissa to talk about the Sports Authority impact, our balance sheet activity,  
including yesterday's announced dividend hike for the record-setting 49th consecutive year  
(big celebration for 50th next) as well as our full year earnings expectations. And I am  
going to ask Dan G. to introduce himself before we open up the line to your questions  
afterwards. But right now, Melissa."
271305,345155802,1029061,"Federal Realty Investment Trust, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Federal Realty Investment Trust","Executives","Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. We'll start with an update on Sports Authority.  First, all 5 of our spaces were occupied and rent-paying through June 30. The lease at  Montrose Crossing here in Rockville, Maryland, was assumed by Value City",833,"Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. We'll start with an update on Sports Authority.  
First, all 5 of our spaces were occupied and rent-paying through June 30. The lease at  
Montrose Crossing here in Rockville, Maryland, was assumed by Value City Furniture --  
we'll have no downtime or lost rent on this one.
With respect to the lease at East Bay Bridge in Emeryville, California, Dick's Sporting  
Goods obtained designation rights for the lease. And we are currently in negotiations with  
Dick's to take over the space. We'll know more on this one in the next 60 days. The  
lease at Crow Canyon was rejected effective July 1 with Brick Plaza and Assembly Square  
marketplace vacant as of August 1.
All outstanding AR for these spaces was 100% reserved as of June 30. In total, we are  
losing 103,000 square feet of leased space, which results in a 50 basis point decline in  
occupancy that we will see in Q3. The spaces have a total base rent of $2.1 million or  
$20.50 per square foot. And we expect to be able to re-lease these spaces at rents 10% to  
20% higher. Though we are in discussions with tenants for each of the spaces, final leases  
will, of course, take time. Typically a full year before new rent starts. For the rest of  
2016, we expect these 3 spaces will impact FFO by approximately $0.02 and of course, be a  
drag to our Q3 and Q4 same-center metrics.
Enough about Sports Authority. Yesterday, we announced an increase to our quarterly  
dividend of $0.04 per share to a quarterly rate of $0.98 and an annual indicative rate of  
$3.92 per share. This is our 49th year of consecutive increases, the longest in the REIT  
sector and one of the longest for all public companies. While we talk a lot about it, this  
is something we couldn't be more proud of to be able to pay our shareholders more every  
year for almost half a century is pretty awesome.
Now turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we issued $59 million of equity on  
our ATM at a weighted average price of $156.24 per share, bringing our year-to-date ATM  
issuances to 92 million. In July, we opportunistically issued $250 million of 30-year  
senior unsecured debt at a coupon of 3.625% at an effective rate of 3.75%. We ended the  
quarter with 18% debt to market cap, net debt to EBITDA of 5.2x and a weighted average  
tenor of our debt of over 11 years after reflecting the July offering. This leaves us lots  
of flexibility with respect to the balance sheet and locking in these historically low  
rates will benefit our company for a long time to come. 
From a capital standpoint, we expect to incur about $250 million in development and  
redevelopment spend in the second half of 2016 as both Phase 2s at Assembly Row and Pike &  
Rose are fully under construction. The cost will be funded with the remaining proceeds  
from the July bond offering, equity under our ATM and a line of credit, all with an eye  
towards maintaining net debt to EBITDA in the low to mid-5 range. Absent a significant  
acquisition, we do not plan to issue additional long-term debt in 2016.
Now turning to guidance. We have adjusted our guidance range to reflect the incremental  
interest expense from the July bond offering. We have not anticipated accessing the long- 
term debt market until late in 2016 or early 2017 and consequently, had assumed funding on  
our line of credit. The impact is $0.03 to $0.04, and our updated FFO per diluted share  
guidance range adjusted the low end of that to a range of $5.62 to $5.68. A few additional  
items to note about our guidance range as well as items having an outsized impact in the  
second half of '16 compared to the first half. First, consistent with our past practice,  
our guidance range does not include any future acquisitions or dispositions. The range  
includes the loss of the 3 Sports Authority spaces I discussed earlier, which is a drag of  
approximately $0.02 per share. We will have additional compensation cost associated with  
our new CFO of approximately $0.015 in the second half of 2016. We still expect same- 
center, including redevelopment, for the year to be in the 3% area. Given our year-to-date  
metric as of 6/30 was 3.8%, we do expect some deceleration in the second half of the year  
as we feel the impact of the Sports Authority vacancies, anchor rollover timing and  
expected more normalized levels of bad debt expense. We expect this to be concentrated  
more in Q3 as we will see additional rent starts late in the year for anchor tenants like  
Saks at Congressional, TJ Maxx at Pentagon Row and Field & Stream at Melville.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dan to introduce himself before we open up  
the call to your questions. Dan?"

those entitlements since prerecession. So this is something that's been out there for a  
while, and we think ultimately going to come to bear over the next few years. And from our  
perspective, we're doing what we can do, which is being very aggressive about  
merchandising the street, making Santana a great place to come, the addition of the Splunk  
building with 670 more parking spaces, redoing some of the common areas, all that kind of  
stuff there. And then thinking about the other parcels we have left to develop and how  
those are going to get developed out, all of that is being rolled into our thinking. And  
maintaining Santana's uniqueness in the marketplace as a great place to come and spend  
time and meet friends and eat out and shop and live and work and all that kind of stuff.  
And so far, everything has gone very, very well. We do expect some headwinds, of course,  
when Valley Fair starts the expansion. That's going to be a little bit of a dogfight for a  
few years. But long term, we're not concerned about it. As it relates to City Place, I  
don't know. There's still a lot to be written on that development. I would never bet  
against Related, but they've got a long ways to go there. And geographically, it's a  
little bit difficult to figure out how that intercepts a lot of our primary shopping  
traffic. So more space in the market always affects everybody, and they're putting a lot  
of space into the market. But again long term, we're not overly concerned about that.  
Stanford's redo is a huge benefit."

to Valley Fair and continuing to do so I don't think matters. Our whole strategy with  
Santana Row as it relates to not only the experience we provide people that come here to  
shop but also tenants is to say look, if it's your 400th store, you should probably be at  
Valley Fair. If it's your 10th, 20th or 50th store, you're very sensitive about the image  
you project to your customer base, Santana is where you should be. And we've been very  
successful over the last few years bringing in some really great merchants like Kate Spade  
and Madewell and the Bonobos and Warby Parker and the list goes on and on. And that's  
continuing to happen in spite of the fact that everybody knows that the Valley Fair

San Jose has had rent control for a very long time, and they recently tweaked some of the  
rules around how that rent control works that primarily affects owners of much, much older  
product than we have. And even when you work through it, rent control in and of itself is,  
in my mind, not a good thing but it doesn't really have any adverse impact in a normal  
market. So yes, I think you're going to continue to see that and how the rubber meets the  
road is still TBD. But generally speaking, most rent control laws are dealing with much  
older product."

keep it in place. The development side of our business is saying, ""This needs to be  
fixed."" It will be fixed if it's -- if we can get the entitlement to do so in 2 stages.  
One will be part of that property is that -- is the best-functioning part of the property  
today, needs to be fixed up. There will be effectively a renovation to create a good  
shopping center there. The second part of the property will -- in order to do what that --  
what the real estate needs, needs to go vertical. We'll need entitlement changes to do  
that. The question will be do we do the first part without the entitlements for the second

we can get the entitlements to make the whole thing makes sense. That's why there's been

development projects that are expected to yield 300 basis points plus over what we're

about is there an acquisition to do. It's about, is there a way to grow? I mean, we -- any  
public REIT has to continue to grow. We just feel fortunate that we have development

Sure, Alex. And I think the Bay Area gets painted with a broad brush, which I think  
everybody understands and probably expects, but I think things are a little bit different  
may be in San Francisco than they are in Silicon Valley right now, particularly on the  
apartment side where there's a lot of product coming online in San Francisco. And when you  
think about what it costs to build a condo or an apartment in San Francisco, you got to  
get a pretty high sales price or pretty high rent. So most of the stuff is coming online  
is targeting the same customer, and there's definitely some softness up there from what  
we've seen and heard, both in condo sales prices and in apartment rents, some concessions  
creeping back into the market. Down in the valley, I think it's probably a little bit  
different. I mean, like Don said in his comments, we're doing better on our rental  
increases at our apartments here in Santana Row than we expected to be doing this time of  
the year, this part of the cycle. And I think that goes to a couple of things, of course.  
One is supply, and there's a little bit of a supply lull at the moment, we'll see how long  
that continues. But also job growth. And I think that's different between San Francisco  
and the valley as well. Things might be a little bit more choppy in San Francisco as it  
relates to that. Down here in Silicon Valley, they're very, very healthy. We look at job  
growth closely, and we're still seeing not only a lot of jobs being added, but a big queue  
of unfilled jobs at most of the major employers. Now you're at sub-frictional unemployment  
rates right now in both San Francisco and Silicon Valley, and there's a lot of competition  
still from the big firms to hire the right people. And the big firms here are still very,  
very profitable and they have a ton of cash on their balance sheets, and they're growing.  
And while that may not be at the same pace that it was a year or so ago, it still  
extremely strong from a historical perspective. So we're really bullish on Silicon Valley  
right now. Always cautious, as you know, but very bullish. And I think what you're hearing  
is more broadbrush effect than what we're seeing in our product."

Santana, while there is no question in my mind that we will be under pressure in terms of  
the rents that we'll get on retail because of the Valley Fair expansion, because of any  
kind of expansion when you have that much space over the next few years. The place itself  
is so solidified and is so good at what it is, that we do benefit big time on both the  
residential and on the office. Now at the end of that street, we're going to have to  
finish out one of these days, and we're working through an office plan for the end of that

that we've had with respect to Splunk. Now I'm not ready to announce that or to talk about

that resonates or it doesn't. And LEGOLAND resonated in a big way. But the challenge then  
is to say, ""Well, okay. Is that the level of business that they're going to maintain  
throughout their lease life?"" You can't assume it is. It's not like a restaurant. And at  
least we found and as much as LEGOLAND is, this kind of notion. It's not like a restaurant  
that gains in popularity all the way through. And it's a lot of small visits that  
continues to happen. The question is does it settle into a place with -- because if of its  
big draw from a large area, where it is always something that people continue to go to  
once a month or -- at first, they'll go a lot. And then over time, they go less. What  
we've seen there is, first of all, it was a huge opening, and that was so validating to  
the property that it was critical. And they have settled. And they've settled down at a  
number from the beginning in a place though that still works really, really well. Now what  
will be interesting to see is from this point, do they grow slowly like other retailers  
from here? Do they reprogram the space with different attractions and things like that?  
How does that work out? That's what we expect to happen. But the level that they're doing  
today is pretty darn impressive albeit not what it was when it opened up."

was that it provided a daily draw to -- or provided a draw to the 18 million tourists that  
come into Boston every year. We got on the same program as the aquarium and the Duck Tours  
and the science museum so that those constituents coming in came to Assembly, to drive  
traffic to every other use we have there. So there is the business answer, and think that  
will drive growth, but there was also a very defined purpose as to why we did it, which  
was creating a use and a need that attracted a regional draw. There, if you talk to them  
they draw from about a 120-mile radius. We see field-trip buses there all the time. And  
I've got 3 kids, I remember when they were younger the same destination at the point in  
time Chuck E. Cheese local for birthday parties. I think I probably went there 30 times  
over a window of time. So I just think that LEGO is also serving that same purpose of  
families and bringing back that recognition. And -- so we're thrilled with LEGOLAND there.  
Which we just had a [indiscernible] at the white marsh, which is same kind of thing. So in  
the right places for the right draw, I think these are uses that make a lot of sense but  
you have to have a big picture as to what the end-use purpose is for us. And this was very  
disciplined in our decision making to bring them here."

Last night, we reported third quarter 2016 FFO per share of $1.41, 3.7% better than last year's exceptionally strong quarter and above our internal expectations. Given these results, we're comfortable reaffirming our previously issued guidance range for full year '16 [indiscernible] of 5 63 million to 5 67. [indiscernible] the third quarters reported results expectations for the balance of the year and most importantly, what this means for '17 since we released initial guidance last night that falls short of expectations, mostly for value-enhancing initiatives that have short-term cost. More of that in a few minutes [indiscernible] 
$1.41 a share [indiscernible] $1.38 in the first quarter, $1.42 on the second, we're happy with that result, given the fact that as anticipated and as we discussed previously, this is the quarter we really see the full effect of the big vacancies in the past few quarters. Sports Authority is gone. A&P are gone, et cetera, and they were all in [indiscernible] a year ago. When coupled with a particularly strong quarter a year ago where FFO per share was down [ph] 11% for a tough year-over-year comparison. Those vacancies this quarter, along with the inclusion of poorly leased Sunset Place and CocoWalk resulted in a reduction of portfolio lease percentage of 120 basis points to 94.3% and a physical occupancy reduction of 200 [ph] basis points.
Those vacancies, in addition to some strong bad debt recovery and percentage rent positives in last year's quarter resulted in anemic same-store growth comparison by [indiscernible] 150 to 200 basis points lower than they would otherwise have been. When you think about it, it does say an awful a lot about the portfolio that same-store grew 1.5% in the quarter that occupancy dipped as much as it did.
It would be wrong to conclude that leasing activity has trailed off, however, as can be seen in the leasing done this quarter. There was a lot of it. 93 comparable deals, that's more leases any quarter in the last couple of years from 427,000 feet of space had an average rent of 31 25, 14% higher than the tenants they replaced. In fact, for the first 9 months of this year, we've done 269 comparable deals or 1.2 million square feet, 17% more volume than the first 9 months of 2015.
And that leads to the discussion I want to have our initial guidance for '17 of $5.83 to $5.93 per share, so let me pivot now and use the rest of my prepared remarks to discuss 2017. I think this will make us one of the first to issue guidance, and this year's particularly required explanation.
And let me start out by being crystal clear that despite 4% [indiscernible] FFO growth at the midpoint of guidance next year, nothing has changed our outlook as the achievability of hitting or beating our long-term business plan goal of doubling income for 10 years. In fact, it's precisely because of the [indiscernible] 2017 that I have greater confidence we'll get there. To make it as clear as possible, we included the schedule on this year's -- in this quarter's press release and 8-K on the reconciliation of FFO guidance -- on FFO guidance page that will parallel the comments I'm about to make. A little background first as to why we're so aggressively repositioning so much our portfolio. We see we have seen consumer behavior changing and changing at an accelerated pace and impacting nearly every business. Retail real estate is no exception. That's why a couple of years back, we turned up the heat on virtually every initiative we had at the same time in every facet of our business at a time when capital was cheap and [indiscernible] best-of-class portfolio in the best possible shape in markets where consumers demand a higher level of service and in an environment they want to hang out as an integral part of their lines. Of course, it takes time, all the more than we would like, but reviewed it as critical to the long-term strengthening of this real estate portfolio. We feel that we're best positioned to do this, given the location of our real estate and our track record of success in transforming different types of retail real estate.
So we accelerated the timing to start the second phase of our big mixed-use development before the paint was dry in the first phase even though second phase construction affects first phase performance until and overall sense is established.
We jumped into Miami with not 1 but 2 new retail opportunities located retail destinations even though the existing income stream will, of course, be disrupted in preparation of the process. We accelerated the full buildout of growth, first  with the option of the 12 acres and NOS and with respect build now fully leased [indiscernible] Building and currently with the announcement to move forward with 215,310,000 square foot office retail tower in the anchor industry.
We restructured our personnel through decentralization investment initiative so that the the human capital was sufficient, properly aligned and has the tools necessary to accelerate progress in both the mixed-use and core portfolios. We took advantage of a very favorable capital environment, both by delevering through current [indiscernible] and somewhat ahead of development spend and by turning on our debt portfolio with $700 million of 30-year [ph] unsecured bonds, creating a level of safety unmatched by any of our peers.  Of course, at the expense of lower earnings led by higher short-term interest expense in lower level of We have and continue to identify more value-enhancing redevelopment opportunities with our new decentralized structure than ever before in our history. And we're getting more faster even though they hurt short-term earnings. Many of those opportunities are possible by our ability to get back on the anchor business. And it's this last point, the one related to the [indiscernible] redevelopment pools sparked by vacancies that is one of the 3 main reasons 2017 appears late even though it is this redevelopment initiative that drives significant value creation and earnings growth to follow. And if the market were softening and the cost of money is increasing, the quality of the real estate location has always been [indiscernible] possible. We're got the best volume growth in the fourth [ph] quarter. I'll give you some numbers.
The release of the excess anchor in the portfolio gives an obvious drag -- earnings drag into the bigger development plan. Then in some cases, entitled, then leased, then turned over to the tenant for interior buildout, then occupied, then finally, rent pay. Generally, we're not just trying to release vacant offices, we're trying to reposition and fortify retail destinations, and that simply takes longer.
Consider this. We have 700,000 square feet of anchor and near-anchor vacancy in the quarter. That's more than doubled the box vacancy that we historically have carried. In Sports Authority, AMC, Hudson Trail [indiscernible] you know their names. The prior ramp on that 730,000 feet was 19 75 and represents $14.5 million of rent or $0.20 a share of former in-place annual rent that's missing.
As of today, we've got 42% of that space released and released at 37% higher rent than was previously being paid. This released the and DSW at Brick shopping center. So Field & Stream and [indiscernible] are at Melrose shopping center, T.J. Maxx at Pentagon Row to L.A. Fitness and Gilmore, et cetera. Every one of those deals is part of a much more comprehensive repositioning of the shopping center, not merely a releasing of the box. But it generally doesn't become rent paying until '17 and '18 with the heavy weighting toward the back end of '17 and '18. Accordingly, we forecast 2017 to be roughly 5 million or $0.07 a share lower than it otherwise would be.  Of course, the validation of these redevelopment shopping centers will be significant when completed.
Now let's go to the big developments and talk with a natural short-term dilution that comes from the delivery and lease-up process associated with the residential development and Phase 2 of assembly and Pike & Rose as well as the dilution that comes from a probable reconfiguration of CocoWalk that we considered in our 2017 guidance.
First, the Phase 2 residential building under construction at both Assembly and Pike & Rose. At Assembly, the 447 unit residential building called and at Pike & Rose, the 272-unit residential building called The Henry will both begin deliveries and lease up in '17. The dilution that comes from this process is expected to exceed $4 million or $0.06 a share. Operating costs, marketing, interest expense naturally exceed revenue as development turns over this building's expenses exceed revenue significantly at first, unless those buildings leased up. It's unavoidable and will create earnings drag of about $2 million before interest and an additional $2 million at the FFO line. Those 2 buildings alone are expected, however, to create well over $100 million of value when stabilized. 
Similarly, at CocoWalk in Florida, while we haven't completely finalized our development plans and numbers, we do hope to able to get those plans to our investment committee early next year, which allow us to begin repositioning space and tenants and beginning construction at the portion of the shopping center in 2017. As we expect -- as you would assume, occupancy at CocoWalk and at Sunset, for that matter, will get worse before it gets better, and we thought it prudent to include the impact of Miami's first step toward repositioning estimated at a couple of cents a share in our guidance. Obviously, the value is expected to be created at CocoWalk [indiscernible] in 2017 accounting losses. Basically, our 2017 guidance would have been roughly $0.16 a share higher if we were simply not building Phase 2s at Pike & Rose for Assembly and not proactively taking out our anchor space. Hopefully, the enhancements we're making to our disclosure, including the timing of income coming online will provide more clarity now and in the future.
The final significant item affecting 2017 guidance is our lower near-term operating income expectations at Pike & Rose, continuing softness in the Montgomery County, Maryland residential market, especially in the last 90 days. And the ongoing construction disruption of Phase 2 simply make me uncomfortable maintaining 7% yield guidance at Pike & Rose. And accordingly, you'll note a change in our disclosures for both the first and second phases as I alluded to earlier [indiscernible] so really need to be used together to a 6% to 7% yield with better disclosure on the time periods, we're getting there. The disclosure now also includes site maps we're adding that make the proximity of the Phase 2 construction and Phase 1 quite apparent along with the land and entitlements for future spaces. I, we remain positive as ever on what we're creating there, but have our our eyes wide open as to the additional time that it's going to take to get there. The combined impact of that lower expected yield and lower pace negatively impacting our '17 guidance by about $0.06 a share. All told, at $0.22 a share or more that's pushed back from '17 to the next 12, 24, 36 months in addition to the positive momentum in contributions for the many initiatives we're working on and from those that we'll add to in the future. So that's it for my prepared remarks. We've got a lot going on around here, huge investment in our future, lots of construction in progress on the balance sheet and the right type of products for the future on some of the best of the real estate and some the best markets of the country, our heads are down and we continue to execute. I look forward to spending more time with many of you in a couple of weeks in Phoenix going through this and wherever else you'd like to talk through. Now let me turn it over to Dan before opening up the lines for your questions."

Then I want to spend some time going through a few specific areas that will help you with your modeling of Federal's going forward. 
First, the third quarter. The $1.41 of FFO per share and same-store NOI growth of 1.5% were fully in step with our expectations for the quarter. As Melissa specifically discussed in our second quarter call, same-store growth is expected to decelerate in the second half of 2017, with most of that concentrated in the third quarter. Now that was due not only to the difficult third quarter comp we faced but also due to the impact on occupancy and cash flow of our anchor repositioning activity.
With portfolio occupancy at 93.1% at quarter end versus 95.1% at third quarter 2015, note that almost 150 of the 200 basis point diminution can be attributed to those 8 anchor boxes that Don referenced in his remarks. The 3 A&Ps, 3 Sports Authorities, Hudson Trail and Hancock which occupancy in '15 were gone in the third quarter of 2016. Also note that this vacancy totaling over 320,000 square feet is at highly productive centers located in Bensenville markets, many of which we are redeveloping, remerchandising at Assembly Square in Boston, Melville Mall in [indiscernible] in North Bethesda, Westgate in San Jose, to name a few. Needless to say, we feel very good about our ability to reposition these boxes [indiscernible]  
Through the first 3 quarters of 2016, our same-store growth stands at 3%, 1.9% excluding redevelopments. We project fourth quarter to be in line with this run rate and expect same-store growth for the year to remain in the 3% area.
Next, on the development front with respect Assembly Row and Pike & Rose, contribution for the third quarter was $6 million, up from $4.9 million during the second quarter. Assembly Row Phase 1 is 100% leased and now is producing approximately 95% of its projected stabilized property operating income or POI. Ask Don mentioned, Pike & Rose Phase 1 is behind from a run rate perspective, mostly driven by softness in effective rents at the PerSei And currently, we are closer to a 60% of projected stabilized deal on a run rate basis. Although we are pleased to be hitting our occupancy projections, the was 98% leased and Pallas almost 86% leased at quarter end. Further, we continue to demand premiums to the market of 10% to 15%. Out west at 500 Santana Row, we are slightly ahead of plan and expect Splunk to open at the end of the fourth quarter. Just a reminder, this 234,000 square-foot development is delivering a 9% cash on cost yield. Given the success at 500 Santana combined with the continued strong demand office space in the submarket, we are moving forward with the development of 700 Santana Row, a 310,000 square foot office and retail development located at the end of Santana Row, which will effectively finish off the street. We are projecting a stabilized cash on cost of 7% with projected delivery in 2019 and stabilization in 2021.
Now let me cover a few areas to provide additional clarity for your modeling in Federal going forward. As it relates to the core businesses and the impact of our anchor repositioning initiatives, we expect overall portfolio occupancy to stay at its current 93% through fourth quarter and remain at this level for most of 2017. We project occupancy will begin to improve at the end of 2017 and continue into 2019. With respect to the 730,000 square feet of anchor on [indiscernible] vacancy in effect during the third quarter, 42% or 310,000 square feet is leased. Of that 310,000, 135,000 will be rent paying by the end of 2016 with start dates for the remaining 175,000 square feet coming on over the course of 2017 and into 2018.
At this point, I would like to take a moment to highlight a new disclosure in our 8-K regarding Assembly Row, Pike & Rose as well as the recently added 700 Santana Row. In our supplemental information exhibit starting on Page 16, we have added detail that provides annual guidance from the timing of property operating income at these developments as each of the phases grow towards stabilization. We've also included site plans on the following pages for both of these communities to provide you with a sense of the progress and the scale of these projects and also to provide some context of the interconnection between the phases of each development.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. As you know, at the beginning of the third quarter we raised $250 million of 3-year unsecured notes that are break record yield for a 30-year of [ph] 3.75%. That issuance is now reflected in our quarter-end metrics. Let me highlight a few of them.
Net debt to EBITDA stands at 5.2x. Our average debt maturity remains at a sector-leading 11-plus years, and our weighted average interest rate is just above 4% with almost all of it fixed. On the equity side, we raised $55 million of common stock through our ATM program during the quarter at an average price per share of $159.38, bringing our year-to-date total ATM issuance to $146 million. As a result of this activity, at quarter end, we had cash in the balance sheet of $100 million, and our $800 million credit facility was completely undrawn. From a capital standpoint, the significant level of liquidity positions us well as we close out 2016 and head in to 2017. As it relates to development and redevelopment, we expect to spend approximately $150 million in the fourth quarter and $400 million to $450 million in 2017. We will fund these capital requirements through a combination of cash on hand, free cash flow, opportunistic issuance under our ATM program and utilization on our line of credit, which we expect to repay rebate through bond issuance in late 2017, early 2018 or sooner if an attractive window available to us. This mix will be dictated by our objective of maintaining our debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5x to 5.5x range. 
Finally, on the acquisition front where we don't have anything concrete we could report at the moment. We continue to pursue a number of compelling opportunities. While the market remains frothy from a valuation standpoint, we do see long-term value on these opportunities, we'll be aggressive in our pursuit. With 13 years of investment experience in my previous seat, I couldn't be more excited to bring that experience to Federal and work with Jeff Berkes and his acquisitions team in West Coast and with Barry Guardian and his team as my partners on the East Coast as well as with the entire Federal Realty Investment committee.
Lastly, before I turn it over to questions, I'd like to talk to you about my initial impressions from being here for almost 3 months from a, call it, a-new-to-Federal point of view.
First and in my view most importantly, the understanding commercial real estate business is constantly changing and changing quickly, especially in retail is ingrained into Federal's DNA. Federal's approach is proactive and dynamic. It does not approach filling vacancies simply to maintain occupancy and cash flow at the property but where it makes sense, uses that vacancy to reposition, remerchandise and redevelop the entire asset. Each decision that is made is made with the long-term goal of ensuring that each center is relevant for the long term.
Second, the real estate really is that good. Before coming to Federal, I was aware that I had the best-in-class portfolio. My first months here, I've traveled East and West, Coast seeing about half the portfolio so far, and the properties are even better than I had imagined. Third, I am convinced that we are creating the right environments of the mixed-use properties that we are currently developing. I spent time at Assembly Row, Bethesda Row and Santana Row. And to give you a little insight into my personal life, I currently live at Pike & Rose, my work a block away and spend a majority of my free evenings and many weekends at property. You could say I've done my due diligence, a real live-work-play experience, and I couldn't be more confident in the communities we are creating a Pike & Rose and Assembly Row. Lastly, I'm truly impressed with the management here. It'll be easy for senior management to sit back and simply rely upon the power of best-in-class portfolio to grow, but there's foresight and dynamism in the way management is looking to implement its growth initiatives and is practically making investments in people and systems in order to make this happen. You could imagine that during his first 2.5 months here, digging into the detail that support these initial observations I share them with you with confidence and conviction. I look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT and spending more time with each of you going forward to help you see what I'm seeing at Federal.
With that, operator, you can open up the line for questions."

Now 4 things that have not started for development that have not started, the CocoWalk conversation that I had in my prepared remarks, et cetera, it's very possible that those -- the decisions to start additional will depend on where the marketplace goes in 2017. But every single thing -- the big point of being disappointed by the guidance of where we are it's, for the most part, as I think it's pretty clear to you is necessary to create the value that we're creating.

Let me take the first part of that on the second part of Jeff's question. One of the things we really wrestled with this time is pretty -- Washington, D.C. in general pre-election kind of every year goes into of ""fold your hands and not do much"" kind",471,"Yes. Let me take the first part of that on the second part of Jeff's question. One of the things we really wrestled with this time is pretty -- Washington, D.C. in general pre-election kind of every year goes into of ""fold your hands and not do much"" kind of mode, and we have seen that in spades over the last 3 months, not only in Pike & Rose but anecdotally, everything we hear with respect to not only any other residential project but other real estate projects. So the decision-making that happens is -- has really slowed down. Now we wanted to see we're 6% [ph] leased at Pallas at about $2.40 a foot, Jeff. We expect that $2.40 [ph] a foot to grow but far more modestly over the next couple of years that we had initially projected. So I think we're expecting that $2.40 through the next few years to go to something like $2.55. And initially, that number was $2.85 or $2.90. So I want to do something for you for a second on -- if you wouldn't mind and indulge me, and it relates to our residential operations and our ability to figure out how to do that you wouldn't mind. I think if you take a look at what happens with us at Bethesda, what happened with us at Santana Row, what happened with us behind Congressional, we know how to build residential. I think we do a really good job at it. If you went back in 2008 when we opened up Bethesda Row's [indiscernible] 180 units there, we underwrote $2.55 and we hit $2.40 or $2.39 or something like that. So we missed those numbers in 2008, too. And if you can imagine what it was like, it's probably understandable.  We're at $3.10 a foot today, and that's over 3% CAGR over that period of time in a market where it also has a lot of additional supply. So the notion that -- from my perspective, the prudence to take that into 6 to 7 is simply a recognition of not only the supply in the market but what is happening to create that real street with [indiscernible] on top of the other. And accordingly, I just didn't feel right keeping the number where it was. But I don't -- I'm hoping that you don't view that as, ""My gosh, what in the world are these guys doing in residential?"" Take a look at Bethesda, take a look at the other actual numbers in the West Coast, take a look at Congressional, and I think you'll feel a whole different about that. But that's where we are, $2.40 to the mid-$2.50s or so over the period of time that we guided as opposed to something that was much closer to $2.85 or 2.90."

And we really kind of thought should we put that guidance, should we talk about that, but here's what's happening in Miami. We'll talk about that for a few minutes. The easier of the 2 to talk about is CocoWalk. CocoWalk -- the dilution that would come from CocoWalk is part of a plan that would knock down part of the shopping center and effectively redevelop physically a big part of the shopping center. And obviously, from demolition cost to lost rents to disruption, obviously, that's dilutive. To the extent, we can't get the numbers to work and again, that will come through the investment committee next year, we won't do that. But I did not want to not include that in guidance to the extent we can get to it. At Sunset, it's a different story. At Sunset, we are dealing with a broken property. We've known that from the beginning. We had some nice income and FFO from that property in the first couple of years that we have it. But obviously, that income stream is being reduced as the conversation of a redeveloped property has become very clear and have tenants sit there and don't perform. So there, we know we got at least another year of entitlement work to do to be able to get to what is a much more significant redevelopment. We're not -- the only impact in 2017 will be a slowly shrinking income stream over there. So most of what we're talking about here is CocoWalk and a little bit of Sunset in '17."

We started and after construction was underway we leased 100% of the building so just want to make sure you understand that. Before I get into the specifics on how we intend to approach the leasing of 700, let me tell you what 700 is. 500 Santana Row was adding an office building to Santana Row and a bunch of parking spaces that we can use nights and weekends. 700 is a lot more than that. With 700 Santana Row, we are capping off the end of Santana Row and really, for all intents and purposes, except for our last residential project over the east side of the site, we're finishing Santana Row. So 700 Santana Row is some 30,000 square feet or about [ph] that of additional retail and restaurant on the ground floor with a magnificent plaza in front of it that's really going to complete how Santana looks and feels, and it's a 1300 space parking garage, which is going to significantly add to a parking pool at the end of the street and help us drive rents and sales for the south of Santana Row. So unlike 500 Santana, it's not just an office building. It is kind of a signature development that really caps off and finished 700 Santana -- or finishes Santana Row. Now as it relates to the lease of the office space, we are already out the market. It's way early. We already have a couple of nibbles, which are exciting but leasing early will kick off in earnest, like it does with every building in Silicon Valley, when there's actually a hole in the ground and construction activity, and that's not going to be until sometime next year. As we get into the end of the year and we start to do tours and fuel interest in the building, we'll be making a decision about whether we look to lease that building 100% to one tenant or whether we break it out. When leased 500, we were very intent on leasing that building to one tenant. 700 will have to wait and see. I think there's a higher likelihood we can hold a tenant at 700, which is why you're seeing an extended stabilization period vis-à-vis building like 500."

We had some disagreement within the company whether that made sense because at the time, we did what we did for a very good reason. And that was the existing shopping center that was there, which we did not disturb during the initial phase extremely productive and effectively allowed us to move some of the tenants from that shopping center into the new shopping center like [indiscernible]. So there were good reasons to do it, but it is important to have enough critical mass on the street to be able to create the environment. Now if the residential market has stayed as strong as it was, none of this would've mattered. And back to like most questions before, the residential empowered right through without the environment on the street fully created. But when you have weakness in the marketplace, there's no question that the reliance on the health of the established retail street is a critical component.

So if the market is softer -- and I do believe the market generally is softer from a standpoint of propensity to take risks. And it certainly is in the area then you underwrite lower going up lower numbers are lower rent lower rent is hard negotiation. It takes longer to do and it also includes the other term associated with it. That's really what it's about, from my perspective as I see it. The other thing and you see it in Assembly to the other -- going the other way, when you got a big sample size of first phase retail project there and that first phase is very successful, it makes a whole lot easier to leave that second phase. We don't have a big sample size in the first phase I'm a little bit [indiscernible] and accordingly, you have tougher economics to negotiate here. Having said that, I just don't -- I don't want -- I can't overemphasize enough the fact that the anchor system in the second phase is done and is critical to the project.

The -- when I try to address this in my remarks as I could, the combination of all of the things, including the decentralization, which is really working as it relates to getting to redevelopment and getting to focus, those things as you have pointed out are dilutive in the short term. There's a lot of it. There's no doubt about that. It's happening at the same time that 2 major development projects, Pike & Rose and Assembly Row, are coming up with a heavy construction phase, which are also dilutive. So all of those things happening at the same time have the balance move down to 4% growth, rather than 6% growth or as they're coming out, 8 or 9. If we don't do any more, George, you're looking at 8% and 9% earnings growth. That's the notion of getting there but not having additional future raw material doesn't excite me.

And by the way, CIP at the end of the fourth quarter will be lower than CIP at the end of the third quarter as we put this one building into service, and that is, for all intents and purposes, a single building. So the notion that we'll continue to always rise is not what you should be assuming. Basically, at the end day, 10% of the value of this company with respect to big development is what I feel comfortable with and not more than that. In fact, you sit back and take a look, take a look over the last 3 years, you'll see that we peaked higher than we are today a couple of years ago and remember the year was '13? When effectively we had all the Phase 1s that were not yet in service but going and so you see this heavy construction in the Phase 2s right now. Those things that are put into service will reduce the CIP and I don't think -- I think the way you should look at it is the EBITDA coverage, which we're very comfortable with in the low to mid-5 fixed charge through the roof. It's kind of why we prefunded a bunch of this development in the form of reducing our leverage in the company turning out for 30 years is what we've got. But on broad basis, Chris, look at 10% of the enterprise value as kind of a rough estimate of the math. It's really much more limited by our debt coverage though and our fixed charge coverage and what we place in reserves."

Given these results, we're comfortable reaffirmi",2127,"Thank you, Leah, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported third quarter 2016 FFO per share of $1.41, 3.7% better than last year's exceptionally strong quarter and above our internal expectations. Given these results, we're comfortable reaffirming our previously issued guidance range for full year '16, in effect narrowing it a bit to $5.63 to $5.67. 
I want to talk about the third quarter's reported results, expectations for the balance of the year, and most importantly, what this means for '17 since we released initial guidance last night that falls short of Street expectations, mostly for value-enhancing initiatives that have short-term costs. More on that in a few minutes.
Let's get started with the quarter. At $1.41 a share, following $1.38 in the first quarter, $1.42 on the second, we're happy with that result, given the fact that as anticipated and as we've discussed previously, this is the quarter when you really see the full effect of the big vacancies we've been talking about in the past few quarters. Sports Authority is gone, the A&P, Hancock Fabrics, Hudson Trailer boxes are gone, et cetera, and they were all in and rent paying a year ago. When coupled with a particularly strong quarter a year ago where FFO per share had gone 11%, this all made for a tough year-over-year comparison. Those vacancies this quarter, along with the inclusion of poorly leased Sunset Place and CocoWalk, resulted in a reduction of our portfolio's lease percentage of 120 basis points to 94.3% and a physical occupancy reduction of 200 basis points.
Those vacancies, in addition to some strong bad debt recoveries and percentage rent positives in last year's quarter, resulted in an anemic same-store growth comparison by some 150 to 200 basis points lower than they would otherwise have been. When you think about it, it does say an awful a lot about the portfolio that same-store grew 1.5% in the quarter that occupancy dipped as much as it did.
It would be wrong to conclude that leasing activity has trailed off, however, as can be seen in the leasing done this quarter. There was a lot of it. 93 comparable deals, that's more leases than any quarter in the last couple of years, from 427,000 feet of space had an average rent of $31.25, 14% higher than the tenants they replaced. In fact, over the first 9 months of this year, we've done 269 comparable deals of 1.2 million square feet, 17% more volume than the first 9 months of 2015.
And that leads me to the discussion that I want to have about our initial guidance for '17 of $5.83 to $5.93 per share, so let me pivot now and use the rest of my prepared remarks to discuss 2017. I think this will make us one of the first to issue guidance and this year particularly requires explanation.
And let me start out by being crystal clear that despite a 4% projected FFO growth at the midpoint of guidance next year, nothing has changed in our outlook as to the achievability of hitting or beating our long-term business plan goal of doubling income over 10 years. In fact, it's precisely because of the items diluting 2017 that I have greater confidence we'll get there. To make it as clear as possible, we've included a schedule on this year's -- in this quarter's press release and 8-K on the reconciliation of FFO guidance -- on the FFO guidance page that will parallel the comments I'm about to make. 
A little background first as to why we are so aggressively repositioning so much of our portfolio. We see -- we have seen consumer behavior changing and changing at an accelerated pace and impacting nearly every business. Retail real estate is no exception. That's why a couple of years back, we turned up the heat on virtually every initiative we had at the same time in every facet of our business at a time when capital was cheap in an effort to put this best-of-class portfolio in the best possible shape to thrive in markets where consumers demand a higher level of service and an environment that they want to hang out in as an integral part of their lives. Of course, it takes time, albeit more than we would like, but we view it as critical to the long-term strengthening of this real estate portfolio. We feel that we're best positioned to do this given the quality locations of our real estate and our track record of success in transforming different types of retail real estate.
So we accelerated the timing to start the second phase of our big mixed-use developments before the paint was dry in the first phase even though second phase construction affects first phase performance until the overall sense of place is established.
We jumped into Miami with not 1, but 2 new retail opportunities that fixed broken but well-located retail destinations even though the existing income stream will, of course, be disrupted in preparation of that process. We accelerated the full build-out of Santana Row, first with the option on 12 acres across the street called Santana West then with the spec build, but now fully leased Splunk office building and currently with the approval and announcement to move forward with 215,310,000-square foot office retail tower that will anchor the end of the street.
We restructured our personnel through a decentralization and systems investment initiative so that the human capital was sufficient, properly aligned and has the tools necessary to accelerate progress in both the mixed-use and the core portfolios. We took advantage of a very favorable capital environment, both by delevering concurrent with and somewhat ahead of development spend and by turning on our debt portfolio with $700 million of 30-year unsecured bonds, creating a level of safety unmatched by any of our peers, of course, at the expense of lower earnings caused by higher short-term interest expense and lower overall leverage. We have and continue to identify more value-enhancing redevelopment opportunities with our new decentralized structure than ever before in our history and we're getting more of them started faster even though they hurt short-term earnings. Many of those opportunities are made possible by our ability to get back on the performing anchor boxes. 
And it's this last point, the one related to the far deeper redevelopment pools sparked by anchor vacancies that is one of the 3 main reasons 2017 appears light even though it is this redevelopment initiative that will drive significant value creation and earnings growth to follow. And if the markets are softening and the cost of money is increasing, the quality of the real estate location has always been the best hedge possible. We've got the best volume growth in the portfolio. I'll give you some numbers.
The re-lease of the excess anchor vacancy in the portfolio creates an obvious drag, earnings drag, until the spaces are coordinated into the bigger development plan. Then, in some cases, entitled, then leased, then turned over to the tenant for interior build-out, then occupied and finally rent paying. Generally, we're not just trying to re-lease vacant boxes, we are trying to reposition and fortify retail destinations and that simply takes longer.
Consider this. We have 700,000 square feet of anchor and near-anchor vacancy in the quarter. That's more than double the box vacancy that we have historically carried. It's Sports Authority, it's AMC, it's Hudson Trail, it's Hancock Fabrics, you know their names. The prior ramp on that 730,000 feet was $19.75 and represents $14.5 million of rent or $0.20 a share of former in-place annual rent that's missing.
As of today, we've got 42% of that space re-leased and re-leased at 37% higher rent than was previously being paid. It's re-leased to Ulta and DSW at Brick shopping center, to Field & Stream and Uncle Giuseppe's at Melville Shopping Center, to T.J. Maxx at Pentagon Row, to L.A. Fitness at Delmar, et cetera. Every one of those deals is part of a much more comprehensive repositioning of the shopping center, not merely a re-leasing of the box. But it generally doesn't become rent paying until '17 and '18 with a heavy weighting toward the back end of '17 and '18. Accordingly, we forecast 2017 to be roughly $5 million or $0.07 a share lower than it otherwise would be.  Of course, the value creation of these redeveloped shopping centers will be significant when complete.
Now let's go to the big developments and talk with a natural short-term dilution that comes from the delivery and lease-up process associated with the residential development and Phase 2 of Assembly and Pike & Rose as well as the dilution that comes from a probable reconfiguration of CocoWalk that we considered in our 2017 guidance.
First, the Phase 2 residential building under construction at both Assembly and Pike & Rose. At Assembly, the 447-unit residential building whole montage, and at Pike & Rose, the 272-unit residential building called The Henri will both begin deliveries and lease up in '17. The dilution that comes from this process is expected to exceed $4 million or $0.06 a share. Operating costs, marketing, interest expense naturally exceed revenue as development turns over this building's operating fees. Expenses exceed revenue significantly at first unless those buildings lease up. It's unavoidable and will create earnings drag of about $2 million before interest and an additional $2 million at the FFO line. Those 2 buildings alone are expected, however, to create well over $100 million of value when stabilized. 
Similarly, at CocoWalk in Florida, while we haven't completely finalized our redevelopment plans and numbers, we do hope to able to get those plans through our investment committee early next year, which will allow us to begin repositioning space and tenants and beginning construction at a proportion of the shopping center in 2017. As you would expect -- as you would assume, occupancy at CocoWalk and at Sunset, for that matter, will get worse before it gets better and we thought it prudent to include the impact of Miami's first step toward repositioning estimated at a couple of cents a share in our guidance. Obviously, the value expected to be created at CocoWalk far exceeds the 2017 accounting loss. Basically, our 2017 guidance would have been roughly $0.16 a share higher if we were simply not building Phase 2s at Pike & Rose for Assembly and not proactively taking out our anchor space. Hopefully, the enhancements we're making to our disclosure including the timing of income coming online will provide more clarity now and in the future. Those are damn good ideas.
The final significant item affecting 2017 guidance is our lower near-term operating income expectations at Pike & Rose. Continuing softness in the Montgomery County, Maryland residential market, especially in the last 90 days, and the ongoing construction disruption of Phase 2 simply made me uncomfortable maintaining the 7% yield guidance at Pike & Rose. And accordingly, you'll note a change in our 8-K disclosure for both the first and second phases, as I alluded to earlier, are so integrated that they really need to be used together to a 6% to 7% yield with better disclosure on the time periods for getting there. The disclosure now also includes site maps that we're adding that make the proximity of the Phase 2 construction to Phase 1 quite apparent, along with the land and entitlements for future spaces. I -- we remain as positive as ever on what we're creating there, but have our eyes wide open as to the additional time that it's going to take to get there. The combined impact of that lower expected yield and lower pace are negatively impacting our '17 guidance by about $0.06 a share. All told, a $0.22 a share or more that is pushed back from '17 to the next 12, 24, 36 months in addition to the positive momentum in contributions for the many initiatives we're working on and from those that we'll add on to in the future. 
So that's it for my prepared remarks. We've got a lot going on around here, it's a huge investment in our future, lots of construction in progress on the balance sheet in the right type of products for the future on some of the best pieces of real estate in some the best markets of the country, our heads are down and we continue to execute. I look forward to spending more time with many of you in a couple of weeks in Phoenix going through this and whatever else you'd like to talk through. 
Now let me turn it over to Dan before opening up the lines for your questions."

Don covered a lot in his remarks so I will fill just a few places as it relates to the third quarter and the balance of 2016. Then I want to spend some time going through a few specific areas that will help you with your modeling of Federal going forward. 
First, the third quarter. The $1.41 of FFO per share and same-store NOI growth of 1.5% were fully in step with our expectations for the quarter. As Melissa specifically discussed in our second quarter call, same-store growth is expected to decelerate in the second half of 2017 with most of that concentrated in the third quarter. Now that was due not only to the difficult third quarter comp we faced, but also due to the impact on occupancy and cash flow of our anchor repositioning activity.
With portfolio occupancy at 93.1% at quarter end versus 95.1% at third quarter 2015, note that almost 150 of the 200 basis point diminution can be attributed to those 8 anchor boxes that Don referenced in his remarks: the 3 A&Ps, 3 Sports Authoritys, Hudson Trail and Hancock Fabrics, which were all in occupancy in '15 were gone from third quarter of 2016. Also note that this vacancy, totaling over 320,000 square feet, is at highly productive centers located in dense in-fill markets, many of which we are redeveloping and remerchandising like Assembly Square in Boston, Melville Mall in Long Island, Montrose Crossing in North Bethesda, Westgate in San Jose, to name a few. Needless to say, we feel very good about our ability to reposition these boxes effectively.
Through the first 3 quarters of 2016, our same-store growth stands at 3%, 1.9% excluding redevelopments. We project fourth quarter to be in line with this run rate and expect same-store growth for the year to remain in the 3% area.
Next, on the development front with respect to Assembly Row and Pike & Rose, contribution for the third quarter was $6 million, up from $4.9 million during the second quarter. Assembly Row Phase 1 is 100% leased and now is producing approximately 95% of its projected stabilized property operating income or POI. As Don mentioned, Pike & Rose Phase 1 is behind from a run rate perspective, mostly driven by softness in effective rents at the PerSei and Pallas apartments and currently we are closer to a 60% projected stabilized POI on a run rate basis. Although we are pleased to be hitting our occupancy projections, the PerSei was 98% leased and Pallas almost 86% leased at quarter end. Further, we continue to demand a premium to the market of 10% to 15%. 
Out west at 500 Santana Row, we are slightly ahead of plan and expect Splunk to open at the end of the fourth quarter. Just a reminder, this 234,000-square foot development is delivering a 9% cash on cost yield. Given the success of 500 Santana, combined with the continued strong demand for office space in this submarket, we are moving forward with the development of 700 Santana Row, a 310,000-square foot office and retail development located at the end of Santana Row, which will effectively finish off the street. We are projecting a stabilized cash on cost of 7% with projected delivery in 2019 and stabilization in 2021.
Now let me cover a few areas to provide additional clarity for your modeling of Federal going forward. As it relates to the core businesses and the impact of our anchor repositioning initiatives, we expect overall portfolio occupancy to stay at its current 93% through fourth quarter and remain at this level for most of 2017. We project occupancy will begin to improve at the end of 2017 and continue into 2019. 
With respect to the 730,000 square feet of anchor or near-anchor vacancy in effect during the third quarter, 42% or 310,000 square feet is leased. Of that 310,000, 135,000 will be rent paying by the end of 2016 with start dates for the remaining 175,000 square feet coming on over the course of 2017 and into 2018.
At this point, I would like to take a moment to highlight the new disclosure in our 8-K regarding Assembly Row, Pike & Rose as well as the recently added 700 Santana Row. In our supplemental information exhibit starting on Page 16, we have added detail that provides annual guidance on the timing of property operating income at these developments as each of the phases grow towards stabilization. We've also included site plans on the following pages for both of these communities to provide you with a sense of the progress and the scale of these projects and also to provide some context of the interconnection between the phases at each development.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. As you know, at the beginning of the third quarter we raised $250 million of 30-year unsecured notes that are REIT record yield for a 30-year of 3.75%. That issuance is now reflected in our quarter-end metrics. Let me highlight a few of them.
Net debt-to-EBITDA stands at 5.2x. Our average debt maturity remains at a sector-leading 11-plus years and our weighted average interest rate is just above 4% although most all of it fixed. 
On the equity side, we raised $55 million of common stock through our ATM program during the quarter at an average price per share of $159.38, bringing our year-to-date total ATM issuance to $146 million. As a result of this activity, at quarter end, we had cash on the balance sheet of $100 million and our $800 million credit facility was completely undrawn. 
From a capital standpoint, the significant level of liquidity positions us well as we close out 2016 and head in to 2017. 
As it relates to development and redevelopment, we expect to spend approximately $150 million in the fourth quarter and $400 million to $450 million in 2017. We will fund these capital requirements through a combination of cash on hand, free cash flow, opportunistic issuance under our ATM program and utilization on our line of credit, which we expect to repay through a bond issuance in late 2017, early 2018 or sooner if an attractive window is available to us. This mix will be dictated by our objective of maintaining our debt-to-EBITDA ratio in 5x to 5.5x range. 
Finally, on the acquisition front, while we don't have anything concrete, we could report at the moment we continue to pursue a number of compelling opportunities. While the market remains frothy from a valuation standpoint, we do see long-term value in these opportunities and we'll be aggressive in our pursuit. With 13 years of investment experience in my previous seat, I couldn't be more excited to bring that experience to Federal and work with Jeff Berkes and his acquisitions team on the West Coast and with Barry Carty and team as my partners on the East Coast as well as with the entire Federal Realty Investment Committee.
Lastly, before I turn it over to questions, I'd like to talk to you about my initial impressions from being here for almost 3 months from a, call it, a-new-to-Federal point of view.
First, and in my view, most importantly, the understanding that the commercial real estate business is constantly changing and changing quickly, especially in retail, is ingrained into Federal's DNA. Federal's approach is proactive and dynamic. It does not approach filling vacancies simply to maintain occupancy and cash flow at the property, but where it makes sense, uses that vacancy to reposition, remerchandise and redevelop the entire asset. Each decision that is made with the long-term goal of ensuring that each center is relevant for long term.
Second, the real estate really is that good. Before coming to Federal, I was aware that it had the best-in-class portfolio. In my first months here, I've traveled East and West Coasts seeing about half the portfolio so far, and the properties are even better than I had imagined. 
Third, I am convinced that we are creating the right environments at the mixed-use properties that we are currently developing. I had spent time at Assembly Row, Bethesda Row and Santana Row, and to give you a little insight into my personal life, I currently live at Pike & Rose, my work a block away and I spend a majority of my free evenings and many weekends at the property. You could say I've done my due diligence, a real live-work-play experience and I couldn't be more confident in the communities we are creating at Pike & Rose and Assembly Row. 
Lastly, I've been truly impressed with the management here. It would be easy for senior management to sit back and simply rely upon the power of best-in-class portfolio to grow, but there is foresight and dynamism in the way management is looking to implement its growth initiatives and is proactively making investments in its people and its systems in order to make this happen. 
You could imagine I've been in the weeds during his first 2.5 months here, digging into the detail that support these initial observations so I share them with you with confidence and conviction. 
I look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT and spending more time with each of you going forward to help you see what I'm seeing at Federal.

One of the things we really wrestled with this time is pretty -- Washington, D.C., in general, pre-election kind of every year goes into of ""fold your hands and not do much"" kind of mode and we have seen that in spades over the last 3 months not only in Pike & Rose, but anecdotally, everything we hear with respect to not only any other residential project but other real estate projects. So the decision-making then happens is -- has really slowed down. Now we wanted to be -- we're 86% leased at Pallas at about $2.40 a foot, Jeff. We expect that $2.40 a foot to grow, but far more modestly over the next couple of years than we had initially projected. So I think we're expecting that $2.40 through the next few years to go to something like $2.55. And initially, that number was $2.85 or $2.90. So I want to do something for you for a second on, if you wouldn't mind and indulge me, and it relates to our residential operations and our ability to figure out how to do that. I think this is a good time to talk about, if you wouldn't mind. If you take a look at what's happened with us in Bethesda, what's happened with us at Santana Row, what's happened with us behind Congressional, we know how to build residential. I think we do a really good job on it. If you were back in 2008 when we opened up Bethesda Row's upstairs product, 180 units there, we underwrote $2.55 and we hit $2.40 or $2.39 or something like that. So we missed those numbers in 2008, too. And if you can imagine what 2008 was like, actually that's probably understandable.  We're at $3.10 a foot today, and that's at over 3% CAGR over that period of time in a market where it also has a lot of additional supply. So the notion that -- from my perspective, the prudence to take that 7% -- to 6% to 7% is simply a recognition of not only the supply in the market but what is happening to create that real streak with the second phase right on top of the other. And accordingly, I just didn't feel right keeping the number where it was. But I don't -- I'm hoping that you don't view that as, my gosh, what in the world are these guys doing in residential? Take a look at Bethesda, take a look at the actual numbers on the West Coast, take a look at Congressional and I think you'll feel a whole lot different about it. But that's where we are, $2.40 to the mid-$2.50s or so over the period of time that we guided as opposed to something that was much closer to $2.85 or 2.90."

CocoWalk -- the dilution that would come from CocoWalk is part of a plan that would knock down part of the shopping center and effectively redevelop physically a big part of the shopping center. And obviously, from demolition cost to lost rents to disruption, obviously that's dilutive. To the extent we can't get the numbers to work, and again, that will come through Investment Committee next year, we won't do that. But I did not want to not include that in guidance to the extent we can get to it. Over at Sunset, it's a different story. At Sunset, we have there is a broken property. We've known that from the beginning. We had some nice income and FFO from that property in the first couple of years that we have it. But obviously, that income stream is being reduced as the conversation of a redeveloped property becomes very clear and have tenants sit there and don't perform. So there, we know we've got at least another year of entitlement work to do to be able to get to what is a much more significant redevelopment. We're not -- the only impact in 2017 will be a slowly shrinking income stream over there. So most of what we're talking about here is CocoWalk and a little bit of Sunset in '17."

We started at stack and after construction was underway, we leased 100% of the building. So just want to make sure you understand that. But before I get into the specifics on how we intend to approach the leasing of 700, let me tell you what 700 is. 500 Santana Row was adding an office building to Santana Row and a bunch of parking spaces that we can use nights and weekends. 700 is a lot more than that. With 700 Santana Row, we are capping off the end of Santana Row and really, for all intents and purposes, except for our last residential project over on the east side of the site, we're finishing Santana Row. So 700 Santana Row is some 30,000 square feet or about that of additional retail and restaurant on the ground floor with a magnificent plaza in front of it that's really going to complete how Santana looks and feels. And it's a 1,300-space parking garage, which is going to significantly add to the parking pool at the end of the street and help us drive rents and sales for the south of the Santana Row. So unlike 500 Santana, it's not just a spec office building. It is kind of a signature development that really caps off and finishes 700 Santana -- or finishes Santana Row. Now as it relates to the lease up of the office space, we are already out the market. It's way early. We already have a couple of nibbles, which are exciting. But leasing really will kick off in earnest, like it does with every building in Silicon Valley, when there's actually a hole in the ground and construction activity and that's not going to be until sometime next year. As we get into the year and we start to do tours and field interest in the building, we'll be making a decision about whether we look to lease that building 100% to one tenant or whether we break it up. When we leased 500, we were very intent on leasing that building to one tenant. 700 we'll have to wait and see. I think there's a higher likelihood we can multi-tenant at 700, which is why you're seeing an extended stabilization period vis-à-vis building like 500."

There's no question about it that if we've given everything I know, we would have probably put the money that is in the residential building in Pallas on the retail street first. At least, I would've done that. We had some disagreement within the company whether that made sense because, at the time, we did what we did for a very good reason and that was the existing shopping center that was there, which we did not disturb during the initial phase. It was extremely productive and effectively allowed us to move some of the tenants from that shopping center into the new shopping center like La Madeleine. So there were good reasons to do it, but it is important to have enough critical mass on the street to be able to create the environment. Now if the residential market has stayed as strong as it was, none of this would have mattered. And back to like most questions before, the residential would have powered right through without the environment on the street fully created. But when you have the weakness in the marketplace, there's no question that the reliance on the health of the established retail street is a critical component. I don't know if that helps or not, but that's what happened."

Is that purely because some of the retail that leases at the smaller spaces is sort of directly attributing to how the residential is going and then those are more amenity based and they're saying, hey, if the people aren't here, I'm not going to pay rent?

I don't know if he would -- I assume he'll add on to what I say. But the reality is today, and we've been talking about this for a while, retailers and this includes the boxes, this includes small people -- the small shops, it includes really most categories, are a whole lot more cautious with their underwriting and they're a whole lot more -- the negotiations are more retail-centric than they are landlord-centric at the moment in a number of places. And when it comes to development, the ability to underwrite sales in a new development is less predictable. So if the market is softer, and I do believe the market generally is softer from the standpoint of propensity to take risks and certainly in the Washington D.C. area, then you underwrite lower numbers. Lower numbers are lower rent, lower rent is a harder negotiation. It takes longer to do and it also includes the other terms associated with it. That's really what it's about from my perspective as I sit and see it. The other thing, and you see it up in Assembly to the other -- going the other way, when you've got a big sample size of first phase retail project there and that first phase is very successful, it makes a whole lot easier to lease that second phase. We don't have a big sample size in the first phase and that goes a little bit back to the questions asked before, and accordingly, it's a tougher economics to negotiate here. Having said that, I just don't -- I don't want -- I can't overemphasize enough the fact that the anchor system in the second phase is done and is critical to the project. So even if rents are a little lower in the remaining small shop space, that is not a big cause for the differential in the yield."

And then the second part of that is for Dan G, should we expect then that with the delay through 2019 until stabilization, does that mean that this project weighs on earnings until then?

The -- and I tried to address this in my remarks as best I could, the combination of all of the things including the decentralization, which is really working well as it relates to getting to redevelopment and getting to focus, those things as you have pointed out are dilutive in the short term. There's a lot of it. There's no doubt about that. It's happening at the same time that 2 major development projects, Pike & Rose and Assembly Row, are coming up with their heavy construction phases, which are also dilutive. So all of those things happening at the same time have the balance move down to 4% growth rather than 6% growth or as they're coming out  8% or 9%. If we don't do any more, George, you're looking at 8% and 9% earnings growth. The notion of getting there, but not having additional future raw material doesn't excite me. So I suspect what you will see is head down and executing what we have, a slowdown at the period of new raw material for new projects for the bulk of '17 to allow us to get back into balance. But this long-term business plan includes those initiatives as the way that we create value. So you will see them. I'm not going to tell you every year you have to wait till next year, you have to wait for the year after that, you have to wait for the year after that for earnings because that's not fair to do and it's not what our anticipation is.

Basically, at the end day, 10% of the value of this company with respect to big development is what I feel comfortable with and not more than that. In fact, if you sit back and you take a look at -- take a look over the last 3 years, you'll see that we peaked higher than we are today a couple of years ago. Remember the year was '13? When effectively we had all the Phase 1s that were not yet in service, but going and so you see this heavy construction in the Phase 2s right now. Those things as they are put into service will reduce the CIP and I don't think -- I think the way you should look at it is debt-to-EBITDA coverage, which we're very comfortable with in the low to mid-5, fixed charge coverage that's through the roof. It's kind of why we had prefunded a bunch of this development in the form of reducing our leverage in the company, terming out for 30 years is what we've got. But on broad basis, Chris, look at 10% of the enterprise value as kind of our rough estimate of the math.

Given these results, we're comfortable reaffirmi",2133,"Thank you, Leah, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported third quarter 2016 FFO per share of $1.41, 3.7% better than last year's exceptionally strong quarter and above our internal expectations. Given these results, we're comfortable reaffirming our previously issued guidance range for full year '16, in effect narrowing it a bit to $5.63 to $5.67. 
I want to talk about the third quarter's reported results, expectations for the balance of the year, and most importantly, what this means for '17 since we released initial guidance last night that falls short of Street expectations, mostly for value-enhancing initiatives that have short-term costs. More on that in a few minutes.
Let's get started with the quarter. At $1.41 a share, following $1.38 in the first quarter, $1.42 on the second, we're happy with that result, given the fact that as anticipated and as we've discussed previously, this is the quarter when you really see the full effect of the big vacancies we've been talking about in the past few quarters. Sports Authority is gone, the A&P, Hancock Fabrics, Hudson Trailer boxes are gone, et cetera, and they were all in and rent paying a year ago. When coupled with a particularly strong quarter a year ago where FFO per share had gone 11%, this all made for a tough year-over-year comparison. Those vacancies this quarter, along with the inclusion of poorly leased Sunset Place and CocoWalk, resulted in a reduction of our portfolio's lease percentage of 120 basis points to 94.3% and a physical occupancy reduction of 200 basis points.
Those vacancies, in addition to some strong bad debt recoveries and percentage rent positives in last year's quarter, resulted in an anemic same-store growth comparison by some 150 to 200 basis points lower than they would have otherwise have been. When you think about it, it does say an awful a lot about the portfolio that same-store grew 1.5% in the quarter that occupancy dipped as much as it did.
It would be wrong to conclude that leasing activity has trailed off, however, as can be seen in the leasing done this quarter. There was a lot of it. 93 comparable deals, that's more leases than any quarter in the last couple of years, for 427,000 feet of space at an average rent of $31.25, 14% higher than the tenants they replaced. In fact, over the first 9 months of this year, we've done 269 comparable deals for 1.2 million square feet, 17% more volume than the first 9 months of 2015.
And that leads me to the discussion that I want to have about our initial guidance for '17 of $5.83 to $5.93 per share, so let me pivot now and use the rest of my prepared remarks to discuss 2017. I think this will make us one of the first to issue guidance and this year particularly requires explanation.
And let me start out by being crystal clear that despite 4% projected FFO growth at the midpoint of guidance next year, nothing has changed in our outlook as to the achievability of hitting or beating our long-term business plan goal of doubling income over 10 years. In fact, it's precisely because of the items diluting 2017 that I have greater confidence we'll get there. To make it as clear as possible, we've included a schedule on this year's -- in this quarter's press release and 8-K on the reconciliation of FFO guidance -- on the FFO guidance page that will parallel the comments I'm about to make. 
A little background first as to why we are so aggressively repositioning so much of our portfolio. We see -- we have seen consumer behavior changing and changing at an accelerated pace and impacting nearly every business. Retail real estate is no exception. That's why a couple of years back, we turned up the heat on virtually every initiative we had at the same time in every facet of our business at a time when capital was cheap in an effort to put this best-of-class portfolio in the best possible shape to thrive in markets where consumers demand a higher level of service and an environment that they want to hang out in as an integral part of their lives. Of course, it takes time, often more than we would like, but we view it as critical to the long-term strengthening of this real estate portfolio. We feel that we're best positioned to do this given the quality locations of our real estate and our track record of success in transforming different types of retail real estate.
So, we accelerated the timing to start the second phases of our big mixed-use developments before the paint was dry in the first phase even though second phase construction affects first phase performance until the overall sense of place is established.
We jumped into Miami with not 1, but 2 new retail opportunities that fixed broken but well-located retail destinations even though the existing income stream will, of course, be disrupted in preparation of that process. We accelerated the full build-out of Santana Row, first with the option on the 12 acres across the street called Santana West then with the spec build, but now fully leased Splunk office building and currently with the approval and announcement to move forward with 215,310,000-square foot office and retail tower that will anchor the end of the street.
We restructured our personnel through a decentralization and systems investment initiative so that the human capital was sufficient, properly aligned and had the tools necessary to accelerate progress in both the mixed-use and the core portfolios. We took advantage of a very favorable capital environment, both by delevering concurrent with and somewhat ahead of heavy development spend and by turning on our debt portfolio with $700 million of 30-year unsecured bonds, creating a level of safety unmatched by any of our peers, of course, at the expense of lower earnings caused by higher short-term interest expenses and lower overall leverage. We have and continue to identify more value-enhancing redevelopment opportunities with our new decentralized structure than ever before in our history and we're getting more of them started faster even though they hurt short-term earnings. Many of those opportunities have been made possible by our ability to get back on the performing anchor boxes. 
And it's this last point, the one related to the far deeper redevelopment pools sparked by anchor vacancies that is one of the 3 main reasons 2017 appears light even though it is this redevelopment initiative that will drive significant value creation and earnings growth to follow. And if the markets are softening and the cost of money is increasing, the quality of the real estate location has always been the best hedge possible. We've got the best volume growth in the portfolio. I'll give you some numbers.
The re-lease of the excess anchor vacancy in the portfolio creates an obvious drag, earnings drag, until the spaces are coordinated into the bigger development plan. Then, in some cases, entitled, then leased, then turned over to the tenant for interior build-out, then occupied and finally rent paying. Generally, we're not just trying to re-lease vacant boxes, we are trying to reposition and fortify retail destinations and that simply takes longer.
Consider this. We have 700,000 square feet of anchor and near-anchor vacancy in the quarter. That's more than double the box vacancy that we have historically carried. It's Sports Authority, it's A&P, it's Hudson Trail, it's Hancock Fabrics, you know their names. The prior rent on that 730,000 feet was $19.75 and represents $14.5 million of rent or $0.20 a share of former in-place annual rent that's missing.
As of today, we've got 42% of that space re-leased and re-leased at 37% higher rent than was previously being paid. It's re-leased to Ulta and DSW at Brick shopping center, to Field & Stream and Uncle Giuseppe's at Melville Shopping Center, to T.J. Maxx at Pentagon Row, to L.A. Fitness at Delmar, et cetera. Every one of those deals is part of a much more comprehensive repositioning of the shopping center, not merely a re-leasing of the box. But it generally doesn't become rent paying until '17 and '18 with a heavy weighting toward the back end of '17 and '18. Accordingly, we forecast 2017 to be roughly $5 million or $0.07 a share lower than it otherwise would be.  Of course, the value creation of these redeveloped shopping centers will be significant when complete.
Now let's go to the big developments and talk through the natural short-term dilution that comes from the delivery and lease-up process associated with the residential development and Phase 2 of Assembly and Pike & Rose as well as the dilution that comes from a probable reconfiguration of CocoWalk that we considered in our 2017 guidance.
First, the Phase 2 residential building under construction at both Assembly and Pike & Rose. At Assembly, the 447-unit residential building, Whole Montage [ph], and at Pike & Rose, the 272-unit residential building called The Henri will both begin deliveries and lease up in '17. The dilution that comes from this process is expected to exceed $4 million or $0.06 a share. Operating costs, marketing, interest expense naturally exceed revenue as development turns over these building's operating fees. Expenses exceed revenue significantly at first unless those buildings lease up. It's unavoidable and will create an earnings drag of about $2 million before interest and an additional $2 million at the FFO line. Those 2 buildings alone are expected, however, to create well over $100 million of value when stabilized. 
Similarly, at CocoWalk in Florida, while we haven't completely finalized our redevelopment plans and numbers, we do hope to able to get those plans through our investment committee early next year, which will allow us to begin repositioning space and tenants and beginning construction at a portion of the shopping center in 2017. As you would expect -- as you would assume, occupancy at CocoWalk and at Sunset, for that matter, will get worse before it gets better and we thought it prudent to include the impact of Miami's first step toward repositioning estimated at a couple of cents a share in our guidance. Obviously, the value expected to be created at CocoWalk far exceeds the 2017 accounting cost. Basically, our 2017 guidance would have been roughly $0.16 a share higher if we were simply not building Phase 2s at Pike & Rose or Assembly and not proactively taking out our anchor space. Hopefully, the enhancements we're making to our disclosure including the timing of income coming online will provide more clarity now and in the future. Those are Dan’s ideas.
The final significant item affecting 2017 guidance is our lower near-term operating income expectations at Pike & Rose. Continuing softness in the Montgomery County, Maryland residential market, especially in the last 90 days, and the ongoing construction disruption of Phase 2 simply made me uncomfortable maintaining the 7% yield guidance at Pike & Rose. And accordingly, you'll note a change in our 8-K disclosure for both the first and the second phases, as I alluded to earlier, are so integrated that they really need to be used together to a 6% to 7% yield with better disclosure on the time periods for getting there. The disclosure now also includes site maps that we're adding that make the proximity of the Phase 2 construction to Phase 1 quite apparent, along with the land and entitlements for future phases. I -- we remain as positive as ever on what we're creating there, but have our eyes wide open as to the additional time that it's going to take to get there. The combined impact of that lower expected yield and lower pace are negatively impacting our '17 guidance by about $0.06 a share. All told, a $0.22 a share or more that is pushed back from '17 to the next 12, 24, 36 months in addition to the positive momentum in contributions for the many initiatives we're working on and from those that we'll add on to in the future. 
So, that's it for my prepared remarks. We've got a lot going on around here, it's a huge investment in our future, lots of construction in progress on the balance sheet in the right type of products for the future on some of the best pieces of real estate in some the best markets of the country, our heads are down and we continue to execute. I look forward to spending more time with many of you in a couple of weeks in Phoenix going through this and whatever else you'd like to talk through. 
Now let me turn it over to Dan before opening up the lines for your questions."

Don covered a lot in his remarks so I will fill just a few places as it relates to the third quarter and the balance of 2016. Then I want to spend some time going through a few specific areas that will help you with your modeling of Federal going forward. 
First, the third quarter. The $1.41 of FFO per share and same-store NOI growth of 1.5% were fully in step with our expectations for the quarter. As Melissa specifically discussed in our second quarter call in August, same-store growth is expected to decelerate in the second half of 2017 with most of that concentrated in the third quarter. Now that was due not only to the difficult third quarter comp we faced, but also due to the impact on occupancy and cash flow of our anchor repositioning activity.
With portfolio occupancy at 93.1% at quarter end versus 95.1% at third quarter 2015, note that almost 150 of the 200 basis point diminution can be attributed to those 8 anchor boxes that Don referenced in his remarks: the 3 A&Ps, 3 Sports Authority’s, Hudson Trail and Hancock Fabrics, which were all in occupancy in '15 were gone from third quarter of 2016. Also note that this vacancy, totaling over 320,000 square feet, is at highly productive centers located in dense in-fill markets, many of which we are redeveloping and remerchandising like Assembly Square in Boston, Melville Mall in Long Island, Montrose Crossing in North Bethesda, Westgate in San Jose, to name a few. Needless to say, we feel very good about our ability to reposition these boxes effectively.
Through the first 3 quarters of 2016, our same-store growth stands at 3%, 1.9% excluding redevelopments. We project fourth quarter to be in line with this run rate and expect same-store growth for the year to remain in the 3% area.
Next, on the development front with respect to Assembly Row and Pike & Rose, contribution for the third quarter was $6 million, up from $4.9 million during the second quarter. Assembly Row Phase 1 is 100% leased and now is producing approximately 95% of its projected stabilized property operating income or POI. As Don mentioned, Pike & Rose Phase 1 is behind from a run rate perspective, mostly driven by softness in effective rents at the PerSei and Pallas apartments and currently we are closer to a 60% projected stabilized POI on a run rate basis. Although we are pleased to be hitting our occupancy projections, the PerSei almost 98% leased and Pallas almost 86% leased at quarter end. Further, we continue to demand a premium to the market of 10% to 15%. 
Out west at 500 Santana Row, we are slightly ahead of plan and expect Splunk to open at the end of the fourth quarter. Just a reminder, this 234,000-square foot development is delivering a 9% cash on cost yield. Given the success at 500 Santana, combined with the continued strong demand for office space in this submarket, we are moving forward with the development of 700 Santana Row, a 310,000-square foot office and retail development located at the end of Santana Row, which will effectively finish off the street. We are projecting a stabilized cash on cost of 7% with projected delivery in 2019 and stabilization in 2021.
Now let me cover a few areas to provide additional clarity for your modeling of Federal going forward. As it relates to the core businesses and the impact of our anchor repositioning initiatives, we expect overall portfolio occupancy to stay at its current 93% through fourth quarter and remain at this level for most of 2017. We project occupancy will begin to improve at the end of 2017 and continue into 2019. 
With respect to the 730,000 square feet of anchor or near-anchor vacancy in effect during the third quarter, 42% or 310,000 square feet is leased. Of that 310,000, 135,000 will be rent paying by the end of 2016 with start dates for the remaining 175,000 square feet coming on over the course of 2017 and into 2018.
At this point, I would like to take a moment to highlight the new disclosure in our 8-K regarding Assembly Row, Pike & Rose as well as the recently added 700 Santana Row. In our supplemental information exhibit starting on Page 16, we have added detail which provides annual guidance on the timing of property operating income at these developments as each of the phases grow towards stabilization. We've also included site plans on the following pages for both of these communities to provide you with a sense of the progress and the scale of these projects and also to provide some context of the interconnection between the phases at each development.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. As you know, at the beginning of the third quarter we raised $250 million of 30-year unsecured notes that are REIT record yield for a 30-year of 3.75%. That issuance is now reflected in our quarter-end metrics. Let me highlight a few of them.
Net debt-to-EBITDA stands at 5.2x. Our average debt maturity remains at a sector-leading 11-plus years and our weighted average interest rate is just above 4% with almost all of it fixed. 
On the equity side, we raised $55 million of common stock through our ATM program during the quarter at an average price per share of $159.38, bringing our year-to-date total ATM issuance to $146 million. As a result of this activity, at quarter end, we had cash on the balance sheet of $100 million and our $800 million credit facility was completely undrawn. 
From a capital standpoint, the significant level of liquidity positions us well as we close out 2016 and head in to 2017. 
As it relates to development and redevelopment, we expect to spend approximately $150 million in the fourth quarter and $400 million to $450 million in 2017. We will fund these capital requirements through a combination of cash on hand, free cash flow, opportunistic issuance under our ATM program and utilization on our line of credit, which we expect to repay through a bond issuance in late 2017, early 2018 or sooner if an attractive window is available to us. This mix will be dictated by our objective of maintaining our debt-to-EBITDA ratio in 5x to 5.5x range. 
Finally, on the acquisition front, while we don't have anything concrete we can report at the moment we continue to pursue a number of compelling opportunities. While the market remains frothy from a valuation standpoint, we do see long-term value in these opportunities and we'll be aggressive in our pursuit. With 13 years of investment experience in my previous seat, I couldn't be more excited to bring that experience to Federal and work with Jeff Berkes and his acquisitions team on the West Coast and with Barry Carty and team as my partners on the East Coast as well as with the entire Federal Realty Investment Committee.
Lastly, before I turn it over to questions, I'd like to talk to you about my initial impressions from being here for almost 3 months from a, call it, a-new-to-Federal point of view.
First, and in my view, most importantly, the understanding that the commercial real estate business is constantly changing and changing quickly, especially in retail, is ingrained into Federal's DNA. Federal's approach is proactive and dynamic. It does not approach filling vacancies simply to maintain occupancy and cash flow at the property, but where it makes sense, uses that vacancy to reposition, remerchandise and redevelop the entire asset. Each decision that is made, was made with the long-term goal of ensuring that each center is relevant for the long term.
Second, the real estate really is that good. Before coming to Federal, I was aware that it had a best-in-class portfolio. In my first months here, I've traveled East and West Coasts seeing about half the portfolio so far, and the properties are even better than I had imagined. 
Third, I am convinced that we are creating the right environments at the mixed-use properties that we are currently developing. I had spent time at Assembly Row, Bethesda Row and Santana Row, and to give you a little insight into my personal life, I currently live at Pike & Rose, I work a block away and I spend a majority of my free evenings and many weekends at the property. You could say I've done my due diligence, a real live-work-play experience and I couldn't be more confident in the communities we are creating at Pike & Rose and Assembly Row. 
Lastly, I've been truly impressed with the management here. It would be easy for senior management to sit back and simply rely upon the power of best-in-class portfolio to grow, but there is foresight and dynamism in the way management is looking to implement its growth initiatives and is proactively making investments in its people and its systems in order to make this happen. 
You could imagine I've been in the weeds during this first 2.5 months here, digging into the detail that support these initial observations so I share them with you with confidence and conviction. 
I look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT and spending more time with each of you going forward to help you see what I'm seeing at Federal.
With that, operator, you can open up the line for questions."

One of the things we really wrestled with this time is pretty -- Washington, D.C., in general, pre-election kind of every year goes into a ""fold your hands",492,"Yes, let me take the first part of that, and Dan, jump on in on the second part of Jeff's question. One of the things we really wrestled with this time is pretty -- Washington, D.C., in general, pre-election kind of every year goes into a ""fold your hands and not do much"" kind of mode and we have seen that in spades over the last 3 months not only at Pike & Rose, but anecdotally, everything we hear with respect to not only any other residential project but other real estate projects. So, the decision-making then happens is -- has really slowed down. Now we wanted to be -- we're 86% leased at Pallas at about $2.40 a foot, Jeff. We expect that $2.40 a foot to grow, but far more modestly over the next couple of years than we had initially projected. So, I think we're expecting that $2.40 through the next few years to go to something like $2.55. And initially, that number was $2.85 or $2.90. So, I want to do something for you for a second on, if you wouldn't mind and indulge me, and it relates to our residential operations and our ability to figure out how to do that. I think this is a good time to talk about, if you wouldn't mind. If you take a look at what's happened with us in Bethesda, what's happened with us at Santana Row, what's happened with us behind Congressional, we know how to build residential. I think we do a really good job on it. If you were back in 2008 when we opened up Bethesda Row's upstairs product, 180 units there, we underwrote $2.55 and we hit $2.40 or $2.39 or something like that. So, we missed those numbers in 2008, too. And if you can imagine what 2008 was like, I think that's probably understandable.  We're at $3.10 a foot today, and that's at over 3% CAGR over that period of time in a market where it also has a lot of additional supply. So, the notion that -- from my perspective, the prudence to take that 7% -- to 6% to 7% is simply a recognition of not only the supply in the market but what is happening to create that real streak with the second phase right on top of the other. And accordingly, I just didn't feel right keeping the number where it was. But I don't -- I'm hoping that you don't view that as, my gosh, what in the world are these guys doing in residential? Take a look at Bethesda, take a look at the actual numbers on the West Coast, take a look at Congressional and I think you'll feel a whole lot different about it. But that's where we are, $2.40 to the mid-$2.50s or so over the period of time that we guided as opposed to something that was much closer to $2.85 or 2.90."

But I did not want to not include that in guidance to the extent we can get to it. Over at Sunset, it's a different story. At Sunset, we have -- there is a broken property. We've known that from the beginning. We had some nice income and FFO from that property in the first couple of years that we had it. But obviously, that income stream is being reduced as the conversation of a redeveloped property becomes very clear and as tenants sit there and don't perform. So there, we know we've got at least another year of entitlement work to do to be able to get to what is a much more significant redevelopment. We're not -- the only impact in 2017 will be a slowly shrinking income stream over there. So, most of what we're talking about here is CocoWalk and a little bit of Sunset in '17."

We started at spec and after construction was underway, we leased 100% of the building. So just want to make sure you understand that. But before I get into the specifics on how we intend to approach the leasing of 700, let me tell you what 700 is. 500 Santana Row was adding an office building to Santana Row and a bunch of parking spaces that we can use nights and weekends. 700 is a lot more than that. With 700 Santana Row, we are capping off the end of Santana Row and really, for all intents and purposes, except for our last residential project over on the east side of the site, we're finishing Santana Row. So, 700 Santana Row is some 30,000 square feet or about that of additional retail and restaurant on the ground floor with a magnificent plaza in front of it that's really going to complete how Santana looks and feels. And it's a 1,300-space parking garage, which is going to significantly add to the parking pool at the end of the street and help us drive rents and sales for the south end of Santana Row. So, unlike 500 Santana, it's not just a spec office building. It is kind of a signature development that really caps off and finishes 700 Santana -- or finishes Santana Row. Now as it relates to the lease up of the office space, we are already out in the market. It's way early. We already have a couple of nibbles, which are exciting. But leasing really will kick off in earnest, like it does with every building in Silicon Valley, when there's actually a hole in the ground and construction activity and that's not going to be until sometime next year. As we get into the year and we start to do tours and field interest in the building, we'll be making a decision about whether we look to lease that building 100% to one tenant or whether we break it up. When we leased 500, we were very intent on leasing that building to one tenant. 700 we'll have to wait and see. I think there's a higher likelihood we can multi-tenant at 700, which is why you're seeing an extended stabilization period vis-à-vis building like 500."

There's no question about it that if we've given everything I know, we would probably put the money that is in the residential building in Pallas on the retail street first. At least, I would've done that. We had some disagreement within the company whether that made sense because, at the time, we did what we did for a very good reason and that was the existing shopping center that was there, which we did not disturb during the initial phase. It was extremely productive and effectively allowed us to move some of the tenants from that shopping center into the new shopping center like La Madeleine. So, there were good reasons to do it, but it is important to have enough critical mass on the street to be able to create the environment. Now if the residential market had stayed as strong as it was, none of this would have mattered. And back to like Mueller’s questions before, the residential would have powered right through without the environment on the street fully created. But when you have the weakness in the marketplace, there's no question that the reliance on, or the health of the established retail street is a critical component. I don't know if that helps or not, but that's what happened."

And it sounds like the residential, like we understand that the residential Montgomery is more so that's pressuring the rents on the residential side, but can you just walk through why the retail would be pressured there? Is that purely because some of the retail that leases at the smaller spaces is sort of directly attributing to how the residential is going and then those are more amenity based and they're saying, hey, if the people aren't here, I'm not going to pay the rent? Or just help us walk through how those 2 are intertwined."

I don't know if he would -- I assume he'll add on to what I say. But the reality is today, and we've been talking about this for a while, retailers and this includes the boxes, this includes small people -- the small shops, it includes really most categories, are a whole lot more cautious with their underwriting and they're a whole lot more -- the negotiations are more retail-centric than they are landlord-centric at the moment in a number of places. And when it comes to development, the ability to underwrite sales in a new development is less predictable. So, if the market is softer, and I do believe the market generally is softer from the standpoint of propensity to take risks and certainly in the Washington D.C. area, then you underwrite lower numbers. Lower numbers are lower rent, lower rent is a harder negotiation. It takes longer to do and it also includes the other terms associated with it. That's really what it's about from my perspective as I sit and see it. The other thing, and you see it up in Assembly to the other -- going the other way, when you've got a big sample size of first phase retail project there and that first phase is very successful, it makes a whole lot easier to lease that second phase. We don't have a big sample size in the first phase of Pike & Rose and that goes a little bit back to the question that was asked before, and accordingly, it's a tougher economics to negotiate here. Having said that, I just don't -- I don't want -- I can't overemphasize enough the fact that the anchor system in the second phase is done and is critical to the project. So even if rents are a little lower in the remaining small shop space, that is not a big cause for the differential in the yield."

The -- and I tried to address this in my remarks as best I could, the combination of all of the things including the decentralization, which is really working well as it relates to getting to redevelopment and getting to focus, those things as you have pointed out are dilutive in the short term. There's a lot of it. There's no doubt about that. It's happening at the same time that 2 major development projects, Pike & Rose and Assembly Row, are coming up with their heavy construction phases, which are also dilutive. So all of those things happening at the same time has the balance move down to 4% growth rather than 6% growth or as they're coming out 8% or 9%. If we don't do any more, George, you're looking at 8% and 9% earnings growth. The notion of getting there, but not having additional future raw material doesn't excite me. So, I suspect what you will see is head down and executing what we have, a slowdown at the period of new raw material for new projects for the bulk of '17 to allow us to get back into balance. But this long-term business plan includes those initiatives as the way that we create value. So, you will see them. I'm not going to tell you every year you have to wait till next year, you have to wait for the year after that, you have to wait for the year after that for earnings because that's not fair to do and it's not what our anticipation is.

So, the notion that it will continue to always rise is not what you should be assuming. Basically, at the end of the day, 10% of the value of this company with respect to big development is what I feel comfortable with and not more than that. In fact, if you sit back and you take a look at -- take a look over the last 3 years, you'll see that we peaked higher than we are today a couple of years ago. Remember the year was '13? When effectively we had all the Phase 1s that were not yet in service, but going and so you’re seeing this heavy construction in the Phase 2s right now. Those things as they are put into service will reduce the CIP and I don't think -- I think the way you should look at it is debt-to-EBITDA coverage, which we're very comfortable with in the low to mid-5, fixed charge coverage that's through the roof. It's kind of why we prefunded a bunch of this development in the form of reducing our leverage in the company, terming out for 30 years is what we've got. But on broad basis, Chris, look at 10% of the enterprise value as kind of our rough estimate of the math. It's really much more limited by our debt coverage though and our fixed charge coverage and what we placed into service."

[Operator Instructions] And now I'd like to turn the call over to Don Wood to begin our discussion of our third quarter 2016 results. Don?"

Last night, we reported third quarter 2016 FFO per share of $1.41, 3.7% better than last year's exceptionally strong quarter and above our internal expectations. Given these results, we're comfortable reaffirming our previously issued guidance range for full year '16, in effect narrowing it a bit to $5.63 to $5.67. 
I want to talk about the third quarter's reported results, expectations for the balance of the year, and most importantly, what this means for '17 since we released initial guidance last night that falls short of Street expectations, mostly for value-enhancing initiatives that have short-term costs. More on that in a few minutes.
Let's get started with the quarter. At $1.41 a share, following $1.38 in the first quarter, $1.42 on the second, we're happy with that result, given the fact that as anticipated and as we've discussed previously, this is the quarter when you really see the full effect of the big vacancies we've been talking about in the past few quarters. Sports Authority is gone, the A&P, Hancock Fabrics, Hudson Trailer boxes are gone, et cetera, and they were all in and rent paying a year ago. When coupled with a particularly strong quarter a year ago where FFO per share had gone 11%, this all made for a tough year-over-year comparison. Those vacancies this quarter, along with the inclusion of poorly leased Sunset Place and CocoWalk, resulted in a reduction of our portfolio's lease percentage of 120 basis points to 94.3% and a physical occupancy reduction of 200 basis points.
Those vacancies, in addition to some strong bad debt recoveries and percentage rent positives in last year's quarter, resulted in an anemic same-store growth comparison by some 150 to 200 basis points lower than they would have otherwise have been. When you think about it, it does say an awful a lot about the portfolio that same-store grew 1.5% in the quarter that occupancy dipped as much as it did.
It would be wrong to conclude that leasing activity has trailed off, however, as can be seen in the leasing done this quarter. There was a lot of it. 93 comparable deals, that's more leases than any quarter in the last couple of years, for 427,000 feet of space at an average rent of $31.25, 14% higher than the tenants they replaced. In fact, over the first 9 months of this year, we've done 269 comparable deals for 1.2 million square feet, 17% more volume than the first 9 months of 2015.
And that leads me to the discussion that I want to have about our initial guidance for '17 of $5.83 to $5.93 per share, so let me pivot now and use the rest of my prepared remarks to discuss 2017. I think this will make us one of the first to issue guidance and this year particularly requires explanation.
And let me start out by being crystal clear that despite 4% projected FFO growth at the midpoint of guidance next year, nothing has changed in our outlook as to the achievability of hitting or beating our long-term business plan goal of doubling income over 10 years. In fact, it's precisely because of the items diluting 2017 that I have greater confidence we'll get there. To make it as clear as possible, we've included a schedule on this year's -- in this quarter's press release and 8-K on the reconciliation of FFO guidance -- on the FFO guidance page that will parallel the comments I'm about to make. 
A little background first as to why we are so aggressively repositioning so much of our portfolio. We see -- we have seen consumer behavior changing and changing at an accelerated pace and impacting nearly every business. Retail real estate is no exception. That's why a couple of years back, we turned up the heat on virtually every initiative we had at the same time in every facet of our business at a time when capital was cheap in an effort to put this best-of-class portfolio in the best possible shape to thrive in markets where consumers demand a higher level of service and an environment that they want to hang out in as an integral part of their lives. Of course, it takes time, often more than we would like, but we view it as critical to the long-term strengthening of this real estate portfolio. We feel that we're best positioned to do this given the quality locations of our real estate and our track record of success in transforming different types of retail real estate.
So, we accelerated the timing to start the second phases of our big mixed-use developments before the paint was dry in the first phase even though second phase construction affects first phase performance until the overall sense of place is established.
We jumped into Miami with not 1, but 2 new retail opportunities that fixed broken but well-located retail destinations even though the existing income stream will, of course, be disrupted in preparation of that process. We accelerated the full build-out of Santana Row, first with the option on the 12 acres across the street called Santana West then with the spec build, but now fully leased Splunk office building and currently with the approval and announcement to move forward with 215,310,000-square foot office and retail tower that will anchor the end of the street.
We restructured our personnel through a decentralization and systems investment initiative so that the human capital was sufficient, properly aligned and had the tools necessary to accelerate progress in both the mixed-use and the core portfolios. We took advantage of a very favorable capital environment, both by delevering concurrent with and somewhat ahead of heavy development spend and by turning on our debt portfolio with $700 million of 30-year unsecured bonds, creating a level of safety unmatched by any of our peers, of course, at the expense of lower earnings caused by higher short-term interest expenses and lower overall leverage. We have and continue to identify more value-enhancing redevelopment opportunities with our new decentralized structure than ever before in our history and we're getting more of them started faster even though they hurt short-term earnings. Many of those opportunities have been made possible by our ability to get back on the performing anchor boxes. 
And it's this last point, the one related to the far deeper redevelopment pools sparked by anchor vacancies that is one of the 3 main reasons 2017 appears light even though it is this redevelopment initiative that will drive significant value creation and earnings growth to follow. And if the markets are softening and the cost of money is increasing, the quality of the real estate location has always been the best hedge possible. We've got the best volume growth in the portfolio. I'll give you some numbers.
The re-lease of the excess anchor vacancy in the portfolio creates an obvious drag, earnings drag, until the spaces are coordinated into the bigger development plan. Then, in some cases, entitled, then leased, then turned over to the tenant for interior build-out, then occupied and finally rent paying. Generally, we're not just trying to re-lease vacant boxes, we are trying to reposition and fortify retail destinations and that simply takes longer.
Consider this. We have 700,000 square feet of anchor and near-anchor vacancy in the quarter. That's more than double the box vacancy that we have historically carried. It's Sports Authority, it's A&P, it's Hudson Trail, it's Hancock Fabrics, you know their names. The prior rent on that 730,000 feet was $19.75 and represents $14.5 million of rent or $0.20 a share of former in-place annual rent that's missing.
As of today, we've got 42% of that space re-leased and re-leased at 37% higher rent than was previously being paid. It's re-leased to Ulta and DSW at Brick shopping center, to Field & Stream and Uncle Giuseppe's at Melville Shopping Center, to T.J. Maxx at Pentagon Row, to L.A. Fitness at Delmar, et cetera. Every one of those deals is part of a much more comprehensive repositioning of the shopping center, not merely a re-leasing of the box. But it generally doesn't become rent paying until '17 and '18 with a heavy weighting toward the back end of '17 and '18. Accordingly, we forecast 2017 to be roughly $5 million or $0.07 a share lower than it otherwise would be.  Of course, the value creation of these redeveloped shopping centers will be significant when complete.
Now let's go to the big developments and talk through the natural short-term dilution that comes from the delivery and lease-up process associated with the residential development and Phase 2 of Assembly and Pike & Rose as well as the dilution that comes from a probable reconfiguration of CocoWalk that we considered in our 2017 guidance.
First, the Phase 2 residential building under construction at both Assembly and Pike & Rose. At Assembly, the 447-unit residential building, Whole Montage [ph], and at Pike & Rose, the 272-unit residential building called The Henri will both begin deliveries and lease up in '17. The dilution that comes from this process is expected to exceed $4 million or $0.06 a share. Operating costs, marketing, interest expense naturally exceed revenue as development turns over these building's operating fees. Expenses exceed revenue significantly at first unless those buildings lease up. It's unavoidable and will create an earnings drag of about $2 million before interest and an additional $2 million at the FFO line. Those 2 buildings alone are expected, however, to create well over $100 million of value when stabilized. 
Similarly, at CocoWalk in Florida, while we haven't completely finalized our redevelopment plans and numbers, we do hope to able to get those plans through our investment committee early next year, which will allow us to begin repositioning space and tenants and beginning construction at a portion of the shopping center in 2017. As you would expect -- as you would assume, occupancy at CocoWalk and at Sunset, for that matter, will get worse before it gets better and we thought it prudent to include the impact of Miami's first step toward repositioning estimated at a couple of cents a share in our guidance. Obviously, the value expected to be created at CocoWalk far exceeds the 2017 accounting cost. Basically, our 2017 guidance would have been roughly $0.16 a share higher if we were simply not building Phase 2s at Pike & Rose or Assembly and not proactively taking out our anchor space. Hopefully, the enhancements we're making to our disclosure including the timing of income coming online will provide more clarity now and in the future. Those are Dan’s ideas.
The final significant item affecting 2017 guidance is our lower near-term operating income expectations at Pike & Rose. Continuing softness in the Montgomery County, Maryland residential market, especially in the last 90 days, and the ongoing construction disruption of Phase 2 simply made me uncomfortable maintaining the 7% yield guidance at Pike & Rose. And accordingly, you'll note a change in our 8-K disclosure for both the first and the second phases, as I alluded to earlier, are so integrated that they really need to be used together to a 6% to 7% yield with better disclosure on the time periods for getting there. The disclosure now also includes site maps that we're adding that make the proximity of the Phase 2 construction to Phase 1 quite apparent, along with the land and entitlements for future phases. I -- we remain as positive as ever on what we're creating there, but have our eyes wide open as to the additional time that it's going to take to get there. The combined impact of that lower expected yield and lower pace are negatively impacting our '17 guidance by about $0.06 a share. All told, a $0.22 a share or more that is pushed back from '17 to the next 12, 24, 36 months in addition to the positive momentum in contributions for the many initiatives we're working on and from those that we'll add on to in the future. 
So, that's it for my prepared remarks. We've got a lot going on around here, it's a huge investment in our future, lots of construction in progress on the balance sheet in the right type of products for the future on some of the best pieces of real estate in some the best markets of the country, our heads are down and we continue to execute. I look forward to spending more time with many of you in a couple of weeks in Phoenix going through this and whatever else you'd like to talk through. 
Now let me turn it over to Dan before opening up the lines for your questions."

Don covered a lot in his remarks so I will fill just a few places as it relates to the third quarter and the balance of 2016. Then I want to spend some time going through a few specific areas that will help you with your modeling of Federal going forward. 
First, the third quarter. The $1.41 of FFO per share and same-store NOI growth of 1.5% were fully in step with our expectations for the quarter. As Melissa specifically discussed in our second quarter call in August, same-store growth is expected to decelerate in the second half of 2017 with most of that concentrated in the third quarter. Now that was due not only to the difficult third quarter comp we faced, but also due to the impact on occupancy and cash flow of our anchor repositioning activity.
With portfolio occupancy at 93.1% at quarter end versus 95.1% at third quarter 2015, note that almost 150 of the 200 basis point diminution can be attributed to those 8 anchor boxes that Don referenced in his remarks: the 3 A&Ps, 3 Sports Authority’s, Hudson Trail and Hancock Fabrics, which were all in occupancy in '15 were gone from third quarter of 2016. Also note that this vacancy, totaling over 320,000 square feet, is at highly productive centers located in dense in-fill markets, many of which we are redeveloping and remerchandising like Assembly Square in Boston, Melville Mall in Long Island, Montrose Crossing in North Bethesda, Westgate in San Jose, to name a few. Needless to say, we feel very good about our ability to reposition these boxes effectively.
Through the first 3 quarters of 2016, our same-store growth stands at 3%, 1.9% excluding redevelopments. We project fourth quarter to be in line with this run rate and expect same-store growth for the year to remain in the 3% area.
Next, on the development front with respect to Assembly Row and Pike & Rose, contribution for the third quarter was $6 million, up from $4.9 million during the second quarter. Assembly Row Phase 1 is 100% leased and now is producing approximately 95% of its projected stabilized property operating income or POI. As Don mentioned, Pike & Rose Phase 1 is behind from a run rate perspective, mostly driven by softness in effective rents at the PerSei and Pallas apartments and currently we are closer to a 60% projected stabilized POI on a run rate basis. Although we are pleased to be hitting our occupancy projections, the PerSei almost 98% leased and Pallas almost 86% leased at quarter end. Further, we continue to demand a premium to the market of 10% to 15%. 
Out west at 500 Santana Row, we are slightly ahead of plan and expect Splunk to open at the end of the fourth quarter. Just a reminder, this 234,000-square foot development is delivering a 9% cash on cost yield. Given the success at 500 Santana, combined with the continued strong demand for office space in this submarket, we are moving forward with the development of 700 Santana Row, a 310,000-square foot office and retail development located at the end of Santana Row, which will effectively finish off the street. We are projecting a stabilized cash on cost of 7% with projected delivery in 2019 and stabilization in 2021.
Now let me cover a few areas to provide additional clarity for your modeling of Federal going forward. As it relates to the core businesses and the impact of our anchor repositioning initiatives, we expect overall portfolio occupancy to stay at its current 93% through fourth quarter and remain at this level for most of 2017. We project occupancy will begin to improve at the end of 2017 and continue into 2019. 
With respect to the 730,000 square feet of anchor or near-anchor vacancy in effect during the third quarter, 42% or 310,000 square feet is leased. Of that 310,000, 135,000 will be rent paying by the end of 2016 with start dates for the remaining 175,000 square feet coming on over the course of 2017 and into 2018.
At this point, I would like to take a moment to highlight the new disclosure in our 8-K regarding Assembly Row, Pike & Rose as well as the recently added 700 Santana Row. In our supplemental information exhibit starting on Page 16, we have added detail which provides annual guidance on the timing of property operating income at these developments as each of the phases grow towards stabilization. We've also included site plans on the following pages for both of these communities to provide you with a sense of the progress and the scale of these projects and also to provide some context of the interconnection between the phases at each development.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. As you know, at the beginning of the third quarter we raised $250 million of 30-year unsecured notes that are REIT record yield for a 30-year of 3.75%. That issuance is now reflected in our quarter-end metrics. Let me highlight a few of them.
Net debt-to-EBITDA stands at 5.2x. Our average debt maturity remains at a sector-leading 11-plus years and our weighted average interest rate is just above 4% with almost all of it fixed. 
On the equity side, we raised $55 million of common stock through our ATM program during the quarter at an average price per share of $159.38, bringing our year-to-date total ATM issuance to $146 million. As a result of this activity, at quarter end, we had cash on the balance sheet of $100 million and our $800 million credit facility was completely undrawn. 
From a capital standpoint, the significant level of liquidity positions us well as we close out 2016 and head in to 2017. 
As it relates to development and redevelopment, we expect to spend approximately $150 million in the fourth quarter and $400 million to $450 million in 2017. We will fund these capital requirements through a combination of cash on hand, free cash flow, opportunistic issuance under our ATM program and utilization on our line of credit, which we expect to repay through a bond issuance in late 2017, early 2018 or sooner if an attractive window is available to us. This mix will be dictated by our objective of maintaining our debt-to-EBITDA ratio in 5x to 5.5x range. 
Finally, on the acquisition front, while we don't have anything concrete we can report at the moment we continue to pursue a number of compelling opportunities. While the market remains frothy from a valuation standpoint, we do see long-term value in these opportunities and we'll be aggressive in our pursuit. With 13 years of investment experience in my previous seat, I couldn't be more excited to bring that experience to Federal and work with Jeff Berkes and his acquisitions team on the West Coast and with Barry Carty and team as my partners on the East Coast as well as with the entire Federal Realty Investment Committee.
Lastly, before I turn it over to questions, I'd like to talk to you about my initial impressions from being here for almost 3 months from a, call it, a-new-to-Federal point of view.
First, and in my view, most importantly, the understanding that the commercial real estate business is constantly changing and changing quickly, especially in retail, is ingrained into Federal's DNA. Federal's approach is proactive and dynamic. It does not approach filling vacancies simply to maintain occupancy and cash flow at the property, but where it makes sense, uses that vacancy to reposition, remerchandise and redevelop the entire asset. Each decision that is made, was made with the long-term goal of ensuring that each center is relevant for the long term.
Second, the real estate really is that good. Before coming to Federal, I was aware that it had a best-in-class portfolio. In my first months here, I've traveled East and West Coasts seeing about half the portfolio so far, and the properties are even better than I had imagined. 
Third, I am convinced that we are creating the right environments at the mixed-use properties that we are currently developing. I had spent time at Assembly Row, Bethesda Row and Santana Row, and to give you a little insight into my personal life, I currently live at Pike & Rose, I work a block away and I spend a majority of my free evenings and many weekends at the property. You could say I've done my due diligence, a real live-work-play experience and I couldn't be more confident in the communities we are creating at Pike & Rose and Assembly Row. 
Lastly, I've been truly impressed with the management here. It would be easy for senior management to sit back and simply rely upon the power of best-in-class portfolio to grow, but there is foresight and dynamism in the way management is looking to implement its growth initiatives and is proactively making investments in its people and its systems in order to make this happen. 
You could imagine I've been in the weeds during this first 2.5 months here, digging into the detail that support these initial observations so I share them with you with confidence and conviction. 
I look forward to seeing many of you at NAREIT and spending more time with each of you going forward to help you see what I'm seeing at Federal.
With that, operator, you can open up the line for questions."

One of the things we really wrestled with this time is pretty -- Washington, D.C., in general, pre-election kind of every year goes into a ""fold your hands",492,"Yes, let me take the first part of that, and Dan, jump on in on the second part of Jeff's question. One of the things we really wrestled with this time is pretty -- Washington, D.C., in general, pre-election kind of every year goes into a ""fold your hands and not do much"" kind of mode and we have seen that in spades over the last 3 months not only at Pike & Rose, but anecdotally, everything we hear with respect to not only any other residential project but other real estate projects. So, the decision-making then happens is -- has really slowed down. Now we wanted to be -- we're 86% leased at Pallas at about $2.40 a foot, Jeff. We expect that $2.40 a foot to grow, but far more modestly over the next couple of years than we had initially projected. So, I think we're expecting that $2.40 through the next few years to go to something like $2.55. And initially, that number was $2.85 or $2.90. So, I want to do something for you for a second on, if you wouldn't mind and indulge me, and it relates to our residential operations and our ability to figure out how to do that. I think this is a good time to talk about, if you wouldn't mind. If you take a look at what's happened with us in Bethesda, what's happened with us at Santana Row, what's happened with us behind Congressional, we know how to build residential. I think we do a really good job on it. If you were back in 2008 when we opened up Bethesda Row's upstairs product, 180 units there, we underwrote $2.55 and we hit $2.40 or $2.39 or something like that. So, we missed those numbers in 2008, too. And if you can imagine what 2008 was like, I think that's probably understandable.  We're at $3.10 a foot today, and that's at over 3% CAGR over that period of time in a market where it also has a lot of additional supply. So, the notion that -- from my perspective, the prudence to take that 7% -- to 6% to 7% is simply a recognition of not only the supply in the market but what is happening to create that real streak with the second phase right on top of the other. And accordingly, I just didn't feel right keeping the number where it was. But I don't -- I'm hoping that you don't view that as, my gosh, what in the world are these guys doing in residential?

But here's what's happening in Miami. Let's talk about that for a few minutes. The easier of the 2 to talk about is CocoWalk. CocoWalk -- the dilution that would come from CocoWalk is part of a plan that would knock down part of the shopping center and effectively redevelop physically a big part of the shopping center. And obviously, from demolition cost to lost rents to disruption, obviously, that's dilutive. To the extent we can't get the numbers to work, and again, that will come through Investment Committee next year, we won't do that. But I did not want to not include that in guidance to the extent we can get to it. Over at Sunset, it's a different story. At Sunset, we have -- there is a broken property. We've known that from the beginning. We had some nice income and FFO from that property in the first couple of years that we had it. But obviously, that income stream is being reduced as the conversation of a redeveloped property becomes very clear and as tenants sit there and don't perform. So there, we know we've got at least another year of entitlement work to do to be able to get to what is a much more significant redevelopment. We're not -- the only impact in 2017 will be a slowly shrinking income stream over there. So, most of what we're talking about here is CocoWalk and a little bit of Sunset in '17."

We started at spec and after construction was underway, we leased 100% of the building. So just want to make sure you understand that. But before I get into the specifics on how we intend to approach the leasing of 700, let me tell you what 700 is. 500 Santana Row was adding an office building to Santana Row and a bunch of parking spaces that we can use nights and weekends. 700 is a lot more than that. With 700 Santana Row, we are capping off the end of Santana Row and really, for all intents and purposes, except for our last residential project over on the east side of the site, we're finishing Santana Row. So, 700 Santana Row is some 30,000 square feet or about that of additional retail and restaurant on the ground floor with a magnificent plaza in front of it that's really going to complete how Santana looks and feels. And it's a 1,300-space parking garage, which is going to significantly add to the parking pool at the end of the street and help us drive rents and sales for the south end of Santana Row. So, unlike 500 Santana, it's not just a spec office building. It is kind of a signature development that really caps off and finishes 700 Santana -- or finishes Santana Row. Now as it relates to the lease up of the office space, we are already out in the market. It's way early. We already have a couple of nibbles, which are exciting. But leasing really will kick off in earnest, like it does with every building in Silicon Valley, when there's actually a hole in the ground and construction activity and that's not going to be until sometime next year. As we get into the year and we start to do tours and field interest in the building, we'll be making a decision about whether we look to lease that building 100% to one tenant or whether we break it up. When we leased 500, we were very intent on leasing that building to one tenant. 700 we'll have to wait and see. I think there's a higher likelihood we can multi-tenant at 700, which is why you're seeing an extended stabilization period vis-à-vis building like 500."

We had some disagreement within the company whether that made sense because, at the time, we did what we did for a very good reason and that was the existing shopping center that was there, which we did not disturb during the initial phase. It was extremely productive and effectively allowed us to move some of the tenants from that shopping center into the new shopping center like La Madeleine. So, there were good reasons to do it, but it is important to have enough critical mass on the street to be able to create the environment. Now if the residential market had stayed as strong as it was, none of this would have mattered. And back to like Mueller’s questions before, the residential would have powered right through without the environment on the street fully created. But when you have the weakness in the marketplace, there's no question that the reliance on, or the health of the established retail street is a critical component.

And it sounds like the residential, like we understand that the residential Montgomery is more so that's pressuring the rents on the residential side, but can you just walk through why the retail would be pressured there? Is that purely because some of the retail that leases at the smaller spaces is sort of directly attributing to how the residential is going and then those are more amenity based and they're saying, hey, if the people aren't here, I'm not going to pay the rent? Or just help us walk through how those 2 are intertwined."

I don't know if he would -- I assume he'll add on to what I say. But the reality is today, and we've been talking about this for a while, retailers and this includes the boxes, this includes small people -- the small shops, it includes really most categories, are a whole lot more cautious with their underwriting and they're a whole lot more -- the negotiations are more retail-centric than they are landlord-centric at the moment in a number of places. And when it comes to development, the ability to underwrite sales in a new development is less predictable. So, if the market is softer, and I do believe the market generally is softer from the standpoint of propensity to take risks and certainly in the Washington D.C. area, then you underwrite lower numbers. Lower numbers are lower rent, lower rent is a harder negotiation. It takes longer to do and it also includes the other terms associated with it. That's really what it's about from my perspective as I sit and see it. The other thing, and you see it up in Assembly to the other -- going the other way, when you've got a big sample size of first phase retail project there and that first phase is very successful, it makes a whole lot easier to lease that second phase. We don't have a big sample size in the first phase of Pike & Rose and that goes a little bit back to the question that was asked before, and accordingly, it's a tougher economics to negotiate here. Having said that, I just don't -- I don't want -- I can't overemphasize enough the fact that the anchor system in the second phase is done and is critical to the project. So even if rents are a little lower in the remaining small shop space, that is not a big cause for the differential in the yield."

And then the second part of that is for Dan G, should we expect then that with the delay through 2019 until stabilization, does that mean that this project weighs on earnings until then?

The -- and I tried to address this in my remarks as best I could, the combination of all of the things including the decentralization, which is really working well as it relates to getting to redevelopment and getting to focus, those things as you have pointed out are dilutive in the short term. There's a lot of it. There's no doubt about that. It's happening at the same time that 2 major development projects, Pike & Rose and Assembly Row, are coming up with their heavy construction phases, which are also dilutive. So all of those things happening at the same time has the balance move down to 4% growth rather than 6% growth or as they're coming out 8% or 9%. If we don't do any more, George, you're looking at 8% and 9% earnings growth. The notion of getting there, but not having additional future raw material doesn't excite me. So, I suspect what you will see is head down and executing what we have, a slowdown at the period of new raw material for new projects for the bulk of '17 to allow us to get back into balance. But this long-term business plan includes those initiatives as the way that we create value. So, you will see them. I'm not going to tell you every year you have to wait till next year, you have to wait for the year after that, you have to wait for the year after that for earnings because that's not fair to do and it's not what our anticipation is.

So, the notion that it will continue to always rise is not what you should be assuming. Basically, at the end of the day, 10% of the value of this company with respect to big development is what I feel comfortable with and not more than that. In fact, if you sit back and you take a look at -- take a look over the last 3 years, you'll see that we peaked higher than we are today a couple of years ago. Remember the year was '13? When effectively we had all the Phase 1s that were not yet in service, but going and so you’re seeing this heavy construction in the Phase 2s right now. Those things as they are put into service will reduce the CIP and I don't think -- I think the way you should look at it is debt-to-EBITDA coverage, which we're very comfortable with in the low to mid-5, fixed charge coverage that's through the roof. It's kind of why we prefunded a bunch of this development in the form of reducing our leverage in the company, terming out for 30 years is what we've got. But on broad basis, Chris, look at 10% of the enterprise value as kind of our rough estimate of the math.
