For the quarter, our sales and gross margin results were largely in line with our expectations, with slightly better and benefits and a lower tax rate.

For the quarter, our sales and gross margin results were largely in line with our expectations, with slightly better and benefits and a lower tax rate. Our sales increased 3% to a record $4.8 billion. We opened 3 stores, including our first store in Huntsville Alabama, a new flagship store in downtown Los Angeles. For the quarter, comp store sales declined 1.8% against the 4.7% increase in the prior year. In addition to headwinds from a tougher comparison and a highly competitive environment, the negative impact from cannibalization increased for the third consecutive quarter. 
We continue to be a destination for the holidays, with comps for Thanksgiving and Christmas week showing a nice lift over prior run rates. For the first 5 to -- from the first 5 to the last 11 weeks of the quarter, traffic and basket trends on both the 1- and 2-year basis showed improvement. We stepped up our value offerings to customers, primarily through more and deeper promotions, such as our customer appreciation Love Fest and 3-day sale and supplements, which were supported through social media, digital ads and select radio ads. Over the remainder of the year, we plan to continue our promotional strategy, including more personalized offers and increase and broaden our price investments as well.
Cost savings and SG&A, primarily salaries and benefits, were more than offset by investments in value and technology as well as deleverage in areas such as occupancy and depreciation, resulting in a 58 basis point decline in OM. We produced an 8.3% EBITDA margin, $0.46 in diluted earnings per share, $53 million in free cash flow and a 14% adjusted return on invested capital. 
In keeping with our new capital allocation strategy, we returned $679 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, ending the quarter with $1.4 billion in total available capital and $1. billion in total debt. 
Last quarter, we outlined our 9-point plan to fundamentally evolve the business, including active steps to improve our price perception and further differentiate and enhance our shopping experience. We're on track with that plan and would like to share some highlights of the progress we're making in several areas.
We continue to open innovative retail stores such as our downtown L.A. store, which broke regional records for opening-day and first-day sales and its first week sales and has already established itself as a full service grocery store and culinary destination. Featuring exciting venues such as the Claim Chef second outpost and our very own 8 [ph] bar, offering daily specials brunch as well as signature craft cocktails and beers. This store offers a fun and compelling in-store experience and is representative of how we continue to evolve for our customers. 
We welcome, who is our Global Vice President of Culinary and Hospitality. Tim has worked with some of the most recognized chefs and hotel brands in the world, and we look forward to his leadership in elevating our $3 billion prepared foods and bakery business to an even higher standard. 
Our Exclusive Brand sales increased to over $725 million or 15% of total sales, 150 basis point increase over the prior year. Notable product launches over the past year include a collection of bodycare products for babies, organic Greek yogurt, animal welfare-rated organic slice deli meats and an expanded assortment of seasonal and holiday items. 
Our Instacart sales continue to grow nicely, and we now offer delivery in 16 markets with many stores seeing sales as a percentage of total store in the mid- to high single digits and several stores averaging baskets over $100. We are in the process of expanding the service to more stores and several new markets this year. 
Our new labor scheduling program is now active across majority of our customer service teams. While still in the early innings, we are pleased with the labor savings we are seeing. We expect to have the program substantially in place across all U.S. customer service teams by the end of Q2 and a program to 2 additional teams in Q3. 
We are close to completing the pilot phase of our new point-of-sale system rollout, which is now being tested in select stores in 10 regions. We expect to complete the pilot phase over the next month, after which, the rollout will accelerate, and we are on track to be in all of our U.S. stores before the end of the calendar year. 
In our ongoing effort to better understand and offer more value to our customers, we have accelerated the first component of our national Affinity program. We're excited to announce today the launch of digital coupons within our Whole Foods Market mobile app, expanding the functionality beyond recipes and shopping lists. Coupons have been the top request among users. And now with a simple stand at the register, preloaded digital coupons can automatically be applied to matching items in the shopper's basket. We encourage everyone to download the app today and take advantage of deep discounts on everyday staples like milk, yogurt and granola, seasonal offers like $5 off dozen Whole trade roses just in time for Valentine's Day and more. This is a win for customers, a win for us as well as we will gain actionable customer data on a national scale. Over the coming months, we will expand and improve our offers as well as launch our national digital sales flyer, bringing our customers great savings on what they love to their fingertips. 
In addition, we have committed to expanding our Affinity test to a new market in Q3, our newly designed rewards program builds one of the best elements of our initial test but with lower costs.
Finally, with 13 365 Whole Foods Market lease is now signed. We are pleased to share the opening scheduled for our first stores. We expect to open several late California in late May, Lake Oswego in Oregon in July and Bellevue, Washington in August. We invite you to check out 365 by wfm.com for a taste of what's to come. 
Turning out our updated outlook for the year. We are raising our EPS outlook to reflect our slightly better-than-expected Q1 results. We saw an improvement in traffic trends over the course of Q1. And while we have seen some negative impact from weather events in the first 3 weeks of Q2, we are hopeful that comps improve going forward as comparisons get easier and our sales-building initiatives gain traction. We note, however, that there could be some offsetting impact from a ramp up in price investments and promotions through the year. Based on our Q1 results, we now expect the year-over-year decline in operating margin for the fiscal year of up to 70 basis points, reflecting increased value efforts as the year progresses, the year-over-year decline in gross margin, excluding LIFO, in Q2 through Q4, is expected to be greater than the 86 basis point decline in Q1. We expect our gross margin investment to be partially offset by a sequential increase in SG&A leverage. And excluding $0.02 to $0.05 per share in estimated net accretion related to debt finance buybacks, we expect fiscal year EPS of $1.53 or greater or $1.07 or greater for the remainder of the year. 
In closing, we are making measurable progress in our strategic plan to fundamentally evolve our business and we'll continue to do so over the remainder of the year. We believe we have taken the right steps to grow and improve our company and produce strong results and returns for our shareholders over the long term. 
We will now take questions."

So over the long run, you won't see small Whole Foods Market stores open up. That's going to be the purview of the 365. That's going to give 365 go in a lot of markets. We think the Whole Foods can't go bigger, more exciting boxes.

And we're working now in real estate. Now we have -- it's not going to be perfect for a while because working stores that are in the queue. But as we go through the real estate process, the smaller stores that come through real estate now are being slotted to be 365 stores. And the larger exciting stores, particularly in Irvine densely populated urban areas, are going to be Whole Foods Market. We think there's -- we got lots of growth room for both concepts and we're particularly excited to get those 365 stores open because I think people are going take very different perception of our company."

I agree with you that there is a certain relationship that needs to happen. But what we see the same thing in organic we see the same thing organic produce demand is high in those categories.

Our sales increased 3% to a record",1277,"Thanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. 
For the quarter, our sales and gross margin results were largely in line with our expectations, with slightly better leverage in salaries and benefits and a lower tax rate. Our sales increased 3% to a record $4.8 billion. We opened 3 stores, including our first store in Huntsville, Alabama, a new flagship store in downtown Los Angeles. For the quarter, comp store sales declined 1.8% against the 4.7% increase in the prior year. In addition to headwinds from a tougher comparison and a highly competitive environment, the negative impact from cannibalization increased for the third consecutive quarter. 
We continue to be a destination for the holidays, with comps for Thanksgiving and Christmas week showing a nice lift over prior run rates. For the first 5 to -- from the first 5 to the last 11 weeks of the quarter, traffic and basket trends on both the 1- and 2-year basis showed improvement. We stepped up our value offerings to customers, primarily through more and deeper promotions, such as our Customer Appreciation Love Fest and 3-day sale and supplements, which were supported through social media, digital ads and select radio ads. Over the remainder of the year, we plan to continue our promotional strategy, including more personalized offers and increase and broaden our price investments as well.
Cost savings and SG&A, primarily salaries and benefits, were more than offset by investments in value and technology as well as deleverage in areas, such as occupancy and depreciation, resulting in a 58-basis-point decline in OM. We produced an 8.3% EBITDA margin, $0.46 in diluted earnings per share, $53 million in free cash flow and a 14% adjusted return on invested capital. 
In keeping with our new capital allocation strategy, we returned $679 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, ending the quarter with $1.4 billion in total available capital and $1. billion in total debt. 
Last quarter, we outlined our 9-point plan to fundamentally evolve the business, including active steps to improve our price perception and further differentiate and enhance our shopping experience. We're on track with that plan and would like to share some highlights of the progress we're making in several areas.
We continue to open innovative retail stores, such as our downtown L.A. store, which broke regional records for opening-day and first-day sales and its first week sales and has already established itself as a full service grocery store and culinary destination. Featuring exciting venues such as acclaimed chef Roy Choi's second Chego outpost and our very own Eight Bar offering daily specials brunch as well as signature craft cocktails and beers. This store offers a fun and compelling in-store experience and is representative of how we continue to evolve for our customers. 
We welcome Tien Ho as our Global Vice President of Culinary and Hospitality. Tiem has worked with some of the most recognized chefs and hotel brands in the world, and we look forward to his leadership in elevating our $3 billion prepared foods and bakery business to an even higher standard. 
Our Exclusive Brands sales increased to over $725 million or 15% of total sales, 150-basis-point increase over the prior year. Notable product launches over the past year include a collection of body care products for babies, organic Greek yogurt, animal welfare-rated organic slice deli meats and an expanded assortment of seasonal and holiday items. 
Our Instacart sales continue to grow nicely, and we now offer delivery in 16 markets with many stores seeing sales as a percentage of total store in the mid- to high single digits and several stores averaging baskets over $100. We are in the process of expanding this service to more stores and several new markets this year. 
Our new labor scheduling program is now active across majority of our customer service teams. While still in the early innings, we are pleased with the labor savings we are seeing. We expect to have the program substantially in place across all U.S. customer service teams by the end of Q2 and introduce the program to 2 additional teams in Q3. 
We are close to completing the pilot phase of our new point-of-sale system rollout, which is now being tested in select stores in 10 regions. We expect to complete the pilot phase over the next month, after which the rollout will accelerate, and we are on track to be in all of our U.S. stores before the end of the calendar year. 
In our ongoing effort to better understand and offer more value to our customers, we have accelerated the first component of our national Affinity program. We're excited to announce today the launch of digital coupons within our Whole Foods Market mobile app, expanding the functionality beyond recipes and shopping lists. Coupons have been the top request among users, and now with a simple stand at the register, preloaded digital coupons can automatically be applied to matching items in the shopper's basket. We encourage everyone to download the app today and take advantage of deep discounts on everyday staples like milk, yogurt and granola; seasonal offers like $5 off a dozen Whole trade roses just in time for Valentine's Day; and more. This is a win for customers, a win for us as well as we will gain actionable customer data on a national scale. Over the coming months, we will expand and improve our offers as well as launch our national digital sales flyer, bringing our customers great savings on what they love to their fingertips. 
In addition, we have committed to expanding our Affinity test to a new market in Q3. Our newly designed rewards program builds one of the best elements of our initial test but with lower costs.
Finally, with 13 365 by Whole Foods Market lease is now signed. We are pleased to share the opening schedule for our first stores. We expect to open in Silver Lake, California in late May; Lake Oswego, Oregon in July; and Bellevue, Washington in August. We invite you to check out 365 by wfm.com for a taste of what's to come. 
Turning now to our updated outlook for the year. We are raising our EPS outlook to reflect our slightly better-than-expected Q1 results. We saw an improvement in traffic trends over the course of Q1, and while we have seen some negative impact from weather events in the first 3 weeks of Q2, we are hopeful that comps improve going forward as comparisons get easier and our sales-building initiatives gain traction. We note, however, that there could be some offsetting impact from a ramp-up in price investments and promotions through the year. 
Based on our Q1 results, we now expect the year-over-year decline in operating margin for the fiscal year of up to 70 basis points, reflecting increased value efforts as the year progresses. The year-over-year decline in gross margin, excluding LIFO in Q2 through Q4, is expected to be greater than the 86-basis-point decline in Q1. We expect our gross margin investment to be partially offset by a sequential increase in SG&A leverage. And excluding $0.02 to $0.05 per share in estimated net accretion related to debt finance buybacks, we expect fiscal year EPS of $1.53 or greater or $1.07 or greater for the remainder of the year. 
In closing, we are making measurable progress on our strategic plan to fundamentally evolve our business, and we'll continue to do so over the remainder of the year. We believe we are taking the right steps to grow and improve our company and produce strong results and returns for our shareholders over the long term. 
We will now take questions."

That's why when you talk about downtown Miami or downtown L.A., you're talking about fairly large stores that are really exciting fun stores to be in. With the 365 stores opening now, they're going to take the smaller footprint with a very curated product mix really focused on creating value for customers, a convenient quick shopping experience. So over the long run, you won't see small Whole Food Market stores open up. That's going to be the purview of the 365. That's going to give 365 stores can go in through a lot of markets. We think that Whole Foods can't go in with these bigger, more exciting boxes. And we're going to work for the Whole Foods Market stores to be very differentiated with a much more exciting experience than our competitors bring, so that's kind of our basic strategy. And we're working now in real estate. Now we have a -- it's not going to be perfect for a while because we're working threesome stores there. They're in the queue. But as we go through the real estate process, the smaller stores that come through real estate now are being slotted to be 365 stores. And the larger exciting stores, particularly in urban, densely-populated urban areas, are going to be Whole Foods Market. We think there's -- we got lots of growth room for both concepts.

For the quarter, our sales and gross margin results were largely in line with our expectations, with slightly better leverage in salaries and benefits and a lower tax rate. Our sales increased 3% to a record",1274,"Thanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everyone. 
For the quarter, our sales and gross margin results were largely in line with our expectations, with slightly better leverage in salaries and benefits and a lower tax rate. Our sales increased 3% to a record $4.8 billion. We opened 3 stores, including our first store in Huntsville, Alabama, a new flagship store in downtown Los Angeles. For the quarter, comp store sales declined 1.8% against the 4.7% increase in the prior year. In addition to headwinds from a tougher comparison and a highly competitive environment, the negative impact from cannibalization increased for the third consecutive quarter. 
We continue to be a destination for the holidays, with comps for Thanksgiving and Christmas week showing a nice lift over prior run rates. For the first 5 to -- from the first 5 to the last 11 weeks of the quarter, traffic and basket trends on both the 1- and 2-year basis showed improvement. We stepped up our value offerings to customers, primarily through more and deeper promotions, such as our Customer Appreciation Love Fest and 3-day sale in supplements, which were supported through social media, digital ads and select radio ads. Over the remainder of the year, we plan to continue our promotional strategy, including more personalized offers and increase and broaden our price investments as well.
Cost savings and SG&A, primarily salaries and benefits, were more than offset by investments in value and technology as well as deleveraging areas, such as occupancy and depreciation, resulting in a 58-basis-point decline in OM. We produced an 8.3% EBITDA margin, $0.46 in diluted earnings per share, $53 million in free cash flow and a 14% adjusted return on invested capital. 
In keeping with our new capital allocation strategy, we returned $679 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, ending the quarter with $1.4 billion in total available capital and $1. billion in total debt. 
Last quarter, we outlined our 9-point plan to fundamentally evolve the business, including active steps to improve our price perception and further differentiate and enhance our shopping experience. We're on track with that plan and would like to share some highlights of the progress we're making in several areas.
We continue to open innovative retail stores, such as our downtown L.A. store, which broke regional records for opening-day and first-day sales and first week sales, and has already established itself as a full-service grocery store and culinary destination. Featuring exciting venues such as acclaimed chef Roy Choi's second Chego outpost and our very own Eight Bar offering daily specials, brunch as well as signature craft cocktails and beers, this store offers a fun and compelling in-store experience and is representative of how we continue to evolve for our customers. 
We welcome Tien Ho as our Global Vice President of Culinary and Hospitality. Tien has worked with some of the most recognized chefs and hotel brands in the world, and we look forward to his leadership in elevating our $3 billion prepared foods and bakery business to an even higher standard. 
Our Exclusive Brands sales increased to over $725 million or 15% of total sales, 150-basis-point increase over the prior year. Notable product launches over the past year include a collection of body care products for babies, organic Greek yogurt, animal welfare-rated organic sliced deli meats and an expanded assortment of seasonal and holiday items. 
Our Instacart sales continue to grow nicely, and we now offer delivery in 16 markets with many stores seeing sales as a percentage of total store in the mid- to high single digits and several stores averaging baskets over $100. We are in the process of expanding this service to more stores and several new markets this year. 
Our new labor scheduling program is now active across the majority of our customer service teams. While still in the early innings, we are pleased with the labor savings we are seeing. We expect to have the program substantially in place across all U.S. customer service teams by the end of Q2 and introduce the program to 2 additional teams in Q3. 
We are close to completing the pilot phase of our new point-of-sale system rollout, which is now being tested in select stores in 10 regions. We expect to complete the pilot phase over the next month, after which the rollout will accelerate, and we are on track to be in all of our U.S. stores before the end of the calendar year. 
In our ongoing effort to better understand and offer more value to our customers, we have accelerated the first component of our national Affinity program. We're excited to announce today the launch of digital coupons within our Whole Foods Market mobile app, expanding the functionality beyond recipes and shopping lists. Coupons have been the top request among users, and now with a simple scan at the register, preloaded digital coupons can automatically be applied to matching items in the shopper's basket. We encourage everyone to download the app today and take advantage of deep discounts on everyday staples like milk, yogurt and granola; seasonal offers like $5 off a dozen Whole trade roses just in time for Valentine's Day; and more. This is a win for customers, a win for us as well as we will gain actionable customer data on a national scale. Over the coming months, we will expand and improve our offers as well as launch our national digital sales flyer, bringing our customers great savings on what they love to their fingertips. 
In addition, we have committed to expanding our Affinity test to a new market in Q3. Our newly designed rewards program builds one of the best elements of our initial test but with lower costs.
Finally, with 13 365 by Whole Foods Market leases now signed, we are pleased to share the opening schedule for our first stores. We expect to open in Silver Lake, California in late May; Lake Oswego, Oregon in July; and Bellevue, Washington in August. We invite you to check out 365 by wfm.com for a taste of what's to come. 
Turning now to our updated outlook for the year. We are raising our EPS outlook to reflect our slightly better-than-expected Q1 results. We saw an improvement in traffic trends over the course of Q1, and while we have seen some negative impact from weather events in the first 3 weeks of Q2, we are hopeful that comps improve going forward as comparisons get easier and our sales-building initiatives gain traction. We note, however, that there could be some offsetting impact from a ramp-up in price investments and promotions through the year. 
Based on our Q1 results, we now expect a year-over-year decline in operating margin for the fiscal year of up to 70 basis points, reflecting increased value efforts as the year progresses. The year-over-year decline in gross margin, excluding LIFO in Q2 through Q4, is expected to be greater than the 86-basis-point decline in Q1. We expect our gross margin investment to be partially offset by a sequential increase in SG&A leverage. And excluding $0.02 to $0.05 per share in estimated net accretion related to debt finance buybacks, we expect fiscal year EPS of $1.53 or greater or $1.07 or greater for the remainder of the year. 
In closing, we are making measurable progress on our strategic plan to fundamentally evolve our business, and we'll continue to do so over the remainder of the year. We believe we are taking the right steps to grow and improve our company and produce strong results and returns for our shareholders over the long term. 
We will now take questions."

But what we think is when you've got a differentiated product, you have a certain -- it's going to sell if -- you can sell it at a different price than the conventional market. I agree with you that there is a certain relationship that needs to happen. But what we see there, we see the same thing in organic dairy, we see the same thing with organic produce that the demand is high in those categories. And so there isn't the kind of deflation in those categories that there isn't some of the conventional product categories. So everybody is paying a -- everybody's affected by that, and so we don't see where we sell so much organic product that there's really deflation in there. So it is not really affecting our ability to be competitive in large categories of what we -- of where we do business."

In a challenging sales environment, we delivered record sales of $3.7 billion and produced a healthy bottom line with a 9.5% EBITDA margin, $0.44 in diluted earnings per share, a record $343 million of operating",1315,"Thank you, Cindy. Good afternoon, everyone. In a challenging sales environment, we delivered record sales of $3.7 billion and produced a healthy bottom line with a 9.5% EBITDA margin, $0.44 in diluted earnings per share, a record $343 million of operating cash flow and 14% adjusted return on invested capital. We returned $144 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and in the quarter, $1.3 billion in total available capital and $1.1 billion in total debt.
We have committed to a fundamental restructuring of the cost side of our business. We want to appreciate our leadership throughout the company for the strong discipline in managing expenses. We improved salaries and benefits expense by 96 basis points. However, these savings are more than offset by investments in value, technology and marketing as well as deleverage in areas such as occupancy and depreciation. As a result, operating margin declined 29 basis points, excluding a nonroutine supplier credit in the prior year.
We are facing ongoing headwinds from a highly competitive environment as well as cannibalization but the negative impact on our value -- of our value strategy was the primary factor for the moderation in our comps from Q1. Approximately 80 of the 120 basis point moderation was due to lower increase in average price per item, which is less than 1% was our lowest increase in 5 years. As we communicated last quarter, our value efforts ramped up in Q2 with increased promotions and broader and deeper price investments in select categories. We have increased our marketing spend to raise the visibility of these investments and are seeing a lift in unit volume. We believe improving our value perception is one of the key components in regaining our sales momentum. While we expect some continued sales impact, we plan to expand our price investments and add weekly deep discount promotions in select categories, which we actively marketed nationwide. Food retailing is evolving at an incredibly fast pace, and consumers have more options than ever before. In addition to becoming more competitive on price, we're making measurable progress and fundamentally evolving our business and providing an enhanced experience for our customers across all platforms before, during and after their visit.
I will now share some highlights of our progress. In our ongoing effort to better understand and offer more value to our customers, we began offering digital coupons within our Whole Foods Market app -- mobile app. This served as the launch of the first component of our national Affinity program as we now have actionable customer data on the national scale. We've already tripled our number of active users year-over-year and are seeing strong coupon redemptions. Later this summer, customers in Dallas will have access within our app to our newly designed rewards program, which builds upon the best elements of our initial program in Philadelphia but with lower cost. We are committed to expanding our personalization efforts. Once this market -- test market is complete, we intend to roll out our rewards program nationally. We intensified our customer acquisition efforts, realizing 30% increase in new customers into our database and a 10% increase in social media followers and engagement in just 1 quarter. With a rapidly growing customer database and a social imprint approaching 13 million followers, we are continuing to invest in digital strategies to convert our strong online traffic into sales. We're excited to announce that for the first time, customers can now order through our wholefoodsmarket.com website for delivery by Instacart, and we look forward to offering continual enhancements that will provide our customers a more seamless experience over time. Instacart has recently expanded to Orange County, Baltimore, Charlotte and San Antonio with additional markets coming soon. Collectively, Whole Foods and Instacart deliver fresh groceries to more households -- households in the United States than anyone else. 
We're continuing to hit major milestones in replacing our legacy systems with new technology platforms. We have completed a pilot phase for our new point-of-sale system and are now accelerating the rollout. We're on track to be in all of our U.S. stores before the end of the calendar year. This new unified system will provide many benefits, including operational efficiencies and consolidated item data to support personalized offers, category management and supplier collaboration. Our new labor scheduling program is now in place across all of our U.S. customer service teams, and we plan to introduce the program to 2 additional store teams in Q3. With this new program, we are saving administrative time and gaining insight on how to spend labor dollars more efficiently to better serve our customers. The benefits of this new tool will be more fully realized next fiscal year and beyond as we implemented company-wide and incorporate best practices into our labor budgeting process. With 19 leases now signed, we're very excited to be just 3 weeks away from opening our first 365 store by Whole Foods Market. Created to complement our Whole Foods Market stores, our new 365 format will offer our same industry-leading standards and dedication to food transparency delivered in a new way. The streamlined format is designed around affordability and convenience and will be supported by enhanced digital experiences. Opening May 25 in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, the 28,000 square foot store will be quickly followed by stores in Lake Oswego, Oregon and Bellevue, Washington. We believe there's a customer demand for both formats and as the second growth vehicle, 365 allows us to attack the value quality proposition in a new way while maintaining the integrity the Whole Foods Market brand represents in the marketplace. We're excited to get our first 3 stores open and to learn and evolve from there. We are continuing to invest in our team members' development and growth, including creating thousands of new jobs this year. Our 86,000 team members are the essential ingredient in creating our best-in-class customer experience, and we were very pleased to have once again earned a spot on Fortune Magazine's annual list of 100 best companies to work for. We are proud to be one of only 11 companies what made the list every year since its inception 19 years ago.
Turning now to our updated outlook. We expect to be at or below the low end of our prior sales and earnings per share ranges. While we beat our bottom line expectations in the first half of the year, primarily through better-than-projected leverage in salaries and benefits, our comp trends have yet to stabilize. We're hopeful the comps will improve over the course of the year as our sales-building initiatives gain traction and our comparisons get easier. Beginning in week 11 of Q3, we will anniversary the sharp drop in our comps last year after weights and measures audit generated negative national media attention. We expect the offsetting impact from our value strategy to continue, however, as we ramp up our price investments and promotions over the remainder of the year. Given our lower sales projections, we now expect SG&A leverage to be more in line with the 19 basis points we have produced year-to-date. This reflects the positive impact of our cost savings initiatives, net of higher depreciation and other cost, including additional marketing and technology investments we have approved for later in the year. Please refer to our press release for more details.
In closing, we continue to make measurable progress in our 9-point strategic plan to have all of our business and hope our remarks today highlight the fundamental transportation that is taking place within our company. We believe we are taking the right steps to grow and improve our company and produce strong results and returns for our shareholders over the long term.
We will now take questions. Our call will end at 4:45 Central Time today to allow more time for questions. [Operator Instructions]"

And what we've been seeing is as we ramped it up -- we started to really ramp it up to the year and in Q2, we made more investments, and we did some large national promotions in produce. We had a big citrus promotion early in the year. We had a really big -- our biggest -- we had organic strawberry promotion, which was the biggest promotion we've ever done. And for the first time, we've had marketing to go with it. We did not show marketing around that, and we saw our phenomenal uplift to that. And I'd say that, generally, in the areas where we've done these investments, we've been seeing a good uptick in the units. They haven't been as much as to offset the actual investment themselves, but we think that over the long term as customers get more used to these promos we're doing in these investments that we'll start to capture a larger percentage of their shopping."

We focused, for instance, in the produce department where we've taken certain categories, and we moved the regular pricing. We moved the regular pricing down in a few categories at the same time we've done some really strong promotions and -- because you've got to kind of do both in order to -- the promotions might bring people in, but once they're in the store, they want to see -- the prices the regular price as they look that are really important if they're going to buy be on the promotion. So it's very important to do both but I think ultimately it's really through the category management program that we're going to be able to determine what is actually the right mix between for -- in each department, for adjusting every day pricing for doing more promotion, we're going to be able to really look and see how not only -- were going to be able to do a lot of testing with that to really understand what is the most effective for our customers because, as Walter was saying earlier, answering the question about our kind of more core shoppers than more occasional shoppers, different strategies work for these different customers.

In a challenging sales environment, we delivered record sales of $3.7 billion and produced a healthy bottom line with a 9.5% EBITDA margin, $0.44 in diluted earnings per share, a record $343 million of operating",1315,"Thank you, Cindy. Good afternoon, everyone. In a challenging sales environment, we delivered record sales of $3.7 billion and produced a healthy bottom line with a 9.5% EBITDA margin, $0.44 in diluted earnings per share, a record $343 million of operating cash flow and 14% adjusted return on invested capital. We returned $144 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, ending the quarter with $1.3 billion in total available capital and $1.1 billion in total debt.
We have committed to a fundamental restructuring of the cost side of our business. We want to appreciate our leadership throughout the company for the strong discipline around managing expenses. We improved salaries and benefits expense by 96 basis points. However, these savings were more than offset by investments in value, technology and marketing as well as deleverage in areas such as occupancy and depreciation. As a result, operating margin declined 29 basis points, excluding a nonroutine supplier credit in the prior year.
We are facing ongoing headwinds from a highly competitive environment as well as cannibalization, but the negative impact on our value -- of our value strategy was the primary factor for the moderation in our comps from Q1. Approximately 80 of the 120 basis point moderation was due to lower increase in average price per item, which is less than 1%, was our lowest increase in 5 years. As we communicated last quarter, our value efforts ramped up in Q2 with increased promotions and broader and deeper price investments in select categories. We have increased our marketing spend to raise the visibility of these investments and are seeing a lift in unit volume. We believe improving our value perception is one of the key components in regaining our sales momentum. While we expect some continued sales impact, we plan to expand our price investments and add weekly deep discount promotions in select categories, which will be actively marketed nationwide. 
Food retailing is evolving at an incredibly fast pace, and consumers have more options than ever before. In addition to becoming more competitive on price, we're making measurable progress and fundamentally evolving our business and providing an enhanced experience for our customers across all platforms before, during and after their visit.  I will now share some highlights of our progress. 
In our ongoing effort to better understand and offer more value to our customers, we began offering digital coupons within our Whole Foods Market  mobile app. This served as the launch of the first component of our national affinity program, as we now have actionable customer data on a national scale. We have already tripled our number of active users year-over-year and are seeing strong coupon redemptions. Later this summer, customers in Dallas will have access within our app to our newly designed rewards program, which builds upon the best elements of our initial program in Philadelphia, but with lower cost. 
We are committed to expanding our personalization efforts. Once this market -- test market is complete, we intend to roll out our rewards program nationally. 
We intensified our customer acquisition efforts, realizing 30% increase in new customers into our database and a 10% increase in social media followers and engagement in just one quarter. With a rapidly growing customer database and the social imprint approaching 13 million followers, we are continuing to invest in digital strategies to convert our strong online traffic into sales. We're excited to announce that for the first time, customers can now order through our wholefoodsmarket.com website for delivery by Instacart, and we look forward to offering continual enhancements that will provide our customers a more seamless experience over time. Instacart has recently expanded to Orange County, Baltimore, Charlotte and San Antonio, with additional markets coming soon. Collectively, Whole Foods and Instacart deliver fresh groceries to more households in the United States than anyone else. 
We're continuing to hit major milestones in replacing our legacy systems with new technology platforms. We have completed the pilot phase for our new point-of-sale system and are now accelerating the rollout. We are on track to be in all of our U.S. stores before the end of the calendar year. This new unified system will provide many benefits, including operational efficiencies and consolidated item data to support personalized offers, category management and supplier collaboration. 
Our new labor scheduling program is now in place across all of our U.S. customer service teams, and we plan to introduce the program to 2 additional store teams in Q3. With this new program, we are saving administrative time and gaining insight on how to spend labor dollars more efficiently to better serve our customers. The benefits of this new tool will be more fully realized next fiscal year and beyond as we implement it company-wide and incorporate best practices into our labor budgeting process. 
With 19 leases now signed, we're very excited to be just 3 weeks away from opening our first 365 store by Whole Foods Market. Created to complement our Whole Foods Market stores, our new 365 format will offer our same industry-leading standards and dedication to food transparency delivered in a new way. The streamlined format is designed around affordability and convenience and will be supported by enhanced digital experiences. Opening May 25 in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, the 28,000 square foot store will be quickly followed by stores in Lake Oswego, Oregon and Bellevue, Washington. We believe there is a customer demand for both formats. And as the second growth vehicle, 365 allows us to attack the value quality proposition in a new way while maintaining the integrity the Whole Foods Market brand represents in the marketplace. We're excited to get our first 3 stores open and to learn and evolve from there. 
We are continuing to invest in our team members' development and growth, including creating thousands of new jobs this year. Our 86,000 team members are the essential ingredient in creating our best-in-class customer experience. And we were very pleased to have once again earned a spot on Fortune Magazine's annual list of 100 Best Companies to Work For. We are proud to be one of only 11 companies who have made the list every year since its inception 19 years ago.
Turning now to our updated outlook. We expect to be at or below the low end of our prior sales and earnings per share ranges. While we beat our bottom line expectations in the first half of the year, primarily through better-than-projected leverage in salaries and benefits, our comp trends are yet to stabilize. We're hopeful the comps will improve over the course of the year as our sales-building initiatives gain traction and our comparisons get easier. Beginning in week 11 of Q3, we will anniversary the sharp drop in our comps last year after a weights and measures audit generated negative national media attention. We expect the offsetting impact from our value strategy to continue, however, as we ramp up our price investments and promotions over the remainder of the year. Given our lower sales projections, we now expect SG&A leverage to be more in line with the 19 basis points we have produced year-to-date. This reflects the positive impact of our cost savings initiatives, net of higher depreciation and other cost, including additional marketing and technology investments we have approved for later in the year. Please refer to our press release for more details.
In closing, we continue to make measurable progress in our 9-point strategic plan to evolve our business and hope our remarks today highlight the fundamental transformation that is taking place within our company. We believe we are taking the right steps to grow and improve our company and produce strong results and returns for our shareholders over the long term.
We will now take questions. Our call end at 4:45 Central Time today to allow more time for questions. [Operator Instructions]"

We had a really big -- our biggest -- we had organic strawberry promotion, which was the biggest promotion we've ever done. And for the first time, we've had marketing to go with it. We did national marketing around that, and we saw a phenomenal uplift in that.

So maybe you can provide color on some of the other things or aspects that you are trying to implement that will actually differentiate Whole Foods from the group rather than moving more closely to them."

But we're -- that's not our -- if you look at our 9-point plan and as we continue to talk about it today, we're putting a lot of emphasis on continuing to provide new experiences, different experiences. We're opening up all the digital platforms to able to reach our customers in new ways, in different ways than we've been able to do previously. So really this is about much more than just price investments. I recognize many others have done those as well, and that's part of being in a grocery retail business. You're constantly chewing up not just on these conference calls but you're chewing up every day in the marketplace as markets change. But hopefully what you're running out of this group is a much broader thought process around how we think we can set ourselves apart, continue to differentiate and gain some momentum. And as AC mentioned, the promotions put the marketing around that, which also talks about the quality of their product, the opening up some of these platforms to offer new content and new options for customers. For example, they can shop for food now through wholefoodsmarket.com. That's a new thing we haven't been able to do before. And so in all these ways, I think we're trying to -- and the 365 John mentioned is, of course, another growth opportunity for the company and serving the customers in new ways. So I think you take the whole big picture and you say there is a lot going on here to regain momentum."

And competitors who're doing some things better than Whole Foods, we certainly want to -- we're going to learn from that, make our company better. But we are not standing still. In fact, I would argue that we're probably undergoing far more evolution in our company than ever before. And the final and probably the most important point, nobody, nobody comes close to matching our quality standards. We're the only one -- only supermarket in America that's 100% cage-free eggs.

And because you really you got to kind of do both in order to -- the promotions might bring people in, but then once they're in the store, they want to see -- the regular prices they look at are really important for us to going to buy beyond the promotion.

In a challenging sales environment, we delivered record sales of $3.7 billion and produced a healthy bottom line with a 9.5% EBITDA margin, $0.44 in diluted earnings per share, a record $343 million of operating",1312,"Thank you, Cindy. Good afternoon, everyone. In a challenging sales environment, we delivered record sales of $3.7 billion and produced a healthy bottom line with a 9.5% EBITDA margin, $0.44 in diluted earnings per share, a record $343 million of operating cash flow and 14% adjusted return on invested capital. We returned $144 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, ending the quarter with $1.3 billion in total available capital and $1.1 billion in total debt.
We have committed to a fundamental restructuring of the cost side of our business. We want to appreciate our leadership throughout the company for their strong discipline around managing expenses. We improved salaries and benefits expense by 96 basis points. However, these savings were more than offset by investments in value, technology and marketing as well as deleverage in areas such as occupancy and depreciation. As a result, operating margin declined 29 basis points, excluding a nonroutine supplier credit in the prior year.
We are facing ongoing headwinds from a highly competitive environment as well as cannibalization, but the negative impact on our value -- of our value strategy was the primary factor for the moderation in our comps from Q1. Approximately 80 of the 120 basis point moderation was due to lower increase in average price per item, which is less than 1%, was our lowest increase in 5 years. As we communicated last quarter, our value efforts ramped up in Q2 with increased promotions and broader and deeper price investments in select categories. We have increased our marketing spend to raise the visibility of these investments and are seeing a lift in unit volume. We believe improving our value perception is one of the key components in regaining our sales momentum. While we expect some continued sales impact, we plan to expand our price investments and add weekly deep-discount promotions in select categories, which will be actively marketed nationwide. 
Food retailing is evolving at an incredibly fast pace, and consumers have more options than ever before. In addition to becoming more competitive on price, we're making measurable progress in fundamentally evolving our business and providing an enhanced experience for our customers across all platforms before, during and after their visit.  I will now share some highlights of our progress. 
In our ongoing effort to better understand and offer more value to our customers, we began offering digital coupons within our Whole Foods Market mobile app. This served as the launch of the first component of our national Affinity program, as we now have actionable customer data on a national scale. We have already tripled our number of active users year-over-year and are seeing strong coupon redemptions. Later this summer, customers in Dallas will have access within our app to our newly designed rewards program, which builds upon the best elements of our initial program in Philadelphia, but with lower cost. 
We are committed to expanding our personalization efforts. Once this market -- test market is complete, we intend to roll out our rewards program nationally. 
We intensified our customer acquisition efforts, realizing 30% increase in new customers into our database and a 10% increase in social media followers and engagement in just one quarter. With a rapidly growing customer database and the social imprint approaching 13 million followers, we are continuing to invest in digital strategies to convert our strong online traffic into sales. We're excited to announce that for the first time, customers can now order through our wholefoodsmarket.com website for delivery by Instacart, and we look forward to offering continual enhancements that will provide our customers a more seamless experience over time. Instacart has recently expanded to Orange County, Baltimore, Charlotte and San Antonio, with additional markets coming soon. Collectively, Whole Foods and Instacart deliver fresh groceries to more households in the United States than anyone else. 
We're continuing to hit major milestones in replacing our legacy systems with new technology platforms. We have completed the pilot phase for our new point-of-sale system and are now accelerating the rollout. We are on track to be in all of our U.S. stores before the end of the calendar year. This new unified system will provide many benefits, including operational efficiencies and consolidated item data to support personalized offers, category management and supplier collaboration. 
Our new labor scheduling program is now in place across all of our U.S. customer service teams, and we plan to introduce the program to 2 additional store teams in Q3. With this new program, we are saving administrative time and gaining insight on how to spend labor dollars more efficiently to better serve our customers. The benefits of this new tool will be more fully realized next fiscal year and beyond as we implement it company-wide and incorporate best practices into our labor budgeting process. 
With 19 leases now signed, we're very excited to be just 3 weeks away from opening our first 365 store by Whole Foods Market. Created to complement our Whole Foods Market stores, our new 365 format will offer our same industry-leading standards and dedication to food transparency delivered in a new way. The streamlined format is designed around affordability and convenience and will be supported by enhanced digital experiences. Opening May 25 in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, the 28,000-square-foot store will be quickly followed by stores in Lake Oswego, Oregon, and Bellevue, Washington. We believe there is a customer demand for both formats. And as the second growth vehicle, 365 allows us to attack the value quality proposition in a new way while maintaining the integrity the Whole Foods Market brand represents in the marketplace. We're excited to get our first 3 stores open and to learn and evolve from there. 
We are continuing to invest in our team members' development and growth, including creating thousands of new jobs this year. Our 86,000 team members are the essential ingredient in creating our best-in-class customer experience. And we were very pleased to have once again earned a spot on Fortune Magazine's annual list of The 100 Best Companies to Work For. We are proud to be one of only 11 companies who have made the list every year since its inception 19 years ago.
Turning now to our updated outlook. We expect to be at or below the low end of our prior sales and earnings per share ranges. While we beat our bottom line expectations in the first half of the year, primarily through better-than-projected leverage in salaries and benefits, our comp trends have yet to stabilize. We're hopeful the comps will improve over the course of the year as our sales-building initiatives gain traction and our comparisons get easier. Beginning in week 11 of Q3, we will anniversary the sharp drop in our comps last year after a weights-and-measures audit generated negative national media attention. We expect the offsetting impact from our value strategy to continue, however, as we ramp up our price investments and promotions over the remainder of the year. Given our lower sales projections, we now expect SG&A leverage to be more in line with the 19 basis points we have produced year-to-date. This reflects the positive impact of our cost savings initiatives, net of higher depreciation and other costs, including additional marketing and technology investments we have approved for later in the year. Please refer to our press release for more details.
In closing, we continue to make measurable progress in our 9-point strategic plan to evolve our business and hope our remarks today highlight the fundamental transformation that is taking place within our company. We believe we are taking the right steps to grow and improve our company and produce strong results and returns for our shareholders over the long term.
We will now take questions. Our call will end at 4:45 Central Time today to allow more time for questions. [Operator Instructions]"

And what we've been seeing is as we -- and we've ramped it up. We've started to really ramp that up through the year, and in Q2 we made more investments. And we did some large national promotions in produce. We had a big citrus promotion early in the year. We had a really big -- our biggest -- we had our organic strawberry promotion, which was the biggest promotion we've ever done. And for the first time, we've had marketing to go with it. We did national marketing around that, and we saw a phenomenal uplift in that. And I'd say that, generally in the areas where we've done these investments, we've been seeing a good uptick in the units. They haven't been as much as to offset the actual investment themselves, but we think that over the long term, as customers get more used to these promos we're doing and these investments, that we'll start to capture a larger percentage of their shopping."

The digital coupons have been very, very popular, like with our Affinity customers in Philadelphia. And the price item investments we've done, we're studying the effects, but we're definitely seeing in some markets much more of a response to them than others. We're seeing -- in certain departments, we're seeing a lot more response to them than others. So it's still really early in our price investments, where we've purposely designed this to roll out kind of slow and steady so we could learn from it and see what people really respond to. And I think the really exciting thing, though, that we've been doing is that we're really ramping up our marketing behind them. With the digital coupons, with our national flyer now, it's digital. It's going to be -- we're going to experiment with sending it out to -- in some markets, we're going to be mailing it to people's homes. So that, I think, is really the next big step for us because, I think I said earlier, just lowering some prices here and there and doing some promotions, if people don't really know about them, it's not -- we're not going to get the full effect.

We're also going to be doing some traditional stuff, advertising in the L.A. Times as well as lots of social media, working with BuzzFeed and few other groups. Anything else?"

And so we can actually -- through the tokenized data, we can actually follow what the customer's actually doing over time. And then we can also look at the segments and how we can respond to groups of customers as well. So we're putting in place some really good tools to be able to measure the investments.

We have -- last year we probably did a little more on the EDLP. This year we're kind of doing a combination. We focused, for instance, in the produce department, where we've taken certain categories and we moved the regular pricing. We moved the regular pricing down in a few categories. At the same time, we've done some really strong promotions. And because you really you got to kind of do both in order to -- the promotions might bring people in, but then once they're in the store, they want to see -- the regular prices they look at are really important for if they're to going to buy beyond the promotion. So it's very important to do both. But I think, ultimately, it's really through the category management program that we're going to be able to determine what is actually the right mix between -- in each department for adjusting everyday pricing, for doing more promotion. We're going to be able to really look and see how not only -- and we're going to be able to do a lot of testing with that to really understand what is the most effective for our customers. Because as Walter was saying earlier, answering the question about our kind of more core shoppers, then more occasional shoppers, different strategies work for these different customers. So what we're in a process of doing is really refining our ability and giving ourselves the tools we need to understand how we both price and market to the different customer -- customers we have, which will respond to different promotions and prices."

In the third quarter, we delivered record sales of $8.7 billion. We produced $0.37 in diluted earnings per share, $189 million of operating cash flow, 8.8% EBITDA margin and 13% adjusted return on invested cap",1292,"Thanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everybody. In the third quarter, we delivered record sales of $8.7 billion. We produced $0.37 in diluted earnings per share, $189 million of operating cash flow, 8.8% EBITDA margin and 13% adjusted return on invested capital. In keeping with our capital allocation strategy, we returned $239 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases ending the quarter with $1.1 billion in available capital. We opened 12 new stores including our first 365 by Whole Foods Market. As we discussed last quarter, we expanded our POTUS price investments and launched weekly deep discount promotions in several categories. We supported our efforts with an enhanced ad campaign, which in addition to produce, featured weekly meat, seafood and prepared foods offers and highlighted our quality differences. We produced a 45 basis point improvement in comps from last quarter as a significant improvement in items per basket more than offset decreases in transactions and average price per item. The combination of our value strategy, disinflation in some categories and customer's trading down to lower-priced items resulted in a year-over-year decline in average price per item. While our value strategies continued to negatively impact comps and gross margin, we are seeing a broad-based lip in items per basket and are encouraged with improving traffic trends in certain key departments and particularly produce. Our ongoing expense discipline is reflected in the 82 basis point improvement in salaries. However, these savings were more than offset by higher healthcare, depreciation, marketing and technology investments as a percentage of sales. Our marketing and technology investments were on budget, but greater-than-expected healthcare cost and lower-than-forecast sales resulted in the SG&A deleverage. Our catastrophic claims and cost for certain your prescription medicines were above forecast and while we're working to reverse these trends, these higher costs are expected to continue in the short term. As you recall back in February, we added digital coupons to our app, introducing the first component of our national affinity program. Coupons quickly became the most used feature within our app and customers can look forward to a continued expansion of offers. Today, we took another big step forward in our efforts to better understand and provide personalized offers to our customers with the market test launch of our new rewards programs in the Dallas and Fort Worth metro areas. Local customers can register at wholefoodsmarket.com to save instantly on member only deals like 10% off their first purchase, earn rewards for free products and receive surprises just for shopping in our stores. With each scan at the checkout, easy-to-use, customers increase their savings and personalized their future rewards. This new program builds upon our initial pilot in Philadelphia while adding improvements that allow us to be more strategic in the ways in which customers can earn and redeem their rewards. Once the test is complete, we look forward to national rollout of the program sometime next year. Just 2 weeks ago, we opened our second 365 store. We want to really   appreciate Jeff, Isabelle François and their team for all the hard work and enthusiasm that went into pulling up a highly successful launch of our new value brand. Designed around affordability and convenience and supported by enhanced digital experiences, 365 delivers a fresh new format to the marketplace and the customer response has been overwhelmingly positive. Through lower capital and operating cost, we were able to offer great values which we believe are attracting a broader customer basic than we typically see at Whole Foods Market stores. While 365 offers a curated mix at sharp price points, we are seeing larger basket sizes with more items versus our metro leverages. This is a pleasant surprise that has led us to a redesign to the front end already. Our 365 stores are first for us in so many ways from a streamlined operating model to centralized buying to auto-replenishment of inventory. With 20 stores in development, we're very excited about the learning potential and we are already using the shape -- already using this to shape and evolve not just feature 365 stores, but Whole Foods Market stores as well. This week, we also welcome 2 new flagship Whole Foods Market stores in Brooklyn, New York and Santa Clara, California. Averaging 50,000 square feet, most stores are designed to take advantage of the dense urban locations with extended prepared foods experiences. Our Williamsburg store in Brooklyn has taken our prepared foods venues to the next level, with the food hall, featuring some of New York City's best and most beloved up-and-coming favorites, like Luke's lobster trail cart, number 7 veggie and East Coast [indiscernible]. We work very closely with each partner to customize their menu and provide our customers a unique dining experienced they simply can't get anywhere else. Our store in Santa Clara, which is located in the heart of Silicon Valley, includes a taproom with local beers and wine and menu items designed by Top Chef finalist Melissa King. [ph] This store also features our partnership with imperfect produce as part of an ongoing commitment to reduce food waste. 
Turning now to the Q4 outlook. We opened 3 stores and expect to open 2 more. While we are hopeful this sequential improvement in comps continues especially in light of an easier 110 basis point comparison over the next 9 weeks. We have yet to see stability in our 2 year comp trends. In addition, we expect some ongoing headwinds from our value strategy and disinflation. If comps were in line with the negative 2.4% we have reported quarter-to-date and healthcare costs continue, the trends continue, we would expect sales growth of approximately 2% and diluted earnings per share of $0.23 to $0.24 for the quarter. As we stated, our strategies to adjust our operating model through lower margin and lower cost structure. Every major conversation we've had about investments and pricing technology and marketing is accompanied by conversation about lowering our cost structure to enhanced technology tools, labor restructuring and work process changes. Last November, we announced our goal to reduce cost structure by $300 million run rate by the end of fiscal '17. While we have some headwinds to overcome in the form of lower sales and a higher healthcare costs, that larger goal remains intact. As we look towards 2017, we expect ending square footage growth of approximately 6%, down from 7% this year. Next quarter, we will provide more information on the expected number of Whole Foods and 365 openings along with other fiscal year targets. While we remain confident in our long-term growth potential, we plan to grow square footage at a more moderate pace this next year to lessen the negative impact of cannibalization on our existing stores and to allow us to focus more time and resources on our key initiatives. We are reviewing our entire development pipeline and as appropriate, are making adjustments to capital budgets and operating models to reflect a more conservative projections for comps and gross margins as well as to apply the learnings from 365. In closing, food retailing has continued to evolve in incredibly fast pace and customers have more options than ever before and in the phase of this challenging environment, we're starting to see some encouraging signs in terms of our sales. We are making measurable progress and fundamentally evolving our business and providing an enhanced experience for our customers before, during and after their store visit. We remain focused on executing our 9-point plan which we believe will produce strong results and returns for our shareholders over the longer term. We will now take some questions. Call will end at 4:45 central time today to allow more time for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

And that's a very interesting opening for us because we don't think the cannibalization from 365 to Whole Foods Market is particularly great because as Walter indicated, we're getting rethinking customer in there. The Bellevue will be a good test because we're going up against one of our flagship stores there. And for your -- in both of our Lake ago in Portland and our Silver Lake store now in our LA area, the Whole Foods Market stores are not particularly close to it.

In the third quarter, we delivered record sales of $8.7 billion. We produced $0.37 in diluted earnings per share, $189 million of operating cash flow, 8.8% EBITDA margin and 13% adjusted return on invested cap",1306,"Thanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everybody. In the third quarter, we delivered record sales of $8.7 billion. We produced $0.37 in diluted earnings per share, $189 million of operating cash flow, 8.8% EBITDA margin and 13% adjusted return on invested capital. In keeping with our capital allocation strategy, we returned $239 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, ending the quarter with $1.1 billion in available capital. We opened 12 new stores, including our first 365 by Whole Foods Market. As we discussed last quarter, we expanded our produce price investments and launched weekly deep discount promotions in several categories. We supported our efforts with an enhanced ad campaign, which in addition to produce, featured weekly meat, seafood and prepared foods offers and highlighted our quality differences. We produced a 45 basis point improvement in comps from last quarter as a significant improvement in the items per basket, more than offset decreases in transactions and average price per item. The combination of our value strategy, disinflation in some categories and customers' trading down to lower-priced items resulted in a year-over-year decline in average price per item. While our value strategies continued to negatively impact comps and gross margin, we are seeing a broad-based leap in items per basket and are encouraged with improving traffic trends in certain key departments and particularly produce. Our ongoing expense discipline is reflected in the 82 basis point improvement in salaries. However, these savings were more than offset by higher health care, depreciation, marketing and technology investments as a percentage of sales. Our marketing and technology investments were on budget, but greater-than-expected health care costs and lower-than-forecast sales resulted in the SG&A deleverage. Our catastrophic claims and costs for certain new prescription medicines were above forecast and while we are working to reverse these trends, these higher costs are expected to continue in the short term. 
As you recall back in February, we added digital coupons to our app, introducing the first component of our national affinity program. Coupons quickly became the most used feature within our app and customers can look forward to a continued expansion of offers. Today, we took another big step forward in our efforts to better understand and provide personalized offers to our customers with a market test launch of our new rewards programs in the Dallas and Fort Worth metro areas. Local customers can register at wholefoodsmarket.com to save instantly on member-only deals like 10% off their first purchase, earn rewards for free products and receive surprises just for shopping in our stores. With each scan at the checkout, easy-to-use, customers increase their savings and personalize their future rewards. This new program builds upon our initial pilot in Philadelphia, while adding improvements that allow us to be more strategic in the ways in which customers can earn and redeem their rewards. Once the test is complete, we look forward to national rollout of the program sometime next year. 
Just 2 weeks ago, we opened our second 365 store. We want to really appreciate Jeff Turnas, Isabelle François and their team for all the hard work and enthusiasm that went into pulling up a highly successful launch of our new value brand. Designed around affordability and convenience and supported by enhanced digital experiences, 365 delivers a fresh new format to the marketplace, and the customer response has been overwhelmingly positive. Through lower capital and operating costs, we were able to offer great values, which we believe are attracting a broader customer base than we typically see at Whole Foods Market stores. While 365 offers a curated mix at sharp price points, we are seeing larger basket sizes with more items versus our metro averages. This is a pleasant surprise that has led us to a redesign of the front end already. 
Our 365 stores are first for us in so many ways from a streamlined operating model to centralized buying to auto-replenishment of inventory. With 20 stores in development, we're very excited about the learning potential and we are already using the shape -- already using these to shape and involve not just feature 365 stores, but Whole Foods Market stores as well. This week, we also welcome 2 new flagship Whole Foods Market stores in Brooklyn, New York and Santa Clara, California. Averaging 50,000 square feet, most stores are designed to take advantage of the dense urban locations with extended prepared foods experiences. Our Williamsburg store in Brooklyn has taken our prepared foods venues to the next level, with the food hall, featuring some of New York City's best, most beloved and up-and-coming favorites, like Luke's Lobster Tail Cart, No. 7 veggie and East Coast Poke. 
We work very closely with each partner to customize their menu and provide our customers with a unique dining experience they simply can't get anywhere else. Our store in Santa Clara, which is located in the heart of Silicon Valley, includes a taproom with local beers and wine and menu items designed by Top Chef finalist, Melissa King. This store also features our partnership with imperfect produce as a part of the ongoing commitment to reduce food waste. 
Turning now to the Q4 outlook. We've opened 3 stores and expect to open 2 more. While we are hopeful the sequential improvement in the comps continues, especially in light of an easier 110 basis point comparison over the next 9 weeks. We have yet to see stability in our 2-year comp trends. In addition, we expect some ongoing headwinds from our value and strategy and disinflation. If comps were in line with a negative 2.4% we have reported quarter-to-date and health care costs continue, the trends continue, we would expect sales growth of approximately 2% and diluted earnings per share of $0.23 to $0.24 for the quarter. As we stated, our strategy is to adjust our operating model through a lower margin and lower cost structure. Every major conversation we've had about investments and pricing technology and marketing is accompanied by a conversation about lowering our cost structure through enhanced technology tools, labor restructuring and work process changes. 
Last November, we announced our goal to reduce our cost structure by $300 million run rate by the end of fiscal '17. While we have some headwinds to overcome in the form of a lower sales and a higher health care costs, that larger goal remains intact. 
As we look towards 2017, we expect ending square footage growth of approximately 6%, down from 7% this year. Next quarter, we will provide more information on the expected number of Whole Foods and 365 openings, along with other fiscal year targets. While we remain confident in our long-term growth potential, we plan to grow square footage at a more moderate pace this next year, to lessen the negative impact of cannibalization on our existing stores and to allow us to focus more time and resources on our key initiatives. We are reviewing our entire development pipeline and as appropriate, are making adjustments to capital budgets and operating models to reflect more conservative projections for comps and gross margins as well as to apply the learnings from 365. 
In closing, food retailing has continued to evolve in an incredibly fast pace and customers have more options than ever before and in the phase of this challenging environment, we are starting to see some encouraging signs in terms of our sales. We are making measurable progress and fundamentally evolving our business and providing an enhanced experience for our customers before, during and after their store visit. We remain focused on executing our 9-point plan, which we believe will produce strong results and returns for our shareholders over the longer term. 
We will now take some questions. Call will end at 4:45 central time today to allow more time for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

But the big one was that, we are busier than we thought, so like we're -- we had capacity issues with getting customers through our register systems so. And also the big factors, the baskets are much bigger. So the kind of smaller teller-style registers that we were using were not effective for the size of the baskets we're getting. So we adjusted the design for Lake Oswego, we're going back and adjusting for Silver Lake and in all other future designs. So the great thing is with these first 3 stores, we are testing out a few product variations, a few layout variances with the idea being by the time we get the store for in Ohio that will be kind of completely dialed in."

We think we created a very successful new business model which we're going to expand rapidly, and we'll have more information about that next quarter. One thing relevant is we're opening our third 365 store in Seattle area in Bellevue in September. And that's a very interesting opening for us because we don't think the cannibalization from 365 to Whole Foods Market is particularly great, because as Walter indicated, we're getting -- we think we're getting a new customer in there. The Bellevue will be a good test because we're going up against one of our flagship stores there. And for -- in both of our Lake Oswego in Portland and our Silver Lake store in LA area, the Whole Foods Market stores are not particularly close to it. So Bellevue is very close, so that's going to be a very interesting. We'll have more information when we do our Q4 report of what kind of cannibalization impact is going to have. So we're very excited about that. We're very excited about 365, and we look forward to better informing you as time goes on."

In the third quarter, we delivered record sales of $8.7 billion. We produced $0.37 in diluted earnings per share, $189 million of operating cash flow, 8.8% EBITDA margin and 13% adjusted return on invested cap",1306,"Thanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everybody. In the third quarter, we delivered record sales of $8.7 billion. We produced $0.37 in diluted earnings per share, $189 million of operating cash flow, 8.8% EBITDA margin and 13% adjusted return on invested capital. In keeping with our capital allocation strategy, we returned $239 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, ending the quarter with $1.1 billion in available capital. We opened 12 new stores, including our first 365 by Whole Foods Market. As we discussed last quarter, we expanded our produce price investments and launched weekly deep discount promotions in several categories. We supported our efforts with an enhanced ad campaign, which in addition to produce, featured weekly meat, seafood and prepared foods offers and highlighted our quality differences. We produced a 45 basis point improvement in comps from last quarter as a significant improvement in items per basket, more than offset decreases in transactions and average price per item. The combination of our value strategy, disinflation in some categories and customers' trading down to lower-priced items resulted in a year-over-year decline in average price per item. While our value strategies continued to negatively impact comps and gross margin, we are seeing a broad-based lift in items per basket and are encouraged with improving traffic trends in certain key departments, particularly produce. Our ongoing expense discipline was reflected in the 82 basis point improvement in salaries. However, these savings were more than offset by higher health care, depreciation, marketing and technology investments as a percentage of sales. Our marketing and technology investments were on budget, but greater-than-expected health care costs and lower-than-forecast sales resulted in the SG&A deleverage. Our catastrophic claims and costs for certain new prescription medicines were above forecast and while we are working to reverse these trends, these higher costs are expected to continue in the short term. 
As you recall, back in February, we added digital coupons to our app, introducing the first component of our national affinity program. Coupons quickly became the most used feature within our app and customers can look forward to a continued expansion of offers. Today, we took another big step forward in our efforts to better understand and provide personalized offers to our customers with the market test launch of our new rewards programs in the Dallas and Fort Worth metro areas. Local customers can register at wholefoodsmarket.com to save instantly on member-only deals like 10% off their first purchase, earn rewards for free products and receive surprises just for shopping in our stores. With each scan at the checkout, easy-to-use, customers increase their savings and personalize their future rewards. This new program builds upon our initial pilot in Philadelphia, while adding improvements that allow us to be more strategic in the ways in which customers can earn and redeem their rewards. Once the test is complete, we look forward to a national rollout of the program sometime next year. 
Just 2 weeks ago, we opened our second 365 store. We want to really appreciate Jeff Turnas, Isabelle François and their team for all the hard work and enthusiasm that went into pulling off a highly successful launch of our new value brand. Designed around affordability and convenience and supported by enhanced digital experiences, 365 delivers a fresh new format to the marketplace, and the customer response has been overwhelmingly positive. Through lower capital and operating costs, we were able to offer great values, which we believe are attracting a broader customer base than we typically see at Whole Foods Market stores. While 365 offers a curated mix at sharp price points, we are seeing larger basket sizes with more items versus our metro averages. This is a pleasant surprise that has led us to a redesign of the front end already. 
Our 365 stores are firsts for us in so many ways, from a streamlined operating model to centralized buying to auto-replenishment of inventory. With 20 stores in development, we're very excited about the learning potential and we are already using the shape -- already using these to shape and evolve not just feature 365 stores but Whole Foods Market stores as well. This week, we also welcome 2 new flagship Whole Foods Market stores in Brooklyn, New York and Santa Clara, California. Averaging 50,000 square feet, both stores are designed to take advantage of the dense urban locations with extended prepared foods experiences. Our Williamsburg store in Brooklyn has taken our prepared foods venues to the next level, with a food hall, featuring some of New York City's best, most beloved and up-and-coming favorites, like Luke's Lobster Tail Cart, No. 7 Veggie and East Coast Poke. 
We work very closely with each partner to customize their menu and provide our customers with a unique dining experience they simply can't get anywhere else. Our store in Santa Clara, which is located in the heart of Silicon Valley, includes a taproom with local beers and wine and menu items designed by Top Chef finalist, Melissa King. This store also features our partnership with Imperfect Produce as a part of the ongoing commitment to reduce food waste. 
Turning now to the Q4 outlook. We have opened 3 stores and expect to open 2 more. While we are hopeful the sequential improvement in the comps continues, especially in light of an easier 110 basis point comparison over the next 9 weeks. We have yet to see stability in our 2-year comp trends. In addition, we expect some ongoing headwinds from our value strategy and disinflation. If comps were in line with a negative 2.4% we have reported quarter-to-date and health care costs continue, the trends continue, we would expect sales growth of approximately 2% and diluted earnings per share of $0.23 to $0.24 for the quarter. As we stated, our strategy is to adjust our operating model to a lower margin and lower cost structure. Every major conversation we've had about investments in pricing, technology and marketing is accompanied by a conversation about lowering our cost structure through enhanced technology tools, labor restructuring and work process changes. 
Last November, we announced our goal to reduce our cost structure by $300 million run rate by the end of fiscal '17. While we have some headwinds to overcome in the form of the lower sales and the higher health care costs, that larger goal remains intact. 
As we look towards 2017, we expect ending square footage growth of approximately 6%, down from 7% this year. Next quarter, we will provide more information on the expected number of Whole Foods and 365 openings, along with other fiscal year targets. While we remain confident in our long-term growth potential, we plan to grow square footage at a more moderate pace this next year, to lessen the negative impact of cannibalization on our existing stores and to allow us to focus more time and resources on our key initiatives. We are reviewing our entire development pipeline and as appropriate, are making adjustments to capital budgets and operating models to reflect more conservative projections for comps and gross margins as well as to apply the learnings from 365. 
In closing, food retailing has continued to evolve at an incredibly fast pace and customers have more options than ever before. And in the face of this challenging environment, we are starting to see some encouraging signs in terms of our sales. We are making measurable progress in fundamentally evolving our business and providing an enhanced experience for our customers before, during and after their store visit. We remain focused on executing our 9-point plan, which we believe will produce strong results and returns for our shareholders over the longer term. 
We will now take some questions. The call will end at 4:45 central time today to allow more time for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

These are all factors. Whole Foods Market being the leader, having very high sales per square foot. We probably feel the brunt of it as there's a bit of a regression to the mean as we lose customers from a convenience standpoint. People don't drive as far as they used to drive because good enough, there's good enough alternatives, in many cases, close by to them. They may not -- so people may not be driving as frequently as far as they used to because they can stop by a Kroger or an HEB or a Wegmans where -- to get products that they can -- used to only be able to get at Whole Foods, now there's some overlap in our product base in other competitors.

In the third quarter, we delivered record sales of $8.7 billion. We produced $0.37 in diluted earnings per share, $189 million of operating cash flow, 8.8% EBITDA margin and 13% adjusted return on invested cap",1306,"Thanks, Cindy, and good afternoon, everybody. In the third quarter, we delivered record sales of $8.7 billion. We produced $0.37 in diluted earnings per share, $189 million of operating cash flow, 8.8% EBITDA margin and 13% adjusted return on invested capital. In keeping with our capital allocation strategy, we returned $239 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, ending the quarter with $1.1 billion in available capital. We opened 12 new stores, including our first 365 by Whole Foods Market. As we discussed last quarter, we expanded our produce price investments and launched weekly deep discount promotions in several categories. We supported our efforts with an enhanced ad campaign, which in addition to produce, featured weekly meat, seafood and prepared foods offers and highlighted our quality differences. We produced a 45 basis point improvement in comps from last quarter as a significant improvement in items per basket, more than offset decreases in transactions and average price per item. The combination of our value strategy, disinflation in some categories and customers' trading down to lower-priced items resulted in a year-over-year decline in average price per item. While our value strategies continued to negatively impact comps and gross margin, we are seeing a broad-based lift in items per basket and are encouraged with improving traffic trends in certain key departments, particularly produce. Our ongoing expense discipline was reflected in the 82 basis point improvement in salaries. However, these savings were more than offset by higher health care, depreciation, marketing and technology investments as a percentage of sales. Our marketing and technology investments were on budget, but greater-than-expected health care costs and lower-than-forecast sales resulted in the SG&A deleverage. Our catastrophic claims and costs for certain new prescription medicines were above forecast and while we are working to reverse these trends, these higher costs are expected to continue in the short term. 
As you recall, back in February, we added digital coupons to our app, introducing the first component of our national affinity program. Coupons quickly became the most used feature within our app and customers can look forward to a continued expansion of offers. Today, we took another big step forward in our efforts to better understand and provide personalized offers to our customers with the market test launch of our new rewards programs in the Dallas and Fort Worth metro areas. Local customers can register at wholefoodsmarket.com to save instantly on member-only deals like 10% off their first purchase, earn rewards for free products and receive surprises just for shopping in our stores. With each scan at the checkout, easy-to-use, customers increase their savings and personalize their future rewards. This new program builds upon our initial pilot in Philadelphia, while adding improvements that allow us to be more strategic in the ways in which customers can earn and redeem their rewards. Once the test is complete, we look forward to a national rollout of the program sometime next year. 
Just 2 weeks ago, we opened our second 365 store. We want to really appreciate Jeff Turnas, Isabelle François and their team for all the hard work and enthusiasm that went into pulling off a highly successful launch of our new value brand. Designed around affordability and convenience and supported by enhanced digital experiences, 365 delivers a fresh new format to the marketplace, and the customer response has been overwhelmingly positive. Through lower capital and operating costs, we were able to offer great values, which we believe are attracting a broader customer base than we typically see at Whole Foods Market stores. While 365 offers a curated mix at sharp price points, we are seeing larger basket sizes with more items versus our metro averages. This is a pleasant surprise that has led us to a redesign of the front end already. 
Our 365 stores are firsts for us in so many ways, from a streamlined operating model to centralized buying to auto-replenishment of inventory. With 20 stores in development, we're very excited about the learning potential and we are already using the shape -- already using these to shape and evolve not just feature 365 stores but Whole Foods Market stores as well. This week, we also welcome 2 new flagship Whole Foods Market stores in Brooklyn, New York and Santa Clara, California. Averaging 50,000 square feet, both stores are designed to take advantage of the dense urban locations with extended prepared foods experiences. Our Williamsburg store in Brooklyn has taken our prepared foods venues to the next level, with a food hall, featuring some of New York City's best, most beloved and up-and-coming favorites, like Luke's Lobster Tail Cart, No. 7 Veggie and East Coast Poke. 
We work very closely with each partner to customize their menu and provide our customers with a unique dining experience they simply can't get anywhere else. Our store in Santa Clara, which is located in the heart of Silicon Valley, includes a taproom with local beers and wine and menu items designed by Top Chef finalist, Melissa King. This store also features our partnership with Imperfect Produce as a part of the ongoing commitment to reduce food waste. 
Turning now to the Q4 outlook. We have opened 3 stores and expect to open 2 more. While we are hopeful the sequential improvement in the comps continues, especially in light of an easier 110 basis point comparison over the next 9 weeks. We have yet to see stability in our 2-year comp trends. In addition, we expect some ongoing headwinds from our value strategy and disinflation. If comps were in line with a negative 2.4% we have reported quarter-to-date and health care costs continue, the trends continue, we would expect sales growth of approximately 2% and diluted earnings per share of $0.23 to $0.24 for the quarter. As we stated, our strategy is to adjust our operating model to a lower margin and lower cost structure. Every major conversation we've had about investments in pricing, technology and marketing is accompanied by a conversation about lowering our cost structure through enhanced technology tools, labor restructuring and work process changes. 
Last November, we announced our goal to reduce our cost structure by $300 million run rate by the end of fiscal '17. While we have some headwinds to overcome in the form of the lower sales and the higher health care costs, that larger goal remains intact. 
As we look towards 2017, we expect ending square footage growth of approximately 6%, down from 7% this year. Next quarter, we will provide more information on the expected number of Whole Foods and 365 openings, along with other fiscal year targets. While we remain confident in our long-term growth potential, we plan to grow square footage at a more moderate pace this next year, to lessen the negative impact of cannibalization on our existing stores and to allow us to focus more time and resources on our key initiatives. We are reviewing our entire development pipeline and as appropriate, are making adjustments to capital budgets and operating models to reflect more conservative projections for comps and gross margins as well as to apply the learnings from 365. 
In closing, food retailing has continued to evolve at an incredibly fast pace and customers have more options than ever before. And in the face of this challenging environment, we are starting to see some encouraging signs in terms of our sales. We are making measurable progress in fundamentally evolving our business and providing an enhanced experience for our customers before, during and after their store visit. We remain focused on executing our 9-point plan, which we believe will produce strong results and returns for our shareholders over the longer term. 
We will now take some questions. The call will end at 4:45 central time today to allow more time for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

These are all factors. Whole Foods Market being the leader, having very high sales per square foot. We probably feel the brunt of it as there's a bit of a regression to the mean as we lose customers from a convenience standpoint. People don't drive as far as they used to drive because good enough, there's good enough alternatives, in many cases, close by to them. They may not -- so people may not be driving as frequently as far as they used to because they can stop by a Kroger or an HEB or a Wegmans where -- to get products that they can -- used to only be able to get at Whole Foods, now there's some overlap in our product base in other competitors.

In Q4, sales increased 2% to a record $3.5 billion. We opened 5 new stores, including 2 365 stores. We continue to make selective investments on key items to narrow pricing gaps while offering strong weekly deals, which were supported by the continuation of our enhanced ad campaign.
We also successfully launched our new affinity Rewards programs in the Dallas/Fort Worth metro area. In a heightened competitive and promotional environment, we have remained focused on our initiatives to build sales over the long term and are seeing encouraging signs of customers responding, as reflected in our third consecutive quarter of improving items per basket.
As our value, personalization and marketing efforts gain traction and new sales-building initiatives roll out throughout the year, we expect our traffic trends to improve as well. In a challenging operating environment, we maintained our expense disciplines, delivering 8% EBITDA margin, $0.28 in earnings per share and $352 million in operating cash flow.
As highlighted in our press release, we have made measurable progress this year on our 9-point plan to position Whole Foods Market for continued success in an increasingly competitive marketplace. This includes one of our most important initiatives, which is to reduce expenses by a $300 million run rate by the end of fiscal year 2017.
We are pleased to report that as of year-end, we are more than 50% of the way toward our goal. The biggest reductions to date have been achieved through various labor-saving measures, including evolving our marketing and HR functions from a store to a metro model; reducing buying positions as we transform our purchasing operations; and combining certain store teams, such as meat and seafood, in lower-volume stores.
Many of these efforts allow us to focus our store labor investments where they are most needed, ensuring product availability, maintaining high standards and serving our customers. In addition to labor and benefits savings, we significantly reduced our supplies and packaging expense through a more consolidated purchasing program across regions. 
Another major accomplishment was the launch of our new value format, 365 by Whole Foods Market. We're using the learnings from our first 3 stores to shape and evolve our next round of 365 openings, and we're excited about the opportunities this streamlined operating model presents for our existing and future Whole Foods Market stores as well. 
We're also pleased to share that our unified point-of-sale system, including EMV technology, is now up and running across all of our U.S. stores. This was a significant undertaking involving the conversion of more than 6,200 checkout lanes. This system provides the foundation to enhance our promotional capabilities, including more dynamic and personalized offers through our mobile app and Rewards programs.
As we evolve our business model, our commitment to our core values, mission and culture has never been stronger, and we appreciate our team members for continuing to deliver a world-class shopping experience to our customers. In a year that presented many ongoing headwinds for food retailers, including deflation, increased competition from existing as well as new business models, and lackluster consumer demand, we produced industry-leading sales per square foot of $915 and a healthy 13% return on invested capital.
While sales were lighter than forecast, we achieved many of the fiscal year targets we provided in Q4 last year, including $1.52 in earnings per share, excluding buybacks and an 8.6% EBITDA margin. We produced more than $1.1 billion of operating cash flow and invested $716 million of capital, primarily in new and existing stores and technology initiatives, resulting in $400 million of free cash flow. And in keeping with our capital allocation strategy, we returned more than $1.1 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Turning to our outlook for fiscal year 2017. We expect sales growth of 2.5% to 4.5% and earnings per share, excluding potential future buybacks of $1.42 or greater. Our priorities include progressing to an always on unified marketing and media plan, using insights from our customer data and analytics to improve the relevancy, effectiveness and efficiency of our value and marketing investments; intensifying our personalization efforts, including the rollout of our optimized Rewards program to all U.S. stores; taking a more strategic approach to our assortments, pricing and promotions, including the continued development of category management tools, processes and capabilities to better inform our investments; evolving our purchasing structure to a hybrid model with global teams leading our category management efforts and regional teams focused on local products; leveraging our new culinary team's leadership and expertise to offer full spectrum of the highest quality, ready-made meal solutions, in-store or delivered to your door, including a pilot for curated meal kits; and offering our customers more convenience through expanded online delivery to more cities and additional ZIP Codes in existing markets.
So far in Q1, we have relocated our Center City Philadelphia store, which had the second-highest opening sales week in our company's history. And opened our first store in El Paso, Texas, which garnered significant media attention across Mexico and is doing twice its projected sales volume. Our new stores, on average, continue to be profitable in year 1, and we have many other exciting openings this year, including Bryant Park in New York City in January and Lakeview, Chicago this spring. At the same time, we believe it is prudent in this challenging retail environment to continue to moderate our lease signings, ending square footage growth and capital expenditures as a percentage of sales.
We have seen stability in comps over the last 2 quarters and an improvement in trends quarter-to-date for both traffic and basket size. We are encouraged that our value and marketing efforts appear to be gaining traction with customers and believe we will see momentum as our sales building initiatives are rolled out throughout the year. The competitive landscape is very dynamic, however, and it is uncertain how long the deflationary environment will continue. The high end of our 2% -- negative 2% to flat comp range reflects a negative 2.5% 2-year comp, slightly better than Q4's negative 2.8%, while the low end reflects the possibility that 2-year trends could get marginally worse before they get better, as we have seen quarter-to-date.
As we have stated, our strategy is to adjust our operating model to a lower margin and lower cost structure. Every major conversation we have about investments in pricing, technology and marketing is accompanied by a conversation about lowering our cost structure to enhanced technology tools, labor restructuring and work process changes. Last November, we announced our goal to reduce our cost structure by $300 million run rate by the end of fiscal year 2017. We expect to reach our goal but expect these savings to be more than offset by our investments to drive traffic and sales as well as higher occupancy, depreciation and other costs. Therefore, we expect a decline in operating margin of up to 60 basis points for the year, with greater declines in the first half, primarily related to higher year-over-year preopening expense in the first quarter and marketing expense in the first and second quarters. Please see our press release for more detailed guidance.
In closing, food retail is evolving at an incredibly fast pace and consumers have many more options for how and where they buy their food than ever before. At the same time, the market opportunity is expanding as the consciousness about fresh, healthy foods continues to awaken. Our company mission, commitment to transparency and a culture of innovation are more relevant and timely than ever. And where our company is today is just a shadow of where we think it will be in the future.
We sell the highest quality food in the world. Our standards lead the industry. And no one delivers the dynamic and compelling in-store experience that we do. We continue to see strong customer reception to our brand in new and existing markets as evidenced by recent openings. Our stores are highly profitable, with only 7 out of 456 stores at year-end not producing positive EBITDA before rent. 
We will keep innovating and creating opportunities for people to connect and find a sense of community in our stores and in the digital world. Promotions and price investments are an integral part of our conversation but we are not participating in a race to the bottom. Our strategy revolves around leading a race to the top in terms of the differentiated customer experience: continuing to raise the bar on our quality standards and selection, providing new levels of transparency and accountability and leveraging technology to deliver an improved shopping experience.
We believe we have the right strategies in place to position the company to produce strong results and returns for our shareholders over the long term. In a separate release today, we announced some coming structural and leadership changes. I want to take the opportunity to acknowledge and appreciate both Walter and Glenda for their many years of partnership and service to the company.
The significance of their countless contributions cannot be overstated. And we are grateful that both will continue to be involved in shaping our future.

And a couple of produce items, specifically avocados, through the big disruption in Mexico when we started to see an increase in there too. So I would say, overall, it was fairly balanced. And one thing to remember to, with us is that, when should an commodity products really dropped down, it doesn't affect us as much. So for instance, there's been a large decrease in the commodity eggs this year but those aren't the eggs we sell. Our eggs are all raised under contract to our quality standards by our producers who produce them based on cost to produce.

We did in the beginning -- in the summertime, we find the last, and I think this is true for a lot of retailers, the latter part of the summer is a slower period for us and we found that promotions during that period don't have as much of an impact as if they do, once you get past mid-July, promotions will have a stronger impact. So we have a lot of promotions early in the quarter, especially in our perishable areas and then as we got to later in the quarter, especially going into late July and August, we did a little less promotions but we started to pick that back up now and we're moving into a -- as we move into the holiday period, we've got some really.

In Q4, sales increased 2% to a record $3.5 billion. We opened 5 new stores, including 2 365 stores. We continue to make selective investments on key items to narrow pricing gaps while offering strong weekly deals, which were supported by the continuation of our enhanced ad campaign.
We also successfully launched our new affinity Rewards programs in the Dallas/Fort Worth metro area. In a heightened competitive and promotional environment, we have remained focused on our initiatives to build sales over the long term and are seeing encouraging signs of customers responding, as reflected in our third consecutive quarter of improving items per basket.
As our value, personalization and marketing efforts gain traction and new sales-building initiatives roll out throughout the year, we expect our traffic trends to improve as well. In a challenging operating environment, we maintained our expense disciplines, delivering 8% EBITDA margin, $0.28 in earnings per share and $352 million in operating cash flow.
As highlighted in our press release, we have made measurable progress this year on our 9-point plan to position Whole Foods Market for continued success in an increasingly competitive marketplace. This includes one of our most important initiatives, which is to reduce expenses by a $300 million run rate by the end of fiscal year 2017.
We are pleased to report that as of year-end, we are more than 50% of the way toward our goal. The biggest reductions to date have been achieved through various labor-saving measures, including evolving our marketing and HR functions from a store to a metro model; reducing buying positions as we transform our purchasing operations; and combining certain store teams, such as meat and seafood, in lower-volume stores.
Many of these efforts allow us to focus our store labor investments where they are most needed, ensuring product availability, maintaining high standards and serving our customers. In addition to labor and benefits savings, we significantly reduced our supplies and packaging expense through a more consolidated purchasing program across regions. 
Another major accomplishment was the launch of our new value format, 365 by Whole Foods Market. We're using the learnings from our first 3 stores to shape and evolve our next round of 365 openings, and we're excited about the opportunities this streamlined operating model presents for our existing and future Whole Foods Market stores as well. 
We're also pleased to share that our unified point-of-sale system, including EMV technology, is now up and running across all of our U.S. stores. This was a significant undertaking involving the conversion of more than 6,200 checkout lanes. This system provides the foundation to enhance our promotional capabilities, including more dynamic and personalized offers through our mobile app and Rewards programs.
As we evolve our business model, our commitment to our core values, mission and culture has never been stronger, and we appreciate our team members for continuing to deliver a world-class shopping experience to our customers. In a year that presented many ongoing headwinds for food retailers, including deflation, increased competition from existing as well as new business models, and lackluster consumer demand, we produced industry-leading sales per square foot of $915 and a healthy 13% return on invested capital.
While sales were lighter than forecast, we achieved many of the fiscal year targets we provided in Q4 last year, including $1.52 in earnings per share, excluding buybacks and an 8.6% EBITDA margin. We produced more than $1.1 billion of operating cash flow and invested $716 million of capital, primarily in new and existing stores and technology initiatives, resulting in $400 million of free cash flow. And in keeping with our capital allocation strategy, we returned more than $1.1 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Turning to our outlook for fiscal year 2017. We expect sales growth of 2.5% to 4.5% and earnings per share, excluding potential future buybacks of $1.42 or greater. Our priorities include progressing to an always on unified marketing and media plan, using insights from our customer data and analytics to improve the relevancy, effectiveness and efficiency of our value and marketing investments; intensifying our personalization efforts, including the rollout of our optimized Rewards program to all U.S. stores; taking a more strategic approach to our assortments, pricing and promotions, including the continued development of category management tools, processes and capabilities to better inform our investments; evolving our purchasing structure to a hybrid model with global teams leading our category management efforts and regional teams focused on local products; leveraging our new culinary team's leadership and expertise to offer full spectrum of the highest quality, ready-made meal solutions, in-store or delivered to your door, including a pilot for curated meal kits; and offering our customers more convenience through expanded online delivery to more cities and additional ZIP Codes in existing markets.
So far in Q1, we have relocated our Center City Philadelphia store, which had the second-highest opening sales week in our company's history. And opened our first store in El Paso, Texas, which garnered significant media attention across Mexico and is doing twice its projected sales volume. Our new stores, on average, continue to be profitable in year 1, and we have many other exciting openings this year, including Bryant Park in New York City in January and Lakeview, Chicago this spring. At the same time, we believe it is prudent in this challenging retail environment to continue to moderate our lease signings, ending square footage growth and capital expenditures as a percentage of sales.
We have seen stability in comps over the last 2 quarters and an improvement in trends quarter-to-date for both traffic and basket size. We are encouraged that our value and marketing efforts appear to be gaining traction with customers and believe we will see momentum as our sales building initiatives are rolled out throughout the year. The competitive landscape is very dynamic, however, and it is uncertain how long the deflationary environment will continue. The high end of our 2% -- negative 2% to flat comp range reflects a negative 2.5% 2-year comp, slightly better than Q4's negative 2.8%, while the low end reflects the possibility that 2-year trends could get marginally worse before they get better, as we have seen quarter-to-date.
As we have stated, our strategy is to adjust our operating model to a lower margin and lower cost structure. Every major conversation we have about investments in pricing, technology and marketing is accompanied by a conversation about lowering our cost structure to enhanced technology tools, labor restructuring and work process changes. Last November, we announced our goal to reduce our cost structure by $300 million run rate by the end of fiscal year 2017. We expect to reach our goal but expect these savings to be more than offset by our investments to drive traffic and sales as well as higher occupancy, depreciation and other costs. Therefore, we expect a decline in operating margin of up to 60 basis points for the year, with greater declines in the first half, primarily related to higher year-over-year preopening expense in the first quarter and marketing expense in the first and second quarters. Please see our press release for more detailed guidance.
In closing, food retail is evolving at an incredibly fast pace and consumers have many more options for how and where they buy their food than ever before. At the same time, the market opportunity is expanding as the consciousness about fresh, healthy foods continues to awaken. Our company mission, commitment to transparency and a culture of innovation are more relevant and timely than ever. And where our company is today is just a shadow of where we think it will be in the future.
We sell the highest quality food in the world. Our standards lead the industry. And no one delivers the dynamic and compelling in-store experience that we do. We continue to see strong customer reception to our brand in new and existing markets as evidenced by recent openings. Our stores are highly profitable, with only 7 out of 456 stores at year-end not producing positive EBITDA before rent. 
We will keep innovating and creating opportunities for people to connect and find a sense of community in our stores and in the digital world. Promotions and price investments are an integral part of our conversation but we are not participating in a race to the bottom. Our strategy revolves around leading a race to the top in terms of the differentiated customer experience: continuing to raise the bar on our quality standards and selection, providing new levels of transparency and accountability and leveraging technology to deliver an improved shopping experience.
We believe we have the right strategies in place to position the company to produce strong results and returns for our shareholders over the long term. In a separate release today, we announced some coming structural and leadership changes. I want to take the opportunity to acknowledge and appreciate both Walter and Glenda for their many years of partnership and service to the company.
The significance of their countless contributions cannot be overstated. And we are grateful that both will continue to be involved in shaping our future.
We'll now take questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

But the first one is on the basket. What's really -- yes, you did a good job on there. The first one that's really exciting looking at these results is if you look across the quintile data for the baskets, every single basket was moving up. And so what that says is that there's some real stability here. And particularly in the $100 basket, it's showing some nice growth, showing that our most loyal customers are continuing to shop with us. And the cool thing about the data and analytics we have now is we can actually look into that $100 basket, and we know what the drivers are in there. And we've got that to build on. Look, with respect to the -- and that's a capability we never really had before. With respect to the trips, I mean, it's -- clearly, this is a challenged environment for retail in general and trips, but actually in this queue, we saw in the time period, we've seen an improvement. We've seen it. It's still not where we want it, but it has improved sequentially. And I think that we've always said we got to go items first and from items we go to trips. And I think we're going to come on strong with the marketing investments issue that I think you're going to be pleased to see with our new leaders, Sonya Gafsi Oblisk. And we're going to really worked hard to drive and go right after those trips. So I think items lead first, and from then -- and then comes the trips."

We did see, in cost, in early in the quarter, we were definitely seeing some deflation. As the quarter went on, it moderated and we actually saw an uptick in certain categories like our farmed-raised salmon, which is a very big part of our seafood sales, so a dramatic increase towards the end of the quarter. And a couple of produce items, specifically avocados, through the big disruption in Mexico when we started to see an increase there, too. So I would say, overall, it was fairly balanced. And one thing to remember to, with us is that, our -- when certain commodity products really dropped down, it doesn't affect us as much. So for instance, there's been a large decrease in the commodity eggs this year, but those aren't the eggs we sell. Our eggs are all raised under contract to our quality standards by our producers who produce them based on cost to produce. So we're not as affected as much as by some of those big commodity swings with the products that we sell. So I'd say, overall, things were pretty flat for us in the quarter."

In Q4, sales increased 2% to a record $3.5 billion. We opened 5 new stores, including 2 365 stores. We continue to make selective investments on key items to narrow pricing gaps while offering strong weekly deals, which were supported by the continuation of our enhanced ad campaign.
We also successfully launched our new affinity Rewards programs in the Dallas/Fort Worth metro area. In a heightened competitive and promotional environment, we have remained focused on our initiatives to build sales over the long term and are seeing encouraging signs of customers responding, as reflected in our third consecutive quarter of improving items per basket.
As our value, personalization and marketing efforts gain traction and new sales-building initiatives roll out throughout the year, we expect our traffic trends to improve as well. In a challenging operating environment, we maintained our expense disciplines, delivering 8% EBITDA margin, $0.28 in earnings per share and $352 million in operating cash flow.
As highlighted in our press release, we have made measurable progress this year on our 9-point plan to position Whole Foods Market for continued success in an increasingly competitive marketplace. This includes one of our most important initiatives, which is to reduce expenses by a $300 million run rate by the end of fiscal year 2017.
We are pleased to report that as of year-end, we are more than 50% of the way toward our goal. The biggest reductions to date have been achieved through various labor-saving measures, including evolving our marketing and HR functions from a store to a metro model; reducing buying positions as we transform our purchasing operations; and combining certain store teams, such as meat and seafood, in lower-volume stores.
Many of these efforts allow us to focus our store labor investments where they are most needed, ensuring product availability, maintaining high standards and serving our customers. In addition to labor and benefits savings, we significantly reduced our supplies and packaging expense through a more consolidated purchasing program across regions. 
Another major accomplishment was the launch of our new value format, 365 by Whole Foods Market. We're using the learnings from our first 3 stores to shape and evolve our next round of 365 openings, and we're excited about the opportunities this streamlined operating model presents for our existing and future Whole Foods Market stores as well. 
We're also pleased to share that our unified point-of-sale system, including EMV technology, is now up and running across all of our U.S. stores. This was a significant undertaking involving the conversion of more than 6,200 checkout lanes. This system provides the foundation to enhance our promotional capabilities, including more dynamic and personalized offers through our mobile app and Rewards programs.
As we evolve our business model, our commitment to our core values, mission and culture has never been stronger, and we appreciate our team members for continuing to deliver a world-class shopping experience to our customers. In a year that presented many ongoing headwinds for food retailers, including deflation, increased competition from existing as well as new business models, and lackluster consumer demand, we produced industry-leading sales per square foot of $915 and a healthy 13% return on invested capital.
While sales were lighter than forecast, we achieved many of the fiscal year targets we provided in Q4 last year, including $1.52 in earnings per share, excluding buybacks, and an 8.6% EBITDA margin. We produced more than $1.1 billion of operating cash flow and invested $716 million of capital, primarily in new and existing stores and technology initiatives, resulting in $400 million of free cash flow. And in keeping with our capital allocation strategy, we returned more than $1.1 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Turning to our outlook for fiscal year 2017. We expect sales growth of 2.5% to 4.5% and earnings per share, excluding potential future buybacks of $1.42 or greater. Our priorities include progressing to an always on unified marketing and media plan, using insights from our customer data and analytics to improve the relevancy, effectiveness and efficiency of our value and marketing investments; intensifying our personalization efforts, including the rollout of our optimized Rewards program to all U.S. stores; taking a more strategic approach to our assortments, pricing and promotions, including the continued development of category management tools, processes and capabilities to better inform our investments; evolving our purchasing structure to a hybrid model with global teams leading our category management efforts and regional teams focused on local products; leveraging our new culinary team's leadership and expertise to offer a full spectrum of the highest quality, ready-made meal solutions, in-store or delivered to your door, including a pilot for curated meal kits; and offering our customers more convenience through expanded online delivery to more cities and additional ZIP Codes in existing markets.
So far in Q1, we have relocated our Center City Philadelphia store, which had the second-highest opening sales week in our company's history, and opened our first store in El Paso, Texas, which garnered significant media attention across Mexico and is doing twice its projected sales volume. Our new stores, on average, continue to be profitable in year 1, and we have many other exciting openings this year, including Bryant Park in New York City in January and Lakeview, Chicago this spring. At the same time, we believe it is prudent in this challenging retail environment to continue to moderate our lease signings, ending square footage growth and capital expenditures as a percentage of sales.
We have seen stability in comps over the last 2 quarters and an improvement in trends quarter-to-date for both traffic and basket size. We are encouraged that our value and marketing efforts appear to be gaining traction with customers and believe we will see momentum as our sales building initiatives are rolled out throughout the year. The competitive landscape is very dynamic, however, and it is uncertain how long the deflationary environment will continue. The high end of our 2% -- negative 2% to flat comp range reflects a negative 2.5% 2-year comp, slightly better than Q4's negative 2.8%, while the low end reflects the possibility that 2-year trends could get marginally worse before they get better, as we have seen quarter-to-date.
As we have stated, our strategy is to adjust our operating model to a lower margin and lower cost structure. Every major conversion we have about investments in pricing, technology and marketing is accompanied by a -- conversation about lowering our cost structure to enhanced technology tools, labor restructuring and work process changes. Last November, we announced our goal to reduce our cost structure by $300 million run rate by the end of fiscal year 2017. We expect to reach our goal but expect these savings to be more than offset by our investments to drive traffic and sales as well as higher occupancy, depreciation and other costs. Therefore, we expect a decline in operating margin of up to 60 basis points for the year, with greater declines in the first half, primarily related to higher year-over-year preopening expense in the first quarter and marketing expense in the first and second quarters. Please see our press release for more detailed guidance.
In closing, food retail is evolving at an incredibly fast pace and consumers have many more options for how and where they buy their food than ever before. At the same time, the market opportunity is expanding as the consciousness about fresh, healthy foods continues to awaken. Our company mission, commitment to transparency and a culture of innovation are more relevant and timely than ever. And where our company is today is just a shadow of where we think it will be in the future.
We sell the highest quality food in the world. Our standards lead the industry. And no one delivers the dynamic and compelling in-store experience that we do. We continue to see strong customer reception to our brand in new and existing markets as evidenced by recent openings. Our stores are highly profitable, with only 7 out of 456 stores at year-end not producing positive EBITDA before rent. 
We will keep innovating and creating opportunities for people to connect and find a sense of community in our stores and in the digital world. Promotions and price investments are an integral part of our conversation but we are not participating in a race to the bottom. Our strategy revolves around leading a race to the top in terms of a differentiated customer experience: continuing to raise the bar on our quality standards and selection, providing new levels of transparency and accountability and leveraging technology to deliver an improved shopping experience.
We believe we have the right strategies in place to position the company to produce strong results and returns for our shareholders over the long term. In a separate release today, we announced some coming structural and leadership changes. I want to take the opportunity to acknowledge and appreciate both Walter and Glenda for their many years of partnership and service to the company.
The significance of their countless contributions cannot be overstated. And we are grateful that both will continue to be involved in shaping our future.
We'll now take questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

We did see, in cost, in early in the quarter, we were definitely seeing some deflation. As the quarter went on, it moderated and we actually saw an uptick in certain categories like our farmed-raised salmon, which is a very big part of our seafood sales, so a dramatic increase towards the end of the quarter. And a couple of produce items, specifically avocados, through the big disruption in Mexico when we started to see an increase there, too. So I would say, overall, it was fairly balanced. And one thing to remember too, with us is that, our -- when certain commodity products really dropped down, it doesn't affect us as much. So for instance, there's been a large decrease in the commodity eggs this year, but those aren't the eggs we sell. Our eggs are all raised under contract to our quality standards by our producers who produced them based on cost to produce. So we're not as affected as much as by some of those big commodity swings with the products that we sell. So I'd say, overall, things were pretty flat for us in the quarter."

In Q4, sales increased 2% to a record $3.5 billion. We opened 5 new stores, including 2 365 stores. We continue to make selective investments on key items to narrow pricing gaps while offering strong weekly deals, which were supported by the continuation of our enhanced ad campaign.
We also successfully launched our new affinity Rewards programs in the Dallas/Fort Worth metro area. In a heightened competitive and promotional environment, we have remained focused on our initiatives to build sales over the long term and are seeing encouraging signs of customers responding, as reflected in our third consecutive quarter of improving items per basket.
As our value, personalization and marketing efforts gain traction and new sales-building initiatives roll out throughout the year, we expect our traffic trends to improve as well. In a challenging operating environment, we maintained our expense disciplines, delivering 8% EBITDA margin, $0.28 in earnings per share and $352 million in operating cash flow.
As highlighted in our press release, we have made measurable progress this year on our 9-point plan to position Whole Foods Market for continued success in an increasingly competitive marketplace. This includes one of our most important initiatives, which is to reduce expenses by a $300 million run rate by the end of fiscal year 2017.
We are pleased to report that as of year-end, we are more than 50% of the way toward our goal. The biggest reductions to date have been achieved through various labor-saving measures, including evolving our marketing and HR functions from a store to a metro model; reducing buying positions as we transform our purchasing operations; and combining certain store teams, such as meat and seafood, in lower-volume stores.
Many of these efforts allow us to focus our store labor investments where they are most needed, ensuring product availability, maintaining high standards and serving our customers. In addition to labor and benefits savings, we significantly reduced our supplies and packaging expense through a more consolidated purchasing program across regions. 
Another major accomplishment was the launch of our new value format, 365 by Whole Foods Market. We're using the learnings from our first 3 stores to shape and evolve our next round of 365 openings, and we're excited about the opportunities this streamlined operating model presents for our existing and future Whole Foods Market stores as well. 
We're also pleased to share that our unified point-of-sale system, including EMV technology, is now up and running across all of our U.S. stores. This was a significant undertaking involving the conversion of more than 6,200 checkout lanes. This system provides the foundation to enhance our promotional capabilities, including more dynamic and personalized offers through our mobile app and Rewards programs.
As we evolve our business model, our commitment to our core values, mission and culture has never been stronger, and we appreciate our team members for continuing to deliver a world-class shopping experience to our customers. In a year that presented many ongoing headwinds for food retailers, including deflation, increased competition from existing as well as new business models, and lackluster consumer demand, we produced industry-leading sales per square foot of $915 and a healthy 13% return on invested capital.
While sales were lighter than forecast, we achieved many of the fiscal year targets we provided in Q4 last year, including $1.52 in earnings per share, excluding buybacks, and an 8.6% EBITDA margin. We produced more than $1.1 billion of operating cash flow and invested $716 million of capital, primarily in new and existing stores and technology initiatives, resulting in $400 million of free cash flow. And in keeping with our capital allocation strategy, we returned more than $1.1 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Turning to our outlook for fiscal year 2017. We expect sales growth of 2.5% to 4.5% and earnings per share, excluding potential future buybacks of $1.42 or greater. Our priorities include progressing to an always on unified marketing and media plan, using insights from our customer data and analytics to improve the relevancy, effectiveness and efficiency of our value and marketing investments; intensifying our personalization efforts, including the rollout of our optimized Rewards program to all U.S. stores; taking a more strategic approach to our assortments, pricing and promotions, including the continued development of category management tools, processes and capabilities to better inform our investments; evolving our purchasing structure to a hybrid model with global teams leading our category management efforts and regional teams focused on local products; leveraging our new culinary team's leadership and expertise to offer a full spectrum of the highest quality, ready-made meal solutions, in-store or delivered to your door, including a pilot for curated meal kits; and offering our customers more convenience through expanded online delivery to more cities and additional ZIP Codes in existing markets.
So far in Q1, we have relocated our Center City Philadelphia store, which had the second-highest opening sales week in our company's history, and opened our first store in El Paso, Texas, which garnered significant media attention across Mexico and is doing twice its projected sales volume. Our new stores, on average, continue to be profitable in year 1, and we have many other exciting openings this year, including Bryant Park in New York City in January and Lakeview, Chicago this spring. At the same time, we believe it is prudent in this challenging retail environment to continue to moderate our lease signings, ending square footage growth and capital expenditures as a percentage of sales.
We have seen stability in comps over the last 2 quarters and an improvement in trends quarter-to-date for both traffic and basket size. We are encouraged that our value and marketing efforts appear to be gaining traction with customers and believe we will see momentum as our sales building initiatives are rolled out throughout the year. The competitive landscape is very dynamic, however, and it is uncertain how long the deflationary environment will continue. The high end of our 2% -- negative 2% to flat comp range reflects a negative 2.5% 2-year comp, slightly better than Q4's negative 2.8%, while the low end reflects the possibility that 2-year trends could get marginally worse before they get better, as we have seen quarter-to-date.
As we have stated, our strategy is to adjust our operating model to a lower margin and lower cost structure. Every major conversion we have about investments in pricing, technology and marketing is accompanied by a -- conversation about lowering our cost structure to enhanced technology tools, labor restructuring and work process changes. Last November, we announced our goal to reduce our cost structure by $300 million run rate by the end of fiscal year 2017. We expect to reach our goal but expect these savings to be more than offset by our investments to drive traffic and sales as well as higher occupancy, depreciation and other costs. Therefore, we expect a decline in operating margin of up to 60 basis points for the year, with greater declines in the first half, primarily related to higher year-over-year preopening expense in the first quarter and marketing expense in the first and second quarters. Please see our press release for more detailed guidance.
In closing, food retail is evolving at an incredibly fast pace and consumers have many more options for how and where they buy their food than ever before. At the same time, the market opportunity is expanding as the consciousness about fresh, healthy foods continues to awaken. Our company mission, commitment to transparency and a culture of innovation are more relevant and timely than ever. And where our company is today is just a shadow of where we think it will be in the future.
We sell the highest quality food in the world. Our standards lead the industry. And no one delivers the dynamic and compelling in-store experience that we do. We continue to see strong customer reception to our brand in new and existing markets as evidenced by recent openings. Our stores are highly profitable, with only 7 out of 456 stores at year-end not producing positive EBITDA before rent. 
We will keep innovating and creating opportunities for people to connect and find a sense of community in our stores and in the digital world. Promotions and price investments are an integral part of our conversation but we are not participating in a race to the bottom. Our strategy revolves around leading a race to the top in terms of a differentiated customer experience: continuing to raise the bar on our quality standards and selection, providing new levels of transparency and accountability and leveraging technology to deliver an improved shopping experience.
We believe we have the right strategies in place to position the company to produce strong results and returns for our shareholders over the long term. In a separate release today, we announced some coming structural and leadership changes. I want to take the opportunity to acknowledge and appreciate both Walter and Glenda for their many years of partnership and service to the company.
The significance of their countless contributions cannot be overstated. And we are grateful that both will continue to be involved in shaping our future.
We'll now take questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you."

The first one that's really exciting looking at these results is if you look across the quintile data for the baskets, every single basket was moving up. And so what that says is that there's some real stability here. And particularly in the $100 basket, it's showing some nice growth, showing that our most loyal customers are continuing to shop with us. And the cool thing about the data and analytics we have now is we can actually look into that $100 basket, and we know what the drivers are in there. And we've got that to build on. Look, with respect to the -- and that's a capability we never really had before. With respect to the trips, I mean, it's -- clearly, this is a challenged environment for retail in general and trips, but actually in this queue, we saw in the time period, we've seen an improvement. We've seen it. It's still not where we want it, but it has improved sequentially. And I think that we've always said we got to go items first and from items we go to trips. And I think we're going to come on strong with the marketing investments issue that I think you're going to be pleased to see with our new leader, Sonya Gafsi Oblisk.

We did see, in cost, in early in the quarter, we were definitely seeing some deflation. As the quarter went on, it moderated and we actually saw an uptick in certain categories like our farmed-raised salmon, which is a very big part of our seafood sales, so a dramatic increase towards the end of the quarter. And a couple of produce items, specifically avocados, through the big disruption in Mexico when we started to see an increase there, too. So I would say, overall, it was fairly balanced. And one thing to remember too, with us is that, our -- when certain commodity products really dropped down, it doesn't affect us as much. So for instance, there's been a large decrease in the commodity eggs this year, but those aren't the eggs we sell. Our eggs are all raised under contract to our quality standards by our producers who produced them based on cost to produce. So we're not as affected as much as by some of those big commodity swings with the products that we sell. So I'd say, overall, things were pretty flat for us in the quarter."
