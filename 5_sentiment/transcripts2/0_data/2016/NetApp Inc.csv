32052,324722178,935033,"NetApp, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2016",2016-02-17,"Earnings Calls","NetApp, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Our Q3 performance reflects our strong focus and operational execution as well as continued challenges from a number of headwinds. For the quarter, we achieved our margin and EPS targets, h",2254,"Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Our Q3 performance reflects our strong focus and operational execution as well as continued challenges from a number of headwinds. For the quarter, we achieved our margin and EPS targets, however, we recorded lower-than-expected revenue. These mixed results reflect the impact of an uncertain and volatile macroeconomic environment, which is causing a slowdown in spending that became more evident in January. Additionally, overall growth rates for enterprise IT remain under pressure as customer shift some of their spending to the cloud. 
Despite these headwinds, we had a number of positives in the quarter. Our data fabric strategy and pivot towards the growth segments of the market, scale-out, software-defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud, continue to yield positive results. Earlier this month, we closed the SolidFire acquisition, positioning us to lead the rapidly growing all-flash array market. 
Before I go into greater depth on the progress we've made in these areas, I want to spend time on the fundamental changes we are undertaking to return NetApp to revenue growth with improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns. On prior calls, I told you that I was driving a detailed inspection of the business. I have now concluded that formal review. Parts of our business are working well and growing, but we're managing through declines in other parts. We have many exciting, innovative, industry-leading products, strong relationships with customers and partners and a large, growing installed base. NetApp does not need to completely reinvent itself, but we do need to execute comprehensive and sustained transformation to deliver on our commitment to return to revenue growth and enhance profitability and shareholder returns. We will take significant steps to streamline the business and further advance our pivot to the growth areas of the market in order to capture the full potential of NetApp. 
To accomplish this, we've adopted a plan with several key priorities. First, we are focused on the strategic solutions that represent our pivot to the growth segments of the market and are the foundation of how we enable customer success in the date of powered digital era; second, we are substantially reducing cost and systematically streamlining the business, even while investing for the future; third, we will provide greater visibility into the business and our revenue mix to demonstrate why we are so confident in our ability to capitalize on our strategic solutions; and fourth, we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy, which includes a combination of share repurchases, dividends and investing for the long-term growth of the business. 
Let's start with our strategic solutions. As the baseline, our focus remains in enabling our customer success as they navigate through their own IT transformations, which leverage modern architectures and hybrid cloud solutions. Clustered ONTAP, Branded E-Series, all-flash arrays, hybrid cloud solutions and OnCommand Insight are the set of strategic solutions that are the basis of our pivot to the growth is severance of the market. The growth rate of our strategic solutions is strong, but as I've discussed, not yet sufficient to offset the headwinds from the mature areas of our business, OEM, ONTAP 7-Mode and add on. We expect that these headwinds will lessen as we progress through fiscal year 2017. As we emerge from FY '17, the transition to clustered ONTAP should be mostly behind us as well the downward pressure that the transition has put on our add-on storage business. As OEM and ONTAP 7-Mode become a smaller part of our mix, we anticipate that our pivot towards the growth areas of the market will return the company to revenue growth, albeit moderated. During this transition period, we will maintain a sharp focus in execution, reduce our cost base and take additional steps to manage the trends in the storage industry. We will make transformational moves to become more focused, efficient and effective, while fundamentally lowering the cost structure of the company, even as we invest in strategic opportunities. 
Which brings us to our second priority, cost control. We will utilize disciplined portfolio management to improve productivity and better align resources with opportunities, while simultaneously maximizing returns from the mature portions of our business. We must also streamline the business to increase our effectiveness and flexibility in responding to the rapidly changing market. All of this will expand our operating margin. We have launched a comprehensive program to reduce the cost base of our business by $400 million gross annually with run rate savings achieved by the end of fiscal year '17. We have already embarked on this initiative. We have made decisions that streamline our business, such as consolidating our hardware, engineering and manufacturing operations teams, implementing tighter controls on indirect spending and improving supply chain efficiency. These actions and lower variable compensation enabled us to lower our Q3 operating expenses by 8% sequentially. Today, we announced a restructuring and reduction in workforce of approximately 12% of total headcount. This action will generate annualized run rate savings of approximately $200 million against our growth target. We expect the majority of this workforce reduction to occur in fiscal Q4. 
As these cost efficiencies materialize, we are reinvesting some of these savings into strategic solutions like SolidFire and productivity improvements, which will allow us to be more effective at a lower cost structure, yielding a net run rate savings of roughly $130 million by the end the fiscal year '17. We are taking a thoughtful approach to the reductions, employing disciplined portfolio management and fundamentally changing the way we operate. Savings will be achieved through business transformation, including operational process redesign, organizational restructuring and realignment and further portfolio streamlining. We are also putting into place controls to ensure that the savings are sustained. These transformational moves will better align our resources against the strategic opportunity and our cost structure to the near-term growth trajectory of the business. 
While we've been working to make our model more efficient for some time now, this comprehensive and sustained transformation will enable us to realize the benefit of our pivot to the growth areas of the market at a faster pace. 
Looking past the streamlining and transformation phase into fiscal year '18 and beyond, we will continue our focus on productivity and the improvements in efficiency will more substantially materialize. Our non-GAAP operating margins will improve towards the high end of our target range, inclusive of SolidFire. By coupling the strength of our data fabric strategy and the benefits we deliver to customers with a more efficient and agile business, we can increase the value we generate for customers, partners, employees and shareholders. Over time, we believe that the investments we've made in innovation and streamlining will enable us to grow at an accelerating pace with improved operating margin and cash flow. 
Our third priority is transparency. The progress we've already made in our pivot towards the growth areas of the market has not been easy to measure from outside the company. To help provide visibility into this transition, we are providing greater clarity into the dynamics of our product revenue. In Q3, our strategic solutions, clustered ONTAP, Branded E-Series, all-flash arrays, hybrid cloud solutions and OnCommand Insight, made up almost 55% of product revenue and grew 26% year-over-year. By contrast, product revenue from our mature solutions, OEM, ONTAP 7-Mode and add-on, declined 40% year-over-year, predominantly from the declines in OEM and ONTAP 7-Mode. 
In Q2 FY '16, we reached a significant milestone when the revenue from strategic solutions exceeded that of the mature ones. In other words, the products with the higher aggregate growth profile are the bigger proportion of our product revenue. We are getting closer to a mix with our strategic solutions can drive a reacceleration of the business. This shift in the composition of our product revenue is a good indicator of the progress we've made in our pivot to the growth areas of the market. This, plus our strong software and hardware maintenance revenues create a solid foundation for NetApp. 
The tight alignment between our strategic solutions and our customers' IT imperatives underscores our confidence that we will generate continued growth from this area of the business. As part of their IT modernization efforts, customers want scale-out and software-defined storage functionality for the efficient management of data growth. Clustered ONTAP enables seamless data management across flash, disk and cloud footprints and across public and private clouds for enterprise applications, regardless of the underlying hardware. Clustered ONTAP was deployed in almost 80% of FAS systems shipped in Q3, up from roughly 40% a year ago. Unit shipments of clustered ONTAP systems saw strong continued customer demand, growing roughly 70% year-over-year. The clustered ONTAP transition acceleration program we put in place at the start of the year is speeding the migration of installed base customers, who are ready to upgrade both their systems and their software from ONTAP 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP. Our FAS install base is growing and clustered ONTAP now represents 24% of installed systems. The installed base mix will continue to shift the clustered ONTAP, but you should not expect a linear progression. These migrations of projects that must fit within the overall IT priorities and budgets of our customers, and we anticipate that the transition of the installed base will happen over the course of years. Both the total number of customers and new-to-NetApp customers who meet clustered ONTAP purchases in Q3 grew by approximately 60% from Q3 last year. Flash is becoming the de facto technology for primary workloads. Our EF all-flash arrays delivered the extreme performance for standalone applications that infrastructure buyers and application owners need. The All Flash FAS arrays have industry-leading data management services with a unified multiprotocol capability that appeals to infrastructure architects driving data center consolidation. Customer demand for our all-flash arrays continues to grow. Our existing all-flash array business, inclusive of EF and All Flash FAS products and services, has accelerated to an almost $600 million annual run rate. To this strong foundation, we are excited to add SolidFire's unique scale-out block storage architecture that is compelling for the cloud architect, masterminding the next generation data center. With this acquisition, NetApp is the clear technology leader in the all-flash array market with the broadest portfolio of all-flash arrays in the industry, addressing the diverse needs of enterprises and service providers, which cannot be adequately met by the one-size-fits-all compromise approach of our competitors. 
Our data fabric solutions are successfully positioning us to help customers with leading-edge cloud deployments. A leading software-as-a-service provider in the Asia-Pacific region created a next-generation service for its customers, utilizing NetApp Private Storage for cloud, AltaVault and OnCommand Insight, connected to multiple hyperscale clouds for compute services. They provide an outstanding customer experience, and in enterprise solution, built on a single modern platform with a consistent look and feel without the risk of a single cloud dependency. By storing data on NetApp Private Storage, they can make customer preference for a specific cloud provider as well as improve their ability to meet SLA guarantees by scaling over to other clouds when the primary cloud is unavailable. The mirror deficiency of NetApp Private Storage also allows them to improve their profitability by effectively storing less data on tiers of flash and creating rapid virtual copies for test and development during new customer acquisitions. Additionally, they can satisfy regulators by proving where data resides at all times for government, financial services and healthcare customers. This is a great example of what I've discussed in the past. Data is at the heart of the transformation our customers are going through to improve the efficiency of their businesses and better serve their customers. At the same time, they're reducing IT budgets, looking for simpler solutions and rethinking how they consume IT. This evaluation is diverting spend towards transformational projects and architectures like scale-out, software-defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud, where our data fabric strategy gives us a compelling advantage. NetApp is the only company able to span flash to disk to cloud, and the only company delivering the ability to manage data across multiple clouds and on premises today. 
Finally, I want to briefly touch on capital allocation, our fourth priority. I'll let Jeff get into the details, but in short, we are fully committed to executing our capital allocation programs and creating value for shareholders. We expect to complete our current share buyback authorization by the end of May 2018 as planned and remain committed to our dividend program. I am more confident than ever in NetApp's potential. While we must manage through a dynamic IT market and declines in our mature solutions, we have a clear plan and a lot of positives. We have a large and growing installed base; our data fabric strategy uniquely enables us to assist customers in achieving their strategic IT imperatives; our strategic solutions our greater than 50% of product revenue and growing. We are making substantial progress in the transition to clustered ONTAP and we've just expanded our conference of all-flash array portfolio. We are keenly focused on our business model and managing our investments between our strategic and mature solutions. The changes we are making to stream line the business and reduce the cost structure will enable investment and strategic opportunities, while accelerating our ability to deliver shareholder value in the form of profitability and cash flow year. 
We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. I'll now turn it over to Jeff to take you through the numbers. Jeff?"

I'd like to start by thanking George and the NetApp board for the opportunity to step in as interim CFO. It's an exciting time of transformation for NetApp as we streamline the business to become more focus and efficient, and at the same time, pivot the company toward growth areas of the market and take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. The team is energized to leverage the strength of our strategic solutions to bolster the company and ultimately drive growth. We have made good progress to date, and as you heard from George, are committed to providing you with greater visibility into the dynamics of our business. 
With that said, let's move to the financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. I want to remind you that unless otherwise specified, I will be using non-GAAP metrics to discuss our financial results and guidance. 
Q3 net revenues of $1.39 billion were down about 4% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. While there were indicators of strength in our results, such as clustered ONTAP traction and rapid all-flash array adoption, which drove growth in our strategic solutions, our revenue performance fell short of our expectations. The shortfall was a result of a combination of the macroeconomic uncertainty George talked that created the lengthening of deal cycles, greater-than-anticipated rate of decline in our mature business, a mix shift to deferred revenue and FX headwinds of about 3 points year-over-year. When we reiterated guidance in early January, our sales volume was in line with our forecast, which assumed a back-end loaded quarter, consistent with historical performance and is typical in the industry. However, after moderate calendar year budget flush, the macroeconomic environment worsened and we saw an increase in the deferred mix of our business over the course of last 2 weeks of the quarter. 
Product revenue declined 8% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. We saw higher-than-expected volume of software and hardware maintenance contract renewals as some customers opted to delay equipment purchases. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues was up 2% year-over-year. 
Now to provide some context and better visibility into our business model, I'd like to walk through how we think about the strategic solutions revenue in software and hardware maintenance revenues coming together to create a foundation from which we can build. Revenue from strategic solutions continues to show strong growth, and as George highlighted, is now more than 50% of our product revenue. The year-over-year decline in our mature solutions revenue is driving overall product revenue declines in the near term, but the size and growth of the strategic solutions revenue gives us confidence in our strategy to provide overall product revenue growth in the future. 
Looking at software and hardware maintenance revenues, I talked about the strength of our renewal business during the quarter, and as George said, 24% of our install base is running on clustered ONTAP. While the product revenue declines will ultimately pressure software and hardware maintenance revenues, the lengthening of product life cycles, growth of our installed base, rapidly increasing mix of clustered ONTAP the install base and high renewal volume creates support for future software and hardware maintenance revenues. Indirect revenue accounted for 78% of net revenues. Gross margin was 63.1% in the third quarter, above our previous guidance, reflecting favorable mix, partially offset by aggressive pricing. Product gross margin of 51.1% was down about 6 points year-over-year, reflecting about 2 points of FX and higher discounting. Software maintenance gross margin was roughly flat, while hardware, maintenance and other services gross margin was up about 2 points, largely reflecting higher contract renewal revenue as well as services infrastructure cost efficiencies. Operating expenses of $630 million decreased 12% year-over-year, reflecting 3 points of FX benefit, lower headcount and related compensation cost and the early work toward driving greater efficiency across the business, as George mentioned in his opening remarks. Operating margin of 17.6% was almost 1 point above our guidance. 
Our effective tax rate was 14.9% and lower than our previous guidance, which reflects a change in the geographic mix of profits and its cumulative year-to-date impact. We expect our effective tax rate for Q4 to be approximately 16%. Our weighted average diluted share count for the third quarter was 296 million shares. Earnings per share was $0.70, within our guidance range. 
Moving on to cash and balance sheet metrics. We ended the quarter with approximately $5 billion in cash and short-term investments, with approximately 12% held by our domestic entities. Deferred and financed under services revenue decreased $80 [ph] million sequentially and $16 million year-over-year. Inventory turns increased to 20 and DSO was at 38 days. 
We generated $315.5 [ph] million in cash flow from operations during the quarter, up 29% year-over-year. Free cash flow of $314 million was about 23% of net revenues, up 217% [ph] sequentially and 28% year-over-year. We expect free cash flow as a percentage of revenue for Q4 to reflect the above 20%. 
Now I'd like to discuss share repurchases for a moment. In Q3, we repurchased approximately $85 million of our stock. This was less than we would've liked to events such as the SolidFire transaction, which reduced the number of days we can be in the market. However, as George noted, we remain fully committed to completing our $2.5 billion share repurchase program by the end of May 2018, with $262 million that's remaining by the end of May 2016. Additionally, we paid $52 [ph] million in cash dividends in the third quarter. 
Today, we also announced next cash dividend of $0.18 per share with the company's common stock, which will be paid on April 27, 2016. Overall, we are confident in our allocation of capital between growth initiatives and shareholder returns as we continue to execute on our transformation strategy. 
Looking forward to guidance. Given the increasingly uncertain macroeconomic environment, continued shifts in enterprise IT spending and our own work in transforming the company, we are tempering our forecast. For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting a revenue range of $1.35 billion to $1.5 billion. Given the aggressive pricing environment, we expect gross margins to decline to approximately 61.5%, driven by higher discounting, which will be partially offset by cost savings initiatives. 
Looking in operating margin, we are transforming the company in order to streamline the business, improved efficiency, become more focused and enhance our ability to rapidly address the changing market. Our initiatives will fundamentally change the way we do business by centralizing similar activities across functions, optimizing geographic location and resources and consolidating suppliers. We are better positioning NetApp for near and long-term success, while reducing our cost structure across both cost of revenues and OpEx and ensuring that the changes we make are sustainable. To minimize disruption, the pace of these changes will be dictated by the company's preparedness for each transformative initiative. As George mentioned, we're driving to achieve a gross run rate savings of $400 million by the end of fiscal 2017, which would include the previously announced discontinuance of our FlashRay product line. We plan to use these cost savings to minimize erosion of margins in a price-competitive environment. We will reinvest some of the gross savings into strategic opportunities such as SolidFire and productivity improvements, building a net run rate savings of roughly $130 million by the end of fiscal 2017. While George touched upon several initiatives that are already underway, we will provide more specifics around additional initiatives as they executed. As a step towards the lower work our cost and rewiring the company, we will initiate a headcount reduction of approximately 12% during the fourth quarter. We expect to realize Q4 savings of just over $30 million, resulting in a Q4 operating margin of approximately's 15% and earnings per share target range of $0.55 to $0.60 for the fourth quarter, including the impact of the SolidFire acquisition. We expect a GAAP restructuring charge of approximately $60 million to $70 million in Q4 relating to this action. 
Finally, to help the 2 [ph] models, I'd like to provide some color around the impact of SolidFire on our outlook. As you know, the acquisition closed on February 2. We funded the transaction through a short term loan of $870 million. We intend to integrate SolidFire into our global operating structure and expect a retired acquisition that with our global earnings by the beginning of Q3 FY '17. In Q4, we expect SolidFire to reduce operating margin by about 3 points, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 15%. Looking forward to FY '17, we expect our strategic plan for SolidFire to contribute about 2 points of revenue growth and be dilutive to operating profit by about 2 points and earnings per share by $0.28 to $0.30. This is at the high end of the guidance range that we gave you on the acquisition call, as that range included benefit of a FlashRay discontinuance, which we are now reporting as part of the overall cost reduction plan. We anticipate that SolidFire will be accretive in FY '18. 
The IT environment is changing rapidly, and we provide a lot of additional content to give you more Insight into how it's impacting us and actions we're taking to adapt. Let me summarize the foreign things around this transformation that I want to ensure you take away from this call. First, underlying our top line results, there is a strong strategic business that is material and growing; second, we are significantly reducing the cost structure of our core NetApp business, aligning our resources to the market opportunity, which will expand operating margins; third, we are committed to providing greater transparency and the ability to our business; and fourth, we are committed to our capital allocation strategy of providing a meaningful dividend that grows over time and executing a robust share repurchase program while investing in the long-term growth of the business. 
With that, I'd like to hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?"

Our Q3 performance reflects our strong focus on operational execution as well as continued challenges from a number of headwinds. For the quarter, we achieved our margin and EPS targets, however, we recorded lower-than-expected revenue. These mixed results reflect the impact of an uncertain and volatile macroeconomic environment, which is causing a slowdown in spending that became more evident in January. Additionally, overall growth rates for enterprise IT remain under pressure as customer shift some of their spending to the cloud.
Despite these headwinds, we had a number of positives in the quarter. Our data fabric strategy and pivot towards the growth segments of the market, scale-out, software-defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud, continue to yield positive results. Earlier this month, we closed the SolidFire acquisition, positioning us to lead the rapidly growing all-flash array market.
Before I go into greater depth on the progress we've made in these areas, I want to spend time on the fundamental changes we are undertaking to return NetApp to revenue growth with improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns. On prior calls, I told you that I was driving a detailed inspection of the business. I have now concluded that formal review. Parts of our business are working well and growing, but we're managing through declines in other parts. We have many exciting, innovative, industry-leading products, strong relationships with customers and partners and a large, growing installed base. NetApp does not need to completely reinvent itself, but we do need to execute comprehensive and sustained transformation to deliver on our commitment to return to revenue growth and enhance profitability and shareholder returns. We will take significant steps to streamline the business and further advance our pivot to the growth areas of the market in order to capture the full potential of NetApp.
To accomplish this, we've adopted a plan with several key priorities. First, we are focused on the strategic solutions that represent our pivot to the growth segments of the market and are the foundation of how we enable customer success in the data-powered digital era. Second, we are substantially reducing cost and systematically streamlining the business, even while investing for the future. Third, we will provide greater visibility into the business and our revenue mix to demonstrate why we are so confident in our ability to capitalize on our strategic solutions. And fourth, we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy, which includes a combination of share repurchases, dividends and investing for the long-term growth of the business.
Let's start with our strategic solutions. As the baseline, our focus remains in enabling our customer success as they navigate through their own IT transformations, which leverage modern architectures and hybrid cloud solutions. Clustered ONTAP, Branded E-Series, all-flash arrays, hybrid cloud solutions and OnCommand Insight are the set of strategic solutions that are the basis of our pivot to the growth segments of the market. The growth rate of our strategic solutions is strong but, as I've discussed, not yet sufficient to offset the headwinds from the mature areas of our business, OEM, ONTAP 7-Mode and add-on. We expect that these headwinds will lessen as we progress through fiscal year 2017. As we emerge from FY '17, the transition to clustered ONTAP should be mostly behind us as well the downward pressure that the transition has put on our add-on storage business. As OEM and ONTAP 7-Mode become a smaller part of our mix, we anticipate that our pivot towards the growth areas of the market will return the company to revenue growth, albeit moderated. During this transition period, we will maintain a sharp focus in execution, reduce our cost base and take additional steps to manage the trends in the storage industry. We will make transformational moves to become more focused, efficient and effective while fundamentally lowering the cost structure of the company, even as we invest in strategic opportunities.
Which brings us to our second priority, cost control. We will utilize disciplined portfolio management to improve productivity and better align resources with opportunities while simultaneously maximizing returns from the mature portions of our business. We must also streamline the business to increase our effectiveness and flexibility in responding to the rapidly changing market. All of this will expand our operating margin. We have launched a comprehensive program to reduce the cost base of our business by $400 million gross annually with run rate savings achieved by the end of fiscal year '17. We have already embarked on this initiative. We have made decisions that streamline our business, such as consolidating our hardware, engineering and manufacturing operations teams, implementing tighter controls on indirect spending and improving supply chain efficiency. These actions and lower variable compensation enabled us to lower our Q3 operating expenses by 8% sequentially. Today, we announced a restructuring and reduction in workforce of approximately 12% of total headcount. This action will generate annualized run rate savings of approximately $200 million against our gross target. We expect the majority of this workforce reduction to occur in fiscal Q4.
As these cost efficiencies materialize, we are reinvesting some of these savings into strategic solutions like SolidFire and productivity improvements, which will allow us to be more effective at a lower cost structure, yielding a net run rate savings of roughly $130 million by the end of fiscal year '17. We are taking a thoughtful approach to the reductions, employing disciplined portfolio management and fundamentally changing the way we operate. Savings will be achieved through business transformation, including operational process redesign, organizational restructuring and realignment and further portfolio streamlining. We are also putting into place controls to ensure that these savings are sustained. These transformational moves will better align our resources against the strategic opportunity and our cost structure to the near-term growth trajectory of the business.
While we've been working to make our model more efficient for some time now, this comprehensive and sustained transformation will enable us to realize the benefit of our pivot to the growth areas of the market at a faster pace.
Looking past the streamlining and transformation phase into fiscal year '18 and beyond, we will continue our focus on productivity and the improvements in efficiency will more substantially materialize. Our non-GAAP operating margins will improve towards the high end of our target range, inclusive of SolidFire. By coupling the strength of our data fabric strategy and the benefits we deliver to customers with a more efficient and agile business, we can increase the value we generate for customers, partners, employees and shareholders. Over time, we believe that the investments we've made in innovation and streamlining will enable us to grow at an accelerating pace with improved operating margin and cash flow.
Our third priority is transparency. The progress we've already made in our pivot towards the growth areas of the market has not been easy to measure from outside the company. To help provide visibility into this transition, we are providing greater clarity into the dynamics of our product revenue. In Q3, our strategic solutions, clustered ONTAP, Branded E-Series, all-flash arrays, hybrid cloud solutions and OnCommand Insight, made up almost 55% of product revenue and grew 26% year-over-year. By contrast, product revenue from our mature solutions, OEM, ONTAP 7-Mode and add-on, declined 40% year-over-year, predominantly from the declines in OEM and ONTAP 7-Mode.
In Q2 FY '16, we reached a significant milestone when the revenue from strategic solutions exceeded that of the mature ones. In other words, the products with the higher aggregate growth profile are the bigger proportion of our product revenue. We are getting closer to a mix where our strategic solutions can drive a reacceleration of the business. This shift in the composition of our product revenue is a good indicator of the progress we've made in our pivot to the growth areas of the market. This plus our strong software and hardware maintenance revenues create a solid foundation for NetApp.
The tight alignment between our strategic solutions and our customers' IT imperatives underscores our confidence that we will generate continued growth from this area of the business. As part of their IT modernization efforts, customers want scale-out and software-defined storage functionality for the efficient management of data growth. Clustered ONTAP enables seamless data management across flash, disk and cloud footprints and across public and private clouds for enterprise applications, regardless of the underlying hardware. Clustered ONTAP was deployed in almost 80% of FAS systems shipped in Q3, up from roughly 40% a year ago. Unit shipments of clustered ONTAP systems saw strong continued customer demand, growing roughly 70% year-over-year. The clustered ONTAP transition acceleration program we put in place at the start of the year is speeding the migration of installed base customers who are ready to upgrade both their systems and their software from ONTAP 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP. Our FAS installed base is growing, and clustered ONTAP now represents 24% of installed systems. The installed base mix will continue to shift to clustered ONTAP, but you should not expect a linear progression. These migrations are projects that must fit within the overall IT priorities and budgets of our customers, and we anticipate that the transition of the installed base will happen over the course of years. Both the total number of customers and new-to-NetApp customers who made clustered ONTAP purchases in Q3 grew by approximately 60% from Q3 last year. Flash is becoming the de facto technology for primary workloads. Our EF all-flash arrays delivered the extreme performance for standalone applications that infrastructure buyers and application owners need. The All Flash FAS arrays have industry-leading data management services with a unified multiprotocol capability that appeals to infrastructure architects driving data center consolidation. Customer demand for our all-flash arrays continues to grow. Our existing all-flash array business, inclusive of EF and All Flash FAS products and services, has accelerated to an almost $600 million annual run rate. To this strong foundation, we are excited to add SolidFire's unique scale-out block storage architecture that is compelling for the cloud architect, masterminding the next-generation data center. With this acquisition, NetApp is the clear technology leader in the all-flash array market, with the broadest portfolio of all-flash arrays in the industry, addressing the diverse needs of enterprises and service providers, which cannot be adequately met by the one-size-fits-all compromise approach of our competitors.
Our data fabric solutions are successfully positioning us to help customers with leading-edge cloud deployments. A leading software-as-a-service provider in the Asia Pacific region created a next-generation service for its customers, utilizing NetApp Private Storage for Cloud, AltaVault and OnCommand Insight, connected to multiple hyperscale clouds for compute services. They provide an outstanding customer experience, and an enterprise solution built on a single modern platform with a consistent look and feel without the risk of single cloud dependency. By storing data on NetApp Private Storage, they can meet customer preference for a specific cloud provider as well as improve their ability to meet SLA guarantees by scaling over to other clouds when the primary cloud is unavailable. The mirror deficiency of NetApp Private Storage also allows them to improve their profitability by effectively storing less data on tiers of flash and creating rapid virtual copies for test and development during new customer acquisitions. Additionally, they can satisfy regulators by proving where data resides at all times for government, financial services and health care customers. This is a great example of what I've discussed in the past. Data is at the heart of the transformation our customers are going through, to improve the efficiency of their businesses and better serve their customers. At the same time, they're reducing IT budgets, looking for simpler solutions and rethinking how they consume IT. This evaluation is diverting spend towards transformational projects and architectures like scale-out, software-defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud, where our data fabric strategy gives us a compelling advantage. NetApp is the only company able to span flash to disk to cloud, and the only company delivering the ability to manage data across multiple clouds and on premises today.
Finally, I want to briefly touch on capital allocation, our fourth priority. I'll let Jeff get into the details, but in short, we are fully committed to executing our capital allocation programs and creating value for shareholders. We expect to complete our current share buyback authorization by the end of May 2018 as planned and remain committed to our dividend program. I am more confident than ever in NetApp's potential. While we must manage through a dynamic IT market and declines in our mature solutions, we have a clear plan and a lot of positives. We have a large and growing installed base. Our data fabric strategy uniquely enables us to assist customers in achieving their strategic IT imperatives. Our strategic solutions our greater than 50% of product revenue and growing. We are making substantial progress in the transition to clustered ONTAP, and we've just expanded our comprehensive all-flash array portfolio. We are keenly focused on our business model and managing our investments between our strategic and mature solutions. The changes we are making to streamline the business and reduce the cost structure will enable investment in strategic opportunities while accelerating our ability to deliver shareholder value in the form of profitability and cash flow.
We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. I'll now turn it over to Jeff to take you through the numbers. Jeff?"

With that said, let's move to the financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. I want to remind you that unless otherwise specified, I will be using non-GAAP metrics to discuss our financial results and guidance.
Q3 net revenues of $1.39 billion were down about 4% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. While there were indicators of strength in our results, such as clustered ONTAP traction and rapid all-flash array adoption, which drove growth in our strategic solutions, our revenue performance fell short of our expectations. The shortfall was a result of a combination of the macroeconomic uncertainty George talked about, that created the lengthening of deal cycles, greater-than-anticipated rate of decline in our mature business, a mix shift to deferred revenue and FX headwinds of about 3 points year-over-year. When we reiterated guidance in early January, our sales volume was in line with our forecast, which assumed a back-end-loaded quarter, consistent with historical performance and is typical in the industry. However, after moderate calendar year budget flush, the macroeconomic environment worsened, and we saw an increase in the deferred mix of our business over the course of the last 2 weeks of the quarter.
Product revenue declined 8% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. We saw higher-than-expected volume of software and hardware maintenance contract renewals as some customers opted to delay equipment purchases. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues was up 2% year-over-year.
Now to provide some context and better visibility into our business model, I'd like to walk through how we think about the strategic solutions revenue and software and hardware maintenance revenues coming together to create a foundation from which we can build. Revenue from strategic solutions continues to show strong growth and, as George highlighted, is now more than 50% of our product revenue. The year-over-year decline in our mature solutions revenue is driving overall product revenue declines in the near term, but the size and growth of the strategic solutions revenue gives us confidence in our strategy to drive overall product revenue growth in the future.
Looking at software and hardware maintenance revenues, I talked about the strength of our renewal business during the quarter, and as George said, 24% of our installed base is running on clustered ONTAP. While the product revenue declines will ultimately pressure software and hardware maintenance revenues, the lengthening of product life cycles, growth of our installed base, rapidly increasing mix of clustered ONTAP installed base and high renewal volume creates support for future software and hardware maintenance revenues. Indirect revenue accounted for 78% of net revenues. Gross margin was 63.1% in the third quarter, above our previous guidance, reflecting favorable mix, partially offset by aggressive pricing. Product gross margin of 51.1% was down about 6 points year-over-year, reflecting about 2 points of FX and higher discounting. Software maintenance gross margin was roughly flat, while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin was up about 2 points, largely reflecting higher contract renewal revenue as well as services infrastructure cost efficiencies. Operating expenses of $630 million decreased 12% year-over-year, reflecting 3 points of FX benefit, lower headcount and related compensation cost and the early work toward driving greater efficiency across the business, as George mentioned in his opening remarks. Operating margin of 17.6% was almost 1 point above our guidance.
Our effective tax rate was 14.9% and lower than our previous guidance, which reflects a change in the geographic mix of profits and its cumulative year-to-date impact. We expect our effective tax rate for Q4 to be approximately 16%. Our weighted average diluted share count for the third quarter was 296 million shares. Earnings per share was $0.70, within our guidance range.
Moving on to cash and balance sheet metrics. We ended the quarter with approximately $5 billion in cash and short-term investments, with approximately 12% held by our domestic entities. Deferred and financed unearned services revenue increased $80 million sequentially and $16 million year-over-year. Inventory turns increased to 20 and DSO was at 38 days.
We generated $355 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter, up 29% year-over-year. Free cash flow of $314 million was about 23% of net revenues, up 217% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. We expect free cash flow as a percentage of revenue for Q4 to be slightly above 20%.
Now I'd like to discuss share repurchases for a moment. In Q3, we repurchased approximately $85 million of our stock. This was less than we would've liked due to the events such as the SolidFire transaction, which reduced the number of days we can be in the market. However, as George noted, we remain fully committed to completing our $2.5 billion share repurchase program by the end of May 2018. $262 million is remaining by the end of May 2016. Additionally, we paid $52 million in cash dividends in the third quarter.
Today, we also announced next cash dividend of $0.18 per share of the company's common stock, which will be paid on April 27, 2016. Overall, we are confident in our allocation of capital between growth initiatives and shareholder returns as we continue to execute on our transformation strategy.
Looking forward to guidance. Given the increasingly uncertain macroeconomic environment, continued shifts in enterprise IT spending and our own work in transforming the company, we are tempering our forecast. For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting a revenue range of $1.35 billion to $1.5 billion. Given the aggressive pricing environment, we expect gross margins to decline to approximately 61.5%, driven by higher discounting, which will be partially offset by cost savings initiatives.
Looking at operating margin, we are transforming the company in order to streamline the business, improve efficiency, become more focused and enhance our ability to rapidly address the changing market. Our initiatives will fundamentally change the way we do business by centralizing similar activities across functions, optimizing geographic location resources and consolidating suppliers. We are better positioning NetApp for near and long-term success while reducing our cost structure across both cost of revenues and OpEx and ensuring that the changes we make are sustainable. To minimize disruption, the pace of these changes will be dictated by the company's preparedness for each transformative initiative. As George mentioned, we're driving to achieve a gross run rate savings of $400 million by the end of fiscal 2017, which will include the previously announced discontinuance of our FlashRay product line. We plan to use these cost savings to minimize erosion of margins in a price-competitive environment. We will reinvest some of the gross savings into strategic opportunities such as SolidFire and productivity improvements, building a net run rate savings of roughly $130 million by the end of fiscal 2017. While George touched upon several initiatives that are already underway, we will provide more specifics around additional initiatives as they are executed. As a step towards lowering our cost and rewiring the company, we will initiate a headcount reduction of approximately 12% during the fourth quarter. We expect to realize Q4 savings of just over $30 million, resulting in a Q4 operating margin of approximately 15% and an earnings per share target range of $0.55 to $0.60 for the fourth quarter, including the impact of the SolidFire acquisition. We expect a GAAP restructuring charge of approximately $60 million to $70 million in Q4 relating to this action.
Finally, to help with your models, I'd like to provide some color around the impact of SolidFire on our outlook. As you know, the acquisition closed on February 2. We funded the transaction through a short term loan of $870 million. We intend to integrate SolidFire into our global operating structure and expect to retire the acquisition debt with our global earnings by the beginning of Q3 FY '17. In Q4, we expect SolidFire to reduce operating margin by about 3 points, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 15%. Looking forward to FY '17, we expect our strategic plan for SolidFire to contribute about 2 points of revenue growth and be dilutive to operating profit by about 2 points and to earnings per share by $0.28 to $0.30. This is at the high end of the guidance range that we gave you on the acquisition call, as that range include the benefit of the FlashRay discontinuance, which we are now reporting as part of the overall cost reduction plan. We anticipate that SolidFire will be accretive in FY '18.
The IT environment is changing rapidly, and we provide a lot of additional content to give you more insight into how it's impacting us and the actions we're taking to adapt. Let me summarize the 4 themes around this transformation that I want to ensure that you take away from this call. First, underlying our top line results, there is a strong strategic business that is material and growing. Second, we are significantly reducing the cost structure of our core NetApp business, aligning our resources to the market opportunity, which will expand operating margins. Third, we are committed to providing greater transparency and visibility into our business. And fourth, we're committed to our capital allocation strategy of providing a meaningful dividend that grows over time and executing a robust share repurchase program while investing in the long-term growth of the business.
With that, I'd like to hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?"

Our Q3 performance reflects our strong focus on operational execution, as well as continued challenges from a number of headwinds. For the quarter, we achieved our margin and EPS targets; h",2244,"Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Our Q3 performance reflects our strong focus on operational execution, as well as continued challenges from a number of headwinds. For the quarter, we achieved our margin and EPS targets; however, we recorded lower-than-expected revenue. These mixed results reflect the impact of an uncertain and volatile macroeconomic environment, which is causing a slowdown in spending that became more evident in January. Additionally, overall growth rates for enterprise IT remain under pressure as customers shift some of their spending to the cloud.
Despite these headwinds, we had a number of positives in the quarter. Our data fabric strategy and pivot towards the growth segments of the market, scale-out, software-defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud, continue to yield positive results. Earlier this month, we closed the SolidFire acquisition, positioning us to lead the rapidly growing all-flash array market.
Before I go into greater depth on the progress we've made in these areas, I want to spend time on the fundamental changes we are undertaking to return NetApp to revenue growth with improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns. 
On prior calls, I told you that I was driving a detailed inspection of the business. I have now concluded that formal review. Parts of our business are working well and growing, but we're managing through declines in other parts. We have many exciting, innovative, industry-leading products, strong relationships with customers and partners and a large, growing installed base. NetApp does not need to completely reinvent itself, but we do need to execute comprehensive and sustained transformation to deliver on our commitment to return to revenue growth and enhance profitability and shareholder returns. We will take significant steps to streamline the business and further advance our pivot to the growth areas of the market in order to capture the full potential of NetApp.
To accomplish this, we've adopted a plan with several key priorities. First, we are focused on the strategic solutions that represent our pivot to the growth segments of the market and are the foundation of how we enable customer success in the data-powered digital era. 
Second, we are substantially reducing cost and systematically streamlining the business, even while investing for the future. 
Third, we will provide greater visibility into the business and our revenue mix to demonstrate why we are so confident in our ability to capitalize on our strategic solutions. 
And fourth, we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy, which includes a combination of share repurchases, dividends and investing for the long-term growth of the business.
Let's start with our strategic solutions. As the baseline, our focus remains in enabling our customer success as they navigate through their own IT transformations, which leverage modern architectures and hybrid cloud solutions. Clustered ONTAP, Branded E-Series, all-flash arrays, hybrid cloud solutions and OnCommand Insight are the set of strategic solutions that are the basis of our pivot to the growth segments of the market. The growth rate of our strategic solutions is strong, but as I've discussed, not yet sufficient to offset the headwinds from the mature areas of our business, OEM, ONTAP 7-Mode and add-on. We expect that these headwinds will lessen as we progress through fiscal year 2017. 
As we emerge from FY '17, the transition to clustered ONTAP should be mostly behind us, as will the downward pressure that the transition has put on our add-on storage business. As OEM and ONTAP 7-Mode become a smaller part of our mix, we anticipate that our pivot towards the growth areas of the market will return the company to revenue growth, albeit moderated. 
During this transition period, we will maintain a sharp focus in execution, reduce our cost base and take additional steps to manage the trends in the storage industry. We will make transformational moves to become more focused, efficient and effective while fundamentally lowering the cost structure of the company, even as we invest in strategic opportunities, which brings us to our second priority, cost control. 
We will utilize disciplined portfolio management to improve productivity and better align resources with opportunities while simultaneously maximizing returns from the mature portions of our business. We must also streamline the business to increase our effectiveness and flexibility in responding to the rapidly changing market. All of this will expand our operating margin. 
We have launched a comprehensive program to reduce the cost base of our business by $400 million gross annually, with run-rate savings achieved by the end of fiscal year '17. We have already embarked on this initiative. We have made decisions that streamline our business, such as consolidating our hardware, engineering and manufacturing operations teams, implementing tighter controls on indirect spending and improving supply chain efficiency. These actions and lower variable compensation enabled us to lower our Q3 operating expenses by 8% sequentially. Today, we announced a restructuring and reduction in workforce of approximately 12% of total headcount. This action will generate annualized run-rate savings of approximately $200 million against our gross target. We expect the majority of this workforce reduction to occur in fiscal Q4.
As these cost efficiencies materialize, we are reinvesting some of these savings into strategic solutions like SolidFire and productivity improvements, which will allow us to be more effective at a lower cost structure, yielding a net run-rate savings of roughly $130 million by the end of fiscal year '17. We are taking a thoughtful approach to the reductions, employing disciplined portfolio management and fundamentally changing the way we operate. Savings will be achieved through business transformation, including operational process redesign, organizational restructuring and realignment and further portfolio streamlining. We are also putting into place controls to ensure that these savings are sustained. These transformational moves will better align our resources against the strategic opportunity and our cost structure to the near-term growth trajectory of the business.
While we've been working to make our model more efficient for some time now, this comprehensive and sustained transformation will enable us to realize the benefit of our pivot to the growth areas of the market at a faster pace.
Looking past the streamlining and transformation phase into fiscal year '18 and beyond, we will continue our focus on productivity and the improvements in efficiency will more substantially materialize. Our non-GAAP operating margins will improve towards the high end of our target range, inclusive of SolidFire. By coupling the strength of our data fabric strategy and the benefits we deliver to customers with a more efficient and agile business, we can increase the value we generate for customers, partners, employees and shareholders. Over time, we believe that the investments we've made in innovation and streamlining will enable us to grow at an accelerating pace with improved operating margin and cash flow.
Our third priority is transparency. The progress we've already made in our pivot towards the growth areas of the market has not been easy to measure from outside the company. To help provide visibility into this transition, we are providing greater clarity into the dynamics of our product revenue. In Q3, our strategic solutions, clustered ONTAP, Branded E-Series, all-flash arrays, hybrid cloud solutions and OnCommand Insight, made up almost 55% of product revenue and grew 26% year-over-year. By contrast, product revenue from our mature solutions, OEM, ONTAP 7-Mode and add-on, declined 40% year-over-year, predominantly from the declines in OEM and ONTAP 7-Mode.
In Q2 FY '16, we reached a significant milestone when the revenue from strategic solutions exceeded that of the mature ones. In other words, the products with the higher aggregate growth profile are the bigger proportion of our product revenue. We are getting closer to a mix where our strategic solutions can drive a reacceleration of the business. This shift in the composition of our product revenue is a good indicator of the progress we've made in our pivot to the growth areas of the market. This plus our strong software and hardware maintenance revenues create a solid foundation for NetApp.
The tight alignment between our strategic solutions and our customers' IT imperatives underscores our confidence that we will generate continued growth from this area of the business. As part of their IT modernization efforts, customers want scale-out and software-defined storage functionality for the efficient management of data growth. Clustered ONTAP enables seamless data management across flash, disk and cloud footprints and across public and private clouds for enterprise applications, regardless of the underlying hardware. 
Clustered ONTAP was deployed in almost 80% of FAS systems shipped in Q3, up from roughly 40% a year ago. Unit shipments of clustered ONTAP systems saw strong continued customer demand, growing roughly 70% year-over-year. The clustered ONTAP transition acceleration program we put in place at the start of the year is speeding the migration of installed base customers who are ready to upgrade both their systems and their software from ONTAP 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP. Our FAS installed base is growing, and clustered ONTAP now represents 24% of installed systems. The installed base mix will continue to shift to clustered ONTAP, but you should not expect a linear progression. These migrations are projects that must fit within the overall IT priorities and budgets of our customers, and we anticipate that the transition of the installed base will happen over the course of years. Both the total number of customers and new-to-NetApp customers who made clustered ONTAP purchases in Q3 grew by approximately 60% from Q3 last year. 
Flash is becoming the de facto technology for primary workloads. Our EF all-flash arrays delivered the extreme performance for stand-alone applications that infrastructure buyers and application owners need. The All Flash FAS arrays have industry-leading data management services with a unified multiprotocol capability that appeals to infrastructure architects driving data center consolidation. Customer demand for our all-flash arrays continues to grow. Our existing all-flash array business, inclusive of EF and All Flash FAS products and services, has accelerated to an almost $600 million annual run rate. 
To this strong foundation, we are excited to add SolidFire's unique scale-out block storage architecture that is compelling for the cloud architect, masterminding the next-generation data center. With this acquisition, NetApp is the clear technology leader in the all-flash array market, with the broadest portfolio of all-flash arrays in the industry, addressing the diverse needs of enterprises and service providers, which cannot be adequately met by the one-size-fits-all compromise approach of our competitors.
Our data fabric solutions are successfully positioning us to help customers with leading-edge cloud deployments. A leading software-as-a-service provider in the Asia Pacific region created a next-generation service for its customers, utilizing NetApp Private Storage for Cloud, AltaVault and OnCommand Insight, connected to multiple hyperscale clouds for compute services. They provide an outstanding customer experience, and an enterprise solution built on a single modern platform with a consistent look and feel without the risk of single cloud dependency. 
By storing data on NetApp Private Storage, they can meet customer preference for a specific cloud provider, as well as improve their ability to meet SLA guarantees by scaling over to other clouds when the primary cloud is unavailable. The inherent efficiency of NetApp Private Storage also allows them to improve their profitability by effectively storing less data on tiers of flash and creating rapid virtual copies for test and development during new customer acquisitions. Additionally, they can satisfy regulators by proving where data resides at all times for government, financial services and health care customers. 
This is a great example of what I've discussed in the past. Data is at the heart of the transformation our customers are going through to improve the efficiency of their businesses and better serve their customers. At the same time, they're reducing IT budgets, looking for simpler solutions and rethinking how they consume IT. This evaluation is diverting spend towards transformational projects and architectures like scale-out, software-defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud, where our data fabric strategy gives us a compelling advantage. NetApp is the only company able to span flash to disk to cloud, and the only company delivering the ability to manage data across multiple clouds and on premises today.
Finally, I want to briefly touch on capital allocation, our fourth priority. I'll let Jeff get into the details, but in short, we are fully committed to executing our capital allocation programs and creating value for shareholders. We expect to complete our current share buyback authorization by the end of May 2018 as planned and remain committed to our dividend program. I am more confident than ever in NetApp's potential. 
While we must manage through a dynamic IT market and declines in our mature solutions, we have a clear plan and a lot of positives. We have a large and growing installed base. Our data fabric strategy uniquely enables us to assist customers in achieving their strategic IT imperatives. Our strategic solutions our greater than 50% of product revenue and growing. We are making substantial progress in the transition to clustered ONTAP and we've just expanded our comprehensive all-flash array portfolio. We are keenly focused on our business model and managing our investments between our strategic and mature solutions. The changes we are making to streamline the business and reduce the cost structure will enable investment in strategic opportunities while accelerating our ability to deliver shareholder value in the form of profitability and cash flow.
We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. I'll now turn it over to Jeff to take you through the numbers. Jeff?"

I'd like to start by thanking George and the NetApp board for the opportunity to step in as interim CFO. It's an exciting time of transformation for NetApp as we streamline the business to become more focused and efficient and, at the same time, pivot the company toward growth areas of the market and take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. The team is energized to leverage the strength of our strategic solutions to bolster the company and ultimately drive growth. We have made good progress to date and, as you heard from George, are committed to providing you with greater visibility into the dynamics of our business.
With that said, let's move to the financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. I want to remind you that unless otherwise specified, I will be using non-GAAP metrics to discuss our financial results and guidance.
Q3 net revenues of $1.39 billion were down about 4% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. While there were indicators of strength in our results, such as clustered ONTAP traction and rapid all-flash array adoption, which drove growth in our strategic solutions, our revenue performance fell short of our expectations. The shortfall was a result of a combination of the macroeconomic uncertainty George talked about that created the lengthening of deal cycles, greater-than-anticipated rate of decline in our mature business, a mix shift to deferred revenue and FX headwinds of about 3 points year-over-year. 
When we reiterated guidance in early January, our sales volume was in line with our forecast, which assumed a back-end-loaded quarter, consistent with historical performance and as is typical in the industry. However, after a moderate calendar year budget flush, the macroeconomic environment worsened, and we saw an increase in the deferred mix of our business over the course of the last 2 weeks of the quarter.
Product revenue declined 8% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. We saw higher-than-expected volume of software and hardware maintenance contract renewals as some customers opted to delay equipment purchases. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues was up 2% year-over-year.
Now, to provide some context and better visibility into our business model, I'd like to walk through how we think about the strategic solutions revenue and software and hardware maintenance revenues coming together to create a foundation from which we can build. Revenue from strategic solutions continues to show strong growth and, as George highlighted, is now more than 50% of our product revenue. The year-over-year decline in our mature solutions revenue is driving overall product revenue declines in the near term, but the size and growth of the strategic solutions revenue gives us confidence in our strategy to drive overall product revenue growth in the future.
Looking at software and hardware maintenance revenues, I talked about the strength of our renewal business during the quarter, and as George said, 24% of our installed base is running on clustered ONTAP. While the product revenue declines will ultimately pressure software and hardware maintenance revenues, the lengthening of product life cycles, growth of our installed base, rapidly increasing mix of clustered ONTAP installed base and high renewal volume creates support for future software and hardware maintenance revenues. Indirect revenue accounted for 78% of net revenues. Gross margin was 63.1% in the third quarter, above our previous guidance, reflecting favorable mix, partially offset by aggressive pricing. Product gross margin of 51.1% was down about 6 points year-over-year, reflecting about 2 points of FX and higher discounting. Software maintenance gross margin was roughly flat, while hardware, maintenance and other services gross margin was up about 2 points, largely reflecting higher contract renewal revenue, as well as services infrastructure cost efficiencies. Operating expenses of $630 million decreased 12% year-over-year, reflecting: 3 points of FX benefit; lower headcount and related compensation cost; and the early work toward driving greater efficiency across the business, as George mentioned in his opening remarks. Operating margin of 17.6% was almost 1 point above our guidance.
Our effective tax rate was 14.9% and lower than our previous guidance, which reflects a change in the geographic mix of profits and its cumulative year-to-date impact. We expect our effective tax rate for Q4 to be approximately 16%. Our weighted average diluted share count for the third quarter was 296 million shares. Earnings per share was $0.70, within our guidance range.
Moving on to cash and balance sheet metrics. We ended the quarter with approximately $5 billion in cash and short-term investments, with approximately 12% held by our domestic entities. Deferred and financed unearned services revenue increased $80 million sequentially and $16 million year-over-year. Inventory turns increased to 20 and DSO was at 38 days.
We generated $355 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter, up 29% year-over-year. Free cash flow of $314 million was about 23% of net revenues, up 217% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. We expect free cash flow as a percentage of revenue for Q4 to be slightly above 20%.
Now I'd like to discuss share repurchases for a moment. In Q3, we repurchased approximately $85 million of our stock. This was less than we would have liked due to the events such as the SolidFire transaction, which reduced the number of days we could be in the market. However, as George noted, we remain fully committed to completing our $2.5 billion share repurchase program by the end of May 2018, which $262 million is remaining by the end of May 2016. Additionally, we paid $52 million in cash dividends in the third quarter.
Today, we also announced the next cash dividend of $0.18 per share of the company's common stock, which will be paid on April 27, 2016. Overall, we are confident in our allocation of capital between growth initiatives and shareholder returns as we continue to execute on our transformation strategy.
Looking forward to guidance. Given the increasingly uncertain macroeconomic environment, continued shifts in enterprise IT spending and our own work in transforming the company, we are tempering our forecast. For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting a revenue range of $1.35 billion to $1.5 billion. Given the aggressive pricing environment, we expect gross margins to decline to approximately 61.5%, driven by higher discounting, which will be partially offset by cost-savings initiatives.
Looking at operating margin, we are transforming the company in order to streamline the business, improve efficiency, become more focused and enhance our ability to rapidly address the changing market. Our initiatives will fundamentally change the way we do business by centralizing similar activities across functions, optimizing geographic location resources and consolidating suppliers. We are better positioning NetApp for near- and long-term success while reducing our cost structure across both cost of revenues and OpEx and ensuring that the changes we make are sustainable. 
To minimize disruption, the pace of these changes will be dictated by the company's preparedness for each transformative initiative. As George mentioned, we're driving to achieve a gross run-rate savings of $400 million by the end of fiscal 2017, which will include the previously announced discontinuance of our FlashRay product line. We plan to use these cost savings to minimize erosion of margins in a price-competitive environment. 
We will reinvest some of the gross savings into strategic opportunities such as SolidFire and productivity improvements, yielding a net run-rate savings of roughly $130 million by the end of fiscal 2017. While George touched upon several initiatives that are already underway, we will provide more specifics around additional initiatives as they are executed. 
As a step towards lowering our cost and rewiring the company, we will initiate a headcount reduction of approximately 12% during the fourth quarter. We expect to realize Q4 savings of just over $30 million, resulting in a Q4 operating margin of approximately 15% and an earnings per share target range of $0.55 to $0.60 for the fourth quarter, including the impact of the SolidFire acquisition. We expect a GAAP restructuring charge of approximately $60 million to $70 million in Q4 relating to this action.
Finally, to help with your models, I'd like to provide some color around the impact of SolidFire on our outlook. As you know, the acquisition closed on February 2. We funded the transaction through a short-term loan of $870 million. We intend to integrate SolidFire into our global operating structure and expect to retire the acquisition debt with our global earnings by the beginning of Q3 FY '17. In Q4, we expect SolidFire to reduce operating margin by about 3 points, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 15%. 
Looking forward to FY '17, we expect our strategic plan for SolidFire to contribute about 2 points of revenue growth and be dilutive to operating profit by about 2 points and to earnings per share by $0.28 to $0.30. This is at the high end of the guidance range that we gave you on the acquisition call, as that range includes the benefit of the FlashRay discontinuance, which we are now reporting as part of the overall cost-reduction plan. We anticipate that SolidFire will be accretive in FY '18.
The IT environment is changing rapidly, and we provide a lot of additional content to give you more insight into how it's impacting us and the actions we're taking to adapt. Let me summarize the 4 themes around this transformation that I want to ensure that you take away from this call. First, underlying our top line results, there is a strong strategic business that is material and growing. Second, we are significantly reducing the cost structure of our core NetApp business, aligning our resources to the market opportunity, which will expand operating margin. Third, we are committed to providing greater transparency and visibility into our business. And fourth, we're committed to our capital allocation strategy of providing a meaningful dividend that grows over time and executing a robust share repurchase program while investing in the long-term growth of the business.
With that, I'd like to hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?"

I would tell you that the base of those transitions are IT projects in our customer environments, right. And so to the extent that enterprise IT spending overall is pressured, there will be some tactical moves that customers might make to just stay on 7 for a period of time before they cut over. The programs that we initiated at the start of the year, clustered ONTAP acceleration program, has seen strong growth. We've already exceeded our expectations for the year with that program in terms of customers, the total volume of transactions, as well as the number of resellers engaged in moving customers, so we feel good."

32052,324722178,936641,"NetApp, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2016",2016-02-17,"Earnings Calls","NetApp, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Our Q3 performance reflects our strong focus on operational execution as well as continued challenges from a number of headwinds. For the quarter, we achieved our margin and EPS targets; ho",2244,"Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Our Q3 performance reflects our strong focus on operational execution as well as continued challenges from a number of headwinds. For the quarter, we achieved our margin and EPS targets; however, we recorded lower-than-expected revenue. These mixed results reflect the impact of an uncertain and volatile macroeconomic environment, which is causing a slowdown in spending that became more evident in January. Additionally, overall growth rates for enterprise IT remain under pressure as customers shift some of their spending to the cloud.
Despite these headwinds, we had a number of positives in the quarter. Our data fabric strategy and pivot towards the growth segments of the market, scale-out, software-defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud, continue to yield positive results. Earlier this month, we closed the SolidFire acquisition, positioning us to lead the rapidly growing all-flash array market.
Before I go into greater depth on the progress we've made in these areas, I want to spend time on the fundamental changes we are undertaking to return NetApp to revenue growth with improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns. 
On prior calls, I told you that I was driving a detailed inspection of the business. I have now concluded that formal review. Parts of our business are working well and growing, but we're managing through declines in other parts. We have many exciting, innovative, industry-leading products, strong relationships with customers and partners and a large, growing installed base. NetApp does not need to completely reinvent itself, but we do need to execute comprehensive and sustained transformation to deliver on our commitment to return to revenue growth and enhance profitability and shareholder returns. We will take significant steps to streamline the business and further advance our pivot to the growth areas of the market in order to capture the full potential of NetApp.
To accomplish this, we've adopted a plan with several key priorities. First, we are focused on the strategic solutions that represent our pivot to the growth segments of the market and are the foundation of how we enable customer success in the data-powered digital era. 
Second, we are substantially reducing cost and systematically streamlining the business, even while investing for the future. 
Third, we will provide greater visibility into the business and our revenue mix to demonstrate why we are so confident in our ability to capitalize on our strategic solutions. 
And fourth, we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy, which includes a combination of share repurchases, dividends and investing for the long-term growth of the business.
Let's start with our strategic solutions. As the baseline, our focus remains in enabling our customer success as they navigate through their own IT transformations, which leverage modern architectures and hybrid cloud solutions. Clustered ONTAP, Branded E-Series, all-flash arrays, hybrid cloud solutions and OnCommand Insight are the set of strategic solutions that are the basis of our pivot to the growth segments of the market. The growth rate of our strategic solutions is strong, but as I've discussed, not yet sufficient to offset the headwinds from the mature areas of our business, OEM, ONTAP 7-Mode and add-on. We expect that these headwinds will lessen as we progress through fiscal year 2017. 
As we emerge from FY '17, the transition to clustered ONTAP should be mostly behind us, as will the downward pressure that the transition has put on our add-on storage business. As OEM and ONTAP 7-Mode become a smaller part of our mix, we anticipate that our pivot towards the growth areas of the market will return the company to revenue growth, albeit moderated. 
During this transition period, we will maintain a sharp focus in execution, reduce our cost base and take additional steps to manage the trends in the storage industry. We will make transformational moves to become more focused, efficient and effective while fundamentally lowering the cost structure of the company, even as we invest in strategic opportunities, which brings us to our second priority, cost control. 
We will utilize disciplined portfolio management to improve productivity and better align resources with opportunities while simultaneously maximizing returns from the mature portions of our business. We must also streamline the business to increase our effectiveness and flexibility in responding to the rapidly changing market. All of this will expand our operating margin. 
We have launched a comprehensive program to reduce the cost base of our business by $400 million gross annually, with run-rate savings achieved by the end of fiscal year '17. We have already embarked on this initiative. We have made decisions that streamline our business, such as consolidating our hardware, engineering and manufacturing operations teams, implementing tighter controls on indirect spending and improving supply chain efficiency. These actions and lower variable compensation enabled us to lower our Q3 operating expenses by 8% sequentially. Today, we announced a restructuring and reduction in workforce of approximately 12% of total headcount. This action will generate annualized run-rate savings of approximately $200 million against our gross target. We expect the majority of this workforce reduction to occur in fiscal Q4.
As these cost efficiencies materialize, we are reinvesting some of these savings into strategic solutions like SolidFire and productivity improvements, which will allow us to be more effective at a lower cost structure, yielding a net run-rate savings of roughly $130 million by the end of fiscal year '17. We are taking a thoughtful approach to the reductions, employing disciplined portfolio management and fundamentally changing the way we operate. Savings will be achieved through business transformation, including operational process redesign, organizational restructuring and realignment and further portfolio streamlining. We are also putting into place controls to ensure that these savings are sustained. These transformational moves will better align our resources against the strategic opportunity and our cost structure to the near-term growth trajectory of the business.
While we've been working to make our model more efficient for some time now, this comprehensive and sustained transformation will enable us to realize the benefit of our pivot to the growth areas of the market at a faster pace.
Looking past the streamlining and transformation phase into fiscal year '18 and beyond, we will continue our focus on productivity and the improvements in efficiency will more substantially materialize. Our non-GAAP operating margins will improve towards the high end of our target range, inclusive of SolidFire. By coupling the strength of our data fabric strategy and the benefits we deliver to customers with a more efficient and agile business, we can increase the value we generate for customers, partners, employees and shareholders. Over time, we believe that the investments we've made in innovation and streamlining will enable us to grow at an accelerating pace with improved operating margin and cash flow.
Our third priority is transparency. The progress we've already made in our pivot towards the growth areas of the market has not been easy to measure from outside the company. To help provide visibility into this transition, we are providing greater clarity into the dynamics of our product revenue. In Q3, our strategic solutions, clustered ONTAP, Branded E-Series, all-flash arrays, hybrid cloud solutions and OnCommand Insight, made up almost 55% of product revenue and grew 26% year-over-year. By contrast, product revenue from our mature solutions, OEM, ONTAP 7-Mode and add-on, declined 40% year-over-year, predominantly from the declines in OEM and ONTAP 7-Mode.
In Q2 FY '16, we reached a significant milestone when the revenue from strategic solutions exceeded that of the mature ones. In other words, the products with the higher aggregate growth profile are the bigger proportion of our product revenue. We are getting closer to a mix where our strategic solutions can drive a reacceleration of the business. This shift in the composition of our product revenue is a good indicator of the progress we've made in our pivot to the growth areas of the market. This plus our strong software and hardware maintenance revenues create a solid foundation for NetApp.
The tight alignment between our strategic solutions and our customers' IT imperatives underscores our confidence that we will generate continued growth from this area of the business. As part of their IT modernization efforts, customers want scale-out and software-defined storage functionality for the efficient management of data growth. Clustered ONTAP enables seamless data management across flash, disk and cloud footprints and across public and private clouds for enterprise applications, regardless of the underlying hardware. 
Clustered ONTAP was deployed in almost 80% of FAS systems shipped in Q3, up from roughly 40% a year ago. Unit shipments of clustered ONTAP systems saw strong continued customer demand, growing roughly 70% year-over-year. The clustered ONTAP transition acceleration program we put in place at the start of the year is speeding the migration of installed base customers who are ready to upgrade both their systems and their software from ONTAP 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP. Our FAS installed base is growing, and clustered ONTAP now represents 24% of installed systems. The installed base mix will continue to shift to clustered ONTAP, but you should not expect a linear progression. These migrations are projects that must fit within the overall IT priorities and budgets of our customers, and we anticipate that the transition of the installed base will happen over the course of years. Both the total number of customers and new-to-NetApp customers who made clustered ONTAP purchases in Q3 grew by approximately 60% from Q3 last year. 
Flash is becoming the de facto technology for primary workloads. Our EF all-flash arrays delivered the extreme performance for stand-alone applications that infrastructure buyers and application owners need. The All Flash FAS arrays have industry-leading data management services with a unified multiprotocol capability that appeals to infrastructure architects driving data center consolidation. Customer demand for our all-flash arrays continues to grow. Our existing all-flash array business, inclusive of EF and All Flash FAS products and services, has accelerated to an almost $600 million annual run rate. 
To this strong foundation, we are excited to add SolidFire's unique scale-out block storage architecture that is compelling for the cloud architect, masterminding the next-generation data center. With this acquisition, NetApp is the clear technology leader in the all-flash array market, with the broadest portfolio of all-flash arrays in the industry, addressing the diverse needs of enterprises and service providers, which cannot be adequately met by the one-size-fits-all compromise approach of our competitors.
Our data fabric solutions are successfully positioning us to help customers with leading-edge cloud deployments. A leading software-as-a-service provider in the Asia Pacific region created a next-generation service for its customers, utilizing NetApp Private Storage for Cloud, AltaVault and OnCommand Insight, connected to multiple hyperscale clouds for compute services. They provide an outstanding customer experience, and an enterprise solution built on a single modern platform with a consistent look and feel without the risk of single cloud dependency. 
By storing data on NetApp Private Storage, they can meet customer preference for a specific cloud provider as well as improve their ability to meet SLA guarantees by scaling over to other clouds when the primary cloud is unavailable. The inherent efficiency of NetApp Private Storage also allows them to improve their profitability by effectively storing less data on tiers of flash and creating rapid virtual copies for test and development during new customer acquisitions. Additionally, they can satisfy regulators by proving where data resides at all times for government, financial services and health care customers. 
This is a great example of what I've discussed in the past. Data is at the heart of the transformation our customers are going through to improve the efficiency of their businesses and better serve their customers. At the same time, they're reducing IT budgets, looking for simpler solutions and rethinking how they consume IT. This evaluation is diverting spend towards transformational projects and architectures like scale-out, software-defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud, where our data fabric strategy gives us a compelling advantage. NetApp is the only company able to span flash to disk to cloud, and the only company delivering the ability to manage data across multiple clouds and on premises today.
Finally, I want to briefly touch on capital allocation, our fourth priority. I'll let Jeff get into the details, but in short, we are fully committed to executing our capital allocation programs and creating value for shareholders. We expect to complete our current share buyback authorization by the end of May 2018 as planned and remain committed to our dividend program. I am more confident than ever in NetApp's potential. 
While we must manage through a dynamic IT market and declines in our mature solutions, we have a clear plan and a lot of positives. We have a large and growing installed base. Our data fabric strategy uniquely enables us to assist customers in achieving their strategic IT imperatives. Our strategic solutions our greater than 50% of product revenue and growing. We are making substantial progress in the transition to clustered ONTAP and we've just expanded our comprehensive all-flash array portfolio. We are keenly focused on our business model and managing our investments between our strategic and mature solutions. The changes we are making to streamline the business and reduce the cost structure will enable investment in strategic opportunities while accelerating our ability to deliver shareholder value in the form of profitability and cash flow.
We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. I'll now turn it over to Jeff to take you through the numbers. Jeff?"

I'd like to start by thanking George and the NetApp board for the opportunity to step in as interim CFO. It's an exciting time of transformation for NetApp as we streamline the business to become more focused and efficient and, at the same time, pivot the company toward growth areas of the market and take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. The team is energized to leverage the strength of our strategic solutions to bolster the company and ultimately drive growth. We have made good progress to date and, as you heard from George, are committed to providing you with greater visibility into the dynamics of our business.
With that said, let's move to the financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. I want to remind you that unless otherwise specified, I will be using non-GAAP metrics to discuss our financial results and guidance.
Q3 net revenues of $1.39 billion were down about 4% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. While there were indicators of strength in our results, such as clustered ONTAP traction and rapid all-flash array adoption, which drove growth in our strategic solutions, our revenue performance fell short of our expectations. The shortfall was a result of a combination of the macroeconomic uncertainty George talked about that created the lengthening of deal cycles, greater-than-anticipated rate of decline in our mature business, a mix shift to deferred revenue and FX headwinds of about 3 points year-over-year. 
When we reiterated guidance in early January, our sales volume was in line with our forecast, which assumed a back-end-loaded quarter, consistent with historical performance and as is typical in the industry. However, after a moderate calendar year budget flush, the macroeconomic environment worsened, and we saw an increase in the deferred mix of our business over the course of the last 2 weeks of the quarter.
Product revenue declined 8% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. We saw higher-than-expected volume of software and hardware maintenance contract renewals as some customers opted to delay equipment purchases. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues was up 2% year-over-year.
Now, to provide some context and better visibility into our business model, I'd like to walk through how we think about the strategic solutions revenue and software and hardware maintenance revenues coming together to create a foundation from which we can build. Revenue from strategic solutions continues to show strong growth and, as George highlighted, is now more than 50% of our product revenue. The year-over-year decline in our mature solutions revenue is driving overall product revenue declines in the near term, but the size and growth of the strategic solutions revenue gives us confidence in our strategy to drive overall product revenue growth in the future.
Looking at software and hardware maintenance revenues, I talked about the strength of our renewal business during the quarter, and as George said, 24% of our installed base is running on clustered ONTAP. While the product revenue declines will ultimately pressure software and hardware maintenance revenues, the lengthening of product life cycles, growth of our installed base, rapidly increasing mix of clustered ONTAP installed base and high renewal volume creates support for future software and hardware maintenance revenues. Indirect revenue accounted for 78% of net revenues. Gross margin was 63.1% in the third quarter, above our previous guidance, reflecting favorable mix, partially offset by aggressive pricing. Product gross margin of 51.1% was down about 6 points year-over-year, reflecting about 2 points of FX and higher discounting. Software maintenance gross margin was roughly flat, while hardware, maintenance and other services gross margin was up about 2 points, largely reflecting higher contract renewal revenue, as well as services infrastructure cost efficiencies. Operating expenses of $630 million decreased 12% year-over-year, reflecting: 3 points of FX benefit; lower headcount and related compensation cost; and the early work toward driving greater efficiency across the business, as George mentioned in his opening remarks. Operating margin of 17.6% was almost 1 point above our guidance.
Our effective tax rate was 14.9% and lower than our previous guidance, which reflects a change in the geographic mix of profits and its cumulative year-to-date impact. We expect our effective tax rate for Q4 to be approximately 16%. Our weighted average diluted share count for the third quarter was 296 million shares. Earnings per share was $0.70, within our guidance range.
Moving on to cash and balance sheet metrics. We ended the quarter with approximately $5 billion in cash and short-term investments, with approximately 12% held by our domestic entities. Deferred and financed unearned services revenue increased $80 million sequentially and $16 million year-over-year. Inventory turns increased to 20 and DSO was at 38 days.
We generated $355 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter, up 29% year-over-year. Free cash flow of $314 million was about 23% of net revenues, up 217% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. We expect free cash flow as a percentage of revenue for Q4 to be slightly above 20%.
Now I'd like to discuss share repurchases for a moment. In Q3, we repurchased approximately $85 million of our stock. This was less than we would have liked due to the events such as the SolidFire transaction, which reduced the number of days we could be in the market. However, as George noted, we remain fully committed to completing our $2.5 billion share repurchase program by the end of May 2018, which $262 million is remaining by the end of May 2016. Additionally, we paid $52 million in cash dividends in the third quarter.
Today, we also announced the next cash dividend of $0.18 per share of the company's common stock, which will be paid on April 27, 2016. Overall, we are confident in our allocation of capital between growth initiatives and shareholder returns as we continue to execute on our transformation strategy.
Looking forward to guidance. Given the increasingly uncertain macroeconomic environment, continued shifts in enterprise IT spending and our own work in transforming the company, we are tempering our forecast. For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting a revenue range of $1.35 billion to $1.5 billion. Given the aggressive pricing environment, we expect gross margins to decline to approximately 61.5%, driven by higher discounting, which will be partially offset by cost-savings initiatives.
Looking at operating margin, we are transforming the company in order to streamline the business, improve efficiency, become more focused and enhance our ability to rapidly address the changing market. Our initiatives will fundamentally change the way we do business by centralizing similar activities across functions, optimizing geographic location resources and consolidating suppliers. We are better positioning NetApp for near- and long-term success while reducing our cost structure across both cost of revenues and OpEx and ensuring that the changes we make are sustainable. 
To minimize disruption, the pace of these changes will be dictated by the company's preparedness for each transformative initiative. As George mentioned, we're driving to achieve a gross run-rate savings of $400 million by the end of fiscal 2017, which will include the previously announced discontinuance of our FlashRay product line. We plan to use these cost savings to minimize erosion of margins in a price-competitive environment. 
We will reinvest some of the gross savings into strategic opportunities such as SolidFire and productivity improvements, yielding a net run-rate savings of roughly $130 million by the end of fiscal 2017. While George touched upon several initiatives that are already underway, we will provide more specifics around additional initiatives as they are executed. 
As a step towards lowering our cost and rewiring the company, we will initiate a headcount reduction of approximately 12% during the fourth quarter. We expect to realize Q4 savings of just over $30 million, resulting in a Q4 operating margin of approximately 15% and an earnings per share target range of $0.55 to $0.60 for the fourth quarter, including the impact of the SolidFire acquisition. We expect a GAAP restructuring charge of approximately $60 million to $70 million in Q4 relating to this action.
Finally, to help with your models, I'd like to provide some color around the impact of SolidFire on our outlook. As you know, the acquisition closed on February 2. We funded the transaction through a short-term loan of $870 million. We intend to integrate SolidFire into our global operating structure and expect to retire the acquisition debt with our global earnings by the beginning of Q3 FY '17. In Q4, we expect SolidFire to reduce operating margin by about 3 points, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 15%. 
Looking forward to FY '17, we expect our strategic plan for SolidFire to contribute about 2 points of revenue growth and be dilutive to operating profit by about 2 points and to earnings per share by $0.28 to $0.30. This is at the high end of the guidance range that we gave you on the acquisition call, as that range includes the benefit of the FlashRay discontinuance, which we are now reporting as part of the overall cost-reduction plan. We anticipate that SolidFire will be accretive in FY '18.
The IT environment is changing rapidly, and we provide a lot of additional content to give you more insight into how it's impacting us and the actions we're taking to adapt. Let me summarize the 4 themes around this transformation that I want to ensure that you take away from this call. First, underlying our top line results, there is a strong strategic business that is material and growing. Second, we are significantly reducing the cost structure of our core NetApp business, aligning our resources to the market opportunity, which will expand operating margin. Third, we are committed to providing greater transparency and visibility into our business. And fourth, we're committed to our capital allocation strategy of providing a meaningful dividend that grows over time and executing a robust share repurchase program while investing in the long-term growth of the business.
With that, I'd like to hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?"

In Q4, we continued our disciplined execution. Revenue and EPS were within our guidance ranges despite significant and ongoing changes to both the industry and NetApp. Like others, we continue to experience constrained enterprise IT spending as customers act with caution due to uncertain macroeconomic environment and shift some of their work loads to the cloud. As we discussed last quarter, we're making fundamental changes to return the company to revenue growth with improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns. To deliver on this commitment, we are executing a comprehensive and sustained transformation. Let me remind you of the key priorities associated with this plan. 
First, we are focused on our Data Fabric strategy and the strategic solutions that form the foundation of how we enable customer success in the data-powered digital era. To provide context for our confidence in the future, we are providing greater transparency into the progress of these solutions. 
Second, we are substantially reducing cost and systematically streamlining our operations while maintaining our ability to deliver innovation and lead the market. 
And third, we have a robust capital allocation program, which includes a combination of share repurchases, dividends and investment for the long-term growth of the business. 
I'll start with an update on the first priority, our emphasis on strategic solutions. We are facilitating our customer success as they navigate through their own IT transformations, which leverage modern architectures and hybrid cloud environment. Our strategic solutions, clustered Data ONTAP, Branded E-Series, all-flash arrays, including SolidFire, hybrid cloud solutions and OnCommand Insight enable these transformations and are the basis of our pivot to the growth segments of the market. In Q4, strategic solutions increased to 61% of net product revenue. For the full year, strategic solutions were 53% of net product revenue and grew 21% from fiscal year '15. The alignment of our strategic solutions with our customers' IT imperatives underpins our confidence that these solutions will expand our leadership in the fastest-growing segments of the market. As expected, net product revenue from our mature solutions, OEM, ONTAP 7-Mode and add-on for both Q4 and the full year declined at roughly 40% year-over-year, driven by declines in ONTAP 7-Mode. As the mature solutions become a smaller contributor to product revenue, the headwinds they generate will lessen. This will allow the growth of our strategic solutions to drive a reacceleration of the business and return the company to moderated revenue growth in fiscal '18. 
As a part of their IT transformation efforts, customers want scale-out and software-defined storage functionality for the efficient management of data growth and to achieve the agility and flexibility needed for success in the data-powered digital era. Uniquely in the storage industry, clustered ONTAP enables seamless enterprise data management across flash, disk, public and private cloud footprints for enterprise applications. With clustered ONTAP, IT organizations can consolidate multiple workloads into a single repository, dramatically improving the efficiency of their storage environments when compared to the sideload legacy architectures that we are displacing. Clustered ONTAP was deployed on 85% of FAS systems shipped in Q4, up from 50% a year ago. Customer demand for clustered ONTAP accelerated from Q3, with system shipments growing roughly 80% year-over-year. 
Our installed base of clustered ONTAP and 7-Mode systems continues to grow in total and clustered ONTAP is now running on 26% of that growing installed base. In addition, we increased the number of clustered ONTAP customers by almost 90% in fiscal year '16 from the prior year. We're pleased with the success of the clustered ONTAP transition program we put in place at the start of the year. In fiscal year '16, it migrations at approximately 1,300 installed base customers who were ready to upgrade both their systems and their software. The installed base mix will continue to shift to clustered ONTAP. However as we've said before, we anticipate that this transition will happen over the course of years as these migrations are projects that must fit within our customers' overall IT priorities and budgets. 
In the coming weeks, you'll hear about breakthrough innovations as we introduce the next generation of ONTAP, which combines new levels of simplicity with unparalleled storage efficiencies and enterprise data management capabilities. It will simplify customers' IT transformations to modern data centers and hybrid cloud environments. And customers can choose the architecture of their choice: Engineered systems, software-defined storage or cloud, all with industry-leading efficiency performance and density for flash environments, rapid and simplified deployment and greater data protection and security. In fiscal year '16, we accelerated adoption of clustered ONTAP and moved into a leadership position in the flash market, and we expect to break away from the pack with the next generation of ONTAP. 
As customers build private clouds or moved to hybrid cloud environments, they need to monitor and manage their storage as an end-to-end service across heterogeneous public and private clouds. OnCommand Insight addresses this requirement and enables customers to simplify their operations and substantially lower cost. Together, clustered ONTAP and OnCommand Insight give customers the ability to bring tremendous efficiency to their IT environments. One of the largest children's hospitals in the U.S. shows All Flash FAS running clustered ONTAP to replace the legacy high-end frame arrays from our leading competitor and will also utilize OnCommand Insight to manage their entire heterogeneous storage infrastructure across multiple data centers. 
Flash plays a key role in customers' IT transformation efforts as they speak to gain advantage through greater speed, responsiveness and value from key business applications while substantially lowering total cost of ownership. The continually improving performance and economics of flash is enabling modern modular and storage systems with scale-out software to replace legacy frame arrays and architectures freight. Flash is becoming the de facto technology for primary workloads as customers look to realize performance and economic benefits by replacing hard disk installations with flash. As they make this transition, customers cannot for go enterprise data management and the production capabilities. With a highly differentiated and complete portfolio of all-flash array offerings, NetApp is, without question, far better positioned to enable customers to accomplish this transition that any other vendor. We won a multimillion dollar deal over emerging all-flash competitors at a U.S.-based customers in the transportation industry with All Flash FAS and EF for its production database, and EDI and disaster recovery environment. They chose NetApp due to the reliability and rich feature set of our product portfolio, reflecting the strength of our all-flash array business inclusive of All Flash FAS, ES and SolidFire products and services grew 35% from Q3 to in annualized revenue run rate of over $700 million. The majority of this growth was driven by high demand for the All Flash FAS. In addition to providing a complete set of enterprise data management and production capabilities, we enable customers to preserve and leverage existing investments while taking advantage of new technologies and rapidly improving cost curves by supporting mixed capacity SSDs within a single system, something that most of our competitors cannot do. Soon, we will become the first vendor to give customers the ability to take advantage of 16 terabyte solid-state drives. Our support for mixed capacities will create even greater customer value with the introduction of these high-capacity SSDs by allowing for their workload and system consolidation, dramatically reducing data center space requirements. 
I'm pleased to report that the integration of SolidFire is going well and progressing as planned. The NetApp sales team is selling SolidFire as part of the portfolio and introducing it into new accounts. We are winning against and replacing footprints of both established and emerging vendors in customers building next-generation data centers. Execution of the product road map is on track and we'll have exciting SolidFire innovations to announce in early June. 
NetApp has an extraordinary opportunity to help customers as they move to modern architectures and hybrid cloud solutions. Our Data Fabric strategy enables data management that seamlessly connects disparate clouds and data centers. We enable our customers to manage, secure and protect their data across flash, disk and public and private cloud resources, all at the scale needed to accommodate the exponential data growth of the digital world. 
A leading telecommunications and service provider and Asia-Pacific region has embraced our hybrid cloud strategy, leveraging clustered ONTAP, our flash technologies and the Data Fabric capabilities to evolve its cloud offerings. They are deploying a solution that leverages the public cloud while retaining data sovereignty. It will give their customers choice, control and confidence and improve business agility by enabling the movement of data in and out of multiple clouds from an on-premises private cloud into a public cloud and perhaps back again all seamlessly. The service provider is so confident in the solutions themselves that they are moving their primary workloads to it in order to solve their own data management challenges. 
Ron will go into depth about cost savings and capital allocation, but I want to underscore our commitments to both of these priorities. We've launched a comprehensive program to reduce the cost base of our business even while investing in strategic opportunities such as SolidFire. In Q4, we took the first significant step in achieving these savings, and I want to thank the NetApp team for remaining focused on execution while making difficult restructuring decisions. We are also fully committed to executing our capital allocation programs and creating value for shareholders. 
In conclusion, I want to spend a little time reflecting on the strides we've made this year. When I took over as CEO, NetApp was dealing with several internal challenges. We were late to the all-flash array market, we were not prepared to assist our installed base of customers in migrating the clustered ONTAP's, and we had limited traction in the hybrid cloud. Over the course of the year, we've made substantial progress. We have moved a leadership position in the flash market with a broad portfolio that addresses multiple workload requirements and deployment styles. We regained ground with our channel partners by successfully enabling them to migrate the installed base to clustered ONTAP. Our Data Fabric strategy has proven effective in positioning us to win leading-edge cloud deployments. 
Additionally, we've added key new leaders with fresh insight and deep experience to the management team and the Board of Directors and took the first step to permanently lowering our cost base. Heading into fiscal year '17, our momentum with customers is accelerating. Data is at the heart of our customers' IT transformation efforts, and this is where NetApp has a profoundly important role to play. Our strategic relevance to customers' digital transformation road maps is evidenced by the growth of our strategic solutions. We are making meaningful progress, but still have work ahead of us and remain focused on execution. I remain highly confident in NetApp's potential. The leadership team is sharply focused on our business model and committed to returning the company to long-term growth and our target operating margin. The fundamental transformation we are undertaking to streamline the business and reduce the cost base will position us for future success by allowing investors and strategic opportunities while accelerating our ability to deliver shareholder value in the form of improved profitability and cash flow. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ron to take you through the numbers. I'm sure many of you already know him. In our search for a CFO, I looked for someone who is forward-looking, operationally astute, collaborative and an effective leader with high standard of ethics and integrity. We found that in Roon, and I'm very excited that he's on board as part of this leadership team. Welcome, Ryan."

I'm looking forward to meeting with many of you in the coming months. 
Before I get started, I'd like to thank the board and George for the confidence they have placed in me and the NetApp team for the warm welcome I received. I'm excited to be joining the team at this time for a number of reasons. As a longtime NetApp customer, I know firsthand the innovative products and passionate employees that are core to NetApp's strong foundation. In the short time I've been with NetApp, I continue to be very impressed with the commitment of employees, the dedication and quality of the management team and the relentless focus on customer success. I look forward to building on NetApp's strong foundation and leveraging my experience to help execute our transformation efforts to drive long-term growth and streamline the business. 
Now before providing detail on our fiscal 2016 performance and forward-looking guidance, I'd like to first discuss our results for Q4. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, I will be referring to non-GAAP metrics today. Q4 net revenues of $1.38 billion were relatively flat on a sequential basis and down 10% year-over-year. Product revenue was up about 1% sequentially and declined 17% year-over-year. While branded product revenue was in line with our expectations, discounting and promotions remained high and we had 6 points of impact sequentially and 4 points of impact year-over-year from weaker than expected OEM business. 
As George discussed, revenue from strategic solutions continues to grow, but are not yet sufficient to offset the headwinds from mature areas of our business. As expected, revenue declines in our mature solutions continue to put pressure on overall product revenue. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenue was down 2% sequentially and relatively flat year-over-year. 
Our gross margin was 61.1%. Product gross margin of 46.8% was down about 7 points year-over-year. The decline in ASPs are faced with declining average unit costs largely due to discounting the product promotions. Software maintenance gross margin was essentially flat year-over-year while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin was up approximately 5 points, largely reflecting the continued services infrastructure cost efficiencies and ongoing improvements in product quality. 
Operating margin of 13.4% decreased 4 points sequentially and 2 points year-over-year, driven by lower revenue, lower product margin and the acquisition of SolidFire, partially offset by the lower cost of hardware maintenance revenue and OpEx. 
As outlined last quarter, we're driving to achieve a gross run rate savings of $400 million across both cost of revenue and OpEx by the end of fiscal 2017. We will reinvest some of these savings into strategic opportunities such as SolidFire and other initiatives, yielding a net run rate savings of roughly $130 [ph] million by the end of fiscal 2017. 
In Q4, we took significant steps forward by reducing our headcount by approximately 11% sequentially. This action resulted in a GAAP restructuring charge of approximately $80 million and a gross savings of approximately $32 million in Q4. To be clear, outlining our cost structure with the opportunity ahead of us is my top priority, given it's completely within our control. We're driving additional changes that include implementing tighter cost controls over indirect spending, improving supply chain efficiency, portfolio streamlining, operational process redesign and organizational restructuring and realignment. We will report back quarterly with more specifics as we realize these savings. 
Our effective tax rate was 13.1% for the quarter, lower than our previous guidance, reflecting the impact of our geographic sales mix. EPS was within our guidance range of $0.55 per share. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were approximately $287 million. 
Moving on to cash and balance sheet metrics for Q4. We generated $345 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter, down 13% year-over-year. Free cash flow of $310 million was about 22% of net revenues, down 1% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. 
Deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue of $259 million was up 8% versus Q3 and 6% versus last year. Inventory turns increased to 22 turns and DSO was 54 days, reflecting a back-end loaded quarter.  Finally, we repurchased approximately $262 [ph] million of stock and paid $51 million in cash dividends in the fourth quarter. 
Now turning to fiscal year 2016 results. Net revenues for the full year of $5.55 billion were down about 9% from fiscal 2015. Gross margin of 62.5% was down about 1.5 points from fiscal 2015, reflecting discounting and product promotions we ran throughout most of fiscal 2016. Operating margin of 13.5% was down 3.5 points versus fiscal 2015. Our effective tax rate for the year was 15.4%. EPS for the year was $2.13, down about 21% from fiscal 2015. 
We ended the year with approximately $5.3 billion in cash and short-term investments with approximately 10% held by our domestic entities. Over the course of the year, we generated $814 million in free cash flow. 
We continue to deliver on our capital allocation strategy. Over the course of FY '16, we returned over 140% of free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.  Finally, we completed the first billion dollars of a $2.5 billion repurchase program we announced in February 2015, ahead of our original schedule. Through dividends and share repurchases, we have returned approximately $4.6 billion to shareholders since may 2013. This represents over 150% of free cash flow generated during that time frame. We remain on track to complete the remaining $1.5 billion of the share repurchase program by the end of May 2018. Today, we also announced an increase in our next cash dividend of $0.19 per share, which we'll pay on July 27, 2016. 
Now the guidance. We are confident in our competitive positioning and long-term growth potential. However, we expect fiscal 2017 to be a year of transition while we transform the company in order to streamline the business, improve efficiency rapidly address the changing market. Consistent with what was said last quarter, we expect that the growth of our strategic solutions will offset the declines in our mature solutions and ultimately drive moderated revenue growth as we emerge from FY '17. 
For FY '17, we are forecasting gross margin of 61% to 63%. We expect operating margin of 15% to 17%, including about 2 points of dilution from SolidFire. We expect our effective tax rate for the year to by approximately 16.5%. And we expect to generate significant free cash flow, enabling us to invest in the business as well as to continue to again return significant capital to our shareholders. Finally, we remain committed to delivering meaningful EPS growth, including dilution from SolidFire through leverage in our business model. 
Turning to our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We are targeting a net revenue range of $1.2 billion to $1.35 billion. At the midpoint, this implies a year-over-year decline of 4.5%, which reflects reduction in declines as strategic overtakes matured. As a reminder, year-over-year comparisons are against the 14-week-quarter we had in Q1 of fiscal 2016, which benefited software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues. We expect gross margin of 62% to 63%, reflecting the impact of continued product promotions, partially offset by cost savings initiatives. We are targeting operating margin of approximately 10% and an EPS range of $0.34 to $0.39. 
In closing, I'm excited to be here and want to emphasize that everyone at NetApp is focused and committed to permanently transforming the business by pivoting towards of the growth areas of the market and reducing cost while also delivering near-term results. While our transformation is far from complete, we had made significant progress and are confident about our future.

We have seen strong progress with both our clustered ONTAP offering as well as SolidFire that allows us to build both traditional cloud environments as well as next-generation cloud. We are also the leader from an enterprise, storage and data management technology company, without question, in the OpenStack cloud deployment, where we have seen strong year-over-year growth. In terms of the hyperscalers, our solutions that combine hyperscaler cloud computing environment with our technology like NetApp Private Storage and our Data Fabric solutions have seen good growth through the course of the year.

As we noted, about 1,300 customers accelerating to the course of the year decided to move forward from 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP. The percentage of the installed base number that you see sometimes lag the point at which it actually decide to convert, because we have to see that show up in our reporting system. We also see as they migrate that some of those smaller systems get replayed potentially by fewer, larger clustered ONTAP systems.

In Q4, we continued our disciplined execution. Revenue and EPS were within our guidance ranges despite significant and ongoing changes to both the industry and NetApp. Like others, we continue to experience constrained enterprise IT spending as customers act with caution due to an uncertain macroeconomic environment and shift some of their workloads to the cloud. As we discussed last quarter, we're making fundamental changes to return the company to revenue growth with improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns. To deliver on this commitment, we are executing a comprehensive and sustained transformation. Let me remind you of the key priorities associated with this plan. 
First, we are focused on our Data Fabric strategy and the strategic solutions that form the foundation of how we enable customer success in the data-powered digital era. To provide context for our confidence in the future, we are providing greater transparency into the progress of these solutions. 
Second, we are substantially reducing cost and systematically streamlining our operations while maintaining our ability to deliver innovation and lead the market. 
And third, we have a robust capital allocation program, which includes a combination of share repurchases, dividends and investment for the long-term growth of the business. 
I'll start with an update on the first priority, our emphasis on strategic solutions. We are facilitating our customer success as they navigate through their own IT transformations, which leverage modern architectures and hybrid cloud environments. Our strategic solutions, Clustered Data ONTAP, Branded E-Series, all-flash arrays, including SolidFire, hybrid cloud solutions and OnCommand Insight enable these transformations and are the basis of our pivot to the growth segments of the market. In Q4, strategic solutions increased to 61% of net product revenue. For the full year, strategic solutions were 53% of net product revenue and grew 21% from fiscal year '15. The alignment of our strategic solutions with our customers' IT imperatives underpins our confidence that these solutions will expand our leadership in the fastest-growing segments of the market. As expected, net product revenue from our mature solutions, OEM, ONTAP 7-Mode and add-on for both Q4 and the full year declined at roughly 40% year-over-year, driven by declines in ONTAP 7-Mode. As mature solutions become a smaller contributor to product revenue, the headwinds they generate will lessen. This will allow the growth of our strategic solutions to drive a reacceleration of the business and return the company to moderated revenue growth in fiscal '18. 
As a part of their IT transformation efforts, customers want scale-out and software-defined storage functionality for the efficient management of data growth and to achieve the agility and flexibility needed for success in the data-powered digital era. Uniquely in the storage industry, clustered ONTAP enables seamless enterprise data management across flash, disk, public and private cloud footprints for enterprise applications. With clustered ONTAP, IT organizations can consolidate multiple workloads into a single repository, dramatically improving the efficiency of their storage environments when compared to the [indiscernible] legacy SAN architectures that we are displacing. Clustered ONTAP was deployed on 85% of FAS systems shipped in Q4, up from 50% a year ago. Customer demand for clustered ONTAP accelerated from Q3, with system shipments growing roughly 80% year-over-year. 
Our installed base of clustered ONTAP and 7-Mode systems continues to grow in total and clustered ONTAP is now running on 26% of that growing installed base. In addition, we increased the number of clustered ONTAP customers by almost 90% in fiscal year '16 from the prior year. We're pleased with the success of the clustered ONTAP transition program we put in place at the start of the year. In fiscal year '16, it accelerated migrations at approximately 1,300 installed base customers who were ready to upgrade both their systems and their software. The installed base mix will continue to shift to clustered ONTAP. However, as we've said before, we anticipate that this transition will happen over the course of years as these migrations are projects that must fit within our customers' overall IT priorities and budgets. 
In the coming weeks, you'll hear about breakthrough innovations as we introduce the next generation of ONTAP, which combines new levels of simplicity with unparalleled storage efficiencies and enterprise data management capabilities. It will simplify customers' IT transformations to modern data centers and hybrid cloud environments. And customers can choose the architecture of their choice: Engineered systems, software-defined storage or cloud, all with industry-leading efficiency, performance and density for flash environments, rapid and simplified deployment and greater data protection and security. In fiscal year '16, we accelerated the adoption of clustered ONTAP and moved into a leadership position in the flash market. And we expect to break away from the pack with the next generation of ONTAP. 
As customers build private clouds or move to hybrid cloud environments, they need to monitor and manage their storage as an end-to-end service across heterogeneous public and private clouds. OnCommand Insight addresses this requirement and enables customers to simplify their operations and substantially lower cost. Together, clustered ONTAP and OnCommand Insight give customers the ability to bring tremendous efficiency to their IT environments. One of the largest children's hospitals in the U.S. chose all-flash FAS running clustered ONTAP to replace legacy high-end frame arrays from a leading competitor and will also utilize OnCommand Insight to manage their entire heterogeneous storage infrastructure across multiple data centers. 
Flash plays a key role in customers' IT transformation efforts as they seek to gain advantage through greater speed, responsiveness and value from key business applications while substantially lowering total cost of ownership. The continually improving performance and economics of flash is enabling modern modular storage systems with scale-out software to replace legacy frame array SAN architectures freight. Flash is becoming the de facto technology for primary workloads as customers look to realize performance and economic benefits by replacing hard disk installations with flash. As they make this transition, customers cannot forego enterprise data management and data protection capabilities. With a highly differentiated and complete portfolio of all-flash array offerings, NetApp is, without question, far better positioned to enable customers to accomplish this transition than any other vendor. We won a multimillion dollar deal over emerging all-flash competitors at a U.S.-based customer in the transportation industry, with all-flash FAS and EF for its production database, and DDI and disaster recovery environments. They chose NetApp due to the reliability and rich feature set of our product portfolio, reflecting the strength of our all-flash array business inclusive of all-flash FAS, EF and SolidFire product and services grew 35% from Q3 to an annualized net revenue run rate of over $700 million. The majority of this growth was driven by high demand for the all-flash FAS. In addition to providing a complete set of enterprise data management and protection capabilities, we enable customers to preserve and leverage existing investments while taking advantage of new technologies and rapidly improving cost curves by supporting mixed capacity SSDs within a single system, something that most of our competitors cannot do. Soon, we will become the first vendor to give customers the ability to take advantage of 16 terabyte solid-state drives. Our support for mixed capacities will create even greater customer value with the introduction of these high-capacity SSDs by allowing further workload and system consolidation, dramatically reducing data center space requirements. 
I'm pleased to report that the integration of SolidFire is going well and progressing as planned. The NetApp sales team is selling SolidFire as part of the portfolio and introducing it into new accounts. We're winning against and replacing footprints of both established and emerging vendors and customers building next-generation data centers. Execution of the product road map is on track, and we'll have exciting SolidFire innovations to announce in early June. 
NetApp has an extraordinary opportunity to help customers as they move to modern architectures and hybrid cloud solutions. Our Data Fabric strategy enables data management that seamlessly connects disparate clouds and data centers. We enable our customers to manage, secure and protect their data across flash, disk and public and private cloud resources, all at the scale needed to accommodate the exponential data growth of the digital world. 
A leading telecommunications and service provider in the Asia-Pacific region has embraced our hybrid cloud strategy, leveraging clustered ONTAP, our flash technologies and Data Fabric capabilities to evolve its cloud offerings. They are deploying a solution that leverages the public cloud while retaining data sovereignty. It will give their customers choice, control and confidence and improve business agility by enabling the movement of data in and out of multiple clouds from an on-premises private cloud into a public cloud and perhaps back again all seamlessly. The service provider is so confident in the solution themselves that they are moving their primary workloads to it in order to solve their own data management challenges. 
Ron will go into depth about cost savings and capital allocation, but I want to underscore our commitment to both of these priorities. We've launched a comprehensive program to reduce the cost base of our business even while investing in strategic opportunities such as SolidFire. In Q4, we took the first significant step in achieving these savings, and I want to thank the NetApp team for remaining focused on execution while making difficult restructuring decisions. We are also fully committed to executing our capital allocation programs and creating value for shareholders. 
In conclusion, I want to spend a little time reflecting on the strides we've made this year. When I took over as CEO, NetApp was dealing with several internal challenges. We were late to the all-flash array market, we were not prepared to assist our installed base of customers in migrating to clustered ONTAP and we had limited traction in the hybrid cloud. Over the course of the year, we've made substantial progress. We have moved into a leadership position in the flash market with a broad portfolio that addresses multiple workload requirements and deployment styles. We regained ground with our channel partners by successfully enabling them to migrate the installed base to clustered ONTAP. Our Data Fabric strategy has proven effective in positioning us to win leading-edge cloud deployments. 
Additionally, we've added key new leaders with fresh insight and deep experience to the management team and the Board of Directors and took the first step to permanently lowering our cost base. Heading into fiscal year '17, our momentum with customers is accelerating. Data is at the heart of our customers' IT transformation efforts. And this is where NetApp has a profoundly important role to play. Our strategic relevance to customers' digital transformation road maps is evidenced by the growth of our strategic solutions. We are making meaningful progress, but still have work ahead of us and remain focused on execution. I remain highly confident in NetApp's potential. The leadership team is sharply focused on our business model and committed to returning the company to long-term growth and our target operating margin. The fundamental transformation we are undertaking to streamline the business and reduce the cost base will position us for future success by allowing investment in strategic opportunities while accelerating our ability to deliver shareholder value in the form of improved profitability and cash flow. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ron to take you through the numbers. I'm sure many of you already know him. In our search for a CFO, I looked for someone who is forward-looking, operationally astute, collaborative and an effective leader with high standard of ethics and integrity. We found that in Roon, and I'm very excited that he's on board as part of this leadership team. Welcome, Ron."

I'm looking forward to meeting with many of you in the coming months. 
Before I get started, I'd like to thank the board and George for the confidence they have placed in me and the NetApp team for the warm welcome I received. I'm excited to be joining the team at this time for a number of reasons. As a longtime NetApp customer, I know firsthand the innovative products and passionate employees that are core to NetApp's strong foundation. In the short time I've been with NetApp, I continue to be very impressed with the commitment of employees, the dedication and quality of the management team and the relentless focus on customer success. I look forward to building on NetApp's strong foundation and leveraging my experience to help execute our transformation efforts to drive long-term growth and streamline the business. 
Now before providing detail on our fiscal 2016 performance and forward-looking guidance, I'd like to first discuss our results for Q4. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, I will be referring to non-GAAP metrics today. Q4 net revenues of $1.38 billion were relatively flat on a sequential basis and down 10% year-over-year. Product revenue was up about 1% sequentially and declined 17% year-over-year. While branded product revenue was in line with our expectations, discounting and promotions remained high, and we had 6 points of impact sequentially and 4 points of impact year-over-year from weaker than expected OEM business. 
As George discussed, revenue from strategic solutions continue to grow, but are not yet sufficient to offset the headwinds from mature areas of our business. As expected, revenue declines in our mature solutions continue to put pressure on overall product revenue. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenue was down 2% sequentially and relatively flat year-over-year. 
Our gross margin was 61.1%. Product gross margin of 46.8% was down about 7 points year-over-year. The decline in ASPs outpaced the declining average unit costs largely due to discounting and product promotions. Software maintenance gross margin was essentially flat year-over-year while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin was up approximately 5 points, largely reflecting the continued services infrastructure cost efficiencies and ongoing improvements in product quality. 
Operating margin of 13.4% decreased 4 points sequentially and 2 points year-over-year, driven by lower revenue, lower product margin and the acquisition of SolidFire, partially offset by the lower cost of hardware maintenance revenue and OpEx. 
As outlined last quarter, we're driving to achieve a gross run rate savings of $400 million across both cost of revenue and OpEx by the end of fiscal 2017. We will reinvest some of these savings into strategic opportunities such as SolidFire and other initiatives, yielding a net run rate savings of roughly $130 million by the end of fiscal 2017. 
In Q4, we took significant steps forward by reducing our headcount by approximately 11% sequentially. This actually resulted in a GAAP restructuring charge of approximately $80 million and a gross savings of approximately $32 million in Q4. To be clear, aligning our cost structure with the opportunity ahead of us is my top priority, given it's completely within our control. We're driving additional changes that include implementing tighter cost controls over indirect spending, improving supply chain efficiency, portfolio streamlining, operational process redesign and organizational restructuring and realignment. We will report back quarterly with more specifics as we realize these savings. 
Our effective tax rate was 13.1% for the quarter, lower than our previous guidance, reflecting the impact of our geographic sales mix. EPS was within our guidance range of $0.55 per share. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were approximately $287 million. 
Moving on to cash and balance sheet metrics for Q4. We generated $345 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter, down 13% year-over-year. Free cash flow of $310 million was about 22% of net revenues, down 1% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. 
Deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue of $259 million was up 8% versus Q3 and 6% versus last year. Inventory turns increased to 22 turns and DSO was 54 days, reflecting a back-end loaded quarter. Finally, we repurchased approximately $262 million of stock and paid $51 million in cash dividends in the fourth quarter. 
Now turning to fiscal year 2016 results. Net revenues for the full year of $5.55 billion were down about 9% from fiscal 2015. Gross margin of 62.5% was down about 1.5 from fiscal 2015, reflecting discounting and product promotions we ran throughout most of fiscal 2016. Operating margin of 13.5% was down 3.5 points versus fiscal 2015. Our effective tax rate for the year was 15.4%. EPS for the year was $2.13, down about 21% from fiscal 2015. 
We ended the year with approximately $5.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, with approximately 10% held by our domestic entities. Over the course of the year, we generated $814 million in free cash flow. 
We continue to deliver on our capital allocation strategy. Over the course of FY '16, we've returned over 140% of free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Finally, we completed the first billion dollars of the $2.5 billion repurchase program we announced in February 2015, ahead of our original schedule. Through dividends and share repurchases, we have returned approximately $4.6 billion to shareholders since may 2013. This represents over 150% of free cash flow generated during that time frame. We remain on track to complete the remaining $1.5 billion of the share repurchase program by the end of May 2018. Today, we also announced an increase in our next cash dividend of $0.19 per share, which we'll pay on July 27, 2016. 
Now to guidance. We are confident in our competitive positioning and long-term growth potential. However, we expect fiscal 2017 to be a year of transition while we transform the company in order to streamline the business, improve efficiency and rapidly address the changing market. Consistent with what was said last quarter, we expect that the growth of our strategic solutions will offset the declines in our mature solutions and ultimately drive moderated revenue growth as we emerge from FY '17. 
For FY '17, we are forecasting gross margin of 61% to 63%. We expect operating margin of 15% to 17%, including about 2 points of dilution from SolidFire. We expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 16.5%. And we expect to generate significant free cash flow, enabling us to invest in the business as well as to continue to again return significant capital to our shareholders. Finally, we remain committed to delivering meaningful EPS growth, including dilution from SolidFire through leverage in our business model. 
Turning to our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We are targeting a net revenue range of $1.2 billion to $1.35 billion. At the midpoint, this implies a year-over-year decline of 4.5%, which reflects reduction in declines as strategic overtakes mature. As a reminder, year-over-year compares are against the 14-week quarter we had in Q1 of fiscal 2016, which benefited software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues. We expect gross margin of 62% to 63%, reflecting the impact of continued product promotions, partially offset by cost savings initiatives. We are targeting operating margin of approximately 10% and an EPS range of $0.34 to $0.39. 
In closing, I'm excited to be here and want to emphasize that everyone at NetApp is focused and committed to permanently transforming the business by pivoting toward the growth areas of the market and reducing costs while also delivering near-term results. While our transformation is far from complete, we have made significant progress and are confident about our future.

You mentioned in your opening comments that you're actually seeing more business shift to the clouds. I assume that when it goes there, you end up not having the majority of the storage sales from that, especially if it's obviously going to AWS and maybe combine that with server-side flash and software-defined storage? Our check suggest that there is improvement in that area, and now you can use software-defined storage to pull together all the storage in servers, before there were [indiscernible].

We did not see any sort of substantial trend between Q3 and Q4 in terms of the cloud. In terms of our positioning for the cloud, we have substantially improved our own positioning over the course of the year for us being -- serving customers with workloads on the cloud. And let me articulate that in 3 ways: First, as a supplier of technology to cloud providers, both people in enterprises building their own clouds as well as service providers building clouds. We have seen strong progress with both our clustered ONTAP offerings as well as SolidFire that allows us to build both traditional cloud environments as well as next-generation cloud. We are also the leader from an enterprise, storage and data management technology company, without question, in the OpenStack cloud deployments, where we have seen strong year-on-year growth. In terms of the hyperscalers, our solutions that combine hyperscaler cloud computing environments with our technology like NetApp Private Storage and our Data Fabric solutions have seen good growth through the course of the year. It's early, but as we noted, we are winning our share of leading-edge hybrid cloud deployments and are the only enterprise vendor who has the capability to combine hyperscaler cloud with enterprise data management. Finally, as you note through the course of the year, there are several examples of customers that started out on public cloud and decided to either migrate data and storage footprints to on-premises environments, and we are uniquely positioned to capture those workloads as they transition either on-prem to the cloud or from the public cloud back on-prem."

First of all, the total installed base of 7-Mode systems and clustered ONTAP systems is growing. So our installed base is not declining. It's actually growing, and clustered ONTAP is growing as a percentage of that. The installed base is a very large number, so even 26% of that installed base is actually a substantial number. We have run promotions through the course of the year to enable customers to transition from 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP. As we noted, about 1,300 customers accelerating through the course of the year decided to move forward from 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP. The percentage of the installed base number that you see sometimes lags the point at which they actually decide to convert, because we have to see that show up in our reporting systems. We also see as they migrate that some of those smaller systems get replaced potentially by fewer larger clustered ONTAP systems. So the percentage of systems under clustered ONTAP actually represents -- under represents sometimes the total value of the systems that we have transitioned. In terms of the overall outlook for clustered ONTAP, we continue to stay focused on the total percentage of our installed base look like total percentage of shipments. And as you see, the percentage of shipments is now very much clustered ONTAP, 85% of shipments of the factory and capacity under management, which is now close to 40%."

As customers make that transition, what they really want in the sort of the majority move is they want the enterprise data management features. And how they choose to use it can be one of 3 ways. The first is greenfields, where for new deployments of enterprise applications, they choose to deploy an all-flash configuration as opposed to a hybrid or disk-based configuration. The second could be a retrofit of an existing architecture where, in the case of clustered ONTAP, we are able to give people a completely transparent way to upgrade a disk drive system to an all-flash system. And so if you've got temporary needs or need for additional performance at a particular point in the season, you can do that very, very easily with us. And the third, as we have noted, is all-flash systems are the new SAN configurations. And we have replaced in customer after customer traditional fiber channel frame arrays from our incumbent competitors with all-flash storage systems."

In Q4, we continued our disciplined execution. Revenue and EPS were within our guidance ranges despite significant and ongoing changes to both the industry and NetApp. Like others, we continue to experience constrained enterprise IT spending as customers act with caution due to an uncertain macroeconomic environment and shift some of their workloads to the cloud. As we discussed last quarter, we're making fundamental changes to return the company to revenue growth with improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns. To deliver on this commitment, we are executing a comprehensive and sustained transformation. Let me remind you of the key priorities associated with this plan. 
First, we are focused on our Data Fabric strategy and the strategic solutions that form the foundation of how we enable customer success in the data-powered digital era. To provide context for our confidence in the future, we are providing greater transparency into the progress of these solutions. 
Second, we are substantially reducing cost and systematically streamlining our operations while maintaining our ability to deliver innovation and lead the market. 
And third, we have a robust capital allocation program, which includes a combination of share repurchases, dividends and investment for the long-term growth of the business. 
I'll start with an update on the first priority, our emphasis on strategic solutions. We are facilitating our customer success as they navigate through their own IT transformations, which leverage modern architectures and hybrid cloud environments. Our strategic solutions, Clustered Data ONTAP, Branded E-Series, all-flash arrays, including SolidFire, hybrid cloud solutions and OnCommand Insight enable these transformations and are the basis of our pivot to the growth segments of the market. In Q4, strategic solutions increased to 61% of net product revenue. For the full year, strategic solutions were 53% of net product revenue and grew 21% from fiscal year '15. The alignment of our strategic solutions with our customers' IT imperatives underpins our confidence that these solutions will expand our leadership in the fastest-growing segments of the market. As expected, net product revenue from our mature solutions, OEM, ONTAP 7-Mode and add-on for both Q4 and the full year declined at roughly 40% year-over-year, driven by declines in ONTAP 7-Mode. As mature solutions become a smaller contributor to product revenue, the headwinds they generate will lessen. This will allow the growth of our strategic solutions to drive a reacceleration of the business and return the company to moderated revenue growth in fiscal '18. 
As a part of their IT transformation efforts, customers want scale-out and software-defined storage functionality for the efficient management of data growth and to achieve the agility and flexibility needed for success in the data-powered digital era. Uniquely in the storage industry, clustered ONTAP enables seamless enterprise data management across flash, disk, public and private cloud footprints for enterprise applications. With clustered ONTAP, IT organizations can consolidate multiple workloads into a single repository, dramatically improving the efficiency of their storage environments when compared to the siloed legacy SAN architectures that we are displacing. Clustered ONTAP was deployed on 85% of FAS systems shipped in Q4, up from 50% a year ago. Customer demand for clustered ONTAP accelerated from Q3, with system shipments growing roughly 80% year-over-year. 
Our installed base of clustered ONTAP and 7-Mode systems continues to grow in total and clustered ONTAP is now running on 26% of that growing installed base. In addition, we increased the number of clustered ONTAP customers by almost 90% in fiscal year '16 from the prior year. We're pleased with the success of the clustered ONTAP transition program we put in place at the start of the year. In fiscal year '16, it accelerated migrations at approximately 1,300 installed base customers who were ready to upgrade both their systems and their software. The installed base mix will continue to shift to clustered ONTAP. However, as we've said before, we anticipate that this transition will happen over the course of years as these migrations are projects that must fit within our customers' overall IT priorities and budgets. 
In the coming weeks, you'll hear about breakthrough innovations as we introduce the next generation of ONTAP, which combines new levels of simplicity with unparalleled storage efficiencies and enterprise data management capabilities. It will simplify customers' IT transformations to modern data centers and hybrid cloud environments. And customers can choose the architecture of their choice: Engineered systems, software-defined storage or cloud, all with industry-leading efficiency, performance and density for flash environments, rapid and simplified deployment and greater data protection and security. In fiscal year '16, we accelerated the adoption of clustered ONTAP and moved into a leadership position in the flash market. And we expect to break away from the pack with the next generation of ONTAP. 
As customers build private clouds or move to hybrid cloud environments, they need to monitor and manage their storage as an end-to-end service across heterogeneous public and private clouds. OnCommand Insight addresses this requirement and enables customers to simplify their operations and substantially lower cost. Together, clustered ONTAP and OnCommand Insight give customers the ability to bring tremendous efficiency to their IT environments. One of the largest children's hospitals in the U.S. chose all-flash FAS running clustered ONTAP to replace legacy high-end frame arrays from a leading competitor and will also utilize OnCommand Insight to manage their entire heterogeneous storage infrastructure across multiple data centers. 
Flash plays a key role in customers' IT transformation efforts as they seek to gain advantage through greater speed, responsiveness and value from key business applications while substantially lowering total cost of ownership. The continually improving performance and economics of flash is enabling modern modular storage systems with scale-out software to replace legacy frame array SAN architectures freight. Flash is becoming the de facto technology for primary workloads as customers look to realize performance and economic benefits by replacing hard disk installations with flash. As they make this transition, customers cannot forgo enterprise data management and data protection capabilities. With a highly differentiated and complete portfolio of all-flash array offerings, NetApp is, without question, far better positioned to enable customers to accomplish this transition than any other vendor. We won a multimillion dollar deal over emerging all-flash competitors at a U.S.-based customer in the transportation industry, with all-flash FAS and EF for its production database, and DDI and disaster recovery environments. They chose NetApp due to the reliability and rich feature set of our product portfolio, reflecting the strength of our all-flash array business inclusive of all-flash FAS, EF and SolidFire product and services grew 35% from Q3 to an annualized net revenue run rate of over $700 million. The majority of this growth was driven by high demand for the all-flash FAS. In addition to providing a complete set of enterprise data management and protection capabilities, we enable customers to preserve and leverage existing investments while taking advantage of new technologies and rapidly improving cost curves by supporting mixed capacity SSDs within a single system, something that most of our competitors cannot do. Soon, we will become the first vendor to give customers the ability to take advantage of 16 terabyte solid-state drives. Our support for mixed capacities will create even greater customer value with the introduction of these high-capacity SSDs by allowing further workload and system consolidation, dramatically reducing data center space requirements. 
I'm pleased to report that the integration of SolidFire is going well and progressing as planned. The NetApp sales team is selling SolidFire as part of the portfolio and introducing it into new accounts. We're winning against and replacing footprints of both established and emerging vendors and customers building next-generation data centers. Execution of the product road map is on track, and we'll have exciting SolidFire innovations to announce in early June. 
NetApp has an extraordinary opportunity to help customers as they move to modern architectures and hybrid cloud solutions. Our Data Fabric strategy enables data management that seamlessly connects disparate clouds and data centers. We enable our customers to manage, secure and protect their data across flash, disk and public and private cloud resources, all at the scale needed to accommodate the exponential data growth of the digital world. 
A leading telecommunications and service provider in the Asia-Pacific region has embraced our hybrid cloud strategy, leveraging clustered ONTAP, our flash technologies and Data Fabric capabilities to evolve its cloud offerings. They are deploying a solution that leverages the public cloud while retaining data sovereignty. It will give their customers choice, control and confidence and improve business agility by enabling the movement of data in and out of multiple clouds from an on-premises private cloud into a public cloud and perhaps back again all seamlessly. The service provider is so confident in the solution themselves that they are moving their primary workloads to it in order to solve their own data management challenges. 
Ron will go into depth about cost savings and capital allocation, but I want to underscore our commitment to both of these priorities. We've launched a comprehensive program to reduce the cost base of our business even while investing in strategic opportunities such as SolidFire. In Q4, we took the first significant step in achieving these savings, and I want to thank the NetApp team for remaining focused on execution while making difficult restructuring decisions. We are also fully committed to executing our capital allocation programs and creating value for shareholders. 
In conclusion, I want to spend a little time reflecting on the strides we've made this year. When I took over as CEO, NetApp was dealing with several internal challenges. We were late to the all-flash array market, we were not prepared to assist our installed base of customers in migrating to clustered ONTAP and we had limited traction in the hybrid cloud. Over the course of the year, we've made substantial progress. We have moved into a leadership position in the flash market with a broad portfolio that addresses multiple workload requirements and deployment styles. We regained ground with our channel partners by successfully enabling them to migrate the installed base to clustered ONTAP. Our Data Fabric strategy has proven effective in positioning us to win leading-edge cloud deployments. 
Additionally, we've added key new leaders with fresh insight and deep experience to the management team and the Board of Directors and took the first step to permanently lowering our cost base. Heading into fiscal year '17, our momentum with customers is accelerating. Data is at the heart of our customers' IT transformation efforts. And this is where NetApp has a profoundly important role to play. Our strategic relevance to customers' digital transformation road maps is evidenced by the growth of our strategic solutions. We are making meaningful progress, but still have work ahead of us and remain focused on execution. I remain highly confident in NetApp's potential. The leadership team is sharply focused on our business model and committed to returning the company to long-term growth and our target operating margin. The fundamental transformation we are undertaking to streamline the business and reduce the cost base will position us for future success by allowing investment in strategic opportunities while accelerating our ability to deliver shareholder value in the form of improved profitability and cash flow. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ron to take you through the numbers. I'm sure many of you already know him. In our search for a CFO, I looked for someone who is forward-looking, operationally astute, collaborative and an effective leader with high standard of ethics and integrity. We found that in Ron, and I'm very excited that he's on board as part of this leadership team. Welcome, Ron."

I'm looking forward to meeting with many of you in the coming months. 
Before I get started, I'd like to thank the board and George for the confidence they have placed in me and the NetApp team for the warm welcome I received. I'm excited to be joining the team at this time for a number of reasons. As a longtime NetApp customer, I know firsthand the innovative products and passionate employees that are core to NetApp's strong foundation. In the short time I've been with NetApp, I continue to be very impressed with the commitment of employees, the dedication and quality of the management team and the relentless focus on customer success. I look forward to building on NetApp's strong foundation and leveraging my experience to help execute our transformation efforts to drive long-term growth and streamline the business. 
Now before providing detail on our fiscal 2016 performance and forward-looking guidance, I'd like to first discuss our results for Q4. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, I will be referring to non-GAAP metrics today. Q4 net revenues of $1.38 billion were relatively flat on a sequential basis and down 10% year-over-year. Product revenue was up about 1% sequentially and declined 17% year-over-year. While branded product revenue was in line with our expectations, discounting and promotions remained high, and we had 6 points of impact sequentially and 4 points of impact year-over-year from weaker than expected OEM business. 
As George discussed, revenue from strategic solutions continue to grow, but are not yet sufficient to offset the headwinds from mature areas of our business. As expected, revenue declines in our mature solutions continue to put pressure on overall product revenue. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenue was down 2% sequentially and relatively flat year-over-year. 
Our gross margin was 61.1%. Product gross margin of 46.8% was down about 7 points year-over-year. The decline in ASPs outpaced the decline in average unit costs largely due to discounting and product promotions. Software maintenance gross margin was essentially flat year-over-year while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin was up approximately 5 points, largely reflecting the continued services infrastructure cost efficiencies and ongoing improvements in product quality. 
Operating margin of 13.4% decreased 4 points sequentially and 2 points year-over-year, driven by lower revenue, lower product margin and the acquisition of SolidFire, partially offset by the lower cost of hardware maintenance revenue and OpEx. 
As outlined last quarter, we're driving to achieve a gross run rate savings of $400 million across both cost of revenue and OpEx by the end of fiscal 2017. We will reinvest some of these savings into strategic opportunities such as SolidFire and other initiatives, yielding a net run rate savings of roughly $130 million by the end of fiscal 2017. 
In Q4, we took significant steps forward by reducing our headcount by approximately 11% sequentially. This action resulted in a GAAP restructuring charge of approximately $80 million and a gross savings of approximately $32 million in Q4. To be clear, aligning our cost structure with the opportunity ahead of us is my top priority, given it's completely within our control. We're driving additional changes that include implementing tighter cost controls over indirect spending, improving supply chain efficiency, portfolio streamlining, operational process redesign and organizational restructuring and realignment. We will report back quarterly with more specifics as we realize these savings. 
Our effective tax rate was 13.1% for the quarter, lower than our previous guidance, reflecting the impact of our geographic sales mix. EPS was within our guidance range of $0.55 per share. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were approximately $287 million. 
Moving on to cash and balance sheet metrics for Q4. We generated $345 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter, down 13% year-over-year. Free cash flow of $310 million was about 22% of net revenues, down 1% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. 
Deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue of $259 million was up 8% versus Q3 and 6% versus last year. Inventory turns increased to 22 turns and DSO was 54 days, reflecting a back-end loaded quarter. Finally, we repurchased approximately $262 million of stock and paid $51 million in cash dividends in the fourth quarter. 
Now turning to fiscal year 2016 results. Net revenues for the full year of $5.55 billion were down about 9% from fiscal 2015. Gross margin of 62.5% was down about 1.5 from fiscal 2015, reflecting discounting and product promotions we ran throughout most of fiscal 2016. Operating margin of 13.5% was down 3.5 points versus fiscal 2015. Our effective tax rate for the year was 15.4%. EPS for the year was $2.13, down about 21% from fiscal 2015. 
We ended the year with approximately $5.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, with approximately 10% held by our domestic entities. Over the course of the year, we generated $814 million in free cash flow. 
We continue to deliver on our capital allocation strategy. Over the course of FY '16, we've returned over 140% of free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Finally, we completed the first billion dollars of the $2.5 billion repurchase program we announced in February 2015, ahead of our original schedule. Through dividends and share repurchases, we have returned approximately $4.6 billion to shareholders since May 2013. This represents over 150% of free cash flow generated during that time frame. We remain on track to complete the remaining $1.5 billion of the share repurchase program by the end of May 2018. Today, we also announced an increase in our next cash dividend of $0.19 per share, which we'll pay on July 27, 2016. 
Now to guidance. We are confident in our competitive positioning and long-term growth potential. However, we expect fiscal 2017 to be a year of transition while we transform the company in order to streamline the business, improve efficiency and rapidly address the changing market. Consistent with what was said last quarter, we expect that the growth of our strategic solutions will offset the declines in our mature solutions and ultimately drive moderated revenue growth as we emerge from FY '17. 
For FY '17, we are forecasting gross margin of 61% to 63%. We expect operating margin of 15% to 17%, including about 2 points of dilution from SolidFire. We expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 16.5%. And we expect to generate significant free cash flow, enabling us to invest in the business as well as to continue to again return significant capital to our shareholders. Finally, we remain committed to delivering meaningful EPS growth, including dilution from SolidFire through leverage in our business model. 
Turning to our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We are targeting a net revenue range of $1.2 billion to $1.35 billion. At the midpoint, this implies a year-over-year decline of 4.5%, which reflects reduction in declines as strategic overtakes mature. As a reminder, year-over-year compares are against the 14-week quarter we had in Q1 of fiscal 2016, which benefited software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues. We expect gross margin of 62% to 63%, reflecting the impact of continued product promotions, partially offset by cost savings initiatives. We are targeting operating margin of approximately 10% and an EPS range of $0.34 to $0.39. 
In closing, I'm excited to be here and want to emphasize that everyone at NetApp is focused and committed to permanently transforming the business by pivoting toward the growth areas of the market and reducing costs while also delivering near-term results. While our transformation is far from complete, we have made significant progress and are confident about our future.

In terms of our positioning for the cloud, we have substantially improved our own positioning over the course of the year for us being -- serving customers with workloads on the cloud. And let me articulate that in 3 ways: First, as a supplier of technology to cloud providers, both people in enterprises building their own clouds as well as service providers building clouds. We have seen strong progress with both our clustered ONTAP offerings as well as SolidFire that allows us to build both traditional cloud environments as well as next-generation cloud. We are also the leader from an enterprise, storage and data management technology company, without question, in the OpenStack cloud deployments, where we have seen strong year-on-year growth. In terms of the hyperscalers, our solutions that combine hyperscaler cloud computing environments with our technology like NetApp Private Storage and our Data Fabric solutions have seen good growth through the course of the year. It's early, but as we noted, we are winning our share of leading-edge hybrid cloud deployments and are the only enterprise vendor who has the capability to combine hyperscaler cloud with enterprise data management. Finally, as you note through the course of the year, there are several examples of customers that started out on public cloud and decided to either migrate data and storage footprints to on-premises environments, and we are uniquely positioned to capture those workloads as they transition either on-prem to the cloud or from the public cloud back on-prem."

First of all, the total installed base of 7-Mode systems and clustered ONTAP systems is growing. So our installed base is not declining. It's actually growing, and clustered ONTAP is growing as a percentage of that. The installed base is a very large number, so even 26% of that installed base is actually a substantial number. We have run promotions through the course of the year to enable customers to transition from 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP. As we noted, about 1,300 customers accelerating through the course of the year decided to move forward from 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP. The percentage of the installed base number that you see sometimes lags the point at which they actually decide to convert, because we have to see that show up in our reporting systems. We also see as they migrate that some of those smaller systems get replaced potentially by fewer larger clustered ONTAP systems. So the percentage of systems under clustered ONTAP actually represents -- under represents sometimes the total value of the systems that we have transitioned. In terms of the overall outlook for clustered ONTAP, we continue to stay focused on the total percentage of our installed base look like total percentage of shipments.

As customers make that transition, what they really want in the sort of the majority move is they want the enterprise data management features. And how they choose to use it can be one of 3 ways. The first is greenfields, where for new deployments of enterprise applications, they choose to deploy an all-flash configuration as opposed to a hybrid or disk-based configuration. The second could be a retrofit of an existing architecture where, in the case of clustered ONTAP, we are able to give people a completely transparent way to upgrade a disk drive system to an all-flash system. And so if you've got temporal needs or need for additional performance at a particular point in the season, you can do that very, very easily with us. And the third, as we have noted, is all-flash systems are the new SAN configurations. And we have replaced in customer after customer traditional fiber channel frame arrays from our incumbent competitors with all-flash storage systems."

In Q4, we continued our disciplined execution. Revenue and EPS were within our guidance ranges despite significant and ongoing changes to both the industry and NetApp. Like others, we continue to experience constrained enterprise IT spending as customers act with caution due to an uncertain macroeconomic environment and shift some of their workloads to the cloud. As we discussed last quarter, we're making fundamental changes to return the company to revenue growth with improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns. To deliver on this commitment, we are executing a comprehensive and sustained transformation. Let me remind you of the key priorities associated with this plan. 
First, we are focused on our Data Fabric strategy and the strategic solutions that form the foundation of how we enable customer success in the data-powered digital era. To provide context for our confidence in the future, we are providing greater transparency into the progress of these solutions. 
Second, we are substantially reducing cost and systematically streamlining our operations while maintaining our ability to deliver innovation and lead the market. 
And third, we have a robust capital allocation program, which includes a combination of share repurchases, dividends and investment for the long-term growth of the business. 
I'll start with an update on the first priority, our emphasis on strategic solutions. We are facilitating our customer success as they navigate through their own IT transformations, which leverage modern architectures and hybrid cloud environments. Our strategic solutions, Clustered Data ONTAP, Branded E-Series, all-flash arrays, including SolidFire, hybrid cloud solutions and OnCommand Insight enable these transformations and are the basis of our pivot to the growth segments of the market. In Q4, strategic solutions increased to 61% of net product revenue. For the full year, strategic solutions were 53% of net product revenue and grew 21% from fiscal year '15. The alignment of our strategic solutions with our customers' IT imperatives underpins our confidence that these solutions will expand our leadership in the fastest-growing segments of the market. As expected, net product revenue from our mature solutions, OEM, ONTAP 7-Mode and add-on for both Q4 and the full year declined at roughly 40% year-over-year, driven by declines in ONTAP 7-Mode. As mature solutions become a smaller contributor to product revenue, the headwinds they generate will lessen. This will allow the growth of our strategic solutions to drive a reacceleration of the business and return the company to moderated revenue growth in fiscal '18. 
As a part of their IT transformation efforts, customers want scale-out and software-defined storage functionality for the efficient management of data growth and to achieve the agility and flexibility needed for success in the data-powered digital era. Uniquely in the storage industry, clustered ONTAP enables seamless enterprise data management across flash, disk, public and private cloud footprints for enterprise applications. With clustered ONTAP, IT organizations can consolidate multiple workloads into a single repository, dramatically improving the efficiency of their storage environments when compared to the siloed legacy SAN architectures that we are displacing. Clustered ONTAP was deployed on 85% of FAS systems shipped in Q4, up from 50% a year ago. Customer demand for clustered ONTAP accelerated from Q3, with system shipments growing roughly 80% year-over-year. 
Our installed base of clustered ONTAP and 7-Mode systems continues to grow in total and clustered ONTAP is now running on 26% of that growing installed base. In addition, we increased the number of clustered ONTAP customers by almost 90% in fiscal year '16 from the prior year. We're pleased with the success of the clustered ONTAP transition program we put in place at the start of the year. In fiscal year '16, it accelerated migrations at approximately 1,300 installed base customers who were ready to upgrade both their systems and their software. The installed base mix will continue to shift to clustered ONTAP. However, as we've said before, we anticipate that this transition will happen over the course of years as these migrations are projects that must fit within our customers' overall IT priorities and budgets. 
In the coming weeks, you'll hear about breakthrough innovations as we introduce the next generation of ONTAP, which combines new levels of simplicity with unparalleled storage efficiencies and enterprise data management capabilities. It will simplify customers' IT transformations to modern data centers and hybrid cloud environments. And customers can choose the architecture of their choice: Engineered systems, software-defined storage or cloud, all with industry-leading efficiency, performance and density for flash environments, rapid and simplified deployment and greater data protection and security. In fiscal year '16, we accelerated the adoption of clustered ONTAP and moved into a leadership position in the flash market. And we expect to break away from the pack with the next generation of ONTAP. 
As customers build private clouds or move to hybrid cloud environments, they need to monitor and manage their storage as an end-to-end service across heterogeneous public and private clouds. OnCommand Insight addresses this requirement and enables customers to simplify their operations and substantially lower cost. Together, clustered ONTAP and OnCommand Insight give customers the ability to bring tremendous efficiency to their IT environments. One of the largest children's hospitals in the U.S. chose all-flash FAS running clustered ONTAP to replace legacy high-end frame arrays from a leading competitor and will also utilize OnCommand Insight to manage their entire heterogeneous storage infrastructure across multiple data centers. 
Flash plays a key role in customers' IT transformation efforts as they seek to gain advantage through greater speed, responsiveness and value from key business applications while substantially lowering total cost of ownership. The continually improving performance and economics of flash is enabling modern modular storage systems with scale-out software to replace legacy frame array SAN architectures freight. Flash is becoming the de facto technology for primary workloads as customers look to realize performance and economic benefits by replacing hard disk installations with flash. As they make this transition, customers cannot forgo enterprise data management and data protection capabilities. With a highly differentiated and complete portfolio of all-flash array offerings, NetApp is, without question, far better positioned to enable customers to accomplish this transition than any other vendor. We won a multimillion dollar deal over emerging all-flash competitors at a U.S.-based customer in the transportation industry, with all-flash FAS and EF for its production database, and DDI and disaster recovery environments. They chose NetApp due to the reliability and rich feature set of our product portfolio, reflecting the strength of our all-flash array business inclusive of all-flash FAS, EF and SolidFire product and services grew 35% from Q3 to an annualized net revenue run rate of over $700 million. The majority of this growth was driven by high demand for the all-flash FAS. In addition to providing a complete set of enterprise data management and protection capabilities, we enable customers to preserve and leverage existing investments while taking advantage of new technologies and rapidly improving cost curves by supporting mixed capacity SSDs within a single system, something that most of our competitors cannot do. Soon, we will become the first vendor to give customers the ability to take advantage of 16 terabyte solid-state drives. Our support for mixed capacities will create even greater customer value with the introduction of these high-capacity SSDs by allowing further workload and system consolidation, dramatically reducing data center space requirements. 
I'm pleased to report that the integration of SolidFire is going well and progressing as planned. The NetApp sales team is selling SolidFire as part of the portfolio and introducing it into new accounts. We're winning against and replacing footprints of both established and emerging vendors and customers building next-generation data centers. Execution of the product road map is on track, and we'll have exciting SolidFire innovations to announce in early June. 
NetApp has an extraordinary opportunity to help customers as they move to modern architectures and hybrid cloud solutions. Our Data Fabric strategy enables data management that seamlessly connects disparate clouds and data centers. We enable our customers to manage, secure and protect their data across flash, disk and public and private cloud resources, all at the scale needed to accommodate the exponential data growth of the digital world. 
A leading telecommunications and service provider in the Asia-Pacific region has embraced our hybrid cloud strategy, leveraging clustered ONTAP, our flash technologies and Data Fabric capabilities to evolve its cloud offerings. They are deploying a solution that leverages the public cloud while retaining data sovereignty. It will give their customers choice, control and confidence and improve business agility by enabling the movement of data in and out of multiple clouds from an on-premises private cloud into a public cloud and perhaps back again all seamlessly. The service provider is so confident in the solution themselves that they are moving their primary workloads to it in order to solve their own data management challenges. 
Ron will go into depth about cost savings and capital allocation, but I want to underscore our commitment to both of these priorities. We've launched a comprehensive program to reduce the cost base of our business even while investing in strategic opportunities such as SolidFire. In Q4, we took the first significant step in achieving these savings, and I want to thank the NetApp team for remaining focused on execution while making difficult restructuring decisions. We are also fully committed to executing our capital allocation programs and creating value for shareholders. 
In conclusion, I want to spend a little time reflecting on the strides we've made this year. When I took over as CEO, NetApp was dealing with several internal challenges. We were late to the all-flash array market, we were not prepared to assist our installed base of customers in migrating to clustered ONTAP and we had limited traction in the hybrid cloud. Over the course of the year, we've made substantial progress. We have moved into a leadership position in the flash market with a broad portfolio that addresses multiple workload requirements and deployment styles. We regained ground with our channel partners by successfully enabling them to migrate the installed base to clustered ONTAP. Our Data Fabric strategy has proven effective in positioning us to win leading-edge cloud deployments. 
Additionally, we've added key new leaders with fresh insight and deep experience to the management team and the Board of Directors and took the first step to permanently lowering our cost base. Heading into fiscal year '17, our momentum with customers is accelerating. Data is at the heart of our customers' IT transformation efforts. And this is where NetApp has a profoundly important role to play. Our strategic relevance to customers' digital transformation road maps is evidenced by the growth of our strategic solutions. We are making meaningful progress, but still have work ahead of us and remain focused on execution. I remain highly confident in NetApp's potential. The leadership team is sharply focused on our business model and committed to returning the company to long-term growth and our target operating margin. The fundamental transformation we are undertaking to streamline the business and reduce the cost base will position us for future success by allowing investment in strategic opportunities while accelerating our ability to deliver shareholder value in the form of improved profitability and cash flow. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ron to take you through the numbers. I'm sure many of you already know him. In our search for a CFO, I looked for someone who is forward-looking, operationally astute, collaborative and an effective leader with high standard of ethics and integrity. We found that in Ron, and I'm very excited that he's on board as part of this leadership team. Welcome, Ron."

I'm looking forward to meeting with many of you in the coming months. 
Before I get started, I'd like to thank the board and George for the confidence they have placed in me and the NetApp team for the warm welcome I received. I'm excited to be joining the team at this time for a number of reasons. As a longtime NetApp customer, I know firsthand the innovative products and passionate employees that are core to NetApp's strong foundation. In the short time I've been with NetApp, I continue to be very impressed with the commitment of employees, the dedication and quality of the management team and the relentless focus on customer success. I look forward to building on NetApp's strong foundation and leveraging my experience to help execute our transformation efforts to drive long-term growth and streamline the business. 
Now before providing detail on our fiscal 2016 performance and forward-looking guidance, I'd like to first discuss our results for Q4. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, I will be referring to non-GAAP metrics today. Q4 net revenues of $1.38 billion were relatively flat on a sequential basis and down 10% year-over-year. Product revenue was up about 1% sequentially and declined 17% year-over-year. While branded product revenue was in line with our expectations, discounting and promotions remained high, and we had 6 points of impact sequentially and 4 points of impact year-over-year from weaker than expected OEM business. 
As George discussed, revenue from strategic solutions continue to grow, but are not yet sufficient to offset the headwinds from mature areas of our business. As expected, revenue declines in our mature solutions continue to put pressure on overall product revenue. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenue was down 2% sequentially and relatively flat year-over-year. 
Our gross margin was 61.1%. Product gross margin of 46.8% was down about 7 points year-over-year. The decline in ASPs outpaced the decline in average unit costs largely due to discounting and product promotions. Software maintenance gross margin was essentially flat year-over-year while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin was up approximately 5 points, largely reflecting the continued services infrastructure cost efficiencies and ongoing improvements in product quality. 
Operating margin of 13.4% decreased 4 points sequentially and 2 points year-over-year, driven by lower revenue, lower product margin and the acquisition of SolidFire, partially offset by the lower cost of hardware maintenance revenue and OpEx. 
As outlined last quarter, we're driving to achieve a gross run rate savings of $400 million across both cost of revenue and OpEx by the end of fiscal 2017. We will reinvest some of these savings into strategic opportunities such as SolidFire and other initiatives, yielding a net run rate savings of roughly $130 million by the end of fiscal 2017. 
In Q4, we took significant steps forward by reducing our headcount by approximately 11% sequentially. This action resulted in a GAAP restructuring charge of approximately $80 million and a gross savings of approximately $32 million in Q4. To be clear, aligning our cost structure with the opportunity ahead of us is my top priority, given it's completely within our control. We're driving additional changes that include implementing tighter cost controls over indirect spending, improving supply chain efficiency, portfolio streamlining, operational process redesign and organizational restructuring and realignment. We will report back quarterly with more specifics as we realize these savings. 
Our effective tax rate was 13.1% for the quarter, lower than our previous guidance, reflecting the impact of our geographic sales mix. EPS was within our guidance range of $0.55 per share. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were approximately $287 million. 
Moving on to cash and balance sheet metrics for Q4. We generated $345 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter, down 13% year-over-year. Free cash flow of $310 million was about 22% of net revenues, down 1% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. 
Deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue of $259 million was up 8% versus Q3 and 6% versus last year. Inventory turns increased to 22 turns and DSO was 54 days, reflecting a back-end loaded quarter. Finally, we repurchased approximately $262 million of stock and paid $51 million in cash dividends in the fourth quarter. 
Now turning to fiscal year 2016 results. Net revenues for the full year of $5.55 billion were down about 9% from fiscal 2015. Gross margin of 62.5% was down about 1.5 from fiscal 2015, reflecting discounting and product promotions we ran throughout most of fiscal 2016. Operating margin of 13.5% was down 3.5 points versus fiscal 2015. Our effective tax rate for the year was 15.4%. EPS for the year was $2.13, down about 21% from fiscal 2015. 
We ended the year with approximately $5.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, with approximately 10% held by our domestic entities. Over the course of the year, we generated $814 million in free cash flow. 
We continue to deliver on our capital allocation strategy. Over the course of FY '16, we've returned over 140% of free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Finally, we completed the first billion dollars of the $2.5 billion repurchase program we announced in February 2015, ahead of our original schedule. Through dividends and share repurchases, we have returned approximately $4.6 billion to shareholders since May 2013. This represents over 150% of free cash flow generated during that time frame. We remain on track to complete the remaining $1.5 billion of the share repurchase program by the end of May 2018. Today, we also announced an increase in our next cash dividend of $0.19 per share, which we'll pay on July 27, 2016. 
Now to guidance. We are confident in our competitive positioning and long-term growth potential. However, we expect fiscal 2017 to be a year of transition while we transform the company in order to streamline the business, improve efficiency and rapidly address the changing market. Consistent with what was said last quarter, we expect that the growth of our strategic solutions will offset the declines in our mature solutions and ultimately drive moderated revenue growth as we emerge from FY '17. 
For FY '17, we are forecasting gross margin of 61% to 63%. We expect operating margin of 15% to 17%, including about 2 points of dilution from SolidFire. We expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 16.5%. And we expect to generate significant free cash flow, enabling us to invest in the business as well as to continue to again return significant capital to our shareholders. Finally, we remain committed to delivering meaningful EPS growth, including dilution from SolidFire through leverage in our business model. 
Turning to our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We are targeting a net revenue range of $1.2 billion to $1.35 billion. At the midpoint, this implies a year-over-year decline of 4.5%, which reflects reduction in declines as strategic overtakes mature. As a reminder, year-over-year compares are against the 14-week quarter we had in Q1 of fiscal 2016, which benefited software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues. We expect gross margin of 62% to 63%, reflecting the impact of continued product promotions, partially offset by cost savings initiatives. We are targeting operating margin of approximately 10% and an EPS range of $0.34 to $0.39. 
In closing, I'm excited to be here and want to emphasize that everyone at NetApp is focused and committed to permanently transforming the business by pivoting toward the growth areas of the market and reducing costs while also delivering near-term results. While our transformation is far from complete, we have made significant progress and are confident about our future.

In terms of our positioning for the cloud, we have substantially improved our own positioning over the course of the year for us being -- serving customers with workloads on the cloud. And let me articulate that in 3 ways: First, as a supplier of technology to cloud providers, both people in enterprises building their own clouds as well as service providers building clouds. We have seen strong progress with both our clustered ONTAP offerings as well as SolidFire that allows us to build both traditional cloud environments as well as next-generation cloud. We are also the leader from an enterprise, storage and data management technology company, without question, in the OpenStack cloud deployments, where we have seen strong year-on-year growth. In terms of the hyperscalers, our solutions that combine hyperscaler cloud computing environments with our technology like NetApp Private Storage and our Data Fabric solutions have seen good growth through the course of the year. It's early, but as we noted, we are winning our share of leading-edge hybrid cloud deployments and are the only enterprise vendor who has the capability to combine hyperscaler cloud with enterprise data management. Finally, as you note through the course of the year, there are several examples of customers that started out on public cloud and decided to either migrate data and storage footprints to on-premises environments, and we are uniquely positioned to capture those workloads as they transition either on-prem to the cloud or from the public cloud back on-prem."

First of all, the total installed base of 7-Mode systems and clustered ONTAP systems is growing. So our installed base is not declining. It's actually growing, and clustered ONTAP is growing as a percentage of that. The installed base is a very large number, so even 26% of that installed base is actually a substantial number. We have run promotions through the course of the year to enable customers to transition from 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP. As we noted, about 1,300 customers accelerating through the course of the year decided to move forward from 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP. The percentage of the installed base number that you see sometimes lags the point at which they actually decide to convert, because we have to see that show up in our reporting systems. We also see as they migrate that some of those smaller systems get replaced potentially by fewer larger clustered ONTAP systems. So the percentage of systems under clustered ONTAP actually represents -- under represents sometimes the total value of the systems that we have transitioned. In terms of the overall outlook for clustered ONTAP, we continue to stay focused on the total percentage of our installed base look like total percentage of shipments.

As customers make that transition, what they really want in the sort of the majority move is they want the enterprise data management features. And how they choose to use it can be one of 3 ways. The first is greenfields, where for new deployments of enterprise applications, they choose to deploy an all-flash configuration as opposed to a hybrid or disk-based configuration. The second could be a retrofit of an existing architecture where, in the case of clustered ONTAP, we are able to give people a completely transparent way to upgrade a disk drive system to an all-flash system. And so if you've got temporal needs or need for additional performance at a particular point in the season, you can do that very, very easily with us.

In Q1 fiscal year 2017, our focus on the disciplined execution of our strategy yielded solid results on both the top and bottom lines. We delivered revenue of above the midpoint of our prior guidance range with both operating margin and EPS above our previous guidance. Over the course of the quarter, we strengthened our position in flash and hybrid cloud while continuing to transform our business to operate more efficiently and to lower cost. We're clearly making progress, but still have work to do as we operate in the low growth macroeconomic and IT spending environment. We are controlling what we can and are increasingly confident in our ability to execute as we streamline the business and pivot to the growth areas of the market. We believe these actions will return the company to revenue growth with improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns. 
Let me remind you of our key priorities in delivering on this commitment. First, we are executing on our Data Fabric strategy and the strategic solutions that form the foundation of how we enable customer success in the data-powered digital era; second, we are substantially reducing cost and systematically streamlining our operations while maintaining our ability to deliver innovation and lead the market; and third, we're committed to a robust capital allocation program, which includes a combination of share repurchases, dividends and investment for the long-term growth of the business. I'll start with an update on the first priority. Ron will update you on the other 2. 
Our strategic solutions aligned to customer's top IT priorities. This alignment drives our confidence in our ability to lead in the fastest-growing segments of the market. In the first quarter, strategic solutions represented 61% of net product revenue and grew 24% year-over-year. Conversely, net product revenue from our mature solutions declined at 24% from Q1 a year ago. As expected, the impact of the declines in mature solutions are lessening, which will allow the growth of our strategic solutions to reaccelerate the business and return NetApp to moderated revenue growth in fiscal year '18. 
Our customers are transforming their IT organizations for success in the data-powered digital era. They are prioritizing investments to modernize their data centers to lower costs, increase simplicity and agility, extract more value from their data and integrate cloud resources with on-premises environments. Clustered Data ONTAP replaces legacy frame array environments to deliver next generation enterprise storage for efficient management of data growth and service provider-like flexibility across flash, disk and cloud footprints. 
We continue to gain new customers and migrate existing customers to clustered ONTAP. Clustered ONTAP was deployed on 82% of FAS systems shipped in Q1, up from 65% a year ago. We saw continued strong customer demand with unit shipments of clustered ONTAP systems growing 35% year-over-year. The installed base of clustered ONTAP's and 7-Mode systems continues to grow in total and clustered ONTAP is now running on 32% of that growing installed base. 
We're building on the strength with the newest generation of ONTAP, which further simplifies customer's ability to deploy modern enterprise data center and hybrid cloud environments. Introduced in Q1, ONTAP 9 builds the foundation for a Data Fabric, bridging new and traditional data center architectures, making it easy to manage and move data where it's needed across flash, disk and cloud resources. Customers can choose the architecture of their choice. Engineering and converge systems, software-defined storage or cloud, all with industry-leading efficiency, performance and density for flash environments. No other storage solution offers customers this range of capability, flexibility and investment protection. 
Also introduced in Q1, ONTAP Select, a scalable, software-defined software solution helps customers achieve their business objectives by bringing together the ability to deploy storage with cloud-like agility and granular capacity scaling with the proven features of the industry's #1 storage operating system. ONTAP Select offers the flexibility to deploy ONTAP on commodity servers with the customer's choice of [indiscernible] It simplifies operations and lowers training requirements by providing consistent management across all ONTAP disk storage, whether on premises or on the cloud. 
Flash plays an important role in IT transformations as customers seek to gain a competitive edge through greater speed, responsiveness and value from key business applications as well as efficiencies through consolidation and lower power requirements. Customers are replacing hard disk installations with flash, making flash the de facto standard for new on-premises deployments. In this transition from disk to flash, customers cannot forgo enterprise data management and data protection capabilities with our highly differentiated portfolio of all-flash array offerings, NetApp is uniquely positioned to enable customers to consolidate on to flash and create all-flash data centers. IDC ranked NetApp #2 in the all-flash array market, which is significantly higher share than we hold in the overall storage market. Last week, we won the Flash Memory Summit Best of Show for most innovative flash memory customer implementation and swept all 6 brand leadership categories for all-flash NAS and unified NAS arrays in the 2016 brand leaders survey. Our advantages in this market are reflected in the continued strong growth of our all-flash array business, which were approximately 385% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of almost $775 million, inclusive of All Flash FAS, EF and SolidFire product and services. The majority of this growth was, again, driven by a high demand for the All Flash FAS. In Q1, we further enhanced the All Flash FAS with increased speed and data efficiency capabilities, guaranteeing 3x performance improvement over hard disk arrays and 4 to 1 data reduction. NetApp was first to market with 15 terabytes flash drives, which in combination with storage efficiency features in ONTAP 9, delivers a flash optimized, enterprise class storage platform that is the best in the industry for mixed workload consolidation. We are displacing our competitors' legacy SAN frame array architectures with the All Flash FAS. It enabled us to break into a large U.S.-based health care company, which had been a decade-long competitor stronghold. We replaced the competitor's SAN infrastructures for the customers mission-critical SAP environment. The All Flash FAS beat out the incumbent and a newer all-flash competitor on performance, features and resiliency. Not only we'll be able to reduce the data center floor space required for this workload by 95%, we were also able to provide the customer a path to the hybrid cloud. The All Flash FAS addresses requirements for next generation enterprise storage for customers who wanted to improve existing infrastructure and processes. 
For enterprises and service providers who are building multitenant public and private clouds, SolidFire delivers a storage solution that is operationally simple, able to deliver predictable services and scale as services need to grow. Its unique webscale-style architecture enables customers to easily build best-in-class as a service environments. In Q1, we delivered new SolidFire innovations across software, hardware and systems along with the new models for purchasing storage. FlashForward capacity licensing. The latest version of the SolidFire element OS software offers a more intuitive user interface and a robust implementation of VMware virtual volumes for VMware operations, including native for virtual machine quality of service. The latest SolidFire platform, which doubles performance and capacity, can be easily added to existing clusters, allowing customers to rapidly deploy the newest flash technology without forklift upgrades or controller swaps. 
FlashForward capacity licensing unbundles storage software from hardware in an efficient software purchasing model with perpetual, transferable and pooled enterprise-wide licensing. IT transformations are also enabling customers to accelerate time-to-market, improve customer satisfaction, drive innovation and gain a competitive edge by getting more out of their data. NetApp data management solutions accelerates third platform analytics solutions by delivering an open, scalable, enterprise grade platform for building customers' critical data links. To enable the real-time enterprise, customers can run analytics in place on existing data stores without copying or having to ensure data consistency across silos. For customers who want to leverage the nearly endless compute on demand capabilities of the cloud, to accomplish cost-effective data analysis, NetApp Data Fabric cloud sync service provides a simple automated way to get data into Amazon Web Services, run the desired cloud analytics service and get the data back to where it is needed, whether on premises or in the cloud. We showcased cloud sync at AWS Summit last week and you can expect to hear more about how we empower customers to leverage cloud resources and integrate them with their existing IT investments over the course of this fiscal year. 
Our Data Fabric strategy enables data management that seamlessly connects disparate systems, software stack, clouds and data centers. We give our customers the ability to manage, secure and protect their data across flash, disk, private and public cloud resources, all at the scale needed to accommodate the exponential data growth of the digital world. More and more, customers are telling us that they choose NetApp because we enable their cloud strategies by providing detail affordability and cloud integration, coupled with our industry-leading next-generation enterprise and webscale storage solutions, we are helping our customers transform for success in the data-powered digital era. 
We accomplished a lot in Q1. Our focus on disciplined execution and pivot to the growth segments of the market is yielding results and starting to change the trajectory of our business. We introduced substantial innovation across our portfolio that helps our customers as they transform to modernize their data centers to lower cost, increase simplicity, extract more value from their data and integrate cloud resources with their on-premises environments. And we will introduce more exciting innovations at our Insight user conference in Las Vegas next month. 
We're making progress, but we still have more work ahead of us to return the company to long-term growth and to our target operating margin. We are estimating the business and reducing our cost base to positions us for future success by allowing investments in strategic opportunities while accelerating our ability to deliver shareholder value in the form of improved profitability and cash flow. Our first quarter results provide early indicators that our strategy is working, and I am very confident in the NetApp team's ability to successfully evolve the company. 
I will now turn the call over to Ron to walk through our Q1 financial performance and expectations for the second quarter."

Product revenue was $660 [ph] million, and for the first time in several quarters, was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis.

Though we still have a lot of work to do, the product revenue results are good indications of progress we're making here. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenue of $634 million were down approximately 6% year-over-year due to the extra week in Q1 fiscal 2016. Gross margin was 62.4% and within our guidance range. Product gross margin of 46.7% was flat sequentially. Although product gross margin remains below where we'd ultimately would like it to be, we feel good about the stabilization. On a year-over-year basis, product gross margin was down about 4.5 points. 
Software maintenance gross margin was relatively flat year-over-year, while hardware, maintenance and other services gross margin increased just under 4 points year-over-year. Operating expenses of $652 million decreased 13% year-over-year. This decline reflects the early results of our transformation efforts as well as the benefit of the return to a typical 13-week-quarter partially offset by SolidFire. Operating margin of 12.1% was above our previous guidance range. 
As I discussed on our last earnings call, aligning our cost structure would opportunities in front of us is my top priority and completely within our control. Although we have made progress on this front, we will continue to take additional steps throughout the year to permanently lower our cost structure, including but not limited to, headcount reductions and continuing to drive greater efficiencies across the business. We will continue to communicate specifics as these savings are realized. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.6%. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 282 million. EPS of $0.46 was $0.07 over the high end of our prior guidance range, reflecting lower operating expenses, higher revenue and the benefit of our share repurchases. 
Our cash and balance sheet metrics remain healthy. We closed Q1 with $4.4 billion in cash and short-term investments with approximately 13% held by our domestic entities. We repaid the SolidFire loan in the first quarter of a global profits up. We remain deeply committed to completing by the end of May 2018 the remaining balance of our share repurchase program that we announced in February 2015. 
In Q1, we repurchased $175 million of our stock and paid approximately $53 million in cash dividends. Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.19 per share, which will be paid on October 26, 2016, to shareholders of record as of the close of business October 7, 2016. 
Deferred and financed unearned services revenue was up 8% year-over-year. Inventory turns increased to 24 and DSO was 35 days. 
Q1 cash flow from operations was approximately $228 [ph] million versus $129 million in Q1 a year ago. We generated strong free cash flow of $192 million in the quarter. Representing about 15% of net revenues, free cash flow grew over 100% year-over-year. 
Now to guidance. As George discussed, we are aggressively pivoting to the growth areas of the market while at the same time, transforming the company in order to streamline the business, to have greater efficiency and rapidly address the changing market. As we've outlined today, we executed well against our plans in Q1 and are encouraged by the early signs of progress that we're seeing. While we still have a lot of work to do, we remain confident in our ability to continue to execute against the plans we outlined for fiscal 2017 on our prior earnings call. 
For Q2, we expect net revenues to range between $1.265 billion and $1.415 billion which, at the midpoint, implies a sequential increase of 4% and a 7% decrease year-over-year on a difficult compare. We expect Q2 consolidated gross margins of approximately 62% to 63% and operating margin is approximately 13% to 14%. And finally, we expect the earnings per share for the second quarter to range from approximately $0.51 to $0.56 per share. With that, I'll hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A."

That's a little bit of an anomaly It's probably to low-end you should expect that level going forward, but it should be an improvement from the prior year. We've continued to focus on working capital. It's one of the perks of our transformation efforts, keenly aware of it. So it's not an accident that these things happen and we're going to continue to drive it."

In Q1 fiscal year 2017, our focus on the disciplined execution of our strategy yielded solid results on both the top and bottom lines. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of our prior guidance range, with both operating margin and EPS above our previous guidance. Over the course of the quarter, we strengthened our position in flash and hybrid cloud, while continuing to transform our business to operate more efficiently and to lower costs. We are clearly making progress, but still have work to do as we operate in the low growth macroeconomic and IT spending environment. We are controlling what we can and are increasingly confident in our ability to execute as we streamline the business and pivot to the growth areas of the market. We believe these actions will return the company to revenue growth, with improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns. 
Let me remind you of our key priorities in delivering on this commitment. First, we are executing on our Data Fabric strategy and the strategic solutions that form the foundation of how we enable customer success in the data-powered digital era; second, we are substantially reducing cost and systematically streamlining our operations, while maintaining our ability to deliver innovation and lead the market; and third, we're committed to a robust capital allocation program, which includes a combination of share repurchases, dividends and investment for the long-term growth of the business. I'll start with an update on the first priority. Ron will update you on the other 2. 
Our strategic solutions aligned to customers top IT priorities. This alignment drives our confidence in our ability to lead in the fastest-growing segments of the market. In the first quarter, strategic solutions represented 61% of net product revenue and grew 24% year-over-year. Conversely, net product revenue from our mature solutions declined at 24% from Q1, a year ago. As expected, the impact of the declines in mature solutions are lessening, which will allow the growth of our strategic solutions to reaccelerate the business and return NetApp to moderated revenue growth in fiscal year '18. 
Our customers are transforming their IT organizations for success in the data-powered digital era. They are prioritizing investments to modernize their data centers to lower costs, increase simplicity and agility, extract more value from their data and integrate cloud resources with on-premises environments. Clustered Data ONTAP replaces legacy frame array environments to deliver next-generation enterprise storage for efficient management of data growth and service provider-like flexibility across flash, disk and cloud footprints. 
We continue to gain new customers and migrate existing customers to clustered ONTAP. Clustered ONTAP was deployed on 82% of FAS systems shipped in Q1, up from 65% a year ago. We saw continued strong customer demand, with unit shipments of clustered ONTAP systems growing 35% year-over-year. The installed base of clustered ONTAP and 7-Mode systems continues to grow in total, and clustered ONTAP is now running on 32% of that growing installed base. 
We are building on the strength with the newest generation of ONTAP, which further simplifies customers' ability to deploy modern enterprise data center and hybrid cloud environments. Introduced in Q1, ONTAP 9 builds the foundation for a Data Fabric, bridging new and traditional data center architectures, making it easy to manage and move data, where it's needed, across flash, disk and cloud resources. Customers can choose the architecture of their choice. Engineered and converged systems, software-defined storage or cloud, all with industry-leading efficiency, performance and density for flash environments. No other storage solution offers customers this range of capability, flexibility and investment protection. 
Also introduced in Q1, ONTAP Select, a scalable, software-defined storage solution helps customers achieve their business objectives by bringing together the ability to deploy storage with cloud-like agility and granular capacity scaling, with the proven features of the industry's #1 storage operating system. ONTAP Select offers the flexibility to deploy ONTAP on commodity servers, with a customers choice of hypervisors. It simplifies operations and lowers training requirements by providing consistent management across all ONTAP disk storage, whether on-premises or on the cloud. 
Flash plays an important role in IT transformations as customers seek to gain a competitive edge through greater speed, responsiveness and value from key business applications as well as efficiencies through consolidation and lower power requirements. Customers are replacing hard disk installations with flash, making flash the de facto standard for new on-premises deployments. In this transition from disk to flash, customers cannot forgo enterprise data management and data protection capabilities. With our highly differentiated portfolio of all-flash array offerings, NetApp is uniquely positioned to enable customers to consolidate on to flash and create all-flash data centers. IDC ranked NetApp, #2 in the all-flash array market, with a significantly higher share than we hold in the overall storage market. Last week, we won the Flash Memory Summit Best of Show for most innovative flash memory customer implementation and swept all 6 brand leadership categories for all-flash NAS and unified NAS/SAN arrays in the 2016 brand leader survey. Our advantages in this market are reflected in the continued strong growth of our all-flash array business, which grew approximately 385% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of almost $775 million, inclusive of All Flash FAS, EF and SolidFire product and services. The majority of this growth was, again, driven by high demand for the All Flash FAS. In Q1, we further enhanced the All Flash FAS with increased speed and data efficiency capabilities, guaranteeing 3x performance improvement over hard disk arrays and 4:1 data reduction. NetApp was first to market with 15 terabyte flash drives, which in combination with storage efficiency features in ONTAP 9, delivers a flash optimized, enterprise-class storage platform that is the best in the industry for mixed workload consolidation. We are displacing our competitors' legacy SAN frame array architectures with the All Flash FAS. It enabled us to break into a large U.S.-based health care company, which had been a decade-long competitor stronghold. We replaced the competitor's SAN infrastructure for the customers' mission-critical SAP environment. The All Flash FAS beat out the incumbent and a newer all-flash competitor on performance, features and resiliency. Not only were we able to reduce the data center floor space required for this workload by 95%, we were also able to provide the customer a path to the hybrid cloud. The All Flash FAS addresses requirements for next-generation enterprise storage for customers who want to improve existing infrastructure and processes. 
For enterprises and service providers, who are building multitenant public and private clouds, SolidFire delivers a storage solution that is operationally simple, able to deliver predictable services and scale as services need to grow. Its unique webscale-style architecture enables customers to easily build best-in-class as a Service environments. In Q1, we delivered new SolidFire innovations across software, hardware and systems along with the new model for purchasing storage, FlashForward Capacity Licensing. The latest version of the SolidFire element OS software offers a more intuitive user interface and a robust implementation of VMware virtual volumes for VMware operations, including native per virtual machine quality of service. The latest SolidFire platform, which doubles performance and capacity, can be easily added to existing clusters, allowing customers to rapidly deploy the newest flash technology without forklift upgrades or controller swaps. 
FlashForward Capacity Licensing unbundles storage software from hardware in an efficient software purchasing model, with perpetual, transferable and pooled enterprise-wide licensing. IT transformations are also enabling customers to accelerate time to market, improve customer satisfaction, drive innovation and gain a competitive edge by getting more out of their data. NetApp data management solutions accelerate third platform analytics solutions by delivering an open, scalable, enterprise-grade platform for building customers' critical data lakes. To enable the real-time enterprise, customers can run analytics in place on existing data stores without copying or having to ensure data consistency across silos. For customers who want to leverage the nearly endless compute on-demand capabilities of the cloud, to accomplish cost-effective data analysis, NetApp Data Fabric cloud sync service provides a simple automated way to get data into Amazon Web Services, run the desired cloud analytics service and get the data back to where it is needed, whether on-premises or in the cloud. We showcased cloud sync at AWS Summit last week, and you can expect to hear more about how we empower customers to leverage cloud resources and integrate them with their existing IT investments over the course of this fiscal year. 
Our Data Fabric strategy enables data management that seamlessly connects disparate systems, software stacks, clouds and data centers. We give our customers the ability to manage, secure and protect their data across flash, disk, public and private cloud resources, all at the scale needed to accommodate the exponential data growth of the digital world. More and more, customers are telling us that they choose NetApp because we enable their cloud strategies by providing data portability and cloud integration, coupled with our industry-leading next-generation enterprise and webscale storage solutions, we are helping our customers transform for success in the data-powered digital era. 
We accomplished a lot in Q1. Our focus on disciplined execution and pivot to the growth segments of the market is yielding results and starting to change the trajectory of our business. We introduced substantial innovation across our portfolio that helps our customers as they transform to modernize their data centers to lower costs, increase simplicity, extract more value from their data and integrate cloud resources with their on-premises environments. And we will introduce more exciting innovations at our Insight user conference in Las Vegas next month. 
We're making progress, but we still have more work ahead of us to return the company to long-term growth and to our target operating margin. We are streamlining the business and reducing our cost base to position us for future success by allowing investments in strategic opportunities, while accelerating our ability to deliver shareholder value in the form of improved profitability and cash flow. Our first quarter results provide early indicators that our strategy is working, and I am very confident in the NetApp team's ability to successfully evolve the company. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ron to walk through our Q1 financial performance and expectations for the second quarter."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers today. Also, please note that year-over-year compares are against a 14-week quarter w",813,"Thanks, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers today. Also, please note that year-over-year compares are against a 14-week quarter we had in Q1 of fiscal 2016. With that let's get started. 
We executed well in the first quarter and overall are pleased with our results. Q1 net revenues of $1.29 billion declined approximately 3% year-over-year and were within our guidance range. Excluding the approximate $40 million benefit to software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenue from the 14th week, we had in Q1 of last year, net revenues were roughly flat year-over-year. 
Product revenue was $660 million, and for the first time in several quarters, was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. As we've discussed, we expect the growth of our strategic solutions to improve our overall product revenue growth trajectory over the course of fiscal 2017. Though we still have a lot of work to do, the product revenue results are good indication of the progress we're making here. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenue of $634 million were down approximately 6% year-over-year due to the extra week in Q1 fiscal 2016. Gross margin was 62.4% and within our guidance range. Product gross margin of 46.7% was flat sequentially. Although product gross margin remains below where we'd ultimately like it to be, we feel good about the stabilization. On a year-over-year basis, product gross margin was down about 4.5 points. 
Software maintenance gross margin was relatively flat year-over-year, while hardware, maintenance and other services gross margin increased just under 4 points year-over-year. Operating expenses of $652 million decreased 13% year-over-year. This decline reflects the early results of our transformation efforts as well as the benefit of the return to a typical 13-week quarter, partially offset by SolidFire. Operating margin of 12.1% was above our previous guidance range. 
As I discussed on our last earnings call, aligning our cost structure with the opportunities in front of us is my top priority and completely within our control. Although we have made progress on this front, we will continue to take additional steps throughout the year to permanently lower our cost structure, including but not limited to headcount reductions and continued to drive greater efficiencies across the business. We will continue to communicate specifics as these savings are realized. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.6%. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 282 million. EPS of $0.46 was $0.07 over the high end of our prior guidance range, reflecting lower operating expenses, higher revenue and the benefit of our share repurchases. 
Our cash and balance sheet metrics remain healthy. We closed Q1 with $4.4 billion in cash and short-term investments, with approximately 13% held by our domestic entities. We repaid the SolidFire loan in the first quarter out of global profits. We remain deeply committed to completing by the end of May 2018 the remaining balance of our share repurchase program that we announced in February 2015. 
In Q1, we repurchased $175 million of our stock and paid approximately $53 million in cash dividends. Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.19 per share, which will be paid on October 26, 2016, to shareholders of record as of the close of business October 7, 2016. 
Deferred and financed unearned services revenue was up 8% year-over-year. Inventory turns increased to 24 and DSO was 35 days. 
Q1 cash flow from operations was approximately $228 million versus $129 million in Q1, a year ago. We generated strong free cash flow of $192 million in the quarter. Representing about 15% of net revenues, free cash flow grew over 100% year-over-year. 
Now to guidance. As George discussed, we are aggressively pivoting to the growth areas of the market, while at the same time, transforming the company in order to streamline the business, to have greater efficiency and rapidly address the changing market. As we've outlined today, we executed well against our plans in Q1 and are encouraged by the early signs of progress that we're seeing. While we still have a lot of work to do, we remain confident in our ability to continue to execute against the plans we outlined for fiscal 2017 on our prior earnings call. 
For Q2, we expect net revenues to range between $1.265 billion and $1.415 billion, which at the midpoint, implies a sequential increase of 4% and a 7% decrease year-over-year on a difficult compare. We expect Q2 consolidated gross margins of approximately 62% to 63% and operating margins of approximately 13% to 14%. And finally, we expect earnings per share for the second quarter to range from approximately $0.51 to $0.56 per share. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A."

ONTAP Select is an offering that we've made available to customers who have the engineering capability to integrate software with systems for specific deployments. I think the range of customers who have that level of engineering capability is small. And so we think that the preponderant majority of our business will continue to face integrated systems. With regard to SolidFire's FlashForward licensing model, it essentially allows customers to simplify procurement of software so that they can build a pool of storage that is enterprise-wide and then by hardware as they needed and integrated under that software umbrella. Typically, what we have seen with that type of model is that it allows us to get larger footprint sooner in customers as they standardize on SolidFire for a broad range of use cases."

But we still have more work ahead of us, and we remain focused on disciplined execution of our strategy. We are committed to the fundamental change that we outlined with the 3 key priorities. 
Let me remind you of them once again. The first is to pivot to the faster growing parts of a market and align ourselves closely with our customers, business and IT transformation priorities with our focus on the strategic solutions portfolio. The second is to reduce cost by streamlining and improving the efficiency for our business. The third is to support and continue with the robust capital allocation plan that we have that include shareholder returns and investment for the long-term growth of the business. We brought a lot of innovation to the market in Q1. You can expect to see even more exciting innovations this year, some of which we'll showcase at our Insight User Conference next month. I look forward to speaking with you all again next quarter. Thank you."

Thank you for joining us today. In Q1 fiscal year 2017, our focus on the disciplined execution of our strategy yielded solid results on both the top and bottom lines.

In Q1 fiscal year 2017, our focus on the disciplined execution of our strategy yielded solid results on both the top and bottom lines. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of our prior guidance range, with both operating margin and EPS above our previous guidance. Over the course of the quarter, we strengthened our position in flash and hybrid cloud, while continuing to transform our business to operate more efficiently and to lower costs. We are clearly making progress, but still have work to do as we operate in the low growth macroeconomic and IT spending environment. We are controlling what we can and are increasingly confident in our ability to execute as we streamline the business and pivot to the growth areas of the market. We believe these actions will return the company to revenue growth, with improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns. 
Let me remind you of our key priorities in delivering on this commitment. First, we are executing on our Data Fabric strategy and the strategic solutions that form the foundation of how we enable customer success in the data-powered digital era; second, we are substantially reducing cost and systematically streamlining our operations, while maintaining our ability to deliver innovation and lead the market; and third, we're committed to a robust capital allocation program, which includes a combination of share repurchases, dividends and investment for the long-term growth of the business. I'll start with an update on the first priority. Ron will update you on the other 2. 
Our strategic solutions align to customer's top IT priorities. This alignment drives our confidence in our ability to lead in the fastest-growing segments of the market. In the first quarter, strategic solutions represented 61% of net product revenue and grew 24% year-over-year. Conversely, net product revenue from our mature solutions declined at 24% from Q1, a year ago. As expected, the impact of the declines in mature solutions are lessening, which will allow the growth of our strategic solutions to reaccelerate the business and return NetApp to moderated revenue growth in fiscal year '18. 
Our customers are transforming their IT organizations for success in the data-powered digital era. They are prioritizing investments to modernize their data centers to lower costs, increase simplicity and agility, extract more value from their data and integrate cloud resources with on-premises environments. Clustered Data ONTAP replaces legacy frame array environments to deliver next-generation enterprise storage for efficient management of data growth and service provider-like flexibility across flash, disk and cloud footprints. 
We continue to gain new customers and migrate existing customers to clustered ONTAP. Clustered ONTAP was deployed on 82% of FAS systems shipped in Q1, up from 65% a year ago. We saw continued strong customer demand, with unit shipments of clustered ONTAP systems growing 35% year-over-year. The installed base of clustered ONTAP and 7-Mode systems continues to grow in total, and clustered ONTAP is now running on 32% of that growing installed base. 
We are building on the strength with the newest generation of ONTAP, which further simplifies customers' ability to deploy modern enterprise data center and hybrid cloud environments. Introduced in Q1, ONTAP 9 builds the foundation for a Data Fabric, bridging new and traditional data center architectures, making it easy to manage and move data, where it's needed, across flash, disk and cloud resources. Customers can choose the architecture of their choice. Engineered and converged systems, software-defined storage or cloud, all with industry-leading efficiency, performance and density for flash environments. No other storage solution offers customers this range of capability, flexibility and investment protection. 
Also introduced in Q1, ONTAP Select, a scalable, software-defined storage solution helps customers achieve their business objectives by bringing together the ability to deploy storage with cloud-like agility and granular capacity scaling, with the proven features of the industry's #1 storage operating system. ONTAP Select offers the flexibility to deploy ONTAP on commodity servers, with a customer’s choice of hypervisors. It simplifies operations and lowers training requirements by providing consistent management across all ONTAP disk storage, whether on-premises or on the cloud. 
Flash plays an important role in IT transformations as customers seek to gain a competitive edge through greater speed, responsiveness and value from key business applications as well as efficiencies through consolidation and lower power requirements. Customers are replacing hard disk installations with flash, making flash the de facto standard for new on-premises deployments. In this transition from disk to flash, customers cannot forgo enterprise data management and data protection capabilities. With our highly differentiated portfolio of all-flash array offerings, NetApp is uniquely positioned to enable customers to consolidate on to flash and create all-flash data centers. IDC ranked NetApp, #2 in the all-flash array market, with a significantly higher share than we hold in the overall storage market. Last week, we won the Flash Memory Summit Best of Show for most innovative flash memory customer implementation and swept all 6 brand leadership categories for all-flash NAS and unified NAS/SAN arrays in the 2016 brand leader survey. Our advantages in this market are reflected in the continued strong growth of our all-flash array business, which grew approximately 385% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of almost $775 million, inclusive of All Flash FAS, EF and SolidFire product and services. The majority of this growth was, again, driven by high demand for the All Flash FAS. In Q1, we further enhanced the All Flash FAS with increased speed and data efficiency capabilities, guaranteeing 3x performance improvement over hard disk arrays and 4:1 data reduction. NetApp was first to market with 15 terabyte flash drives, which in combination with storage efficiency features in ONTAP 9, delivers a flash optimized, enterprise-class storage platform that is the best in the industry for mixed workload consolidation. We are displacing our competitors' legacy SAN frame array architectures with the All Flash FAS. It enabled us to break into a large U.S.-based health care company, which had been a decade-long competitor stronghold. We replaced the competitor's SAN infrastructure for the customers' mission-critical SAP environment. The All Flash FAS beat out the incumbent and a newer all-flash competitor on performance, features and resiliency. Not only were we able to reduce the data center floor space required for this workload by 95%, we were also able to provide the customer a path to the hybrid cloud. The All Flash FAS addresses requirements for next-generation enterprise storage for customers who want to improve existing infrastructure and processes. 
For enterprises and service providers, who are building multi-tenant public and private clouds, SolidFire delivers a storage solution that is operationally simple, able to deliver predictable services and scale as services need to grow. Its unique webscale-style architecture enables customers to easily build best-in-class as a Service environments. In Q1, we delivered new SolidFire innovations across software, hardware and systems along with the new model for purchasing storage, FlashForward Capacity Licensing. The latest version of the SolidFire element OS software offers a more intuitive user interface and a robust implementation of VMware virtual volumes for VMware operations, including native per virtual machine quality of service. The latest SolidFire platform, which doubles performance and capacity, can be easily added to existing clusters, allowing customers to rapidly deploy the newest flash technology without forklift upgrades or controller swaps. 
FlashForward Capacity Licensing unbundles storage software from hardware in an efficient software purchasing model, with perpetual, transferable and pooled enterprise-wide licensing. IT transformations are also enabling customers to accelerate time to market, improve customer satisfaction, drive innovation and gain a competitive edge by getting more out of their data. NetApp data management solutions accelerate third platform analytics solutions by delivering an open, scalable, enterprise-grade platform for building customers' critical data lakes. To enable the real-time enterprise, customers can run analytics in place on existing data stores without copying or having to ensure data consistency across silos. For customers who want to leverage the nearly endless compute on-demand capabilities of the cloud, to accomplish cost-effective data analysis, NetApp Data Fabric cloud sync service provides a simple automated way to get data into Amazon Web Services, run the desired cloud analytics service and get the data back to where it is needed, whether on-premises or in the cloud. We showcased cloud sync at AWS Summit last week, and you can expect to hear more about how we empower customers to leverage cloud resources and integrate them with their existing IT investments over the course of this fiscal year. 
Our Data Fabric strategy enables data management that seamlessly connects disparate systems, software stacks, clouds and data centers. We give our customers the ability to manage, secure and protect their data across flash, disk, public and private cloud resources, all at the scale needed to accommodate the exponential data growth of the digital world. More and more, customers are telling us that they choose NetApp because we enable their cloud strategies by providing data portability and cloud integration, coupled with our industry-leading next-generation enterprise and webscale storage solutions, we are helping our customers transform for success in the data-powered digital era. 
We accomplished a lot in Q1. Our focus on disciplined execution and pivot to the growth segments of the market is yielding results and starting to change the trajectory of our business. We introduced substantial innovation across our portfolio that helps our customers as they transform to modernize their data centers to lower costs, increase simplicity, extract more value from their data and integrate cloud resources with their on-premises environments. And we will introduce more exciting innovations at our Insight user conference in Las Vegas next month. 
We're making progress, but we still have more work ahead of us to return the company to long-term growth and to our target operating margin. We are streamlining the business and reducing our cost base to position us for future success by allowing investments in strategic opportunities, while accelerating our ability to deliver shareholder value in the form of improved profitability and cash flow. Our first quarter results provide early indicators that our strategy is working, and I am very confident in the NetApp team's ability to successfully evolve the company. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ron to walk through our Q1 financial performance and expectations for the second quarter."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers today. Also, please note that year-over-year compares are against a 14-week quarter w",813,"Thanks, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers today. Also, please note that year-over-year compares are against a 14-week quarter we had in Q1 of fiscal 2016. With that let's get started. 
We executed well in the first quarter and overall are pleased with our results. Q1 net revenues of $1.29 billion declined approximately 3% year-over-year and were within our guidance range. Excluding the approximate $40 million benefit to software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenue from the 14th week, we had in Q1 of last year, net revenues were roughly flat year-over-year. 
Product revenue was $660 million, and for the first time in several quarters, was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. As we've discussed, we expect the growth of our strategic solutions to improve our overall product revenue growth trajectory over the course of fiscal 2017. Though we still have a lot of work to do, the product revenue results are good indication of the progress we're making here. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenue of $634 million were down approximately 6% year-over-year due to the extra week in Q1 fiscal 2016. Gross margin was 62.4% and within our guidance range. Product gross margin of 46.7% was flat sequentially. Although product gross margin remains below where we'd ultimately like it to be, we feel good about the stabilization. On a year-over-year basis, product gross margin was down about 4.5 points. 
Software maintenance gross margin was relatively flat year-over-year, while hardware, maintenance and other services gross margin increased just under 4 points year-over-year. Operating expenses of $652 million decreased 13% year-over-year. This decline reflects the early results of our transformation efforts as well as the benefit of the return to a typical 13-week quarter, partially offset by SolidFire. Operating margin of 12.1% was above our previous guidance range. 
As I discussed on our last earnings call, aligning our cost structure with the opportunities in front of us is my top priority and completely within our control. Although we have made progress on this front, we will continue to take additional steps throughout the year to permanently lower our cost structure, including but not limited to headcount reductions and continued to drive greater efficiencies across the business. We will continue to communicate specifics as these savings are realized. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.6%. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 282 million. EPS of $0.46 was $0.07 over the high end of our prior guidance range, reflecting lower operating expenses, higher revenue and the benefit of our share repurchases. 
Our cash and balance sheet metrics remain healthy. We closed Q1 with $4.4 billion in cash and short-term investments, with approximately 13% held by our domestic entities. We repaid the SolidFire loan in the first quarter out of global profits. We remain deeply committed to completing by the end of May 2018 the remaining balance of our share repurchase program that we announced in February 2015. 
In Q1, we repurchased $175 million of our stock and paid approximately $53 million in cash dividends. Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.19 per share, which will be paid on October 26, 2016, to shareholders of record as of the close of business October 7, 2016. 
Deferred and financed unearned services revenue was up 8% year-over-year. Inventory turns increased to 24 and DSO was 35 days. 
Q1 cash flow from operations was approximately $228 million versus $129 million in Q1, a year ago. We generated strong free cash flow of $192 million in the quarter. Representing about 15% of net revenues, free cash flow grew over 100% year-over-year. 
Now to guidance. As George discussed, we are aggressively pivoting to the growth areas of the market, while at the same time, transforming the company in order to streamline the business, to have greater efficiency and rapidly address the changing market. As we've outlined today, we executed well against our plans in Q1 and are encouraged by the early signs of progress that we're seeing. While we still have a lot of work to do, we remain confident in our ability to continue to execute against the plans we outlined for fiscal 2017 on our prior earnings call. 
For Q2, we expect net revenues to range between $1.265 billion and $1.415 billion, which at the midpoint, implies a sequential increase of 4% and a 7% decrease year-over-year on a difficult compare. We expect Q2 consolidated gross margins of approximately 62% to 63% and operating margins of approximately 13% to 14%. And finally, we expect earnings per share for the second quarter to range from approximately $0.51 to $0.56 per share. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A."

I think, when you think about our installed base, it's a very large installed base that we've built up over 20 years, and it's growing. And so the percentage of systems that are -- we represent is a very large number. The cDOT conversions are lumpy. They go up and down.

In terms of gross margins, I think a couple of things.

The gross margin model that we showed last quarter to this quarter has stayed stable, and it's -- the market remains competitive, but we have differentiated technology in the market as well as, as you -- as we outlined in our cost focus, we continue to do work in the supply chain, on both the cost of goods sold as well as the operating structure of the company to support that model.

First of all, from a customer perspective, we think that the value of differentiated storage in data management capabilities, as we've always said, is in software. And we have among the best storage in data management platforms in the industry, without question, for traditional enterprise with clustered ONTAP and for webscale enterprise with SolidFire. So we feel very good about our position in those markets, the software value of those products protecting the differentiated gross margin. 
ONTAP Select is an offering that we've made available to customers who have the engineering capability to integrate software with systems for specific deployments. I think the range of customers who have that level of engineering capability is small. And so we think that the preponderant majority of our business will continue to stay integrated systems. With regard to SolidFire's FlashForward licensing model, it essentially allows customers to simplify procurement of software so that they can build a pool of storage that is enterprise-wide and then buy hardware as they needed and integrated under that software umbrella. Typically, what we have seen with that type of model is that it allows us to get larger footprint sooner in customers as they standardize on SolidFire for a broad range of use cases."

In Q1 fiscal year 2017, our focus on the disciplined execution of our strategy yielded solid results on both the top and bottom lines. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of our prior guidance range, with both operating margin and EPS above our previous guidance. Over the course of the quarter, we strengthened our position in flash and hybrid cloud, while continuing to transform our business to operate more efficiently and to lower costs. We are clearly making progress, but still have work to do as we operate in the low growth macroeconomic and IT spending environment. We are controlling what we can and are increasingly confident in our ability to execute as we streamline the business and pivot to the growth areas of the market. We believe these actions will return the company to revenue growth, with improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns. 
Let me remind you of our key priorities in delivering on this commitment. First, we are executing on our Data Fabric strategy and the strategic solutions that form the foundation of how we enable customer success in the data-powered digital era; second, we are substantially reducing cost and systematically streamlining our operations, while maintaining our ability to deliver innovation and lead the market; and third, we're committed to a robust capital allocation program, which includes a combination of share repurchases, dividends and investment for the long-term growth of the business. I'll start with an update on the first priority. Ron will update you on the other 2. 
Our strategic solutions align to customer's top IT priorities. This alignment drives our confidence in our ability to lead in the fastest-growing segments of the market. In the first quarter, strategic solutions represented 61% of net product revenue and grew 24% year-over-year. Conversely, net product revenue from our mature solutions declined at 24% from Q1, a year ago. As expected, the impact of the declines in mature solutions are lessening, which will allow the growth of our strategic solutions to reaccelerate the business and return NetApp to moderated revenue growth in fiscal year '18. 
Our customers are transforming their IT organizations for success in the data-powered digital era. They are prioritizing investments to modernize their data centers to lower costs, increase simplicity and agility, extract more value from their data and integrate cloud resources with on-premises environments. Clustered Data ONTAP replaces legacy frame array environments to deliver next-generation enterprise storage for efficient management of data growth and service provider-like flexibility across flash, disk and cloud footprints. 
We continue to gain new customers and migrate existing customers to clustered ONTAP. Clustered ONTAP was deployed on 82% of FAS systems shipped in Q1, up from 65% a year ago. We saw continued strong customer demand, with unit shipments of clustered ONTAP systems growing 35% year-over-year. The installed base of clustered ONTAP and 7-Mode systems continues to grow in total, and clustered ONTAP is now running on 32% of that growing installed base. 
We are building on the strength with the newest generation of ONTAP, which further simplifies customers' ability to deploy modern enterprise data center and hybrid cloud environments. Introduced in Q1, ONTAP 9 builds the foundation for a Data Fabric, bridging new and traditional data center architectures, making it easy to manage and move data, where it's needed, across flash, disk and cloud resources. Customers can choose the architecture of their choice. Engineered and converged systems, software-defined storage or cloud, all with industry-leading efficiency, performance and density for flash environments. No other storage solution offers customers this range of capability, flexibility and investment protection. 
Also introduced in Q1, ONTAP Select, a scalable, software-defined storage solution helps customers achieve their business objectives by bringing together the ability to deploy storage with cloud-like agility and granular capacity scaling, with the proven features of the industry's #1 storage operating system. ONTAP Select offers the flexibility to deploy ONTAP on commodity servers, with a customer’s choice of hypervisors. It simplifies operations and lowers training requirements by providing consistent management across all ONTAP disk storage, whether on-premises or on the cloud. 
Flash plays an important role in IT transformations as customers seek to gain a competitive edge through greater speed, responsiveness and value from key business applications as well as efficiencies through consolidation and lower power requirements. Customers are replacing hard disk installations with flash, making flash the de facto standard for new on-premises deployments. In this transition from disk to flash, customers cannot forgo enterprise data management and data protection capabilities. With our highly differentiated portfolio of all-flash array offerings, NetApp is uniquely positioned to enable customers to consolidate on to flash and create all-flash data centers. IDC ranked NetApp, #2 in the all-flash array market, with a significantly higher share than we hold in the overall storage market. Last week, we won the Flash Memory Summit Best of Show for most innovative flash memory customer implementation and swept all 6 brand leadership categories for all-flash NAS and unified NAS/SAN arrays in the 2016 brand leader survey. Our advantages in this market are reflected in the continued strong growth of our all-flash array business, which grew approximately 385% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of almost $775 million, inclusive of All Flash FAS, EF and SolidFire product and services. The majority of this growth was, again, driven by high demand for the All Flash FAS. In Q1, we further enhanced the All Flash FAS with increased speed and data efficiency capabilities, guaranteeing 3x performance improvement over hard disk arrays and 4:1 data reduction. NetApp was first to market with 15 terabyte flash drives, which in combination with storage efficiency features in ONTAP 9, delivers a flash optimized, enterprise-class storage platform that is the best in the industry for mixed workload consolidation. We are displacing our competitors' legacy SAN frame array architectures with the All Flash FAS. It enabled us to break into a large U.S.-based health care company, which had been a decade-long competitor stronghold. We replaced the competitor's SAN infrastructure for the customers' mission-critical SAP environment. The All Flash FAS beat out the incumbent and a newer all-flash competitor on performance, features and resiliency. Not only were we able to reduce the data center floor space required for this workload by 95%, we were also able to provide the customer a path to the hybrid cloud. The All Flash FAS addresses requirements for next-generation enterprise storage for customers who want to improve existing infrastructure and processes. 
For enterprises and service providers, who are building multi-tenant public and private clouds, SolidFire delivers a storage solution that is operationally simple, able to deliver predictable services and scale as services need to grow. Its unique webscale-style architecture enables customers to easily build best-in-class as a Service environments. In Q1, we delivered new SolidFire innovations across software, hardware and systems along with the new model for purchasing storage, FlashForward Capacity Licensing. The latest version of the SolidFire element OS software offers a more intuitive user interface and a robust implementation of VMware virtual volumes for VMware operations, including native per virtual machine quality of service. The latest SolidFire platform, which doubles performance and capacity, can be easily added to existing clusters, allowing customers to rapidly deploy the newest flash technology without forklift upgrades or controller swaps. 
FlashForward Capacity Licensing unbundles storage software from hardware in an efficient software purchasing model, with perpetual, transferable and pooled enterprise-wide licensing. IT transformations are also enabling customers to accelerate time to market, improve customer satisfaction, drive innovation and gain a competitive edge by getting more out of their data. NetApp data management solutions accelerate third platform analytics solutions by delivering an open, scalable, enterprise-grade platform for building customers' critical data lakes. To enable the real-time enterprise, customers can run analytics in place on existing data stores without copying or having to ensure data consistency across silos. For customers who want to leverage the nearly endless compute on-demand capabilities of the cloud, to accomplish cost-effective data analysis, NetApp Data Fabric cloud sync service provides a simple automated way to get data into Amazon Web Services, run the desired cloud analytics service and get the data back to where it is needed, whether on-premises or in the cloud. We showcased cloud sync at AWS Summit last week, and you can expect to hear more about how we empower customers to leverage cloud resources and integrate them with their existing IT investments over the course of this fiscal year. 
Our Data Fabric strategy enables data management that seamlessly connects disparate systems, software stacks, clouds and data centers. We give our customers the ability to manage, secure and protect their data across flash, disk, public and private cloud resources, all at the scale needed to accommodate the exponential data growth of the digital world. More and more, customers are telling us that they choose NetApp because we enable their cloud strategies by providing data portability and cloud integration, coupled with our industry-leading next-generation enterprise and webscale storage solutions, we are helping our customers transform for success in the data-powered digital era. 
We accomplished a lot in Q1. Our focus on disciplined execution and pivot to the growth segments of the market is yielding results and starting to change the trajectory of our business. We introduced substantial innovation across our portfolio that helps our customers as they transform to modernize their data centers to lower costs, increase simplicity, extract more value from their data and integrate cloud resources with their on-premises environments. And we will introduce more exciting innovations at our Insight user conference in Las Vegas next month. 
We're making progress, but we still have more work ahead of us to return the company to long-term growth and to our target operating margin. We are streamlining the business and reducing our cost base to position us for future success by allowing investments in strategic opportunities, while accelerating our ability to deliver shareholder value in the form of improved profitability and cash flow. Our first quarter results provide early indicators that our strategy is working, and I am very confident in the NetApp team's ability to successfully evolve the company. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ron to walk through our Q1 financial performance and expectations for the second quarter."
32052,379071569,1037094,"NetApp, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 17, 2016",2016-08-17,"Earnings Calls","NetApp, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers today. Also, please note that year-over-year compares are against a 14-week quarter w",813,"Thanks, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers today. Also, please note that year-over-year compares are against a 14-week quarter we had in Q1 of fiscal 2016. With that let's get started. 
We executed well in the first quarter and overall are pleased with our results. Q1 net revenues of $1.29 billion declined approximately 3% year-over-year and were within our guidance range. Excluding the approximate $40 million benefit to software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenue from the 14th week, we had in Q1 of last year, net revenues were roughly flat year-over-year. 
Product revenue was $660 million, and for the first time in several quarters, was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. As we've discussed, we expect the growth of our strategic solutions to improve our overall product revenue growth trajectory over the course of fiscal 2017. Though we still have a lot of work to do, the product revenue results are good indication of the progress we're making here. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenue of $634 million were down approximately 6% year-over-year due to the extra week in Q1 fiscal 2016. Gross margin was 62.4% and within our guidance range. Product gross margin of 46.7% was flat sequentially. Although product gross margin remains below where we'd ultimately like it to be, we feel good about the stabilization. On a year-over-year basis, product gross margin was down about 4.5 points. 
Software maintenance gross margin was relatively flat year-over-year, while hardware, maintenance and other services gross margin increased just under 4 points year-over-year. Operating expenses of $652 million decreased 13% year-over-year. This decline reflects the early results of our transformation efforts as well as the benefit of the return to a typical 13-week quarter, partially offset by SolidFire. Operating margin of 12.1% was above our previous guidance range. 
As I discussed on our last earnings call, aligning our cost structure with the opportunities in front of us is my top priority and completely within our control. Although we have made progress on this front, we will continue to take additional steps throughout the year to permanently lower our cost structure, including but not limited to headcount reductions and continued to drive greater efficiencies across the business. We will continue to communicate specifics as these savings are realized. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.6%. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 282 million. EPS of $0.46 was $0.07 over the high end of our prior guidance range, reflecting lower operating expenses, higher revenue and the benefit of our share repurchases. 
Our cash and balance sheet metrics remain healthy. We closed Q1 with $4.4 billion in cash and short-term investments, with approximately 13% held by our domestic entities. We repaid the SolidFire loan in the first quarter out of global profits. We remain deeply committed to completing by the end of May 2018 the remaining balance of our share repurchase program that we announced in February 2015. 
In Q1, we repurchased $175 million of our stock and paid approximately $53 million in cash dividends. Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.19 per share, which will be paid on October 26, 2016, to shareholders of record as of the close of business October 7, 2016. 
Deferred and financed unearned services revenue was up 8% year-over-year. Inventory turns increased to 24 and DSO was 35 days. 
Q1 cash flow from operations was approximately $228 million versus $129 million in Q1, a year ago. We generated strong free cash flow of $192 million in the quarter. Representing about 15% of net revenues, free cash flow grew over 100% year-over-year. 
Now to guidance. As George discussed, we are aggressively pivoting to the growth areas of the market, while at the same time, transforming the company in order to streamline the business, to have greater efficiency and rapidly address the changing market. As we've outlined today, we executed well against our plans in Q1 and are encouraged by the early signs of progress that we're seeing. While we still have a lot of work to do, we remain confident in our ability to continue to execute against the plans we outlined for fiscal 2017 on our prior earnings call. 
For Q2, we expect net revenues to range between $1.265 billion and $1.415 billion, which at the midpoint, implies a sequential increase of 4% and a 7% decrease year-over-year on a difficult compare. We expect Q2 consolidated gross margins of approximately 62% to 63% and operating margins of approximately 13% to 14%. And finally, we expect earnings per share for the second quarter to range from approximately $0.51 to $0.56 per share. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A."

And so the percentage of systems that are -- we represent is a very large number. The cDOT conversions are lumpy. They go up and down. The pace at which they move are tied to customers IT spending and their readiness for conversions. In aggregate, you're seeing us continue to progress the conversion of the installed base. I would just say that I would not -- we're not planning the business around any particular quarter-on-quarter model. I think in aggregate, we're pleased with the progress, and we continue to want to get our customers over to clustered ONTAP and you're seeing that. 
In terms of gross margins, I think a couple of things. The first is the value proposition of All Flash FAS, clustered ONTAP are showing up in the differentiation and customer acquisition and the shipments that we are delivering to customers. The gross margin model that we showed last quarter to this quarter has stayed stable, and it's -- the market remains competitive, but we have differentiated technology in the market as well as, as you -- as we outlined in our cost focus, we continue to do work in the supply chain, on both the cost of goods sold as well as the operating structure of the company to support that model.

First of all, from a customer perspective, we think that the value of differentiated storage in data management capabilities, as we've always said, is in software. And we have among the best storage in data management platforms in the industry, without question, for traditional enterprise with clustered ONTAP and for webscale enterprise with SolidFire. So we feel very good about our position in those markets, the software value of those products protecting the differentiated gross margin. 
ONTAP Select is an offering that we've made available to customers who have the engineering capability to integrate software with systems for specific deployments. I think the range of customers who have that level of engineering capability is small. And so we think that the preponderant majority of our business will continue to stay integrated systems. With regard to SolidFire's FlashForward licensing model, it essentially allows customers to simplify procurement of software so that they can build a pool of storage that is enterprise-wide and then buy hardware as they needed and integrated under that software umbrella. Typically, what we have seen with that type of model is that it allows us to get larger footprint sooner in customers as they standardize on SolidFire for a broad range of use cases."

Our focus and disciplined execution again yielded solid results on the top and bottom lines. Our second quarter fiscal year 2017 revenue was at the midpoint of our prior guidance range with",1808,"Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Our focus and disciplined execution again yielded solid results on the top and bottom lines. Our second quarter fiscal year 2017 revenue was at the midpoint of our prior guidance range with both operating margin and earnings per share above our previous guidance. And we expanded our innovation in our industry-leading flash and hybrid cloud solutions during the quarter. These results are clear evidence of our ability to execute while we streamline the business and pivot to the growth areas of the market. 
As you've heard from us before, we have 3 priorities to deliver on our commitment to return the company to revenue growth with improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns. First, we are executing our Data Fabric strategy and delivering the strategic solutions that creates the foundation for how we enable customer success. Second, we are permanently lowering our cost structure and streamlining operations while maintaining our ability to innovate. And third, we are continuing our robust capital allocation program, which includes a mix of share buybacks, dividends and investment for the long-term growth of the business. 
I'll begin with an update on our first priority. Our strategic solutions are aligned to our customers' top IT imperatives and position us to lead in the new era of IT. In Q2, strategic solutions comprised 62% of net product revenue. Growth was relatively flat against the tough compare in Q2 fiscal year '16, but grew 10% sequentially, an indication that we continue to gain traction in customer environments. Net product revenue from our mature solutions declined at 29% year-over-year. We expect that over the course of this fiscal year, the headwinds from mature solutions will lessen, allowing the growth of the strategic solutions to return the company to moderated revenue growth in fiscal year 2018. 
As you saw in the Q3 guidance included in our press release, we expect this shift to begin delivering growth in the second half of this fiscal year. Much like us, our customers need to drive efficiency in the mature parts of their businesses while adding flexibility to capture new business opportunities, execute the competition and grow revenue. To achieve this, we are transforming IT, modernizing their data centers so that they can lower costs, increase agility, get more value from their data and integrate cloud resources with on-premises environments. 
As customers modernize they're infrastructure, their replacing stand-alone silos of storage and monolithic frame arrays with scale-out, software-defined shared storage platforms. Clustered ONTAP enables seamless enterprise data management across flash, disk and public and private cloud environments. With clustered ONTAP, IT organizations can consolidate multiple workloads into a single repository, dramatically improving the efficiency of their enterprise storage infrastructure. We continue to see strong customer demand and are gaining new customers and migrating existing customers to clustered ONTAP. Clustered ONTAP was deployed on 86% of FAS systems shift in Q2, up from roughly 70% a year ago. Unit shipments of clustered ONTAP systems grew 14% year-over-year. The installed base of FAS systems continues to grow, and clustered ONTAP is now running on approximately 36% of systems in that large and growing installed base. 
At the beginning of the fiscal year, we introduced ONTAP 9, which unifies data management across flash, disk and cloud, bridging current enterprise workloads and new emerging applications. The initial customer feedback has been tremendously positive. In the first 4 months since its release, ONTAP 9 has had the highest adoption rate of any of our major ONTAP introductions. In Q2, we expanded the innovation of ONTAP 9 with built in multitenant capability encryption for improved data security, support for massively scalable high-performance NAS containers and greatly simplified provisioning and operations for enterprise applications. 
To gain advantage through greater speed and responsiveness from key business applications while substantially lowering total cost of ownership, customers are leveraging flash technologies as part of their IT transformations. Flash is being used for a wide range of workloads and becoming the mainstream choice for on-premises deployments, requiring that all-flash arrays deliver enterprise grade data management capabilities. 
NetApp is leading the industry in the transition to flash with our highly differentiated portfolio of all-flash arrays, which provide customers with unrivaled scale, speed and data services. Gartner recognized NetApp as the leader in its Magic Quadrant for solid-state arrays. IDC ranks NetApp #2 in the all-flash array market with our growth outpacing that of the market and our peers. We expect to gain share again this quarter. In the second quarter, our all-flash every business tripled year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of over $1 billion, inclusive of All Flash FAS, EF and SolidFire product and services. 
With flash moving from a point solution to a pervasive technology, we refreshed our portfolio of ONTAP-powered hybrid all-flash arrays in Q2. We also enhanced ONTAP Select to support flash and commodity servers. Our new hybrid array systems span the requirements of large enterprise data centers to small enterprises and midsized businesses, offer dramatically increased speed and responsiveness compared to our previous hybrid arrays and scale up 14 petabytes in a single system and out [ph] to 172 petabytes in a cluster. Our new all-flash systems offer the industry's best data management features with up to twice the performance of prior systems at half the latency and are designed for easy set up in less than 10 minutes. Our new all-flash FAS systems are included in our flash promotion, which offers 3x guaranteed performance and a 4 to 1 guaranteed increase in storage efficiency over competitive disk arrays as well as a risk-free upfront trial, free storage controller upgrade and support extension to simplify ongoing operations. 
The majority of our growth in the all-flash every market is driven by the All Flash FAS. Customers are deploying the All Flash FAS to improve existing infrastructure and processes, lower cost and enhance flexibility. A North American financial services company chose the All Flash FAS to create a modern alternative to their expensive legacy monolithic fiber channel SAN array from a competitor. Another North American financial services company replaced a competitor's NAS footprint with an all-flash FAS cluster connected to a disk-based cluster with Snap backup services to crate a tiered cloud service model for its next-generation cloud services platform. We're gaining new customers and new footprint at existing customers with our all-flash arrays. For the first half of calendar 2016, NetApp is the fastest-growing SAN vendor as measured by IDC, a clear indicator that we are moving outside of our traditional install base and expanding our market opportunity. 
For enterprises and service providers who want to build a multitenant public and private clouds, SolidFire delivers a web scale-style architecture for next-generation data centers. Through the expanded reach of NetApp, we are acquiring new customers, introducing SolidFire into existing NetApp accounts and bringing NetApp solutions to SolidFire customers. A global financial services company is moving to NetApp after years of preference for a competitor. They're building a next-generation data center environment to power the digitization of their services by deploying ONTAP as the storage infrastructure for their OpenStack environment, SolidFire for their IT DevOps environment and StorageGRID web scale for their 1/3 [ph] platform solutions and archiving. Each of these products address unique requirements in the customer's environment while delivering the performance and reliability needed for a global digital enterprise. 
SolidFire is a key area of focus and investment for the long-term growth of NetApp and is performing to plan. Customers are also leveraging the hybrid cloud in the IT transformations to capitalize on the value of their data. Our Data Fabric strategy enables data management that seamlessly connects disparate systems, software stacks, clouds and data centers, allowing customers to architect the IT environment that best meets their needs, utilizing a mix of flash, disk and public and private cloud resources, all at the scale needed to accommodate the exponential data growth of the digital world. Customers can innovate faster by leveraging the scale of on-demand cloud capabilities while maintaining data visibility with a single, consistent view of data and infrastructure across clouds and on-premises resources. 
Earlier this month, we announced new data fabric solutions and services that maximize control and improve the secure movement of data across the hybrid cloud, along with updated versions of AltaVault, StorageGRID web scale and SnapCenter technologies to help customers extract the value of their data from anywhere in the hybrid cloud. We expanded the use case for ONTAP cloud to include Microsoft Azure and announced cloud control for Microsoft Office 365, a simple way to control and protect critical data stored in Office 365 with support for data retention and cloud services such as Amazon S3 and Azure as well as on-premises storage. 
Additionally, we introduced NetApp Private Storage as a service, on OpEx-based consumption model available through a growing partner delivery ecosystem. We're engaging with a broader set of partners to help customers plan and evolve hybrid cloud deployments to fit their changing business needs, and more and more customers in cloud service providers are choosing NetApp because we enable their hybrid cloud strategies. 
While Ron will go into depth about cost savings and capital allocation, I want to emphasize our commitment to both priorities. At the start of the third quarter, we announced the reduction in force as part of our planned transformation and cost-reduction efforts. This action was taken in alignment with real structural changes to make our business more streamlined and agile. We are making substantial progress against $130 million cost-reduction goal net of reinvestment that we outlined in our Q3 fiscal year 2016 earnings call. We are on target and expect to achieve the remainder of savings through the normal course of business. I want to thank the NetApp team for remaining focused on execution while making difficult restructuring decisions.
We're pleased with our progress, but still have more work ahead of us. We're advancing our product and solutions portfolio, evolving our ecosystem of partners, streamlining our business processes and enhancing our go-to-market model. We've sharpened our focus, accelerated our innovation and are funding the investments against the fastest-growing parts of the market like all-flash arrays, next-generation data centers and hybrid cloud solutions, while accelerating our ability to deliver shareholder value in the form of improved profitability and cash flow. We are on track to return the company to long-term growth and to our target operating margin range, but we must remain focused and continue our disciplined execution. Our second quarter results and third quarter guidance are evidence that our strategy is working, and I get more confident than ever in the NetApp team's ability to successfully evolve the company for leadership in the data-powered digital era. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ron to walk through our Q2 financial performance and expectations for Q3. Ron?"
32052,408409497,1088136,"NetApp, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2016",2016-11-16,"Earnings Calls","NetApp, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers today.

As a reminder, we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers today. 
As you heard from George, we continue to make significant progress toward our pivot to the growth areas of the market, while at the same time, transforming the company. Q2 marks another quarter of solid execution, albeit against a difficult year-over-year compare. Net revenues were at the midpoint of our guidance at $1.34 billion. This was an increase of approximately 3.5% sequentially and a decline of about 7% on a year-over-year basis. Product revenue of $710 million increased 7.5% sequentially and declined 13% year-over-year. As we've discussed, we expect the growth of our strategic solutions to improve our product revenue growth trajectory over the course of fiscal 2017. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenue of $630 million was relatively flat sequentially and year-over-year. 
Gross margin was 62.7% and within our guidance range. Product gross margin of 48.2% decreased about 3.5 points year-over-year and increased 1.5 points sequentially. Software maintenance gross margin was relatively flat sequentially and year-over-year, while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin increased just over 3 points year-over-year. 
Operating expenses of $636 million decreased 7% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, reflecting the benefits of our ongoing transformation efforts. Operating margin of 15.2% was above our guidance range, evidence of the progress we're making toward the operating margin range we guided for the year. 
Aligning our cost structure with the opportunities ahead remains my top priority. As I said on our last earnings call, part of the planned transformation efforts will include additional step to permanently lower our cost structure, including headcount reductions. As such, on November 3, we initiated a reduction of approximately 6% of our worldwide headcount, which will result in a onetime charge of $50 [ph] million to $60 million primarily in Q3 fiscal 2017. This action will yield an annual run rate savings of approximately $130 million. 
As a reminder, we are driving to permanently reduce our cost structure across both cost of sales and OpEx. In Q3 '16, we announced our plan to reduce our cost structure by $400 million gross annualized by the end of fiscal 2017. We said some of those savings will be reinvested into strategic opportunities such as SolidFire and will yield a net run rate savings annually off roughly $130 [ph] million by the end of fiscal 2017. We have made meaningful progress against this plan by implementing tighter cost controls over indirect spending, improving supply chain efficiency, streamlining our product portfolio, evolving the business processes and reducing headcount. Given the progress we've made today, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our goal on schedule. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.3%. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 284 million. EPS of $0.60 was $0.04 over the high end of our guidance range, reflecting improved gross margin, lower operating expense and the benefits of our share repurchases. Our cash and balance sheet metrics remain healthy. We closed Q2 with $4.4 billion in cash and short-term investments with approximately 10% held by our domestic entities. We remain committed to completing by the end of May 2018 the remaining balance of our share repurchase program announced in February 2015. In Q2, we repurchased $117 million of our stock and paid approximately $52 million in cash dividends. Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.19 per share, which will be paid on January 25, 2017, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 6, 2017. 
Deferred and financed unearned services revenue was up 5% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Q2 cash flow from operations was $158 [ph] million, up 9% year-over-year. We generated free cash flow of $102 million, an increase of about 3% year-over-year. We are aggressively managing our working capital metrics, DSO, DPO and days of inventory outstanding. DSO were flat year-over-year while DPO increased by 8 days and days of inventory outstanding improved by 3 days. As a result, our cash conversion cycle was 9 days, which was an improvement of 12 days year-over-year but, 3 days longer sequentially due to the seasonal increase in DSO. 
Now on to guidance. As we outlined today, our transformation efforts are resulting in a stronger, more focused and agile company. We remain committed to driving productivity, while at the same time, continuing to shift our investment and focus toward the growth areas of the market. We are increasingly encouraged by the early signs of progress that we're seeing. While we still have work to do we remain confident in our ability to continue to execute against the plans we outlined for fiscal 2017 on our Q1 earnings call. For Q3, we expect net revenues to range between $1.325 billion to $1.475 billion which, at the midpoint, implies a sequential increase of approximately 4% and a 1% increase year-over-year. We expect Q3 gross margin in the range of 61.5% to 62.5% and operating margin between 18% and 18.5%. And finally, we expect earnings per share for the third quarter to range from approximately $0.72 to $0.77 per share.

Our focus and disciplined execution, again, yielded solid results on the top and bottom lines.

Our focus and disciplined execution, again, yielded solid results on the top and bottom lines. Our second quarter fiscal year 2017 revenue was at the midpoint of our prior guidance range with both operating margin and earnings per share above our previous guidance, and we expanded our innovation in our industry-leading flash and hybrid cloud solutions during the quarter. These results are clear evidence of our ability to execute while we streamline the business and pivot to the growth areas of the market. 
As you've heard from us before, we have 3 priorities to deliver on our commitment to return the company to revenue growth with improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns. First, we are executing our Data Fabric strategy and delivering the strategic solutions that create the foundation for how we enable customer success. Second, we are permanently lowering our cost structure and streamlining operations while maintaining our ability to innovate. And third, we are continuing our robust capital allocation program, which includes a mix of share buybacks, dividends and investment for the long-term growth of the business. 
I'll begin with an update on our first priority. Our strategic solutions are aligned to our customers' top IT imperatives and position us to lead in the new era of IT. In Q2, strategic solutions comprised 62% of net product revenue. Growth was relatively flat against the tough compare in Q2 fiscal year '16 but grew 10% sequentially, an indication that we continue to gain traction in customer environments. Net product revenue from our mature solutions declined at 29% year-over-year. We expect that over the course of this fiscal year, the headwinds from mature solutions will lessen, allowing the growth of the strategic solutions to return the company to moderated revenue growth in fiscal year 2018. 
As you saw in the Q3 guidance included in our press release, we expect this shift to begin delivering growth in the second half of this fiscal year. Much like us, our customers need to drive efficiency in the mature parts of their businesses while adding flexibility to capture new business opportunities, out-execute the competition and grow revenue. To achieve this, they are transforming IT, modernizing their data centers so that they can lower costs, increase agility, get more value from their data and integrate cloud resources with on-premises environments. 
As customers modernize their infrastructures, they're replacing stand-alone silos of storage and monolithic frame arrays with scale-out, software-defined shared-storage platforms. Clustered ONTAP enables seamless enterprise data management across flash, disk and public and private cloud environments. With clustered ONTAP, IT organizations can consolidate multiple workloads into a single repository, dramatically improving the efficiency of their enterprise storage infrastructure. We continue to see strong customer demand and are gaining new customers and migrating existing customers to clustered ONTAP. Clustered ONTAP was deployed on 86% of FAS systems shipped in Q2, up from roughly 70% a year ago. Unit shipments of clustered ONTAP systems grew 14% year-over-year. The installed base of FAS systems continues to grow, and clustered ONTAP is now running on approximately 36% of systems in that large and growing installed base. 
At the beginning of the fiscal year, we introduced ONTAP 9, which unifies data management across flash, disk and cloud, bridging current enterprise workloads and new emerging applications. The initial customer feedback has been tremendously positive. In the first 4 months since its release, ONTAP 9 has had the highest adoption rate of any of our major ONTAP introductions. In Q2, we expanded the innovation of ONTAP 9 with built-in multi-tenant-capable encryption for improved data security, support for massively scalable high-performance NAS containers and greatly simplified provisioning and operations for enterprise applications.  
To gain advantage through greater speed and responsiveness from key business applications while substantially lowering total cost of ownership, customers are leveraging flash technology as part of their IT transformations. Flash is being used for a wide range of workloads and becoming the mainstream choice for on-premises deployments, requiring that all-flash arrays deliver enterprise-grade data management capabilities. 
NetApp is leading the industry in the transition to flash with our highly differentiated portfolio of all-flash arrays, which provide customers with unrivaled scale, speed and data services. Gartner recognized NetApp as the leader in its Magic Quadrant for solid-state arrays. IDC ranks NetApp #2 in the all-flash array market with our growth outpacing that of the market and our peers. We expect to gain share again this quarter. In the second quarter, our all-flash array business tripled year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of over $1 billion, inclusive of All Flash FAS, EF and SolidFire product and services. 
With flash moving from a point solution to a pervasive technology, we refreshed our portfolio of ONTAP-powered hybrid and all-flash arrays in Q2. We also enhanced ONTAP Select to support flash and commodity servers. Our new hybrid array systems span the requirements of large enterprise data centers to small enterprises and midsized businesses, offer dramatically increased speed and responsiveness compared to our previous hybrid arrays and scale up to 14 petabytes in a single system and out to 172 petabytes in a cluster. Our new all-flash systems offer the industry's best data management features with up to twice the performance of prior systems at half the latency and are designed for easy setup in less than 10 minutes. Our new All Flash FAS systems are included in our flash promotion, which offers 3x guaranteed performance and a 4-to-1 guaranteed increase in storage efficiency over competitive disk arrays as well as a risk-free upfront trial, free storage controller upgrade and support extension to simplify ongoing operations. 
The majority of our growth in the all-flash array market is driven by the All Flash FAS. Customers are deploying the All Flash FAS to improve existing infrastructure and processes, lower costs and enhance flexibility. A North American financial services company chose the All Flash FAS to create a modern alternative to their expensive legacy monolithic fiber channel SAN array from a competitor. Another North American financial services company replaced a competitor's NAS footprint with an All Flash FAS cluster connected to a disk-based cluster with SnapVault backup services to create a tiered cloud service model for its next-generation FAS services platform. We're gaining new customers and new footprint at existing customers with our all-flash arrays. For the first half of calendar 2016, NetApp is the fastest-growing SAN vendor as measured by IDC, a clear indicator that we are moving outside of our traditional installed base and expanding our market opportunity. 
For enterprises and service providers who want to build a multi-tenant public and private clouds, SolidFire delivers a web-scale-style architecture for next-generation data centers. Through the expanded reach of NetApp, we are acquiring new customers, introducing SolidFire into existing NetApp accounts and bringing NetApp solutions to SolidFire customers. A global financial services company is moving to NetApp after years of preference for a competitor. They're building a next-generation data center environment to power the digitization of their services by deploying ONTAP as the storage infrastructure for their OpenStack environment, SolidFire for their IT DevOps environment and StorageGRID Webscale for their third platform solutions and archiving. Each of these products address unique requirements in the customer's environment while delivering the performance and reliability needed for a global digital enterprise. SolidFire is a key area of focus and investment for the long-term growth of NetApp and is performing to plan. 
Customers are also leveraging the hybrid cloud in their IT transformations to capitalize on the value of their data. Our Data Fabric strategy enables data management that seamlessly connects disparate systems, software stacks, clouds and data centers, allowing customers to architect the IT environment that best meets their needs, utilizing a mix of flash, disk and public and private cloud resources, all at the scale needed to accommodate the exponential data growth of the digital world. Customers can innovate faster by leveraging the scale of on-demand cloud capabilities while maintaining data visibility with a single, consistent view of data and infrastructure across clouds and on-premises resources. 
Earlier this month, we announced new data fabric solutions and services that maximize control and improve the secure movement of data across the hybrid cloud, along with updated versions of AltaVault, StorageGRID Webscale and SnapCenter technologies to help customers extract the value of their data from anywhere in the hybrid cloud. We expanded the use case for ONTAP cloud to include Microsoft Azure and announced cloud control for Microsoft Office 365, a simple way to control and protect critical data stored in Office 365 with support for data retention and cloud services such as Amazon S3 and Azure as well as on-premises storage. 
Additionally, we introduced NetApp Private Storage as a service, on OpEx-based consumption model available through a growing partner delivery ecosystem. We're engaging with a broader set of partners to help customers plan and evolve their hybrid cloud deployments to fit their changing business needs, and more and more customers and cloud service providers are choosing NetApp because we enable their hybrid cloud strategies. 
While Ron will go into depth about cost savings and capital allocation, I want to reemphasize our commitment to both priorities. At the start of the third quarter, we announced the reduction in force as part of our planned transformation and cost-reduction efforts. This action was taken in alignment with real structural changes to make our business more streamlined and agile. We are making substantial progress against $130 million cost-reduction goal net of reinvestment that we outlined on our Q3 fiscal year 2016 earnings call. We are on target and expect to achieve the remainder of savings through the normal course of business. I want to thank the NetApp team for remaining focused on execution while making difficult restructuring decisions.
We're pleased with our progress but still have more work ahead of us. We're advancing our product and solutions portfolio, evolving our ecosystem of partners, streamlining our business processes and enhancing our go-to-market model. We've sharpened our focus, accelerated our innovation and are funding the investments against the fastest-growing parts of the market like all-flash arrays, next-generation data centers and hybrid cloud solutions while accelerating our ability to deliver shareholder value in the form of improved profitability and cash flow. We're on track to return the company to long-term growth and to our target operating margin range, but we must remain focused and continue our disciplined execution. Our second quarter results and third quarter guidance are evidence that our strategy is working, and I am more confident than ever in the NetApp team's ability to successfully evolve the company for leadership in the data-powered digital era. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ron to walk through our Q2 financial performance and expectations for Q3. Ron?"

As a reminder, we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers today. 
As you heard from George, we continue to make significant progress toward our pivot to the growth areas of the market while at the same time transforming the company. Q2 marks another quarter of solid execution, albeit against a difficult year-over-year compare. Net revenues were at the midpoint of our guidance at $1.34 billion. This was an increase of approximately 3.5% sequentially and a decline of about 7% on a year-over-year basis. Product revenue of $710 million increased 7.5% sequentially and declined 13% year-over-year. As we've discussed, we expect the growth of our strategic solutions to improve our product revenue growth trajectory over the course of fiscal 2017. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenue of $630 million was relatively flat sequentially and year-over-year. 
Gross margin was 62.7% and within our guidance range. Product gross margin of 48.2% decreased about 3.5 points year-over-year and increased 1.5 points sequentially. Software maintenance gross margin was relatively flat sequentially and year-over-year, while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin increased just over 3 points year-over-year. 
Operating expenses of $636 million decreased 7% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, reflecting the benefit of our ongoing transformation efforts. Operating margin of 15.2% was above our guidance range, evidence of the progress we're making toward the operating margin range we guided for the year. 
Aligning our cost structure with the opportunities ahead remains my top priority. As I said on our last earnings call, part of the planned transformation efforts would include additional steps to permanently lower our cost structure, including headcount reductions. As such, on November 3, we initiated a reduction of approximately 6% of our worldwide headcount, which will result in a onetime charge of $50 million to $60 million primarily in Q3 fiscal 2017. This action will yield an annual run rate savings of approximately $130 million. 
As a reminder, we are driving to permanently reduce our cost structure across both cost of sales and OpEx. In Q3 '16, we announced our plan to reduce our cost structure by $400 million gross annualized by the end of fiscal 2017. We said some of those savings will be reinvested into strategic opportunities such as SolidFire and will yield a net run rate savings annually of roughly $130 million by the end of fiscal 2017. We have made meaningful progress against this plan by implementing tighter cost controls over indirect spending, improving supply chain efficiency, streamlining our product portfolio, evolving the business processes and reducing headcount. Given the progress we've made today, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our goal on schedule. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.3%. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 284 million. EPS of $0.60 was $0.04 over the high end of our guidance range, reflecting improved gross margin, lower operating expense and the benefit of our share repurchases. Our cash and balance sheet metrics remain healthy. We closed Q2 with $4.4 billion in cash and short-term investments with approximately 10% held by our domestic entities. We remain committed to completing by the end of May 2018 the remaining balance of our share repurchase program announced in February 2015. In Q2, we repurchased $117 million of our stock and paid approximately $52 million in cash dividends. Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.19 per share, which will be paid on January 25, 2017, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 6, 2017. 
Deferred and financed unearned services revenue was up 5% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Q2 cash flow from operations was $158 million, up 9% year-over-year. We generated free cash flow of $102 million, an increase of about 3% year-over-year. We are aggressively managing our working capital metrics: DSO, DPO and days of inventory outstanding. DSO were flat year-over-year while DPO increased by 8 days, and days of inventory outstanding improved by 3 days. As a result, our cash conversion cycle was 9 days, which was an improvement of 12 days year-over-year but 3 days longer sequentially due to the seasonal increase in DSO. 
Now on to guidance. As we outlined today, our transformation efforts are resulting in a stronger, more focused and agile company. We remain committed to driving productivity while at the same time continuing to shift our investment and focus toward the growth areas of the market. We are increasingly encouraged by the early signs of progress that we're seeing. While we still have work to do, we remain confident in our ability to continue to execute against the plans we outlined for fiscal 2017 on our Q1 earnings call. For Q3, we expect net revenues to range between $1.325 billion to $1.475 billion which, at the midpoint, implies a sequential increase of approximately 4% and a 1% increase year-over-year. We expect Q3 gross margin in the range of 61.5% to 62.5% and operating margin between 18% and 18.5%. And finally, we expect earnings per share for the third quarter to range from approximately $0.72 to $0.77 per share.

Our focus and disciplined execution, again, yielded solid results on the top and bottom lines.

Our focus and disciplined execution, again, yielded solid results on the top and bottom lines. Our second quarter fiscal year 2017 revenue was at the midpoint of our prior guidance range with both operating margin and earnings per share above our previous guidance, and we expanded our innovation in our industry-leading flash and hybrid cloud solutions during the quarter. These results are clear evidence of our ability to execute while we streamline the business and pivot to the growth areas of the market. 
As you've heard from us before, we have 3 priorities to deliver on our commitment to return the company to revenue growth with improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns. First, we are executing our Data Fabric strategy and delivering the strategic solutions that create the foundation for how we enable customer success. Second, we are permanently lowering our cost structure and streamlining operations while maintaining our ability to innovate. And third, we are continuing our robust capital allocation program, which includes a mix of share buybacks, dividends and investment for the long-term growth of the business. 
I'll begin with an update on our first priority. Our strategic solutions are aligned to our customers' top IT imperatives and position us to lead in the new era of IT. In Q2, strategic solutions comprised 62% of net product revenue. Growth was relatively flat against the tough compare in Q2 fiscal year '16 but grew 10% sequentially, an indication that we continue to gain traction in customer environments. Net product revenue from our mature solutions declined at 29% year-over-year. We expect that over the course of this fiscal year, the headwinds from mature solutions will lessen, allowing the growth of the strategic solutions to return the company to moderated revenue growth in fiscal year 2018. 
As you saw in the Q3 guidance included in our press release, we expect this shift to begin delivering growth in the second half of this fiscal year. Much like us, our customers need to drive efficiency in the mature parts of their businesses while adding flexibility to capture new business opportunities, out-execute the competition and grow revenue. To achieve this, they are transforming IT, modernizing their data centers so that they can lower costs, increase agility, get more value from their data and integrate cloud resources with on-premises environments. 
As customers modernize their infrastructures, they're replacing stand-alone silos of storage and monolithic frame arrays with scale-out, software-defined shared-storage platforms. Clustered ONTAP enables seamless enterprise data management across flash, disk and public and private cloud environments. With clustered ONTAP, IT organizations can consolidate multiple workloads into a single repository, dramatically improving the efficiency of their enterprise storage infrastructure. We continue to see strong customer demand and are gaining new customers and migrating existing customers to clustered ONTAP. Clustered ONTAP was deployed on 86% of FAS systems shipped in Q2, up from roughly 70% a year ago. Unit shipments of clustered ONTAP systems grew 14% year-over-year. The installed base of FAS systems continues to grow, and clustered ONTAP is now running on approximately 36% of systems in that large and growing installed base. 
At the beginning of the fiscal year, we introduced ONTAP 9, which unifies data management across flash, disk and cloud, bridging current enterprise workloads and new emerging applications. The initial customer feedback has been tremendously positive. In the first 4 months since its release, ONTAP 9 has had the highest adoption rate of any of our major ONTAP introductions. In Q2, we expanded the innovation of ONTAP 9 with built-in multi-tenant-capable encryption for improved data security, support for massively scalable high-performance NAS containers and greatly simplified provisioning and operations for enterprise applications.  
To gain advantage through greater speed and responsiveness from key business applications, while substantially lowering total cost of ownership, customers are leveraging flash technology as part of their IT transformations. Flash is being used for a wide range of workloads and becoming the mainstream choice for on-premises deployments, requiring that all-flash arrays deliver enterprise-grade data management capabilities. 
NetApp is leading the industry in the transition to flash with our highly differentiated portfolio of all-flash arrays, which provide customers with unrivaled scale, speed and data services. Gartner recognized NetApp as the leader in its Magic Quadrant for solid-state arrays. IDC ranks NetApp #2 in the all-flash array market with our growth outpacing that of the market and our peers. We expect to gain share again this quarter. In the second quarter, our all-flash array business tripled year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of over $1 billion, inclusive of All Flash FAS, EF and SolidFire product and services. 
With flash moving from a point solution to a pervasive technology, we refreshed our portfolio of ONTAP-powered hybrid and all-flash arrays in Q2. We also enhanced ONTAP Select to support flash and commodity servers. Our new hybrid array systems span the requirements of large enterprise data centers to small enterprises and midsized businesses, offer dramatically increased speed and responsiveness compared to our previous hybrid arrays and scale up to 14 petabytes in a single system and out to 172 petabytes in a cluster. Our new all-flash systems offer the industry's best data management features with up to twice the performance of prior systems at half the latency and are designed for easy setup in less than 10 minutes. Our new All Flash FAS systems are included in our flash promotion, which offers 3x guaranteed performance and a 4-to-1 guaranteed increase in storage efficiency over competitive disk arrays as well as a risk-free upfront trial, free storage controller upgrade and support extension to simplify ongoing operations. 
The majority of our growth in the all-flash array market is driven by the All Flash FAS. Customers are deploying the All Flash FAS to improve existing infrastructure and processes, lower costs and enhance flexibility. A North American financial services company chose the All Flash FAS to create a modern alternative to their expensive legacy monolithic fiber channel SAN array from a competitor. Another North American financial services company replaced a competitor's NAS footprint with an All Flash FAS cluster connected to a disk-based cluster with SnapVault backup services to create a tiered cloud service model for its next-generation FAS services platform. We're gaining new customers and new footprint at existing customers with our all-flash arrays. For the first half of calendar 2016, NetApp is the fastest-growing SAN vendor as measured by IDC, a clear indicator that we are moving outside of our traditional installed base and expanding our market opportunity. 
For enterprises and service providers who want to build a multi-tenant public and private clouds, SolidFire delivers a web-scale-style architecture for next-generation data centers. Through the expanded reach of NetApp, we are acquiring new customers, introducing SolidFire into existing NetApp accounts and bringing NetApp solutions to SolidFire customers. A global financial services company is moving to NetApp after years of preference for a competitor. They're building a next-generation data center environment to power the digitization of their services by deploying ONTAP as the storage infrastructure for their OpenStack environment, SolidFire for their IT DevOps environment and StorageGRID Webscale for their third platform solutions and archiving. Each of these products address unique requirements in the customer's environment while delivering the performance and reliability needed for a global digital enterprise. SolidFire is a key area of focus and investment for the long-term growth of NetApp and is performing to plan. 
Customers are also leveraging the hybrid cloud in their IT transformations to capitalize on the value of their data. Our Data Fabric strategy enables data management that seamlessly connects disparate systems, software stacks, clouds and data centers, allowing customers to architect the IT environment that best meets their needs, utilizing a mix of flash, disk and public and private cloud resources, all at the scale needed to accommodate the exponential data growth of the digital world. Customers can innovate faster by leveraging the scale of on-demand cloud capabilities while maintaining data visibility with a single, consistent view of data and infrastructure across clouds and on-premises resources. 
Earlier this month, we announced new data fabric solutions and services that maximize control and improve the secure movement of data across the hybrid cloud, along with updated versions of AltaVault, StorageGRID Webscale and SnapCenter technologies to help customers extract the value of their data from anywhere in the hybrid cloud. We expanded the use case for ONTAP cloud to include Microsoft Azure and announced cloud control for Microsoft Office 365, a simple way to control and protect critical data stored in Office 365 with support for data retention and cloud services such as Amazon S3 and Azure as well as on-premises storage. 
Additionally, we introduced NetApp Private Storage as a service, on OpEx-based consumption model available through a growing partner delivery ecosystem. We're engaging with a broader set of partners to help customers plan and evolve their hybrid cloud deployments to fit their changing business needs, and more and more customers and cloud service providers are choosing NetApp because we enable their hybrid cloud strategies. 
While Ron will go into depth about cost savings and capital allocation, I want to reemphasize our commitment to both priorities. At the start of the third quarter, we announced the reduction in force as part of our planned transformation and cost-reduction efforts. This action was taken in alignment with real structural changes to make our business more streamlined and agile. We are making substantial progress against $130 million cost-reduction goal net of reinvestment that we outlined on our Q3 fiscal year 2016 earnings call. We are on target and expect to achieve the remainder of savings through the normal course of business. I want to thank the NetApp team for remaining focused on execution while making difficult restructuring decisions.
We're pleased with our progress but still have more work ahead of us. We're advancing our product and solutions portfolio, evolving our ecosystem of partners, streamlining our business processes and enhancing our go-to-market model. We've sharpened our focus, accelerated our innovation and are funding the investments against the fastest-growing parts of the market like all-flash arrays, next-generation data centers and hybrid cloud solutions while accelerating our ability to deliver shareholder value in the form of improved profitability and cash flow. We're on track to return the company to long-term growth and to our target operating margin range, but we must remain focused and continue our disciplined execution. Our second quarter results and third quarter guidance are evidence that our strategy is working, and I am more confident than ever in the NetApp team's ability to successfully evolve the company for leadership in the data-powered digital era. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ron to walk through our Q2 financial performance and expectations for Q3. Ron?"
32052,408409497,1088249,"NetApp, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 16, 2016",2016-11-16,"Earnings Calls","NetApp, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, George, and good afternoon, everyone.

As a reminder, we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers today. 
As you heard from George, we continue to make significant progress toward our pivot to the growth areas of the market while at the same time transforming the company. Q2 marks another quarter of solid execution, albeit against a difficult year-over-year compare. Net revenues were at the midpoint of our guidance at $1.34 billion. This was an increase of approximately 3.5% sequentially and a decline of about 7% on a year-over-year basis. Product revenue of $710 million increased 7.5% sequentially and declined 13% year-over-year. As we've discussed, we expect the growth of our strategic solutions to improve our product revenue growth trajectory over the course of fiscal 2017. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenue of $630 million was relatively flat sequentially and year-over-year. 
Gross margin was 62.7% and within our guidance range. Product gross margin of 48.2% decreased about 3.5 points year-over-year and increased 1.5 points sequentially. Software maintenance gross margin was relatively flat sequentially and year-over-year, while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin increased just over 3 points year-over-year. 
Operating expenses of $636 million decreased 7% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, reflecting the benefit of our ongoing transformation efforts. Operating margin of 15.2% was above our guidance range, evidence of the progress we're making toward the operating margin range we guided for the year. 
Aligning our cost structure with the opportunities ahead remains my top priority. As I said on our last earnings call, part of the planned transformation efforts would include additional steps to permanently lower our cost structure, including headcount reductions. As such, on November 3, we initiated a reduction of approximately 6% of our worldwide headcount, which will result in a onetime charge of $50 million to $60 million primarily in Q3 fiscal 2017. This action will yield an annual run rate savings of approximately $130 million. 
As a reminder, we are driving to permanently reduce our cost structure across both cost of sales and OpEx. In Q3 '16, we announced our plan to reduce our cost structure by $400 million gross annualized by the end of fiscal 2017. We said some of those savings will be reinvested into strategic opportunities such as SolidFire and will yield a net run rate savings annually of roughly $130 million by the end of fiscal 2017. We have made meaningful progress against this plan by implementing tighter cost controls over indirect spending, improving supply chain efficiency, streamlining our product portfolio, evolving the business processes and reducing headcount. Given the progress we've made to-date, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our goal on schedule. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.3%. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 284 million. EPS of $0.60 was $0.04 over the high end of our guidance range, reflecting improved gross margin, lower operating expense and the benefit of our share repurchases. Our cash and balance sheet metrics remain healthy. We closed Q2 with $4.4 billion in cash and short-term investments with approximately 10% held by our domestic entities. We remain committed to completing by the end of May 2018 the remaining balance of our share repurchase program announced in February 2015. In Q2, we repurchased $117 million of our stock and paid approximately $52 million in cash dividends. Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.19 per share, which will be paid on January 25, 2017, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 6, 2017. 
Deferred and financed unearned services revenue was up 5% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Q2 cash flow from operations was $158 million, up 9% year-over-year. We generated free cash flow of $102 million, an increase of about 3% year-over-year. We are aggressively managing our working capital metrics: DSO, DPO and days of inventory outstanding. DSO were flat year-over-year while DPO increased by 8 days, and days of inventory outstanding improved by 3 days. As a result, our cash conversion cycle was 9 days, which was an improvement of 12 days year-over-year but 3 days longer sequentially due to the seasonal increase in DSO. 
Now on to guidance. As we outlined today, our transformation efforts are resulting in a stronger, more focused and agile company. We remain committed to driving productivity while at the same time continuing to shift our investment and focus toward the growth areas of the market. We are increasingly encouraged by the early signs of progress that we're seeing. While we still have work to do, we remain confident in our ability to continue to execute against the plans we outlined for fiscal 2017 on our Q1 earnings call. For Q3, we expect net revenues to range between $1.325 billion to $1.475 billion which, at the midpoint, implies a sequential increase of approximately 4% and a 1% increase year-over-year. We expect Q3 gross margin in the range of 61.5% to 62.5% and operating margin between 18% and 18.5%. And finally, we expect earnings per share for the third quarter to range from approximately $0.72 to $0.77 per share.

Our focus and disciplined execution, again, yielded solid results on the top and bottom lines.

Our focus and disciplined execution, again, yielded solid results on the top and bottom lines. Our second quarter fiscal year 2017 revenue was at the midpoint of our prior guidance range with both operating margin and earnings per share above our previous guidance, and we expanded our innovation in our industry-leading flash and hybrid cloud solutions during the quarter. These results are clear evidence of our ability to execute while we streamline the business and pivot to the growth areas of the market. 
As you've heard from us before, we have 3 priorities to deliver on our commitment to return the company to revenue growth with improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns. First, we are executing our Data Fabric strategy and delivering the strategic solutions that create the foundation for how we enable customer success. Second, we are permanently lowering our cost structure and streamlining operations while maintaining our ability to innovate. And third, we are continuing our robust capital allocation program, which includes a mix of share buybacks, dividends and investment for the long-term growth of the business. 
I'll begin with an update on our first priority. Our strategic solutions are aligned to our customers' top IT imperatives and position us to lead in the new era of IT. In Q2, strategic solutions comprised 62% of net product revenue. Growth was relatively flat against the tough compare in Q2 fiscal year '16 but grew 10% sequentially, an indication that we continue to gain traction in customer environments. Net product revenue from our mature solutions declined at 29% year-over-year. We expect that over the course of this fiscal year, the headwinds from mature solutions will lessen, allowing the growth of the strategic solutions to return the company to moderated revenue growth in fiscal year 2018. 
As you saw in the Q3 guidance included in our press release, we expect this shift to begin delivering growth in the second half of this fiscal year. Much like us, our customers need to drive efficiency in the mature parts of their businesses while adding flexibility to capture new business opportunities, out-execute the competition and grow revenue. To achieve this, they are transforming IT, modernizing their data centers so that they can lower costs, increase agility, get more value from their data and integrate cloud resources with on-premises environments. 
As customers modernize their infrastructures, they're replacing stand-alone silos of storage and monolithic frame arrays with scale-out, software-defined shared-storage platforms. Clustered ONTAP enables seamless enterprise data management across flash, disk and public and private cloud environments. With clustered ONTAP, IT organizations can consolidate multiple workloads into a single repository, dramatically improving the efficiency of their enterprise storage infrastructure. We continue to see strong customer demand and are gaining new customers and migrating existing customers to clustered ONTAP. Clustered ONTAP was deployed on 86% of FAS systems shipped in Q2, up from roughly 70% a year ago. Unit shipments of clustered ONTAP systems grew 14% year-over-year. The installed base of FAS systems continues to grow, and clustered ONTAP is now running on approximately 36% of systems in that large and growing installed base. 
At the beginning of the fiscal year, we introduced ONTAP 9, which unifies data management across flash, disk and cloud, bridging current enterprise workloads and new emerging applications. The initial customer feedback has been tremendously positive. In the first 4 months since its release, ONTAP 9 has had the highest adoption rate of any of our major ONTAP introductions. In Q2, we expanded the innovation of ONTAP 9 with built-in multi-tenant-capable encryption for improved data security, support for massively scalable high-performance NAS containers and greatly simplified provisioning and operations for enterprise applications.  
To gain advantage through greater speed and responsiveness from key business applications, while substantially lowering total cost of ownership, customers are leveraging flash technology as part of their IT transformations. Flash is being used for a wide range of workloads and becoming the mainstream choice for on-premises deployments, requiring that all-flash arrays deliver enterprise-grade data management capabilities. 
NetApp is leading the industry in the transition to flash with our highly differentiated portfolio of all-flash arrays, which provide customers with unrivaled scale, speed and data services. Gartner recognized NetApp as the leader in its Magic Quadrant for solid-state arrays. IDC ranks NetApp #2 in the all-flash array market with our growth outpacing that of the market and our peers. We expect to gain share again this quarter. In the second quarter, our all-flash array business tripled year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of over $1 billion, inclusive of All Flash FAS, EF and SolidFire product and services. 
With flash moving from a point solution to a pervasive technology, we refreshed our portfolio of ONTAP-powered hybrid and all-flash arrays in Q2. We also enhanced ONTAP Select to support flash and commodity servers. Our new hybrid array systems span the requirements of large enterprise data centers to small enterprises and midsized businesses, offer dramatically increased speed and responsiveness compared to our previous hybrid arrays and scale up to 14 petabytes in a single system and out to 172 petabytes in a cluster. Our new all-flash systems offer the industry's best data management features with up to twice the performance of prior systems at half the latency and are designed for easy setup in less than 10 minutes. Our new All Flash FAS systems are included in our flash promotion, which offers 3x guaranteed performance and a 4-to-1 guaranteed increase in storage efficiency over competitive disk arrays as well as a risk-free upfront trial, free storage controller upgrade and support extension to simplify ongoing operations. 
The majority of our growth in the all-flash array market is driven by the All Flash FAS. Customers are deploying the All Flash FAS to improve existing infrastructure and processes, lower costs and enhance flexibility. A North American financial services company chose the All Flash FAS to create a modern alternative to their expensive legacy monolithic fiber channel SAN array from a competitor. Another North American financial services company replaced a competitor's NAS footprint with an All Flash FAS cluster connected to a disk-based cluster with SnapVault backup services to create a tiered cloud service model for its next-generation FAS services platform. We're gaining new customers and new footprint at existing customers with our all-flash arrays. For the first half of calendar 2016, NetApp is the fastest-growing SAN vendor as measured by IDC, a clear indicator that we are moving outside of our traditional installed base and expanding our market opportunity. 
For enterprises and service providers who want to build a multi-tenant public and private clouds, SolidFire delivers a web-scale-style architecture for next-generation data centers. Through the expanded reach of NetApp, we are acquiring new customers, introducing SolidFire into existing NetApp accounts and bringing NetApp solutions to SolidFire customers. A global financial services company is moving to NetApp after years of preference for a competitor. They're building a next-generation data center environment to power the digitization of their services by deploying ONTAP as the storage infrastructure for their OpenStack environment, SolidFire for their IT DevOps environment and StorageGRID Webscale for their third platform solutions and archiving. Each of these products address unique requirements in the customer's environment while delivering the performance and reliability needed for a global digital enterprise. SolidFire is a key area of focus and investment for the long-term growth of NetApp and is performing to plan. 
Customers are also leveraging the hybrid cloud in their IT transformations to capitalize on the value of their data. Our Data Fabric strategy enables data management that seamlessly connects disparate systems, software stacks, clouds and data centers, allowing customers to architect the IT environment that best meets their needs, utilizing a mix of flash, disk and public and private cloud resources, all at the scale needed to accommodate the exponential data growth of the digital world. Customers can innovate faster by leveraging the scale of on-demand cloud capabilities while maintaining data visibility with a single, consistent view of data and infrastructure across clouds and on-premises resources. 
Earlier this month, we announced new data fabric solutions and services that maximize control and improve the secure movement of data across the hybrid cloud, along with updated versions of AltaVault, StorageGRID Webscale and SnapCenter technologies to help customers extract the value of their data from anywhere in the hybrid cloud. We expanded the use case for ONTAP cloud to include Microsoft Azure and announced cloud control for Microsoft Office 365, a simple way to control and protect critical data stored in Office 365 with support for data retention and cloud services such as Amazon S3 and Azure as well as on-premises storage. 
Additionally, we introduced NetApp Private Storage as a service, on OpEx-based consumption model available through a growing partner delivery ecosystem. We're engaging with a broader set of partners to help customers plan and evolve their hybrid cloud deployments to fit their changing business needs, and more and more customers and cloud service providers are choosing NetApp because we enable their hybrid cloud strategies. 
While Ron will go into depth about cost savings and capital allocation, I want to reemphasize our commitment to both priorities. At the start of the third quarter, we announced the reduction in force as part of our planned transformation and cost-reduction efforts. This action was taken in alignment with real structural changes to make our business more streamlined and agile. We are making substantial progress against $130 million cost-reduction goal net of reinvestment that we outlined on our Q3 fiscal year 2016 earnings call. We are on target and expect to achieve the remainder of savings through the normal course of business. I want to thank the NetApp team for remaining focused on execution while making difficult restructuring decisions.
We're pleased with our progress but still have more work ahead of us. We're advancing our product and solutions portfolio, evolving our ecosystem of partners, streamlining our business processes and enhancing our go-to-market model. We've sharpened our focus, accelerated our innovation and are funding the investments against the fastest-growing parts of the market like all-flash arrays, next-generation data centers and hybrid cloud solutions while accelerating our ability to deliver shareholder value in the form of improved profitability and cash flow. We're on track to return the company to long-term growth and to our target operating margin range, but we must remain focused and continue our disciplined execution. Our second quarter results and third quarter guidance are evidence that our strategy is working, and I am more confident than ever in the NetApp team's ability to successfully evolve the company for leadership in the data-powered digital era. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ron to walk through our Q2 financial performance and expectations for Q3. Ron?"

As a reminder, we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers today. 
As you heard from George, we continue to make significant progress toward our pivot to the growth areas of the market while at the same time transforming the company. Q2 marks another quarter of solid execution, albeit against a difficult year-over-year compare. Net revenues were at the midpoint of our guidance at $1.34 billion. This was an increase of approximately 3.5% sequentially and a decline of about 7% on a year-over-year basis. Product revenue of $710 million increased 7.5% sequentially and declined 13% year-over-year. As we've discussed, we expect the growth of our strategic solutions to improve our product revenue growth trajectory over the course of fiscal 2017. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenue of $630 million was relatively flat sequentially and year-over-year. 
Gross margin was 62.7% and within our guidance range. Product gross margin of 48.2% decreased about 3.5 points year-over-year and increased 1.5 points sequentially. Software maintenance gross margin was relatively flat sequentially and year-over-year, while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin increased just over 3 points year-over-year. 
Operating expenses of $636 million decreased 7% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, reflecting the benefit of our ongoing transformation efforts. Operating margin of 15.2% was above our guidance range, evidence of the progress we're making toward the operating margin range we guided for the year. 
Aligning our cost structure with the opportunities ahead remains my top priority. As I said on our last earnings call, part of the planned transformation efforts would include additional steps to permanently lower our cost structure, including headcount reductions. As such, on November 3, we initiated a reduction of approximately 6% of our worldwide headcount, which will result in a onetime charge of $50 million to $60 million primarily in Q3 fiscal 2017. This action will yield an annual run rate savings of approximately $130 million. 
As a reminder, we are driving to permanently reduce our cost structure across both cost of sales and OpEx. In Q3 '16, we announced our plan to reduce our cost structure by $400 million gross annualized by the end of fiscal 2017. We said some of those savings will be reinvested into strategic opportunities such as SolidFire and will yield a net run rate savings annually of roughly $130 million by the end of fiscal 2017. We have made meaningful progress against this plan by implementing tighter cost controls over indirect spending, improving supply chain efficiency, streamlining our product portfolio, evolving the business processes and reducing headcount. Given the progress we've made to-date, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our goal on schedule. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.3%. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 284 million. EPS of $0.60 was $0.04 over the high end of our guidance range, reflecting improved gross margin, lower operating expense and the benefit of our share repurchases. Our cash and balance sheet metrics remain healthy. We closed Q2 with $4.4 billion in cash and short-term investments with approximately 10% held by our domestic entities. We remain committed to completing by the end of May 2018 the remaining balance of our share repurchase program announced in February 2015. In Q2, we repurchased $117 million of our stock and paid approximately $52 million in cash dividends. Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.19 per share, which will be paid on January 25, 2017, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 6, 2017. 
Deferred and financed unearned services revenue was up 5% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Q2 cash flow from operations was $158 million, up 9% year-over-year. We generated free cash flow of $102 million, an increase of about 3% year-over-year. We are aggressively managing our working capital metrics: DSO, DPO and days of inventory outstanding. DSO were flat year-over-year while DPO increased by 8 days, and days of inventory outstanding improved by 3 days. As a result, our cash conversion cycle was 9 days, which was an improvement of 12 days year-over-year but 3 days longer sequentially due to the seasonal increase in DSO. 
Now on to guidance. As we outlined today, our transformation efforts are resulting in a stronger, more focused and agile company. We remain committed to driving productivity while at the same time continuing to shift our investment and focus toward the growth areas of the market. We are increasingly encouraged by the early signs of progress that we're seeing. While we still have work to do, we remain confident in our ability to continue to execute against the plans we outlined for fiscal 2017 on our Q1 earnings call. For Q3, we expect net revenues to range between $1.325 billion to $1.475 billion which, at the midpoint, implies a sequential increase of approximately 4% and a 1% increase year-over-year. We expect Q3 gross margin in the range of 61.5% to 62.5% and operating margin between 18% and 18.5%. And finally, we expect earnings per share for the third quarter to range from approximately $0.72 to $0.77 per share.
