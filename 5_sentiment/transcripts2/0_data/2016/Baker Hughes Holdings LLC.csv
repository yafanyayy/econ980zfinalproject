When we last spoke to you on May 3, we told you that we were focused on 3 objectives this year. First, we said we would reduce $500 million in costs by year-end by simplifying our organizational structure and rationalizing our operational footprint. Second, we said that we would focus on our core strengths and product innovation while building broader sales channel for our product and technology. And third, we announced plans to optimize our capital structure by paying down debt and buying back shares, while ensuring we maintain financial flexibility. In less than 3 months we've moved with urgency and made tremendous progress on all fronts. We restructured the company to remove significant costs and create a more nimble, efficient organization. Today, we are firmly on track to reach our savings targets. We redesigned the customer-facing areas of our business to better support our strategy of taking more new products to market faster and more efficiently. We fortified our full service business with enhancements to our operations and cell organization, and we've laid the groundwork to build new sales channels for direct sales. 
As Kimberly will describe, we have also made enormous progress on our capital structure in all 3 areas of focus. Today, I will share more details about what we have accomplished so far, how we are executing in the market to better position the company for success and our view of the industry outlook, including the opportunities we see for Baker Hughes. But first, I would like to give you an overview of our second quarter financial results. 
Our performance in the quarter was impacted by continued reductions in customer spending and activity, trends driven not only by the price of oil, but the volatility of those prices and the lack of clarity on the future. In looking back over the past few months, it's clear to me that the movement of oil prices has been driven more by one-off events, such as temporary supply disruptions, and not by a change in the fundamental underpinnings supply and demand. Therefore, I believe the industry will remain in a period of continued uncertainty, at least through the end of this year, until more foundational changes to supply and demand create a more stable environment for our customers to plan against. 
As a result of the continued supply demand imbalance globally, pricing for oil field services continued to erode in the second quarter. In light of these conditions, we are aggressively removing costs from all areas of our business consistent with the commitment we outlined in early May. As you can see from today's release, we implemented significant restructuring actions in the quarter to put us on track to meet our cost reduction targets. 
Regarding top line performance, our global sequential revenue was down 10% from the first quarter of the year versus a 19% decline in the global rig count during the same period. The most severe revenue decline was in North America, but we continue to see softness in most regions of the world. In spite of a challenging environment, our revenue outperformed the current rig count trends. While that is a positive, it is important to note that in these market conditions, revenue is less tightly correlated to active drilling rigs as customers place more emphasis on completion and production-related activities. 
Adjusted operating profit declined $209 million sequentially, as activity and pricing continued to pressure margins. In addition, we recorded large provisions on receivables, primarily related to Ecuador, which negatively impacted second quarter results. However, the cost reductions we implemented during the quarter will result in a positive impact on our margins for the second half of the year. 
Now that we have flexibility to move closely -- to more closely align our costs with market conditions, we have taken aggressive steps to do so, which will result in savings going forward. 
Since our Investor Call in early May, we've made other significant changes to the company. First, we restructured the leadership team and the resulting organizational design. This resulted in workforce reductions that, while difficult, are necessary to align our cost structure to the market. However, we have been able to retain a strong core talent and experience that's critical to our success today and going forward. The resulting organization is more efficient, agile and intensely focused, and our employees are energized about what we intend to accomplish. The reorganization, in addition to reducing costs, more strongly aligns our company's structure to supporting our overarching strategy, which is to take our technology to market faster and more efficiently through our full service model and a broader set of sales channels. These actions demonstrate the breadth, depth and speed of change across the entire company. Let me walk you through some of the changes. 
Consistent with our decision to focus on our core innovation strength, we consolidated our products and technology organizations into 2 team under our Art Soucy. Art's primary mandate is to get more new products to market faster and to ensure that they are aligned with the market realities and corresponding commercial opportunities. In this market, that means lower costs. It means lower costs fit for purpose products that are simplified and standardized, but also technically advanced products that bring leading-edge solutions to enable our customers to fundamentally reduce lifting costs. 
To accelerate the pace of new product launches, Art is driving a collaborative product development process that integrates manufacturing and reliability engineering with the vast capability of our design team. This process reduces product costs and development lead times, all while improving reliabilities. In the second half of this year, Art's team is committed to launching 60 products, the vast majority of which will lower cost and optimize production for our customers. For example, in the second quarter, we launched the Integrity eXplorer, an industry unique wireline service that is fast becoming the industry standard for accurate and reliable cement evaluation. This disruptive technology is enabled by electromagnetic acoustic sensors that deliver precise evaluation of any cement mixture in all borehole environments. When conventional technologies wrongly diagnose cement quality, operators are required to perform unnecessary remedial operations that cost them days of rig time and a lot of unplanned expenditures. Integrity eXplorer is the only product in the market that deploys this technology, and customer pool thus far has been exceptional. 
In next week, we will launch a new tiered artificial lift motor line designed to drive operational efficiency by improving reliability and lowering power consumption costs for our customers. This motor line is applicable for 90% of our core market, and the tiered offering provides the reliability factors and power efficiencies our customers demand, in both standard applications and in the harshest well environments. Some of the motor technology upgrades include an enhanced insulation system that allows higher horsepower per rotor, a larger diameter shaft for higher torque ratings, and a superior bearing system to minimize vibration. In addition, we've optimized rotor and stable geometries and applied our proprietary motor winding technology to create the industry's highest temperature rated, multi-sufficient downhole induction motor for our core markets. 
Next, to ensure we are capitalizing on the opportunities for that technology in the market, we consolidated and more tightly integrated our sales and operations teams under 1 global operations organization led by Belgacem Chariag. In doing, so we restructured 4 regions, encompassing more than 20 preview steel markets, into 1 organization, consisting of 9 geo markets. The result of the flatter, simpler and more responsive structure that will allow us to operate more efficiently. 
Global operations is responsible for both sales and operational execution, which form the cornerstone of our operations in more than 80 countries. Belgacem's objective are to achieve outstanding operational and HSE performance and increase both profitability and return on invested capital. 
I want to emphasize that the full-service model will remain our predominant commercial focus around the world. However, we also see an opportunity to develop new channels for our products and technology beyond the traditional approach. To that end, we created a commercial strategy organization led by Derek Mathieson, which is responsible for the long-range strategic planning for the company. That remit includes developing a broader range of sales channels for our product innovations. It also includes developing other Baker Hughes businesses, such as our Process and Pipeline Services business and our subsea production alliance with Aker Solutions to ensure they reach their full potential. 
Turning to expand the channels, we are making good progress and must line up on our direct sales business to local service providers. In essence, this means we will supply and grow a new set of customers beyond our traditional base. The interest levels we've seen so far and the potential opportunities we've identified are strong indications that we are going down the right path with the strategy that is right for Baker Hughes and will differentiate us in the market. 
While it will take some time to build critical mass to these channels, we are focused on winning in the market in the here and now. Our customers are intensely focused on reducing costs, maximizing production and increasing recoveries, all of which align with our strengths and competencies. Let me share with you how we are positioning Baker Hughes for the market opportunities we see today and on the horizon. 
We achieved some significant wins and milestones in the second quarter, where our technology and operational performance were cited as competitive differentiators. It's clear from our customers that they're very glad to have Baker Hughes firmly rooted in the market, doing what we do best. Several of these wins are cited in our release, but, in summary, we achieved significant awards or work expansions for intelligent production systems in Brazil, coiled tubing in the North Sea and drilling services in Russia. In addition, we secured a 5-year contract for completion systems in Kazakhstan, along with a 3-year completions in wellbore intervention award in Southeast Asia. In India, we won a 3-year drill bits contract, a 5-year drilling services contract in Kuwait and a 3-year artificial lift systems contract in Oman. 
We had numerous wins in upstream and downstream chemicals for contracts from customers ranging from North America to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. 
Our process and pipeline services business also earned a big win with a contract for Australia's it field, where we are currently pre-commissioning a new pipeline for service and will provide leak testing services for an additional 18 months for this liquid natural gas project. Out of 11 major pre-commissioning projects being conducted worldwide this year, Baker Hughes will perform 9 of them. 
In the Johann's field in the North sea, we are off to a great start on a large project for which we are providing drilling services, cementing, drilling fluids and completions. We started drilling 2 months ahead of schedule in March of this year and, by the end of June, we had completed 2 batch drilling campaigns and drilled and completed the first 3 wells in record time. We helped the customer reduce their budget and well time by 50%. 
I think it's also important to emphasize that when we define winning, we're not talking just about taking share. Our focus is on profitable growth and sufficient returns on capital investment. We've conducted an analysis of the competitive dynamics, market opportunities and our own profitability performance spanning more than 200 product line geo combinations. As a result of that review, we've begun the process of rationalizing certain product offerings in specific countries based on our objectives of profitable growth and return on invested capital. While these potential reductions represent less than 5% of our current revenue, they will have a positive impact on operating profitability. 
The point I'd  like to emphasize is, at Baker Hughes, product lines and geomarkets will earn their right to be in our portfolio. 
Along a similar vein, the last time we spoke, I provided our view on the U.S. land Pressure Pumping market, and I outlined the first phase of our new plans for this business, consolidating in 2 target basins, where the majority of activity and near-term growth is concentrated. We continue to believe this is the right approach for Baker Hughes given the continued pricing pressure, capital investment requirements and the large number of competitors serving this market. 
The first steps of our plan are well underway with the new management structure in place and operations consolidation taking place into those basins. As we prepare for the final stage of our plan, we continue to retain much of the operating structure in North America for this business while we evaluate our options to ensure we maximize shareholder value. 
I want to finish up with a bit more on the market outlook and the opportunities we see for Baker Hughes. As we said in May, in early May, we don't expect to see a meaningful recovery in the second half of the year, and that's still the case. While we see production as down, particularly in North America, that has been offset by additional production elsewhere. While our customers have substantially slowed, reduced or altogether canceled a large number of exploratory and field development campaigns, I have yet to see an economic catalyst that will create a step change to demand that will lead to materially higher oil prices. In addition, U.S. crude storage levels are at record highs, and there's a significant backlog of crude in the form of drilled but uncompleted or so called duck wells. On the demand side, growth is only forecasted to be modestly higher than expectations at the beginning of the year. In fact, the economic impact of recent events, such as the Brexit vote leading to a stronger dollar and significantly weaker British pound, has waited more uncertainty and historically has been a strong correlation between a strengthening dollar and a weakening oil price, which could continue to be an unfavorable headwind Many of our customers I speak to are standing path at today's oil prices and, yes, many say they will ramp activity as oil prices reach the $50 mark. However, like in past cycles, service sector cost will rise with increased activity and that will erode incremental cash margin for the operators. Accordingly, I believe oil prices in the upper 50s at a minimum are required for a sustainable recovery in North America. 
As we've mentioned previously, in North America, we expected an initial increase in activity in the drilled but uncompleted category, which today extends beyond 5,000 wells across the various basins. While completion schedules for these wells are estimated to ramp up as oil prices recover, the pace and speed of the increase will vary wildly across the available inventory, based on the well's economics. And a large number of docks are not economical at $50 oil prices. Regardless, with our strength in the artificial lift and production chemical product lines, this expected activity is a near-term opportunity for Baker Hughes. 
Despite a backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells to work through, we expect the North American rig count to increase modestly in the second half of 2016, driven by seasonal gains in Canada and a slight uptick in the U.S. market. I describe it as a slow grind upwards for North America. 
Internationally, we expect rig counts to continue slight declines in most countries for the second half of 2016. However, it's not a one size fits all outlook, as there are pockets of stability mix with pockets of declines. Markets in the Middle East and Russia Caspian are expected to be more resilient and may experience modest growth. The leading drilling and completions positions that we've built in these markets are likely to see the first surge in activity on the well construction side as conventional markets with lower lifting costs are the first to recover. 
We expect Deepwater activity to continue to decline. However, when this segment recovers, which we fully expect, we are well positioned with a substantial footprint in Deepwater markets, such as the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, North Sea and West Africa, with leading positions in drilling and completion services. In the meantime, with our customers focused on maximizing production, the new products coming out of our production chemicals business continue to drive market share gains in every Deepwater basin. 
To sum it up, I want to emphasize that we are making great progress on meeting our cost objectives. We've restructured the company to support our go-to-market strategy, and we are executing on that strategy decisively and with a sense of urgency. And I'm very optimistic about our road ahead. 
Now, let me turn it over to Kimberly."
19007,368371108,1015004,"Baker Hughes Incorporated, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Baker Hughes Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. As Martin mentioned, today, we reported revenue for the second quarter of $2.4 billion, down 10% sequentially, as a result of additional activity reductions and pricing pressures across all our geographic segmen",1358,"Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. As Martin mentioned, today, we reported revenue for the second quarter of $2.4 billion, down 10% sequentially, as a result of additional activity reductions and pricing pressures across all our geographic segments. On a GAAP basis, the net loss for the quarter was $911 million or $2.08 per share. The adjusted net loss for the second quarter was $392 million or $0.90 per share. Adjusted net loss excludes $519 million of after-tax adjusting items or $1.18 per share. These items on a pretax basis are: Goodwill impairment of $1.8 billion, of which $1.5 billion related to North America and $311 million to our Industrial Services segment; impairments and restructuring charges of $1.1 billion primarily related to impairments of fixed assets and intangibles, workforce reductions and contract terminations; inventory adjustments of $621 million related to writing off inventory; a charge for early extinguishment of debt of $142 million related primarily to the premium on the bonds we repurchased; merger and related costs of $78 million; and $262 million for income taxes on these items. These charges were partially offset by the collection of the merger termination fee of $3.5 billion and the reversal of a loss on farm purchase commitment of $51 million as a result of reaching a settlement this quarter. 
On the other hand, non-adjusted from our results are before tax charges related to: Provisions for doubtful accounts of $166 million, primarily in Ecuador, and valuation allowances on indirect taxes of $45 million largely in Africa. These charges reflect the ongoing challenges our industry is facing and the restructuring actions we have implemented to align our business to this market condition. These actions are expected to result in an estimated $450 million of annualized cost savings, with approximately 2/3 coming from compensation savings related to workforce reductions of 3,000 positions, which were completed this quarter, with the other 1/3 of the savings resulting from reduced depreciation and amortization expense associated with the impairment. While our cost reductions will continue in the second half of the year, the actions taken this quarter clearly puts us well underway to accomplish our annualized cost savings objectives of $500 million. 
The effective tax rate for the second quarter was a negative 20%. Our income tax rate has remained and will continue to remain volatile between the quarters, as a result of the geographic mix of earnings and certain discrete tax items. 
Our corporate costs were $29 million for the quarter, down $3 million sequentially. We expect these costs to remain in the low 30s for the rest of the year. 
Taking a closer look at our results from operations. In North America, revenue of $668 million decreased 18% sequentially against the backdrop of a 35% decline in the rig count. The decrease in revenue was driven primarily by reduced U.S. onshore activity and the seasonal spring breakup in Canada. We continued to experience pricing pressure during the quarter, although prices in some markets have begun to reach bottom. Adjusted operating losses for the quarter of $153 million improved sequentially by $21 million as the initial savings from impairments and restructuring actions more than offset the impact of reduced revenue. 
Moving to international results. We posted revenue of $1.5 billion, which is a 9% decrease versus the prior quarter. Our Latin America segment experienced largest top line decline as revenue dropped 15% sequentially. This was primarily driven by reduced offshore activity in Mexico, where the offshore rig count dropped an additional 32% sequentially, and reduced revenue in Ecuador, where we have substantially decreased activity with a local customer to avoid further collection risk. 
In the Middle East/Asia Pacific segment, revenue was down 9% sequentially, primarily as a result of weakening activity and pricing pressures in Asia Pacific, with the largest decline seen in Australia, where the rig count declined 50% sequentially. 
Lastly, our Europe/Africa/Russian Caspian segment was down 5% sequentially. Activity in pricing reductions, primarily in North Africa, Nigeria, the U.K. and Angola, were partially offset by the impact of favorable exchange rates in Europe and Russia and increased activity in the North Sea. 
International adjusted operating losses were $277 million, with operating margins down 1,664 basis points sequentially, which include 1,050 basis points sequential impact from provisions for doubtful account, mostly related to Ecuador, and valuation allowances on indirect taxes in Africa. And although we are taking provisions for these receivables, we continue to aggressively pursue collection. 
For our Industrial Services segment, revenue for the second quarter was $273 million, up 11% sequentially. Industrial Services, adjusted operating profit was $4 million [ph] , with operating margins increasing 310 basis points sequentially. The increase in revenue and margins was driven by the seasonal increase in activity in our pipeline inspection and maintenance business, partially offset by a 250 basis point margin impact from provision for doubtful accounts. 
Looking at cash flow and the balance sheet. During the quarter, we generated $3.6 billion in free cash flow, driven mainly by the collection of the $3.5 billion termination fee, while restructuring activities of $135 million paid during the quarter were funded from operations. At this time, the estimated net cash proceeds from the $3.5 billion termination fee have increased from $3 billion announced in May to approximately $3.4 billion, as we are able to utilize more tax attributes than previously anticipated. 
We are also well down the path of our announced plan to optimize our capital structure. First, we repurchased approximately 10.9 million shares on the open market, totaling $500 million. This leaves $1 billion remaining under our previously announced intention to repurchase $1.5 billion of shares, which we will continue to execute. 
Second, we have completed the purchase of $1 billion face value of outstanding bonds, which will result in $632 million in savings over the life of the bond. This represents $55 million of annualized interest savings, which will be above and beyond the $500 million cost reduction commitment. Also, as a result of this transaction, our total debt for the quarter declined by $1 billion, or 25% sequentially, to $3 billion, and we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 18%. As part of this transaction, during the quarter, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $142 million before tax. 
Third, in early July, we successfully refinanced our $2.5 billion credit facility, which was set to expire in September for a new 5-year term maturing in 2021. This untapped credit facility allows us to maintain additional financial flexibility if the right opportunity arises. 
After all this was said and done, we ended the second quarter with $3.9 billion of cash on the balance sheet. While not all of the cash is readily available, it provides us with ample liquidity to address the challenges and opportunities of the current market. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $70 million, down 19% sequentially. During this downturn, we have been extremely disciplined in our capital deployment and, going forward, we will continue to maintain the same rigor. As such, we expect our capital expenditures to range between $300 million and $400 million for the year. At the same time, we continue to invest widely in our core business to ensure we remain competitively well positioned while maximizing return on invested capital. I always say it's not necessarily about how much capital we spend, but more about the returns we get for the capital investments we make. 
Depreciation and amortization for the second quarter was $305 million, down 14% sequentially. The asset impairments recorded this quarter are expected to result in approximately $160 million of annualized depreciation and amortization savings. 
To sum it up, we had a lot of moving parts this quarter, but we've made great progress on the financial objectives we outlined in May. And while there is still work to be done, we are well positioned financially and strategically to manage through the challenges and to capitalize on the opportunities ahead. We are committed to generating positive cash flows by proactively managing our cost structure, reducing our working capital and maximizing return on invested capital. 
And with that, let's go to Q&A, Alondra."

And those were largely attributed to the write-off or the reserves that we took on both of those. We did overall, we had 9 days improvement, of which 7 days was essentially bad debt on the receivables side, so we continue to make progress on collecting the receivable. This is an area that we started last year being very focused on, because at the end of the day, I would say a sale is not a sale if you don't collect on it, it's a gift, and we're not in the business of gifting. So we really increased the discipline and having proactive discussions with our customers about collections. So obviously, there are many countries, especially when they're very dependent on oil, that are struggling in today's environment. We look at those. In some cases, the future look better when oil prices get better. In other cases, we see they might continue to have struggles. And so what I can't say is even write-down to myself is people are out talking to our customers and having a good sense about where they are. We obviously try to work with them as much as possible. But in some cases, we end up having to take provisions in our policies based on a time frame. So when we haven't been paid after a certain time frame, then we take provisions on those receivables. Not getting any easier right now. Think we have a pretty good full-court press on it from our side.

There is a skill set that's different from looking after a large NOC or an independent in North America, but that's a skill set that we're growing ourself. I think it's going to be a competency that as this category emerges, we are going to have a competency that's very much oriented to this sector. It's a very technical, but also very, very operations-driven customer base, unlike a traditional customer, James, like a Statoil or a Petrobras or Devon. These are us. These are folks that have generally been in our industry, and so the conversations are much more about partnerships. It's about what their challenges are themselves in terms it could be anything around compliance, HSE, maintenance schedules. So it's -- you'll see -- you would see sales people in this category be former types of heavy lifters within our operations. And the time frame on these is much longer than a transactional or a tender type of thing. These are probably 6-month time frames once the discussions start. And these guys get our folks and get our equipment in place. So I don't know if I my answer your question or not, but that's kind of the color I can provide."

It depends on the strength of the customer, the quality of their acreage and so forth. I think, as Kimberly said, internationally, it's a concerning environment. It's -- the cash flow, CapEx issue much more. It's a longer cycle nature of projects. I think until the view is more constructive, these guys are just going to just sit tight. Now, I think the Middle East is maybe a little bit different than that, it should be at worse flat to slightly up. And we have a large, large, very large OPEC open customer there that just announced a very ambitious plan to grow their production 30% by 2020. So that aside, as far as North America, I don't subscribe to the whole full commentary that I think gets thrown a lot around by your community. And I think the customers are going to need something that's coming in, vectoring in on around $60 or high 50s just because certain costs on our side are going to go up. And I just would feel a lot more confident that we see some stability well north of $55 before there's a lot of motivation to for us to be bringing back capital into North America."

When we last spoke to you on May 3, we told you that we were focused on 3 objectives this year. First, we said we would reduce $500 million in costs by year-end by simplifying our organizational structure and rationalizing our operational footprint. Second, we said that we would focus on our core strengths and product innovation while building broader sales channels for our product and technology. And third, we announced plans to optimize our capital structure by paying down debt and buying back shares, while ensuring we maintain financial flexibility. 
In less than 3 months, we've moved with urgency and have made  tremendous progress on all fronts. We restructured the company to remove significant costs and create a more nimble, efficient organization. Today, we are firmly on track to reach our savings targets. We redesigned the customer-facing areas of our business to better support our strategy of taking more new products to market faster and more efficiently. We fortified our full-service business with enhancements to our operations and sales organization, and we've laid the groundwork to build new sales channels for direct sales. As Kimberly will describe, we've also made enormous progress on our capital structure in all 3 areas of focus. 
Today, I will share more details about what we have accomplished so far, how we are executing in the market to better position the company for success and our view of the industry outlook, including the opportunities we see for Baker Hughes. But first, I would like to give you an overview of our second quarter financial results. Our performance in the quarter was impacted by continued reductions in customer spending and activity, trends driven not only by the price of oil, but the volatility of those prices and the lack of clarity on the future. 
In looking back over the past few months, it's clear to me that the movement of oil prices has been driven more by one-off events, such as temporary supply disruptions, and not by a change in the fundamental underpinning supply and demand. Therefore, I believe the industry will remain in a period of continued uncertainty, at least through the end of this year, until more foundational changes to supply and demand create a more stable environment for our customers to plan against. 
As a result of the continued supply/demand imbalance globally, pricing for oilfield services continued to erode in the second quarter. In light of these conditions, we are aggressively removing costs from all areas of our business, consistent with the commitment we outlined in early May. As you can see from today's release, we implemented significant restructuring actions in the quarter to put us on track to meet our cost-reduction targets. 
Regarding top line performance, our global sequential revenue was down 10% from the first quarter of the year versus a 19% decline in the global rig count during the same period. The most severe revenue decline was in North America, but we continue to see softness in most regions of the world. In spite of a challenging environment, our revenue outperformed the current rig count trends. While that is a positive, it is important to note that in these market conditions, revenue is less tightly correlated to active drilling rigs as customers place more emphasis on completion and production-related activities. 
Adjusted operating profit declined $209 million sequentially as activity and pricing continue to pressure margins. In addition, we recorded large provisions on receivables, primarily related to Ecuador, which negatively impacted second quarter results. However, the cost reductions we implemented during the quarter will result in a positive impact on our margins for the second half of the year. Now that we have flexibility to move closely -- to more closely align our costs with market conditions, we have taken aggressive steps to do so, which will result in savings going forward. 
Since our investor call in early May, we've made other significant changes to the company. First, we restructured the leadership team and the resulting organizational design. This resulted in workforce reductions that, while difficult, are necessary to align our cost structure to the market. However, we have been able to retain a strong core of talent and experience that's critical to our success today and going forward. The resulting organization is more efficient, agile and intensely focused, and our employees are energized about what we intend to accomplish. 
The reorganization, in addition to reducing costs, more strongly aligns our company structure to supporting our overarching strategy, which is to take our technology to market faster and more efficiently through our full-service model and a broader set of sales channels. These actions demonstrate the breadth, depth and speed of change across the entire company. 
Let me walk you through some of the changes. Consistent with our decision to focus on our core innovation strength, we consolidated our products and technology organizations into one team under our Art Soucy. Art's primary mandate is to get more new products to market faster and to ensure that they're aligned with the market realities and corresponding commercial opportunities. In this market, that means lower costs. It means lower cost fit for purpose products that are simplified and standardized, but also technically advanced products that bring leading-edge solutions to enable our customers to fundamentally reduce lifting costs. 
To accelerate the pace of new product launches, Art is driving a collaborative product development process that integrates manufacturing and reliability engineering with the vast capability of our design team. This process reduces product cost and development lead times all while improving reliabilities. In the second half of this year, Art's team is committed to launching 60 products, the vast of -- the vast majority of which will lower cost and optimize production for our customers. 
For example, in the second quarter, we launched the Integrity eXplorer, an industry unique wireline service that is fast becoming the industry standard for accurate and reliable cement evaluation. This disruptive technology is enabled by electromagnetic acoustic sensors that deliver precise evaluation of any cement mixture in all borehole environments. When conventional technologies wrongly diagnose cement quality, operators are required to perform unnecessary remedial operations that cost them days of rig time and a lot of unplanned expenditures. Integrity eXplorer is the only product in the market that deploys this technology, and customer pull, thus far, has been exceptional. 
And next week, we will launch a new tiered artificial lift motor line designed to drive operational efficiency by improving reliability and lowering power consumption costs for our customers. This motor line is applicable for 90% of our core market, and the tiered offering provides the reliability factors and power efficiencies our customers demand in both standard applications and in the harshest well environments. Some of the motor technology upgrades include an enhanced insulation system that allows higher horsepower per rotor, a larger diameter shaft for higher torque ratings and a superior bearing system to minimize vibration. In addition, we've optimized rotor and stator geometries and applied our proprietary motor-winding technology to create the industry's highest temperature-rated, multi-sufficient downhole induction motor for our core markets. 
Next, to ensure we're capitalizing on the opportunities for that technology in the market, we consolidated and more tightly integrated our sales and operations teams under one global operations organization led by Belgacem Chariag. In doing so, we restructured 4 regions encompassing more than 20 previous steel markets into one organization consisting of 9 geomarkets. The result is a flatter, simpler and more responsive structure that will allow us to operate more efficiently. 
Global operations is responsible for both sales and operational execution, which form the cornerstone of our operations in more than 80 countries. Belgacem's objectives are to achieve outstanding operational and HSE performance and increase both profitability and return on invested capital. 
I want to emphasize that the full-service model will remain our predominant commercial focus around the world. However, we also see an opportunity to develop new channels for our products and technology beyond the traditional approach. To that end, we created a commercial strategy organization led by Derek Mathieson, which is responsible for the long-range strategic planning for the company. That remit includes developing a broader range of sales channels for our product innovations. It also includes developing other Baker Hughes businesses, such as our Process and Pipeline Services business and our subsea production alliance with Aker Solutions to ensure they reach their full potential. 
Turning to expanded channels. We're making good progress in muscling up on our direct sales business to local service providers. In essence, this means we will supply and grow a new set of customers beyond our traditional base. The interest levels we've seen so far and the potential opportunities we've identified are strong indications that we are going down the right path with a strategy that is right for Baker Hughes and will differentiate us in the market. 
While it will take some time to build critical mass to these channels, we're focused on winning in the market in the here and now. Our customers are intensely focused on reducing costs, maximizing production and increasing recoveries, all of which align with our strengths and competencies. 
Let me share with you how we're positioning Baker Hughes for the market opportunities we see today and on the horizon. We achieved some significant wins and milestones in the second quarter, where our technology and operational performance were cited as competitive differentiators. It's clear from our customers that they're very glad to have Baker Hughes firmly rooted in the market doing what we do best. 
Several of these wins are cited in our release, but in summary, we achieved significant awards or work expansions for intelligent production systems in Brazil, coiled tubing in the North Sea and drilling services in Russia. In addition, we secured a 5-year contract for completion systems in Kazakhstan, along with a 3-year completions and wellbore intervention award in Southeast Asia. In India, we won a 3-year drill bits contract, a 5-year drilling services contract in Kuwait and a 3-year artificial lift systems contract in Oman. We had numerous wins in upstream and downstream chemicals for contracts from customers ranging from North America to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. 
Our Process and Pipeline Services business also earned a big win with a contract for Australia's Ichthys field, where we are currently pre-commissioning a new pipeline for service and will provide leak testing services for an additional 18 months for this liquid natural gas project. Out of 11 major pre-commissioning projects being conducted worldwide this year, Baker Hughes will perform 9 of them. 
In the Johan Sverdrup field in the North sea, we are off to a great start on a large project for which we're providing drilling services, cementing, drilling fluids and completions. We started drilling 2 months ahead of schedule in March of this year, and by the end of June, we had completed 2 batch drilling campaigns and drilled and completed the first 3 wells in record time. We helped the customer reduce their budget and well time by 50%. 
I think it's also important to emphasize that when we define winning, we're not talking just about taking share. Our focus is on profitable growth and sufficient returns on capital investment. 
We've conducted an analysis of the competitive dynamics, market opportunities and our own profitability performance spanning more than 200 product line geo combinations. As a result of that review, we've begun the process of rationalizing certain product offerings in specific countries based on our objectives of profitable growth and return on invested capital. While these potential reductions represent less than 5% of our current revenue, they will have a positive impact on operating profitability. The point I'd like to emphasize is, at Baker Hughes, product lines and geomarkets will earn their right to be in our portfolio. 
Along a similar vein, the last time we spoke, I provided our view of the U.S. land pressure pumping market, and I outlined the first phase of our new plan for this business, consolidating in 2 target basins, where the majority of activity and near-term growth is concentrated. We continue to believe this is the right approach for Baker Hughes, given the continued pricing pressure, capital investment requirements and the large number of competitors serving this market. The first steps of our plan are well underway with the new management structure in place and operations consolidation taking place into those basins. As we prepare for the final stage of our plan, we continue to retain much of the operating structure in North America for this business while we evaluate our options to ensure we maximize shareholder value. 
I want to finish up with a bit more on the market outlook and the opportunities we see for Baker Hughes. As we said in May, in early May, we don't expect to see a meaningful recovery in the second half of the year, and that's still the case. While we've seen production edge down, particularly in North America, that has been offset by additional production elsewhere. While our customers have substantially slowed, reduced or altogether canceled a large number of exploratory and field development campaigns, I have yet to see an economic catalyst that will create a step change to demand that would lead to materially higher oil prices. In addition, U.S. crude storage levels are at record highs, and there's a significant backlog of crude in the form of drilled but uncompleted or so-called duck wells. 
On the demand side, growth is only forecasted to be modestly higher than expectations at the beginning of the year. In fact, the economic impact of recent events, such as the Brexit vote leading to a stronger dollar and significantly weaker British pound, has created more uncertainty, and historically, there's been a strong correlation between a strengthening dollar and a weakening oil price, which could continue to be an unfavorable headwind. 
Many of our customers I speak to are standing pat at today's oil prices and, yes, many say they will ramp activity as oil prices reach the $50 mark. However, like in past cycles, service sector cost will rise with increased activity and that will erode incremental cash margins for the operators. Accordingly, I believe oil prices in the upper $50s, at a minimum, are required for a sustainable recovery in North America. 
As we mentioned previously, in North America, we expect an initial increase in activity in the drilled but uncompleted category, which, today, extends beyond 5,000 wells across the various basins. While completion schedules for these wells are estimated to ramp up as oil prices recover, the pace and speed of the increase will vary wildly across the available inventory, based on the well's economics, and a large number of docks are not economical at $50 oil prices. Regardless, with our strength in the artificial lift and production chemical product lines, this expected activity is a near-term opportunity for Baker Hughes. 
Despite a backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells to work through, we expect the North American rig count to increase modestly in the second half of 2016, driven by seasonal gains in Canada and a slight uptick in the U.S. market. I describe it as a slow grind upwards for North America. 
Internationally, we expect rig counts to continue slight declines in most countries for the second half of 2016. However, it's not a one size fits all outlook as there are pockets of stability mixed with pockets of declines. Markets in the Middle East and Russia Caspian are expected to be more resilient and may experience modest growth. The leading drilling and completions positions that we've built in these markets are likely to see the first surge in activity on the well construction side as conventional markets with lower lifting costs are the first to recover. 
We expect deepwater activity to continue to decline. However, when this segment recovers, which we fully expect, we are well positioned with a substantial footprint in deepwater markets, such as the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, North Sea and West Africa, with leading positions in drilling and completion services. In the meantime, with our customers focused on maximizing production, the new products coming out of our production chemicals business continue to drive market share gains in every deepwater basin. 
To sum it up, I want to emphasize that we're making great progress on meeting our cost objectives. We've restructured the company to support our go-to-market strategy, and we are executing on that strategy decisively and with a sense of urgency. And I'm very optimistic about our road ahead. 
Now let me turn it over to Kimberly."
19007,368371108,1015282,"Baker Hughes Incorporated, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Baker Hughes Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. As Martin mentioned, today, we reported revenue for the second quarter of $2.4 billion, down 10% sequentially, as a result of additional activity reductions and pricing pressures across all our geographic segmen",1355,"Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. As Martin mentioned, today, we reported revenue for the second quarter of $2.4 billion, down 10% sequentially, as a result of additional activity reductions and pricing pressures across all our geographic segments. 
On a GAAP basis, the net loss for the quarter was $911 million or $2.08 per share. The adjusted net loss for the second quarter was $392 million or $0.90 per share. Adjusted net loss excludes $519 million of after tax adjusting items or $1.18 per share. These items on a pretax basis are: goodwill impairment of $1.8 billion, of which $1.5 billion related to North America and $311 million to our Industrial Services segment; impairments and restructuring charges of $1.1 billion primarily related to impairments of fixed assets and intangibles, workforce reductions and contract termination; inventory adjustments of $621 million related to writing off inventory; a charge for early extinguishment of debt of $142 million related primarily to the premium on the bonds we repurchased; merger and related costs of $78 million; and $262 million for income taxes on these items. These charges were partially offset by the collection of the merger termination fee of $3.5 billion and the reversal of a loss on firm purchase commitment of $51 million as result of reaching a settlement this quarter. 
On the other hand, non-adjusted from our results are before tax charges related to provisions for doubtful accounts of $166 million, primarily in Ecuador, and valuation allowances on indirect taxes of $45 million, largely in Africa. These charges reflect the ongoing challenges our industry is facing and the restructuring actions we have implemented to align our business to this market condition. These actions are expected to result in an estimated $450 million of annualized cost savings with approximately 2/3 coming from compensation savings related to workforce reductions of 3,000 positions, which were completed this quarter, with the other 1/3 of the savings resulting from reduced depreciation and amortization expense associated with the impairment. While our cost reductions will continue in the second half of the year, the actions taken this quarter clearly puts us well underway to accomplish our annualized cost savings objectives of $500 million. 
The effective tax rate for the second quarter was a negative 20%. Our income tax rate has remained and will continue to remain volatile between the quarters as a result of the geographic mix of earnings and certain discrete tax item. Our corporate costs were $29 million for the quarter, down $3 million sequentially. We expect these costs to remain in the low 30s for the rest of the year. 
Taking a closer look at our results from operations. In North America, revenue of $668 million decreased 18% sequentially against the backdrop of a 35% decline in the rig count. The decrease in revenue was driven primarily by reduced U.S. onshore activity and the seasonal spring breakup in Canada. We continue to experience pricing pressure during the quarter, although prices in some markets have begun to reach bottom. Adjusted operating losses for the quarter of $153 million improved sequentially by $21 million as the initial savings from impairments and restructuring actions more than offset the impact of reduced revenue. 
Moving to international results. We posted revenue of $1.5 billion, which is 9 -- a 9% decrease versus the prior quarter. Our Latin America segment experienced largest top line decline as revenue dropped 15% sequentially. This was primarily driven by reduced offshore activity in Mexico, where the offshore rig count dropped an additional 32% sequentially, and reduced revenue in Ecuador, where we have substantially decreased activity with a local customer to avoid further collection risk. 
In the Middle East/Asia Pacific segment, revenue was down 9% sequentially primarily as a result of weakening activity and pricing pressures in Asia Pacific with the largest decline seen in Australia, where the rig count declined 50% sequentially. 
Lastly, our Europe/Africa/Russian Caspian segment was down 5% sequentially. Activity in pricing reductions, primarily in North Africa, Nigeria, the U.K. and Angola, were partially offset by the impact of favorable exchange rates in Europe and Russia and increased activity in the North Sea. 
International adjusted operating losses were $277 million with operating margins down 1,664 basis points sequentially, which include 1,050 basis points sequential impact from provisions for doubtful account, mostly related to Ecuador, and valuation allowances on indirect taxes in Africa. And although we're taking provisions for these receivables, we continue to aggressively pursue collection. 
For our Industrial Services segment, revenue for the second quarter was $273 million, up 11% sequentially. Industrial Services adjusted operating profit was $4 million with operating margins increasing 310 basis points sequentially. The increase in revenue and margins was driven by the seasonal increase in activity in our pipeline inspection and maintenance business, partially offset by a 250 basis point margin impact from provision for doubtful account. 
Looking at cash flow and the balance sheet. During the quarter, we generated $3.6 billion in free cash flow driven mainly by the collection of the $3.5 billion termination fee while restructuring activities of $135 million paid during the quarter were funded from operations. At this time, the estimated net cash proceeds from the $3.5 billion termination fee have increased from $3 billion announced in May to approximately $3.4 billion as we were able to utilize more tax attributes than previously anticipated. 
We're also well down the path of our announced plan to optimize our capital structure. First, we repurchased approximately 10.9 million shares on the open market totaling $500 million. This leaves $1 billion remaining under our previously announced intention to repurchase $1.5 billion of shares, which we will continue to execute. 
Second, we have completed the purchase of $1 billion face value of outstanding bonds, which will result in $632 million in savings over the life of the bond. This represents $55 million of annualized interest savings, which will be above and beyond the $500 million cost-reduction commitment. Also, as a result of this transaction, our total debt for the quarter declined by $1 billion or 25% sequentially to $3 billion, and we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 18%. As part of this transaction, during the quarter, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $142 million before tax. 
Third, in early July, we successfully refinanced our $2.5 billion credit facility, which was set to expire in September for a new 5-year term maturing in 2021. This untapped credit facility allows us to maintain additional financial flexibility if the right opportunity arises. 
After all this was said and done, we ended the second quarter with $3.9 billion of cash on the balance sheet. While not all of the cash is readily available, it provides us with ample liquidity to address the challenges and opportunities of the current market. 
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $70 million, down 19% sequentially. During this downturn, we have been extremely disciplined in our capital deployment, and going forward, we will continue to maintain the same rigor. As such, we expect our capital expenditures to range between $300 million and $400 million for the year. 
At the same time, we continue to invest widely in our core business to ensure we remain competitively well positioned while maximizing return on invested capital. I always say it's not necessarily about how much capital we spend, but more about the returns we get for the capital investments we make. 
Depreciation and amortization for the second quarter were $305 million, down 14% sequentially. The asset impairments recorded this quarter are expected to result in approximately $160 million of annualized depreciation and amortization saving. 
To sum it up, we had a lot of moving parts this quarter, but we've made great progress on the financial objectives we outlined in May. And while there is still work to be done, we are well positioned financially and strategically to manage through the challenges and to capitalize on the opportunities ahead. We are committed to generating positive cash flows by proactively managing our cost structure, reducing our working capital and maximizing return on invested capital. 
And with that, let's go to Q&A, Alondra."

We did -- overall, we had 9 days improvement, of which 7 days was essentially bad debt on the receivables side. So we continue to make progress on collecting the receivable. This is an area that we started last year being very focused on, because at the end of the day, I would say a sale is not a sale if you don't collect on it. It's a gift, and we're really not in the business of gifting. So we really increased the discipline and having proactive discussions with our customers about collections. So obviously, there are many countries, especially when they're very dependent on oil, that are struggling in today's environment. We look at those. In some cases, the future will look better when oil prices get better. In other cases, we see that they might continue to have struggles. And so what I can say is -- even right down to myself is people are out talking to our customers and having a good sense about where they are, and we obviously try to work with them as much as possible. But in some cases is we end up having to take provisions in our policies based on a time frame. So when we haven't been paid after a certain time frame, then we take provisions on those receivables.

It depends with the strength of the customer, the quality of their acreage and so forth. I think as Kimberly said, internationally, it's a concerning environment. It's the cash flow, CapEx issue, much more. It's a longer cycle nature of projects. I think until the view's more constructive, these guys are just going to just sit tight. Now I think the Middle East is maybe a little bit different than that. It should be, at worse, flat to slightly up, and we have a large, large, very large OPEC open customer there that just announced a very ambitious plan to grow their production 30% by 2020. So that aside, as far as North America, I don't subscribe to the hopeful commentary that I think gets thrown around a lot by your community. And I think that the customers are going to need something that's coming in, vectoring in on around $60 or high $50s just because certain costs on our side are going to go up, and I just would feel a lot more confident that we see some stability well north of $55 before there's a lot of motivation to -- for us to be bringing back capital into North America."

When we last spoke to you on May 3, we told you that we were focused on 3 objectives this year. First, we said we would reduce $500 million in costs by year-end by simplifying our organizational structure and rationalizing our operational footprint. Second, we said that we would focus on our core strengths and product innovation while building broader sales channels for our product and technology. And third, we announced plans to optimize our capital structure by paying down debt and buying back shares, while ensuring we maintain financial flexibility. 
In less than 3 months, we've moved with urgency and have made tremendous progress on all fronts. We restructured the company to remove significant costs and create a more nimble, efficient organization. Today, we are firmly on track to reach our savings targets. We redesigned the customer-facing areas of our business to better support our strategy of taking more new products to market faster and more efficiently. We fortified our full-service business with enhancements to our operations and sales organization, and we've laid the groundwork to build new sales channels for direct sales. As Kimberly will describe, we have also made enormous progress on our capital structure in all 3 areas of focus. 
Today, I will share more details about what we have accomplished so far, how we are executing in the market to better position the company for success and our view of the industry outlook, including the opportunities we see for Baker Hughes. But first, I would like to give you an overview of our second quarter financial results. Our performance in the quarter was impacted by continued reductions in customer spending and activity, trends driven not only by the price of oil, but the volatility of those prices and the lack of clarity on the future. 
In looking back over the past few months, it's clear to me that the movement of oil prices has been driven more by one-off events, such as temporary supply disruptions, and not by a change in the fundamentals underpinning supply and demand. Therefore, I believe the industry will remain in a period of continued uncertainty, at least through the end of this year, until more foundational changes to supply and demand create a more stable environment for our customers to plan against. 
As a result of the continued supply/demand imbalance globally, pricing for oilfield services continued to erode in the second quarter. In light of these conditions, we are aggressively removing costs from all areas of our business, consistent with the commitment we outlined in early May. As you can see from today's release, we implemented significant restructuring actions in the quarter to put us on track to meet our cost-reduction targets. 
Regarding top line performance, our global sequential revenue was down 10% from the first quarter of the year versus a 19% decline in the global rig count during the same period. The most severe revenue decline was in North America, but we continue to see softness in most regions of the world. In spite of a challenging environment, our revenue outperformed the current rig count trends. While that is a positive, it is important to note that in these market conditions, revenue is less tightly correlated to active drilling rigs as customers place more emphasis on completion and production-related activities. 
Adjusted operating profit declined $209 million sequentially as activity and pricing continued to pressure margins. In addition, we recorded large provisions on receivables, primarily related to Ecuador, which negatively impacted second quarter results. However, the cost reductions we implemented during the quarter will result in a positive impact on our margins for the second half of the year. Now that we have flexibility to move closely -- to more closely align our costs with market conditions, we have taken aggressive steps to do so, which will result in savings going forward. 
Since our investor call in early May, we've made other significant changes to the company. First, we restructured the leadership team and the resulting organizational design. This resulted in workforce reductions that, while difficult, are necessary to align our cost structure to the market. However, we have been able to retain a strong core of talent and experience that's critical to our success today and going forward. The resulting organization is more efficient, agile and intensely focused, and our employees are energized about what we intend to accomplish. The reorganization, in addition to reducing costs, more strongly aligns our company structure to supporting our overarching strategy, which is to take our technology to market faster and more efficiently through our full-service model and a broader set of sales channels. These actions demonstrate the breadth, depth and speed of change across the entire company. 
Let me walk you through some of the changes. Consistent with our decision to focus on our core innovation strength, we consolidated our products and technology organizations into one team under our Art Soucy. Art's primary mandate is to get more new products to market faster and to ensure that they're aligned with the market realities and corresponding commercial opportunities. In this market, that means lower costs. It means lower cost fit for purpose products that are simplified and standardized, but also technically advanced products that bring leading-edge solutions to enable our customers to fundamentally reduce lifting costs. 
To accelerate the pace of new product launches, Art is driving a collaborative product development process that integrates manufacturing and reliability engineering with the vast capability of our design team. This process reduces product cost and development lead times, all while improving reliability. In the second half of this year, Art's team is committed to launching 60 products, the vast majority of which will lower cost and optimize production for our customers. 
For example, in the second quarter, we launched the Integrity eXplorer, an industry unique wireline service that is fast becoming the industry standard for accurate and reliable cement evaluation. This disruptive technology is enabled by electromagnetic acoustic sensors that deliver precise evaluation of any cement mixture in all borehole environments. When conventional technologies wrongly diagnose cement quality, operators are required to perform unnecessary remedial operations that cost them days of rig time and a lot of unplanned expenditures. Integrity eXplorer is the only product in the market that deploys this technology, and customer pool, thus far, has been exceptional. 
And next week, we will launch a new tiered artificial lift motor line designed to drive operational efficiency by improving reliability and lowering power consumption costs for our customers. This motor line is applicable for 90% of our core market, and the tiered offering provides the reliability factors and power efficiencies our customers demand in both standard applications and in the harshest well environments. Some of the motor technology upgrades include an enhanced insulation system that allows higher horsepower per rotor, a larger diameter shaft for higher torque ratings and a superior bearing system to minimize vibration. In addition, we've optimized rotor and stator geometries and applied our proprietary motor-winding technology to create the industry's highest temperature-rated, most efficient downhole induction motor for our core markets. 
Next, to ensure we're capitalizing on the opportunities for that technology in the market, we consolidated and more tightly integrated our sales and operations teams under one global operations organization led by Belgacem Chariag. In doing so, we restructured 4 regions encompassing more than 20 previous steel markets into one organization consisting of 9 geomarkets. The result is a flatter, simpler and more responsive structure that will allow us to operate more efficiently. Global operations is responsible for both sales and operational execution, which form the cornerstone of our operations in more than 80 countries. Belgacem's objectives are to achieve outstanding operational and HSE performance and increase both profitability and return on invested capital. 
I want to emphasize that the full-service model will remain our predominant commercial focus around the world. However, we also see an opportunity to develop new channels for our products and technology beyond the traditional approach. To that end, we created a commercial strategy organization led by Derek Mathieson, which is responsible for the long-range strategic planning for the company. That remit includes developing a broader range of sales channels for our product innovations. It also includes developing other Baker Hughes businesses, such as our Process and Pipeline Services business and our subsea production alliance with Aker Solutions to ensure they reach their full potential. 
Turning to expanded channels. We're making good progress in muscling up on our direct sales business to local service providers. In essence, this means we will supply and grow a new set of customers beyond our traditional base. The interest levels we've seen so far and the potential opportunities we've identified are strong indications that we are going down the right path with a strategy that is right for Baker Hughes and will differentiate us in the market. While it will take some time to build critical mass to these channels, we're focused on winning in the market in the here and now. Our customers are intensely focused on reducing costs, maximizing production and increasing recoveries, all of which align with our strengths and competencies. 
Let me share with you how we're positioning Baker Hughes for the market opportunities we see today and on the horizon. We achieved some significant wins and milestones in the second quarter, where our technology and operational performance were cited as competitive differentiators. It's clear from our customers that they're very glad to have Baker Hughes firmly rooted in the market doing what we do best. 
Several of these wins are cited in our release, but in summary, we achieved significant awards or work expansions for intelligent production systems in Brazil, coiled tubing in the North Sea and drilling services in Russia. In addition, we secured a 5-year contract for completion systems in Kazakhstan, along with a 3-year completions and wellbore intervention award in Southeast Asia. In India, we won a 3-year drill bits contract, a 5-year drilling services contract in Kuwait and a 3-year artificial lift systems contract in Oman. We had numerous wins in upstream and downstream chemicals for contracts from customers ranging from North America to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. 
Our Process and Pipeline Services business also earned a big win with a contract for Australia's Ichthys field, where we are currently pre-commissioning a new pipeline for service and will provide leak testing services for an additional 18 months for this liquid natural gas project. Out of 11 major pre-commissioning projects being conducted worldwide this year, Baker Hughes will perform 9 of them. 
In the Johan Sverdrup field in the North Sea, we are off to a great start on a large project for which we're providing drilling services, cementing, drilling fluids and completions. We started drilling 2 months ahead of schedule in March of this year, and by the end of June, we had completed 2 batch drilling campaigns and drilled and completed the first 3 wells in record time. We helped the customer reduce their budget and well time by 50%. 
I think it's also important to emphasize that when we define winning, we're not talking just about taking share. Our focus is on profitable growth and sufficient returns on capital investment.  We've conducted an analysis of the competitive dynamics, market opportunities and our own profitability performance spanning more than 200 product line geo combinations. As a result of that review, we've begun the process of rationalizing certain product offerings in specific countries based on our objectives of profitable growth and return on invested capital. While these potential reductions represent less than 5% of our current revenue, they will have a positive impact on operating profitability. The point I'd like to emphasize is, at Baker Hughes, product lines and geomarkets will earn their right to be in our portfolio. 
Along a similar vein, the last time we spoke, I provided our view of the U.S. land pressure pumping market, and I outlined the first phase of our new plan for this business, consolidating in 2 target basins, where the majority of activity and near-term growth is concentrated. We continue to believe this is the right approach for Baker Hughes, given the continued pricing pressure, capital investment requirements and the large number of competitors serving this market. The first steps of our plan are well underway with the new management structure in place and operations consolidation taking place into those basins. As we prepare for the final stage of our plan, we continue to retain much of the operating structure in North America for this business while we evaluate our options to ensure we maximize shareholder value. 
I want to finish up with a bit more on the market outlook and the opportunities we see for Baker Hughes. As we said in May, in early May, we don't expect to see a meaningful recovery in the second half of the year, and that's still the case. While we've seen production edge down, particularly in North America, that has been offset by additional production elsewhere. While our customers have substantially slowed, reduced or altogether canceled a large number of exploratory and field development campaigns, I have yet to see an economic catalyst that will create a step change to demand that would lead to materially higher oil prices. In addition, U.S. crude storage levels are at record highs, and there's a significant backlog of crude in the form of drilled but uncompleted or so-called DUC wells. 
On the demand side, growth is only forecasted to be modestly higher than expectations at the beginning of the year. In fact, the economic impact of recent events, such as the Brexit vote leading to a stronger dollar and significantly weaker British pound, has created more uncertainty, and historically, there's been a strong correlation between a strengthening dollar and a weakening oil price, which could continue to be an unfavorable headwind. Many of our customers I speak to are standing pat at today's oil prices and, yes, many say they will ramp activity as oil prices reach the $50 mark. However, like in past cycles, service sector cost will rise with increased activity and that will erode incremental cash margins for the operators. Accordingly, I believe oil prices in the upper $50s, at a minimum, are required for a sustainable recovery in North America. 
As we mentioned previously, in North America, we expect an initial increase in activity in the drilled but uncompleted category, which, today, extends beyond 5,000 wells across the various basins. While completion schedules for these wells are estimated to ramp up as oil prices recover, the pace and speed of the increase will vary wildly across the available inventory, based on the well's economics, and a large number of DUCs are not economical at $50 oil prices. Regardless, with our strength in the artificial lift and production chemical product lines, this expected activity is a near-term opportunity for Baker Hughes. Despite a backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells to work through, we expect the North American rig count to increase modestly in the second half of 2016, driven by seasonal gains in Canada and a slight uptick in the U.S. market. I describe it as a slow grind upwards for North America. 
Internationally, we expect rig counts to continue slight declines in most countries for the second half of 2016. However, it's not a one size fits all outlook as there are pockets of stability mixed with pockets of declines. Markets in the Middle East and Russia Caspian are expected to be more resilient and may experience modest growth. The leading drilling and completions positions that we've built in these markets are likely to see the first surge in activity on the well construction side as conventional markets with lower lifting costs are the first to recover. 
We expect deepwater activity to continue to decline. However, when this segment recovers, which we fully expect, we are well positioned with a substantial footprint in deepwater markets, such as the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, North Sea and West Africa, with leading positions in drilling and completion services. In the meantime, with our customers focused on maximizing production, the new products coming out of our production chemicals business continue to drive market share gains in every deepwater basin. 
To sum it up, I want to emphasize that we're making great progress on meeting our cost objectives. We've restructured the company to support our go-to-market strategy, and we are executing on that strategy decisively and with a sense of urgency. And I'm very optimistic about our road ahead. 
Now let me turn it over to Kimberly."
19007,368371108,1015548,"Baker Hughes Incorporated, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Baker Hughes Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. As Martin mentioned, today, we reported revenue for the second quarter of $2.4 billion, down 10% sequentially, as a result of additional activity reductions and pricing pressures across all our geographic segmen",1356,"Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. As Martin mentioned, today, we reported revenue for the second quarter of $2.4 billion, down 10% sequentially, as a result of additional activity reductions and pricing pressures across all our geographic segments. 
On a GAAP basis, the net loss for the quarter was $911 million or $2.08 per share. The adjusted net loss for the second quarter was $392 million or $0.90 per share. Adjusted net loss excludes $519 million of after tax adjusting items or $1.18 per share. These items on a pretax basis are: goodwill impairment of $1.8 billion, of which $1.5 billion related to North America and $311 million to our Industrial Services segment; impairments and restructuring charges of $1.1 billion primarily related to impairments of fixed assets and intangibles, workforce reductions and contract termination; inventory adjustments of $621 million related to writing off inventory; a charge for early extinguishment of debt of $142 million related primarily to the premium on the bonds we repurchased; merger and related costs of $78 million; and $262 million for income taxes on these items. These charges were partially offset by the collection of the merger termination fee of $3.5 billion and the reversal of a loss on firm purchase commitments of $51 million as result of reaching a settlement this quarter. 
On the other hand, non-adjusted from our results are before tax charges related to provisions for doubtful accounts of $166 million, primarily in Ecuador, and valuation allowances on indirect taxes of $45 million, largely in Africa. These charges reflect the ongoing challenges our industry is facing and the restructuring actions we have implemented to align our business to these market conditions. These actions are expected to result in an estimated $450 million of annualized cost savings with approximately 2/3 coming from compensation savings related to workforce reductions of 3,000 positions, which were completed this quarter, with the other 1/3 of the savings resulting from reduced depreciation and amortization expense associated with the impairment. While our cost reductions will continue in the second half of the year, the actions taken this quarter clearly puts us well underway to accomplish our annualized cost savings objectives of $500 million. 
The effective tax rate for the second quarter was a negative 20%. Our income tax rate has remained and will continue to remain volatile between the quarters as a result of the geographic mix of earnings and certain discrete tax item. Our corporate costs were $29 million for the quarter, down $3 million sequentially. We expect these costs to remain in the low 30s for the rest of the year. 
Taking a closer look at our results from operations. In North America, revenue of $668 million decreased 18% sequentially against the backdrop of a 35% decline in the rig count. The decrease in revenue was driven primarily by reduced U.S. onshore activity and the seasonal spring breakup in Canada. We continued to experience pricing pressure during the quarter, although prices in some markets have begun to reach bottom. Adjusted operating losses for the quarter of $153 million improved sequentially by $21 million as the initial savings from impairments and restructuring actions more than offset the impact of reduced revenue. 
Moving to international results. We posted revenue of $1.5 billion, which is 9 -- a 9% decrease versus the prior quarter. Our Latin America segment experienced largest top line decline as revenue dropped 15% sequentially. This was primarily driven by reduced offshore activity in Mexico, where the offshore rig count dropped an additional 32% sequentially, and reduced revenue in Ecuador, where we have substantially decreased activity with a local customer to avoid further collection risk. 
In the Middle East/Asia Pacific segment, revenue was down 9% sequentially primarily as a result of weakening activity and pricing pressures in Asia Pacific with the largest decline seen in Australia, where the rig count declined 50% sequentially.  Lastly, our Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian segment was down 5% sequentially. Activity in pricing reductions, primarily in North Africa, Nigeria, the U.K. and Angola, were partially offset by the impact of favorable exchange rates in Europe and Russia and increased activity in the North Sea. 
International adjusted operating losses were $277 million with operating margins down 1,664 basis points sequentially, which include 1,050 basis points sequential impact from provisions for doubtful accounts, mostly related to Ecuador, and valuation allowances on indirect taxes in Africa. And although we're taking provisions for these receivables, we continue to aggressively pursue collection. 
For our Industrial Services segment, revenue for the second quarter was $273 million, up 11% sequentially. Industrial Services adjusted operating profit was $4 million with operating margins increasing 310 basis points sequentially. The increase in revenue and margins was driven by the seasonal increase in activity in our pipeline inspection and maintenance business, partially offset by a 250 basis point margin impact from provision for doubtful accounts. 
Looking at cash flow and the balance sheet. During the quarter, we generated $3.6 billion in free cash flow driven mainly by the collection of the $3.5 billion termination fee while restructuring activities of $135 million paid during the quarter were funded from operations. At this time, the estimated net cash proceeds from the $3.5 billion termination fee have increased from $3 billion announced in May to approximately $3.4 billion as we were able to utilize more tax attributes than previously anticipated. We are also well down the path of our announced plan to optimize our capital structure. First, we repurchased approximately 10.9 million shares on the open market totaling $500 million. This leaves $1 billion remaining under our previously announced intention to repurchase $1.5 billion of shares, which we will continue to execute. 
Second, we have completed the purchase of $1 billion face value of outstanding bonds, which will result in $632 million in savings over the life of the bond. This represents $55 million of annualized interest savings, which will be above and beyond the $500 million cost-reduction commitment. Also, as a result of this transaction, our total debt for the quarter declined by $1 billion or 25% sequentially to $3 billion, and we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 18%. As part of this transaction, during the quarter, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $142 million before tax. Third, in early July, we successfully refinanced our $2.5 billion credit facility, which was set to expire in September for a new 5-year term maturing in 2021. This untapped credit facility allows us to maintain additional financial flexibility if the right opportunity arises. 
After all this was said and done, we ended the second quarter with $3.9 billion of cash on the balance sheet. While not all of the cash is readily available, it provides us with ample liquidity to address the challenges and opportunities of the current market. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $70 million, down 19% sequentially. During this downturn, we have been extremely disciplined in our capital deployment, and going forward, we will continue to maintain the same rigor. As such, we expect our capital expenditures to range between $300 million and $400 million for the year. 
At the same time, we continue to invest widely in our core business to ensure we remain competitively well positioned while maximizing return on invested capital. I always say it's not necessarily about how much capital we spend, but more about the returns we get for the capital investments we make. Depreciation and amortization for the second quarter was $305 million, down 14% sequentially. The asset impairments recorded this quarter are expected to result in approximately $160 million of annualized depreciation and amortization saving. 
To sum it up, we had a lot of moving parts this quarter, but we've made great progress on the financial objectives we outlined in May. And while there is still work to be done, we are well positioned financially and strategically to manage through the challenges and to capitalize on the opportunities ahead. We are committed to generating positive cash flows by proactively managing our cost structure, reducing our working capital and maximizing return on invested capital. 
And with that, let's go to Q&A, Alondra."

And then you could go through the various forms of cold stacked, warm stacked, hot stacked. The hot stacked equipment could mobilize in days. The cold stacked, you're talking a lot longer period, months. Very little money in terms of the hot stacked to bring it back. But the cold stacked, you're well north of $150 million. So it's a lot of capital, and this is one of the issues that we have with that business."

As I said, obviously, we had a big movement, both in receivables as well as in inventory, and those were largely attributed to the write-offs or the reserves that we took on both of those. We did -- overall, we had 9 days improvement, of which 7 days was essentially bad debt on the receivables side. So we continued to make progress on collecting the receivable. This is an area that we started last year being very focused on, because at the end of the day, I would say a sale is not a sale if you don't collect on it. It's a gift, and we're really not in the business of gifting. So we really increased the discipline and having proactive discussions with our customers about collections. So obviously, there are many countries, especially when they're very dependent on oil, that are struggling in today's environment. We look at those. In some cases, the future will look better when oil prices get better. In other cases, we see that they might continue to have struggles. And so what I can say is -- even right down to myself is people are out talking to our customers and having a good sense about where they are, and we obviously try to work with them as much as possible. But in some cases is we end up having to take provisions and our policy is based on a time frame. So when we haven't been paid after a certain time frame, then we take provisions on those receivables. So not getting any easier right now, but I think we have a pretty good full court press on it from our side. And even if we have taken a provision, I should say, we will continue to work on collecting those funds. So it's not like it's been written off. We continue to work to collect."

There is a skill set that's different from a -- looking after a large NOC or an independent in North America, but that's a skill set that we're growing ourself. I think it's going to be a competency that's -- that as this category emerges, we're going to have a competency that's very much oriented to this sector. It's a very technical, but also very, very operations-driven customer base, unlike a traditional customer, James, like a Statoil or a Petrobras or Devon. This -- these are us. These are folks that have generally been in our industry, and so the conversations are much more about partnerships.

So you have a customer that says, wait, you mean I can have Baker Hughes product, perhaps more opportunities to buy some of the best products and technology in my respective country I operate in or the basin I operate in. I mean, customers love it. As to the activity levels that I'm hearing from our customers, it's kind of, as I said, James, in the commentary. It depends where they are. It depends with the strength of the customer, the quality of their acreage and so forth. I think as Kimberly said, internationally, it's a concerning environment. It's the cash flow, CapEx issue, much more. It's a longer cycle nature of projects. I think until the view's more constructive, these guys are just going to just sit tight. Now I think the Middle East is maybe a little bit different than that. It should be, at worse, flat to slightly up, and we have a large, large, very large OPEC open customer there that just announced a very ambitious plan to grow their production 30% by 2020. So that aside, as far as North America, I don't subscribe to the hopeful commentary that I think gets thrown around a lot by your community. And I think that the customers are going to need something that's coming in, vectoring in on around $60 or high $50s just because certain costs on our side are going to go up, and I just would feel a lot more confident that we see some stability well north of $55 before there's a lot of motivation to -- for us to be bringing back capital into North America."

When we last spoke to you on May 3, we told you that we were focused on 3 objectives this year. First, we said we would reduce $500 million in costs by year-end by simplifying our organizational structure and rationalizing our operational footprint. Second, we said that we would focus on our core strengths and product innovation while building broader sales channels for our product and technology. And third, we announced plans to optimize our capital structure by paying down debt and buying back shares, while ensuring we maintain financial flexibility. 
In less than 3 months, we've moved with urgency and have made tremendous progress on all fronts. We restructured the company to remove significant costs and create a more nimble, efficient organization. Today, we are firmly on track to reach our savings targets. We redesigned the customer-facing areas of our business to better support our strategy of taking more new products to market faster and more efficiently. We fortified our full-service business with enhancements to our operations and sales organization, and we've laid the groundwork to build new sales channels for direct sales. As Kimberly will describe, we have also made enormous progress on our capital structure in all 3 areas of focus. 
Today, I will share more details about what we have accomplished so far, how we are executing in the market to better position the company for success and our view of the industry outlook, including the opportunities we see for Baker Hughes. But first, I would like to give you an overview of our second quarter financial results. Our performance in the quarter was impacted by continued reductions in customer spending and activity, trends driven not only by the price of oil, but the volatility of those prices and the lack of clarity on the future. 
In looking back over the past few months, it's clear to me that the movement of oil prices has been driven more by one-off events, such as temporary supply disruptions, and not by a change in the fundamentals underpinning supply and demand. Therefore, I believe the industry will remain in a period of continued uncertainty, at least through the end of this year, until more foundational changes to supply and demand create a more stable environment for our customers to plan against. 
As a result of the continued supply/demand imbalance globally, pricing for oilfield services continued to erode in the second quarter. In light of these conditions, we are aggressively removing costs from all areas of our business, consistent with the commitment we outlined in early May. As you can see from today's release, we implemented significant restructuring actions in the quarter to put us on track to meet our cost-reduction targets. 
Regarding top line performance, our global sequential revenue was down 10% from the first quarter of the year versus a 19% decline in the global rig count during the same period. The most severe revenue decline was in North America, but we continue to see softness in most regions of the world. In spite of a challenging environment, our revenue outperformed the current rig count trends. While that is a positive, it is important to note that in these market conditions, revenue is less tightly correlated to active drilling rigs as customers place more emphasis on completion and production-related activities. 
Adjusted operating profit declined $209 million sequentially as activity and pricing continued to pressure margins. In addition, we recorded large provisions on receivables, primarily related to Ecuador, which negatively impacted second quarter results. However, the cost reductions we implemented during the quarter will result in a positive impact on our margins for the second half of the year. Now that we have flexibility to move closely -- to more closely align our costs with market conditions, we have taken aggressive steps to do so, which will result in savings going forward. 
Since our investor call in early May, we've made other significant changes to the company. First, we restructured the leadership team and the resulting organizational design. This resulted in workforce reductions that, while difficult, are necessary to align our cost structure to the market. However, we have been able to retain a strong core of talent and experience that's critical to our success today and going forward. The resulting organization is more efficient, agile and intensely focused, and our employees are energized about what we intend to accomplish. The reorganization, in addition to reducing costs, more strongly aligns our company structure to supporting our overarching strategy, which is to take our technology to market faster and more efficiently through our full-service model and a broader set of sales channels. These actions demonstrate the breadth, depth and speed of change across the entire company. 
Let me walk you through some of the changes. Consistent with our decision to focus on our core innovation strength, we consolidated our products and technology organizations into one team under our Art Soucy. Art's primary mandate is to get more new products to market faster and to ensure that they're aligned with the market realities and corresponding commercial opportunities. In this market, that means lower costs. It means lower cost fit for purpose products that are simplified and standardized, but also technically advanced products that bring leading-edge solutions to enable our customers to fundamentally reduce lifting costs. 
To accelerate the pace of new product launches, Art is driving a collaborative product development process that integrates manufacturing and reliability engineering with the vast capability of our design team. This process reduces product cost and development lead times, all while improving reliability. In the second half of this year, Art's team is committed to launching 60 products, the vast majority of which will lower cost and optimize production for our customers. 
For example, in the second quarter, we launched the Integrity eXplorer, an industry unique wireline service that is fast becoming the industry standard for accurate and reliable cement evaluation. This disruptive technology is enabled by electromagnetic acoustic sensors that deliver precise evaluation of any cement mixture in all borehole environments. When conventional technologies wrongly diagnose cement quality, operators are required to perform unnecessary remedial operations that cost them days of rig time and a lot of unplanned expenditures. Integrity eXplorer is the only product in the market that deploys this technology, and customer pool, thus far, has been exceptional. 
And next week, we will launch a new tiered artificial lift motor line designed to drive operational efficiency by improving reliability and lowering power consumption costs for our customers. This motor line is applicable for 90% of our core market, and the tiered offering provides the reliability factors and power efficiencies our customers demand in both standard applications and in the harshest well environments. Some of the motor technology upgrades include an enhanced insulation system that allows higher horsepower per rotor, a larger diameter shaft for higher torque ratings and a superior bearing system to minimize vibration. In addition, we've optimized rotor and stator geometries and applied our proprietary motor-winding technology to create the industry's highest temperature-rated, most efficient downhole induction motor for our core markets. 
Next, to ensure we're capitalizing on the opportunities for that technology in the market, we consolidated and more tightly integrated our sales and operations teams under one global operations organization led by Belgacem Chariag. In doing so, we restructured 4 regions encompassing more than 20 previous steel markets into one organization consisting of 9 geomarkets. The result is a flatter, simpler and more responsive structure that will allow us to operate more efficiently. Global operations is responsible for both sales and operational execution, which form the cornerstone of our operations in more than 80 countries. Belgacem's objectives are to achieve outstanding operational and HSE performance and increase both profitability and return on invested capital. 
I want to emphasize that the full-service model will remain our predominant commercial focus around the world. However, we also see an opportunity to develop new channels for our products and technology beyond the traditional approach. To that end, we created a commercial strategy organization led by Derek Mathieson, which is responsible for the long-range strategic planning for the company. That remit includes developing a broader range of sales channels for our product innovations. It also includes developing other Baker Hughes businesses, such as our Process and Pipeline Services business and our subsea production alliance with Aker Solutions to ensure they reach their full potential. 
Turning to expanded channels. We're making good progress in muscling up on our direct sales business to local service providers. In essence, this means we will supply and grow a new set of customers beyond our traditional base. The interest levels we've seen so far and the potential opportunities we've identified are strong indications that we are going down the right path with a strategy that is right for Baker Hughes and will differentiate us in the market. While it will take some time to build critical mass to these channels, we're focused on winning in the market in the here and now. Our customers are intensely focused on reducing costs, maximizing production and increasing recoveries, all of which align with our strengths and competencies. 
Let me share with you how we're positioning Baker Hughes for the market opportunities we see today and on the horizon. We achieved some significant wins and milestones in the second quarter, where our technology and operational performance were cited as competitive differentiators. It's clear from our customers that they're very glad to have Baker Hughes firmly rooted in the market doing what we do best. 
Several of these wins are cited in our release, but in summary, we achieved significant awards or work expansions for intelligent production systems in Brazil, coiled tubing in the North Sea and drilling services in Russia. In addition, we secured a 5-year contract for completion systems in Kazakhstan, along with a 3-year completions and wellbore intervention award in Southeast Asia. In India, we won a 3-year drill bits contract, a 5-year drilling services contract in Kuwait and a 3-year artificial lift systems contract in Oman. We had numerous wins in upstream and downstream chemicals for contracts from customers ranging from North America to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. 
Our Process and Pipeline Services business also earned a big win with a contract for Australia's Ichthys field, where we are currently pre-commissioning a new pipeline for service and will provide leak testing services for an additional 18 months for this liquid natural gas project. Out of 11 major pre-commissioning projects being conducted worldwide this year, Baker Hughes will perform 9 of them. 
In the Johan Sverdrup field in the North Sea, we are off to a great start on a large project for which we're providing drilling services, cementing, drilling fluids and completions. We started drilling 2 months ahead of schedule in March of this year, and by the end of June, we had completed 2 batch drilling campaigns and drilled and completed the first 3 wells in record time. We helped the customer reduce their budget and well time by 50%. 
I think it's also important to emphasize that when we define winning, we're not talking just about taking share. Our focus is on profitable growth and sufficient returns on capital investment.  We've conducted an analysis of the competitive dynamics, market opportunities and our own profitability performance spanning more than 200 product line geo combinations. As a result of that review, we've begun the process of rationalizing certain product offerings in specific countries based on our objectives of profitable growth and return on invested capital. While these potential reductions represent less than 5% of our current revenue, they will have a positive impact on operating profitability. The point I'd like to emphasize is, at Baker Hughes, product lines and geomarkets will earn their right to be in our portfolio. 
Along a similar vein, the last time we spoke, I provided our view of the U.S. land pressure pumping market, and I outlined the first phase of our new plan for this business, consolidating in 2 target basins, where the majority of activity and near-term growth is concentrated. We continue to believe this is the right approach for Baker Hughes, given the continued pricing pressure, capital investment requirements and the large number of competitors serving this market. The first steps of our plan are well underway with the new management structure in place and operations consolidation taking place into those basins. As we prepare for the final stage of our plan, we continue to retain much of the operating structure in North America for this business while we evaluate our options to ensure we maximize shareholder value. 
I want to finish up with a bit more on the market outlook and the opportunities we see for Baker Hughes. As we said in May, in early May, we don't expect to see a meaningful recovery in the second half of the year, and that's still the case. While we've seen production edge down, particularly in North America, that has been offset by additional production elsewhere. While our customers have substantially slowed, reduced or altogether canceled a large number of exploratory and field development campaigns, I have yet to see an economic catalyst that will create a step change to demand that would lead to materially higher oil prices. In addition, U.S. crude storage levels are at record highs, and there's a significant backlog of crude in the form of drilled but uncompleted or so-called DUC wells. 
On the demand side, growth is only forecasted to be modestly higher than expectations at the beginning of the year. In fact, the economic impact of recent events, such as the Brexit vote leading to a stronger dollar and significantly weaker British pound, has created more uncertainty, and historically, there's been a strong correlation between a strengthening dollar and a weakening oil price, which could continue to be an unfavorable headwind. Many of our customers I speak to are standing pat at today's oil prices and, yes, many say they will ramp activity as oil prices reach the $50 mark. However, like in past cycles, service sector cost will rise with increased activity and that will erode incremental cash margins for the operators. Accordingly, I believe oil prices in the upper $50s, at a minimum, are required for a sustainable recovery in North America. 
As we mentioned previously, in North America, we expect an initial increase in activity in the drilled but uncompleted category, which, today, extends beyond 5,000 wells across the various basins. While completion schedules for these wells are estimated to ramp up as oil prices recover, the pace and speed of the increase will vary wildly across the available inventory, based on the well's economics, and a large number of DUCs are not economical at $50 oil prices. Regardless, with our strength in the artificial lift and production chemical product lines, this expected activity is a near-term opportunity for Baker Hughes. Despite a backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells to work through, we expect the North American rig count to increase modestly in the second half of 2016, driven by seasonal gains in Canada and a slight uptick in the U.S. market. I describe it as a slow grind upwards for North America. 
Internationally, we expect rig counts to continue slight declines in most countries for the second half of 2016. However, it's not a one size fits all outlook as there are pockets of stability mixed with pockets of declines. Markets in the Middle East and Russia Caspian are expected to be more resilient and may experience modest growth. The leading drilling and completions positions that we've built in these markets are likely to see the first surge in activity on the well construction side as conventional markets with lower lifting costs are the first to recover. 
We expect deepwater activity to continue to decline. However, when this segment recovers, which we fully expect, we are well positioned with a substantial footprint in deepwater markets, such as the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, North Sea and West Africa, with leading positions in drilling and completion services. In the meantime, with our customers focused on maximizing production, the new products coming out of our production chemicals business continue to drive market share gains in every deepwater basin. 
To sum it up, I want to emphasize that we're making great progress on meeting our cost objectives. We've restructured the company to support our go-to-market strategy, and we are executing on that strategy decisively and with a sense of urgency. And I'm very optimistic about our road ahead. 
Now let me turn it over to Kimberly."
19007,368371108,1016531,"Baker Hughes Incorporated, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Baker Hughes Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. As Martin mentioned, today, we reported revenue for the second quarter of $2.4 billion, down 10% sequentially, as a result of additional activity reductions and pricing pressures across all our geographic segmen",1356,"Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone. As Martin mentioned, today, we reported revenue for the second quarter of $2.4 billion, down 10% sequentially, as a result of additional activity reductions and pricing pressures across all our geographic segments. 
On a GAAP basis, the net loss for the quarter was $911 million or $2.08 per share. The adjusted net loss for the second quarter was $392 million or $0.90 per share. Adjusted net loss excludes $519 million of after tax adjusting items or $1.18 per share. These items on a pretax basis are: goodwill impairment of $1.8 billion, of which $1.5 billion related to North America and $311 million to our Industrial Services segment; impairments and restructuring charges of $1.1 billion primarily related to impairments of fixed assets and intangibles, workforce reductions and contract termination; inventory adjustments of $621 million related to writing off inventory; a charge for early extinguishment of debt of $142 million related primarily to the premium on the bonds we repurchased; merger and related costs of $78 million; and $262 million for income taxes on these items. These charges were partially offset by the collection of the merger termination fee of $3.5 billion and the reversal of a loss on firm purchase commitments of $51 million as result of reaching a settlement this quarter. 
On the other hand, non-adjusted from our results are before tax charges related to provisions for doubtful accounts of $166 million, primarily in Ecuador, and valuation allowances on indirect taxes of $45 million, largely in Africa. These charges reflect the ongoing challenges our industry is facing and the restructuring actions we have implemented to align our business to these market conditions. These actions are expected to result in an estimated $450 million of annualized cost savings with approximately 2/3 coming from compensation savings related to workforce reductions of 3,000 positions, which were completed this quarter, with the other 1/3 of the savings resulting from reduced depreciation and amortization expense associated with the impairment. While our cost reductions will continue in the second half of the year, the actions taken this quarter clearly puts us well underway to accomplish our annualized cost savings objectives of $500 million. 
The effective tax rate for the second quarter was a negative 20%. Our income tax rate has remained and will continue to remain volatile between the quarters as a result of the geographic mix of earnings and certain discrete tax item. Our corporate costs were $29 million for the quarter, down $3 million sequentially. We expect these costs to remain in the low 30s for the rest of the year. 
Taking a closer look at our results from operations. In North America, revenue of $668 million decreased 18% sequentially against the backdrop of a 35% decline in the rig count. The decrease in revenue was driven primarily by reduced U.S. onshore activity and the seasonal spring breakup in Canada. We continued to experience pricing pressure during the quarter, although prices in some markets have begun to reach bottom. Adjusted operating losses for the quarter of $153 million improved sequentially by $21 million as the initial savings from impairments and restructuring actions more than offset the impact of reduced revenue. 
Moving to international results. We posted revenue of $1.5 billion, which is 9 -- a 9% decrease versus the prior quarter. Our Latin America segment experienced largest top line decline as revenue dropped 15% sequentially. This was primarily driven by reduced offshore activity in Mexico, where the offshore rig count dropped an additional 32% sequentially, and reduced revenue in Ecuador, where we have substantially decreased activity with a local customer to avoid further collection risk. 
In the Middle East/Asia Pacific segment, revenue was down 9% sequentially primarily as a result of weakening activity and pricing pressures in Asia Pacific with the largest decline seen in Australia, where the rig count declined 50% sequentially.  Lastly, our Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian segment was down 5% sequentially. Activity in pricing reductions, primarily in North Africa, Nigeria, the U.K. and Angola, were partially offset by the impact of favorable exchange rates in Europe and Russia and increased activity in the North Sea. 
International adjusted operating losses were $277 million with operating margins down 1,664 basis points sequentially, which include 1,050 basis points sequential impact from provisions for doubtful accounts, mostly related to Ecuador, and valuation allowances on indirect taxes in Africa. And although we're taking provisions for these receivables, we continue to aggressively pursue collection. 
For our Industrial Services segment, revenue for the second quarter was $273 million, up 11% sequentially. Industrial Services adjusted operating profit was $4 million with operating margins increasing 310 basis points sequentially. The increase in revenue and margins was driven by the seasonal increase in activity in our pipeline inspection and maintenance business, partially offset by a 250 basis point margin impact from provision for doubtful accounts. 
Looking at cash flow and the balance sheet. During the quarter, we generated $3.6 billion in free cash flow driven mainly by the collection of the $3.5 billion termination fee while restructuring activities of $135 million paid during the quarter were funded from operations. At this time, the estimated net cash proceeds from the $3.5 billion termination fee have increased from $3 billion announced in May to approximately $3.4 billion as we were able to utilize more tax attributes than previously anticipated. We are also well down the path of our announced plan to optimize our capital structure. First, we repurchased approximately 10.9 million shares on the open market totaling $500 million. This leaves $1 billion remaining under our previously announced intention to repurchase $1.5 billion of shares, which we will continue to execute. 
Second, we have completed the purchase of $1 billion face value of outstanding bonds, which will result in $632 million in savings over the life of the bond. This represents $55 million of annualized interest savings, which will be above and beyond the $500 million cost-reduction commitment. Also, as a result of this transaction, our total debt for the quarter declined by $1 billion or 25% sequentially to $3 billion, and we ended the quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio of 18%. As part of this transaction, during the quarter, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $142 million before tax. Third, in early July, we successfully refinanced our $2.5 billion credit facility, which was set to expire in September for a new 5-year term maturing in 2021. This untapped credit facility allows us to maintain additional financial flexibility if the right opportunity arises. 
After all this was said and done, we ended the second quarter with $3.9 billion of cash on the balance sheet. While not all of the cash is readily available, it provides us with ample liquidity to address the challenges and opportunities of the current market. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $70 million, down 19% sequentially. During this downturn, we have been extremely disciplined in our capital deployment, and going forward, we will continue to maintain the same rigor. As such, we expect our capital expenditures to range between $300 million and $400 million for the year. 
At the same time, we continue to invest widely in our core business to ensure we remain competitively well positioned while maximizing return on invested capital. I always say it's not necessarily about how much capital we spend, but more about the returns we get for the capital investments we make. Depreciation and amortization for the second quarter was $305 million, down 14% sequentially. The asset impairments recorded this quarter are expected to result in approximately $160 million of annualized depreciation and amortization saving. 
To sum it up, we had a lot of moving parts this quarter, but we've made great progress on the financial objectives we outlined in May. And while there is still work to be done, we are well positioned financially and strategically to manage through the challenges and to capitalize on the opportunities ahead. We are committed to generating positive cash flows by proactively managing our cost structure, reducing our working capital and maximizing return on invested capital. 
And with that, let's go to Q&A, Alondra."

We did -- overall, we had 9 days improvement, of which 7 days was essentially bad debt on the receivables side. So we continued to make progress on collecting the receivable. This is an area that we started last year being very focused on, because at the end of the day, I would say a sale is not a sale if you don't collect on it. It's a gift, and we're really not in the business of gifting. So we really increased the discipline and having proactive discussions with our customers about collections. So obviously, there are many countries, especially when they're very dependent on oil, that are struggling in today's environment. We look at those. In some cases, the future will look better when oil prices get better. In other cases, we see that they might continue to have struggles. And so what I can say is -- even right down to myself is people are out talking to our customers and having a good sense about where they are, and we obviously try to work with them as much as possible. But in some cases is we end up having to take provisions and our policy is based on a time frame. So when we haven't been paid after a certain time frame, then we take provisions on those receivables. So not getting any easier right now, but I think we have a pretty good full court press on it from our side. And even if we have taken a provision, I should say, we will continue to work on collecting those funds. So it's not like it's been written off. We continue to work to collect."

I mean, customers love it. As to the activity levels that I'm hearing from our customers, it's kind of, as I said, James, in the commentary. It depends where they are. It depends with the strength of the customer, the quality of their acreage and so forth. I think as Kimberly said, internationally, it's a concerning environment. It's the cash flow, CapEx issue, much more. It's a longer cycle nature of projects. I think until the view's more constructive, these guys are just going to just sit tight. Now I think the Middle East is maybe a little bit different than that. It should be, at worse, flat to slightly up, and we have a large, large, very large OPEC open customer there that just announced a very ambitious plan to grow their production 30% by 2020. So that aside, as far as North America, I don't subscribe to the hopeful commentary that I think gets thrown around a lot by your community. And I think that the customers are going to need something that's coming in, vectoring in on around $60 or high $50s just because certain costs on our side are going to go up, and I just would feel a lot more confident that we see some stability well north of $55 before there's a lot of motivation to -- for us to be bringing back capital into North America."

And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. This morning, I'm going to address several topics with you. First, I will provide an overview of our third quarter results and the improvement we achieved. Second, I will update you on our progress against the 3 financial and strategic objectives that we outlined in early May and provide further details on how we are aggressively executing on these plans. And finally, I will give you our perspective on the market, including how our views have evolved and how Baker Hughes is positioned for the opportunities ahead.
But look, before I get started, I want to take a moment and thank all of our employees for their commitment and effort in delivering a vastly improved quarter. The last 2 years have been extraordinarily challenging, and I'm very proud of their leadership and how they've responded to those challenges, remaining focused on working safely and compliantly and taking care of our customers.
Okay. [ph] Starting with the third quarter, [ph] we've made progress on all fronts. This is evident in our third quarter results. We recorded an adjusted net loss of $64 million or $0.15 per diluted share, an improvement of $328 million sequentially. While revenue declined 2% sequentially to $2.4 billion, reflecting lower activity levels and pricing pressure in key markets, we generated an adjusted operating profit of $7 million in the quarter. This represents an improvement of $462 million compared to the prior quarter and is an indication of the momentum in our cost reduction and business restructuring efforts.
Now let me provide an overview of our performance against the 3 objectives we outlined in May: [ph] One, reducing $500 million of costs by year-end through simplifying our organizational structure and operational footprint; two, focusing on our core strengths in product innovation by fortifying our full-service model and building broader sales channels for our products and technology; and three, optimizing our capital structure by paying down debt and buying back shares while ensuring we maintain financial flexibility. We've made significant progress against all of those objectives, and we are doing so with an overarching focus on profitable growth and return on invested capital.
Starting with costs. Last month, we said that we expected to achieve the $500 million in savings by the end of the third quarter, 3 months ahead of our original time line, [ph] and that we had identified additional savings opportunities beyond that. To that end, I'm pleased to say that we not only have achieved that goal, but we now expect the total annualized savings run rate to increase by 30% to $650 million by year-end. Kimberly will provide more details later in the call.
Turning to our efforts to fortify our core full-service business and build new sales channels for our products and technology, [ph] we continue to make significant progress. Previously, we said that we had identified opportunities to prune our product line portfolio and geomarket presence in certain markets by either exiting the market or converting it to an alternative sales channel. As previously highlighted, these exits and conversions represented less than 5% of total second quarter revenue. We expect to have 2/3 of these exits and conversions completed by the end of 2016.
As an example, we have recently converted select geographical areas within our drilling and completion fluids business in North America to a distribution model. We've completed one such conversion in the South Texas and Permian market, which will not only allow us to retain product revenue but will also take our products into new markets and increase our market share. For this particular product line, we will replicate this model elsewhere in the United States while retaining our current model in markets where the financial returns are more appealing. This business conversion illustrates how these alternative sales channels provide us an opportunity to grow with a minimal asset base.
This is just one example of how we are fine-tuning our business with a surgical approach to improve efficiency, profitability and return on invested capital. That's the same philosophical view we are taking as we consider a range of ownership models for our North America land pressure pumping business. While we will continue to participate in this market, we are looking at models that will allow us to do so while mitigating the resource requirements and capital intensity that are inherent in this particular business segment.
To be clear, some of the changes to our full-service offerings provide an opportunity for conversion to an alternative business model by selling products and services to local service providers in the markets that we're rationalizing. However, I want to emphasize that the opportunities extend to markets where we have a limited or zero presence today. I'm very pleased by the customer responses so far, and we currently have a line of sight to a steady pipeline of revenue growth opportunities in this space, including some that could materialize in Latin America and the Middle East/Asia Pacific [ph] as early as the first quarter of 2017. We believe these local service providers represent a market segment that is under-supported. [ph] We've seen numerous examples of government programs with the goal of keeping more of the oilfield [ph] service and supply chain spending in-country by establishing homegrown companies. This is an ideal opportunity for Baker Hughes. Because of our leading technology, innovator mindset and catalog of world-class brands, we are uniquely positioned to enable this emerging customer segment in all facets of their business, spanning products, services training, technical support and consulting services, and position them to compete for and win local contracts, not just in a onetime transactional way [ph] but as part of a recurring, longer-term relationship that grows over time. While this opportunity needs some runway to develop, the growth potential is real, and it's obtainable.
Next, let me give you some thoughts on the market, how it's evolving and where we think it's heading. As we said in July and reiterated again in September, we continue to believe that oil prices in the mid- to upper 50s are required for a sustainable recovery in North America. Our customers also need to be more confident on the durability of those oil prices before making any significant change to the spending patterns. As we previously projected, the North American market has been continuing to grind slowly upward, and we expect that to continue. In order for a broader recovery to take place, a series of milestones need to be reached before the market can respond in a more predictable way. First, supply-demand surplus has to rebalance, allowing commodity prices to improve. [ph] Second, those commodity prices need to stabilize for confidence in the customer community to improve and their investment to accelerate. [ph] And third, activity needs to increase meaningfully before service capacity can be substantially absorbed and pricing recovery take place. Until then, we will continue to see this dislocation we have today in the relationship between commodity prices and services pricing.
In North America, we have seen a recent shift in land activity from what was predominantly small private operators adding rigs opportunistically to include larger, more established E&P companies. While we've seen customers growing more optimistic about the industry outlook, volatility and uncertainty remain. We expect the ramp-up to remain slow and pricing to remain challenging. And as a result, we expect only modest growth in the fourth quarter in North America.
Internationally, we see activity declines and pricing pressure continuing in the near term. [ph] And with customers controlling spending, we don't expect year-end seasonal product sales to offset those declines.
In Africa, where we have a significant deepwater drilling position, we expect our revenue to further decline as a result of ongoing reductions in deepwater activity. Additionally, in Norway, we expect to see a sequential revenue reduction as a result of the recently resolved local strikes, which impacted the first 2 weeks of the fourth quarter.
Conversely, in the Middle East/Asia Pacific region, we expect to see growth opportunities in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, India and Oman. And in Saudi Arabia, we continue to fortify our position with a focus on flawless execution across our full suite of product lines.
And finally, in Latin America, we expect the overall market to remain relatively flat, although a onetime product sell [ph] in Colombia during the third quarter will create a sequential headwind.
Now as we look ahead, it's also worth reiterating the obvious that the oil and gas ecosystem remains fragile and susceptible to shocks from headlines, difficult policy changes, currency fluctuation and geopolitical dynamics. And as I've [ph] said previously, the difference in this cycle is the more prominent role of the North American shale producer, [ph] who can achieve production growth and get it into the pipe far [ph] faster than conventional producers. As such, the elasticity of the unconventional segment could act as an effective ceiling on the commodity price.
So while we remain optimistic about recoveries prospects, we are positioning the company to prosper in a lower-for-longer market environment. In simple terms, that means delivering solutions to our customers that result in more efficient wells, optimized production and improved recovery.
Let me give you an example of how we are delivering more efficient wells for our customers. The DJ Basin in the Rockies has historically been a drilling motor market, but operators there are challenged to reach further [ph] with more and longer laterals. Conventional [ph] drilling systems lack the ability to stay in the target zone on longer laterals, and that limits the reach.
Last quarter, Baker Hughes combined 2 industry-leading products, our AutoTrak Curve rotary steerable system, the only continuous, proportional steering system in the market, with our Talon Force [ph] bit technology to increase lateral length from 5,000 feet to 10,000 feet while drilling 30% faster and delivering gun barrel [ph] quality holes.
Speed and reach are important, but speed and reach without borehole quality is a recipe for increased completions costs and premature wear on lift systems. So when you hit the sweet spot of fast and good, you have a clear competitive advantage, and that is what Baker Hughes does really well. We bring technology, products, systems and people that differentiate in the markets in which we choose to play. That's why one customer in the DJ Basin awarded us 100% of their work through 2017, and it's not just one customer. We now hold nearly 50% of the drilling share in that critical basin.
Touching on optimizing production. While it's always high on our customers' agenda, given today's market conditions, it's nothing short of an imperative. In some basins, particularly the Canadian oil sands, with high costs and long cycle time for new projects, frankly, it's a lifeline. Our chemicals portfolio is uniquely positioned to improve and sustain productivity for our customers in that market today, and we are seeing an increase in the demand for technology solutions in that area. For example, last month, we launched our new TRETOLITE SNAP water clarifier product designed for wells that require oil and water separation, like the steam-assisted gravity drainage, or SAGD, [ph] production facilities in Canada. During the oil and water separation process, dry oil and clean water usually come with undesired costs and operational instability, resulting from heat exchange refiling, oil and water recycling and slop oil generation. These issues drive costs up and production down. Prior to its commercial launch, we worked with an operator in Canada to try and [ph] run our [ph] TRETOLITE SNAP water clarifier, and the results were overwhelmingly differentiating. Over the treatment period, we lowered oil and water rates, basic sediment and water levels in the oil. This significantly reduced recycling, [ph] costly equipment cleanouts and slop production, [ph] all while increasing throughput capacity.
And finally, to increase ultimate recovery in a meaningful way, we require not only the aforementioned well construction and production improvement but also the development of a new range of sensing and intelligent products integrated into a broader digital framework. For several years now, we've been investing in next-generation electronics to deploy in the extreme environments that we face in drilling and completions. Our recent launch of SureSENS Elite [ph] is a great example for this in our completions business, designed to provide 20 years of downhole data in high-pressure, high-temperature wells. This design incorporates application-specific [ph] integrated circuits, or ASIC, [ph] technology that does not break down in high temperatures and delivers a next generation of reliability and accuracy for downhole gauges. The SureSENS [ph] Elite Gauge [ph] delivers ongoing pressure, temperature, flow and fluid density readings required to calculate estimated returns and optimize intelligent production systems. Initial market uptake has been strong, and we're currently ramping up the production.
I'm completely confident that as we focus on what we do best, differentiate ourselves in the marketplace with leading products and technology, make prudent decisions about where and how we go-to-market and continue to invest in our people, Baker Hughes will prosper no matter the environment.
[ph] So with that, let me hand it off to Kimberly, and I'll come back at the end of the call with a few final thoughts. Kimberly?"

Let me start by saying that like Martin, I am very pleased with the progress our teams have made. We have had a lot of moving parts recently. During the last 6 months, we restructured the organization, and people have now settled into the new role while, at the same time, focusing on the customer and executing our cost-reduction initiative. [ph] Additionally, we took steps to optimize our capital structure and continued to enhance processes around cost management, capital discipline and working capital.
Delivering on all of [ph] these objectives simultaneously, ahead of schedule, is a true testament of team performance. While we have more work to do, I have no doubt that we are on the right path.
Moving to our third quarter results. Today, we reported revenue for the third quarter of $2.4 billion, down 2% sequentially, primarily as a result of activity reductions in our Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and Norwegian deepwater operations. On a GAAP basis, the net loss for the quarter was $429 million or $1 per share. The adjusted net loss for the third quarter was $64 million or $0.15 per share. Adjusted net loss excluded $365 million in [ph] after-tax adjusting items or $0.85 per share, primarily related to additional impairments and restructuring charges. As a result of the restructuring actions taken this quarter, we have now achieved $600 million of annualized savings. Approximately 2/3 of the savings are related to lower compensation expense from workforce reductions, and another 1/3 of savings are associated with reduced depreciation and amortization expense from impairment. From a segment perspective, approximately 30% of the cost savings reside in North America, 65% in international and 5% in Industrial Services. The majority of the benefit is reflected in our third quarter results, with an estimate incremental benefit in the fourth quarter of approximately $20 million. Based on this progress, and as Martin alluded to earlier, we now expect to achieve a new annualized savings target of $650 million by year-end.
Heading into 2017, we fully expect those efforts to continue. For example, we are evaluating opportunities to further optimize our global manufacturing footprint, thus reducing under-absorption [ph] and achieving other sourcing efficiencies throughout the supply chain. Also, we continue to carry costs associated with North America land pressure pumping [ph] business as we work through our process to maximize shareholder value for that business.
Turning back to the third quarter. Adjusted operating profit before tax and interest for the quarter was $7 million, a sequential improvement of $462 million. Most of the improvement is driven by a reduction in operating costs as a result of the actions we have taken to align our cost structure to the reality [ph] in the market and by the reduction and provisions for doubtful accounts and excess inventory resulting mainly from the controls and processes we're establishing around receivables and inventory. Also, the third quarter results included the benefit of several nonrecurring items totaling $45 million.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter was a negative 19%. Our income tax rate has remained and will continue to remain volatile between the quarters as a result of the geographic mix of earnings, valuation allowances and certain discrete items.
Taking a closer look at our results from operations. In North America, revenue of $674 million increased 1% sequentially. The increase in U.S. onshore activity and the seasonal uptick in Canada were almost entirely offset by a steep decline of activity in the Gulf of Mexico. In the Gulf of Mexico, we experienced project delays and reduced drilling activity as reflected by the 22% drop in the U.S. offshore rig count. In the U.S. onshore, where most of the activity increases were driven by small, private E&P companies, we managed to outpace the sequential rig count growth in our drilling services and drill bits product lines. However, with almost half of our operations in the region associated with production, our business experiences less of an immediate correlation between revenue and the rig count. We see a similar dynamic in Canada where we are less impacted by the seasonality as a result of this mix.
Adjusted operating losses for the quarter were $74 million, with operating margins improving 1,192 basis points sequentially. This improvement was driven primarily by cost reductions, including lower depreciation and amortization expense from impairment and reduced provisions for excess inventory. The third quarter includes the benefit of approximately 410 basis points associated with non-reoccurring items.
Moving to international results. We reported revenue of $1.4 billion, which is a 4% decrease versus the prior quarter. Despite the overall decline, our Latin America revenue grew 3% sequentially. This increase was driven primarily by onetime product sales in Colombia, partially offset by reduced activity in the region, mainly in Venezuela within IOC and in Mexico. In our Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian segment, revenue was down 11% sequentially as a result of steep activity reductions, primarily in Norway and West Africa. In Norway, activity was impacted not only by the timing of drilling and completion schedule but also by delays that resulted from the recent union strikes. In West Africa, where we have a significant market share position in drilling, several large projects were temporarily suspended. The Middle East/Asia Pacific segment revenue was relatively flat sequentially [ph] as activity declines and price erosion across most of the region were offset by pockets of activity growth, primarily in Saudi and Kuwait.
International adjusted operating profit was $92 million, with operating margins up 2,540 basis points sequentially despite the decline in revenue. Sequentially, margins include 1,300 basis point benefit from provision of doubtful accounts [ph] mostly related to Ecuador and valuation allowances on indirect taxes in Africa not repeating in the third quarter. Margins also benefited from cost reductions and reduced provisions for excess inventory. Note that our current quarter margins include the benefit [ph] of approximately 180 basis points related to non-reoccurring items.
For Industrial Services segment, revenue for the third quarter was $268 million, down 2% sequentially. The decrease in revenue was mainly related to project delays in the pipeline inspection and maintenance business causing an earlier-than-usual seasonal decline. Industrial Services [ph] adjusted operating profit was $26 million, with operating margins increasing 824 basis points sequentially on declining revenue. The increase in margins was driven by cost savings and provisions for doubtful accounts from the second quarter not reoccurring. Also, the current quarter margins include the benefit of approximately 110 basis points related to non-reoccurring items.
Looking at cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $109 million in free cash flow, which includes $103 million of restructuring payments during the quarter. This quarter, we repurchased approximately 5.3 million shares on the open [ph] market totaling $263 million. In less than 6 months, we purchased more than half of the $1.5 billion of shares under our previously announced program. As such, we ended the third quarter with $3.7 billion of cash on the balance sheet, which positions us well to address the challenges and opportunities ahead.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $70 million, unchanged sequentially. We have recently implemented enhanced controls on capital spending to ensure that we maintain the needed discipline and focus on returns when activity begins to ramp up. For all of 2016, we still expect our capital expenditures to range between $300 million and $400 million.
Depreciation and amortization for the third quarter was $262 million, down $43 million or 14% sequentially. The asset impairments recorded in the third quarter are expected to result in approximately $35 million of annualized depreciation and amortization savings going forward.
To summarize, we've made good progress on our cost-reduction initiatives. Not only have we exceeded our original target for the year, but we've identified opportunities for further cost efficiencies. We have also continued to generate positive cash flow through managing our cost structure, reducing our working capital and maximizing return on invested capital.
And with that, let's go to Q&A. Alondra?"

Did I hear you right that you recognized about $600 million of savings already, annualized savings in the third quarter, and that accounts for probably the majority of the increase in EBITDA? What other items should we look at that were driving the sequential increase in EBITDA? Was it mix or some other things that helped drive that? And then thinking about the fourth quarter, it sounds like we have some more cost savings to kind of roll through. I just wanted to just kind of maybe touch on that, please."

And as we said, now on an annualized basis, we do expect to get $650 million, [ph] of which $600 million is now done. With [ph] that said, there were some Q2 to Q3 items. Recall that in Q2, we had about $166 million of bad debt that didn't reoccur this quarter. Also, we had valuation allowances on indirect taxes last quarter, about $45 million. And in this quarter, we also recognized some non-reoccurring benefits, which were a bunch of small items [ph] largely related to some of the initiatives that we had with regard to cost reductions. And then also, we had provisions for excess inventories and -- that don't repeat this quarter. Then if we think of the Q4, I think there are a couple of things to recognize. First of all, again, we said that we have about $20 million more of savings that we expect in quarter 4. Obviously, the [ph] $45 million of one-offs [ph] this quarter will not repeat next quarter. And then a lot depends on activity. And keeping in mind that in Q4 last year, we saw some pullback during the holiday season, and so that could repeat this quarter again.

It's been our intention, Bill, I can tell you, to continue to make this company focused on what it does best, which in many regards is going to make is increasingly more unique than our peers. And another thread of all this will be, as I said, new channels that are even going to participate in North America like we did on our drilling fluids and what that means to revenues versus accretive margins. So I'll leave to you experts to figure out what that proxy is, but it's best color I can give you right now."

And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. This morning, I'm going to address several topics with you. First, I will provide an overview of our third quarter results and the improvement we achieved. Second, I will update you on our progress against the 3 financial and strategic objectives that we outlined in early May and provide further details on how we are aggressively executing on these plans. And finally, I will give you our perspective on the market, including how our views have evolved and how Baker Hughes is positioned for the opportunities ahead.
But look, before I get started, I want to take a moment and thank all of our employees for their commitment and effort in delivering a vastly improved quarter. The last 2 years have been extraordinarily challenging, and I'm very proud of their leadership and how they've responded to those challenges, remaining focused on working safely and compliantly and taking care of our customers.
Okay. Starting with the third quarter, we've made progress on all fronts. This is evident in our third quarter results. We recorded an adjusted net loss of $64 million or $0.15 per diluted share, an improvement of $328 million sequentially. While revenue declined 2% sequentially to $2.4 billion, reflecting lower activity levels and pricing pressure in key markets, we generated an adjusted operating profit of $7 million in the quarter. This represents an improvement of $462 million compared to the prior quarter and is an indication of the momentum in our cost reduction and business restructuring efforts.
Now let me provide an overview of our performance against the 3 objectives we outlined in May: one, reducing $500 million of costs by year-end through simplifying our organizational structure and operational footprint; two, focusing on our core strengths in product innovation by fortifying our full-service model and building broader sales channels for our products and technology; and three, optimizing our capital structure by paying down debt and buying back shares while ensuring we maintain financial flexibility. We've made significant progress against all of those objectives, and we are doing so with an overarching focus on profitable growth and return on invested capital.
Starting with costs. Last month, we said that we expected to achieve the $500 million in savings by the end of the third quarter, 3 months ahead of our original time line, and that we had identified additional savings opportunities beyond that. To that end, I'm pleased to say that we not only have achieved that goal, but we now expect the total annualized savings run rate to increase by 30% to $650 million by year-end. Kimberly will provide more details later in the call.
Turning to our efforts to fortify our core full-service business and build new sales channels for our products and technology, we continue to make significant progress. Previously, we said that we had identified opportunities to prune our product line portfolio and geomarket presence in certain markets by either exiting the market or converting it to an alternative sales channel. As previously highlighted, these exits and conversions represented less than 5% of total second quarter revenue. We expect to have 2/3 of these exits and conversions completed by the end of 2016.
As an example, we have recently converted select geographical areas within our drilling and completion fluids business in North America to a distribution model. We've completed one such conversion in the South Texas and Permian market, which will not only allow us to retain product revenue but will also take our products into new markets and increase our market share. For this particular product line, we will replicate this model elsewhere in the United States while retaining our current model in markets where the financial returns are more appealing. This business conversion illustrates how these alternative sales channels provide us an opportunity to grow with a minimal asset base.
This is just one example of how we are fine-tuning our business with a surgical approach to improve efficiency, profitability and return on invested capital. That's the same philosophical view we are taking as we consider a range of ownership models for our North America land pressure pumping business. While we will continue to participate in this market, we are looking at models that will allow us to do so while mitigating the resource requirements and capital intensity that are inherent in this particular business segment.
To be clear, some of the changes to our full-service offerings provide an opportunity for conversion to an alternative business model by selling products and services to local service providers in the markets that we're rationalizing. However, I want to emphasize that the opportunities extend to markets where we have a limited or zero presence today. I'm very pleased by the customer responses so far, and we currently have a line of sight to a steady pipeline of revenue growth opportunities in this space, including some that could materialize in Latin America and the Middle East/Asia Pacific as early as the first quarter of 2017. We believe these local service providers represent a market segment that is under-supported. We've seen numerous examples of government programs with the goal of keeping more of the oilfield service and supply chain spending in-country by establishing homegrown companies. This is an ideal opportunity for Baker Hughes. Because of our leading technology, innovator mindset and catalog of world-class brands, we are uniquely positioned to enable this emerging customer segment in all facets of their business, spanning products, services training, technical support and consulting services, and position them to compete for and win local contracts, not just in a onetime transactional way but as part of a recurring, longer-term relationship that grows over time. While this opportunity needs some runway to develop, the growth potential is real, and it's obtainable.
Next, let me give you some thoughts on the market, how it's evolving and where we think it's heading. As we said in July and reiterated again in September, we continue to believe that oil prices in the mid- to upper 50s are required for a sustainable recovery in North America. Our customers also need to be more confident on the durability of those oil prices before making any significant change to the spending patterns. As we previously projected, the North American market has been continuing to grind slowly upward, and we expect that to continue. In order for a broader recovery to take place, a series of milestones need to be reached before the market can respond in a more predictable way. First, supply-demand surplus has to rebalance, allowing commodity prices to improve. Second, those commodity prices need to stabilize for confidence in the customer community to improve and their investment to accelerate. And third, activity needs to increase meaningfully before service capacity can be substantially absorbed and pricing recovery take place. Until then, we will continue to see this dislocation we have today in the relationship between commodity prices and services pricing.
In North America, we have seen a recent shift in land activity from what was predominantly small private operators adding rigs opportunistically to include larger, more established E&P companies. While we've seen customers growing more optimistic about the industry outlook, volatility and uncertainty remain. We expect the ramp-up to remain slow and pricing to remain challenging. And as a result, we expect only modest growth in the fourth quarter in North America.
Internationally, we see activity declines and pricing pressure continuing in the near term. And with customers controlling spending, we don't expect year-end seasonal product sales to offset those declines.
In Africa, where we have a significant deepwater drilling position, we expect our revenue to further decline as a result of ongoing reductions in deepwater activity. Additionally, in Norway, we expect to see a sequential revenue reduction as a result of the recently resolved local strikes, which impacted the first 2 weeks of the fourth quarter.
Conversely, in the Middle East/Asia Pacific region, we expect to see growth opportunities in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, India and Oman. And in Saudi Arabia, we continue to fortify our position with a focus on flawless execution across our full suite of product lines.
And finally, in Latin America, we expect the overall market to remain relatively flat, although a onetime product sell in Colombia during the third quarter will create a sequential headwind.
Now as we look ahead, it's also worth reiterating the obvious that the oil and gas ecosystem remains fragile and susceptible to shocks from headlines, difficult policy changes, currency fluctuation and geopolitical dynamics. And as I've said previously, the difference in this cycle is the more prominent role of the North American shale producer, who can achieve production growth and get it into the pipe far faster than conventional producers. As such, the elasticity of the unconventional segment could act as an effective ceiling on the commodity price.
So while we remain optimistic about recoveries prospects, we are positioning the company to prosper in a lower-for-longer market environment. In simple terms, that means delivering solutions to our customers that result in more efficient wells, optimized production and improved recovery.
Let me give you an example of how we are delivering more efficient wells for our customers. The DJ Basin in the Rockies has historically been a drilling motor market, but operators there are challenged to reach further with more and longer laterals. Conventional drilling systems lack the ability to stay in the target zone on longer laterals, and that limits the reach.
Last quarter, Baker Hughes combined 2 industry-leading products, our AutoTrak Curve rotary steerable system, the only continuous, proportional steering system in the market, with our Talon Force bit technology to increase lateral length from 5,000 feet to 10,000 feet while drilling 30% faster and delivering gun barrel quality holes.
Speed and reach are important, but speed and reach without borehole quality is a recipe for increased completions costs and premature wear on lift systems. So when you hit the sweet spot of fast and good, you have a clear competitive advantage, and that is what Baker Hughes does really well. We bring technology, products, systems and people that differentiate in the markets in which we choose to play. That's why one customer in the DJ Basin awarded us 100% of their work through 2017, and it's not just one customer. We now hold nearly 50% of the drilling share in that critical basin.
Touching on optimizing production. While it's always high on our customers' agenda, given today's market conditions, it's nothing short of an imperative. In some basins, particularly the Canadian oil sands, with high costs and long cycle time for new projects, frankly, it's a lifeline. Our chemicals portfolio is uniquely positioned to improve and sustain productivity for our customers in that market today, and we are seeing an increase in the demand for technology solutions in that area. For example, last month, we launched our new TRETOLITE SNAP water clarifier product designed for wells that require oil and water separation, like the steam-assisted gravity drainage, or SAGD, production facilities in Canada. During the oil and water separation process, dry oil and clean water usually come with undesired costs and operational instability, resulting from heat exchange refiling, oil and water recycling and slop oil generation. These issues drive costs up and production down. Prior to its commercial launch, we worked with an operator in Canada to try and run our TRETOLITE SNAP water clarifier, and the results were overwhelmingly differentiating. Over the treatment period, we lowered oil and water rates, basic sediment and water levels in the oil. This significantly reduced recycling, costly equipment clean-outs and slop production, all while increasing throughput capacity.
And finally, to increase ultimate recovery in a meaningful way, we require not only the aforementioned well construction and production improvement but also the development of a new range of sensing and intelligent products integrated into a broader digital framework. For several years now, we've been investing in next-generation electronics to deploy in the extreme environments that we face in drilling and completions. Our recent launch of SureSENS Elite is a great example for this in our completions business, designed to provide 20 years of downhole data in high-pressure, high-temperature wells. This design incorporates application-specific integrated circuits, or ASIC, technology that does not break down in high temperatures and delivers a next generation of reliability and accuracy for downhole gauges. The SureSENS Elite Gauge delivers ongoing pressure, temperature, flow and fluid density readings required to calculate estimated returns and optimize intelligent production systems. Initial market uptake has been strong, and we're currently ramping up the production.
I'm completely confident that as we focus on what we do best, differentiate ourselves in the marketplace with leading products and technology, make prudent decisions about where and how we go-to-market and continue to invest in our people, Baker Hughes will prosper no matter the environment.
So with that, let me hand it off to Kimberly, and I'll come back at the end of the call with a few final thoughts. Kimberly?"
19007,402293429,1060097,"Baker Hughes Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2016",2016-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Baker Hughes Holdings LLC","Executives","Thanks, Martin, and good morning, everyone.

Let me start by saying that like Martin, I am very pleased with the progress our teams have made. We have had a lot of moving parts recently. During the last 6 months, we restructured the organization, and people have now settled into the new role while at the same time focusing on the customer and executing our cost-reduction initiative. Additionally, we took steps to optimize our capital structure and continued to enhance processes around cost management, capital discipline and working capital.
Delivering on all of these objectives simultaneously ahead of schedule is a true testament of team performance. While we have more work to do, I have no doubt that we are on the right path.
Moving to our third quarter results. Today, we reported revenue for the third quarter of $2.4 billion, down 2% sequentially, primarily as a result of activity reductions in our Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and Norwegian deepwater operations. On a GAAP basis, the net loss for the quarter was $429 million or $1 per share. The adjusted net loss for the third quarter was $64 million or $0.15 per share. Adjusted net loss excluded $365 million in after-tax adjusting items or $0.85 per share, primarily related to additional impairments and restructuring charges. As a result of the restructuring actions taken this quarter, we have now achieved $600 million of annualized savings. Approximately 2/3 of the savings are related to lower compensation expense from workforce reductions, and another 1/3 of savings are associated with reduced depreciation and amortization expense from impairment. From a segment perspective, approximately 30% of the cost savings reside in North America, 65% in international and 5% in Industrial Services. The majority of the benefit is reflected in our third quarter results, with an estimate incremental benefit in the fourth quarter of approximately $20 million. Based on this progress, and as Martin alluded to earlier, we now expect to achieve a new annualized savings target of $650 million by year-end.
Heading into 2017, we fully expect those efforts to continue. For example, we are evaluating opportunities to further optimize our global manufacturing footprint, thus reducing under-absorption and achieving other sourcing efficiencies throughout the supply chain. Also, we continue to carry costs associated with North America land pressure pumping business as we work through our process to maximize shareholder value for that business.
Turning back to the third quarter. Adjusted operating profit before tax and interest for the quarter was $7 million, a sequential improvement of $462 million. Most of the improvement is driven by a reduction in operating costs as a result of the actions we have taken to align our cost structure to the realities in the market and by the reduction and provisions for doubtful accounts and excess inventory resulting mainly from the controls and processes we're establishing around receivables and inventory. Also, the third quarter results included the benefit of several nonrecurring items totaling $45 million.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter was a negative 19%. Our income tax rate has remained and will continue to remain volatile between the quarters as a result of the geographic mix of earnings, valuation allowances and certain discrete items.
Taking a closer look at our results from operations. In North America, revenue of $674 million increased 1% sequentially. The increase in U.S. onshore activity and the seasonal uptick in Canada were almost entirely offset by a steep decline of activity in the Gulf of Mexico. In the Gulf of Mexico, we experienced project delays and reduced drilling activity as reflected by the 22% drop in the U.S. offshore rig count. In the U.S. onshore, where most of the activity increases were driven by small, private E&P companies, we managed to outpace the sequential rig count growth in our drilling services and drill bits product lines. However, with almost half of our operations in the region associated with production, our business experiences less of an immediate correlation between revenue and the rig count. We see a similar dynamic in Canada where we are less impacted by the seasonality as a result of this mix.
Adjusted operating losses for the quarter were $74 million, with operating margins improving 1,192 basis points sequentially. This improvement was driven primarily by cost reductions, including lower depreciation and amortization expense from impairment and reduced provisions for excess inventory. The third quarter includes the benefit of approximately 410 basis points associated with non-reoccurring items.
Moving to international results. We reported revenue of $1.4 billion, which is a 4% decrease versus the prior quarter. Despite the overall decline, our Latin America revenue grew 3% sequentially. This increase was driven primarily by onetime product sales in Colombia, partially offset by reduced activity in the region, mainly in Venezuela within IOC and in Mexico. In our Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian segment, revenue was down 11% sequentially as a result of steep activity reductions, primarily in Norway and West Africa. In Norway, activity was impacted not only by the timing of drilling and completion schedule but also by delays that resulted from the recent union strikes. In West Africa, where we have a significant market share position in drilling, several large projects were temporarily suspended. The Middle East/Asia Pacific segment revenue was relatively flat sequentially as activity declines and price erosion across most of the region were offset by pockets of activity growth, primarily in Saudi and Kuwait.
International adjusted operating profit was $92 million, with operating margins up 2,540 basis points sequentially despite the decline in revenue. Sequentially, margins include 1,300 basis point benefit from provision of doubtful accounts mostly related to Ecuador and valuation allowances on indirect taxes in Africa not repeating in the third quarter. Margins also benefited from cost reductions and reduced provisions for excess inventory. Note that our current quarter margins include the benefit of approximately 180 basis points related to non-reoccurring items.
For Industrial Services segment, revenue for the third quarter was $268 million, down 2% sequentially. The decrease in revenue was mainly related to project delays in the pipeline inspection and maintenance business causing an earlier-than-usual seasonal decline. Industrial Services adjusted operating profit was $26 million, with operating margins increasing 824 basis points sequentially on declining revenue. The increase in margins was driven by cost savings and provisions for doubtful accounts from the second quarter not reoccurring. Also, the current quarter margins include the benefit of approximately 110 basis points related to non-reoccurring items.
Looking at cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $109 million in free cash flow, which includes $103 million of restructuring payments during the quarter. This quarter, we repurchased approximately 5.3 million shares on the open market totaling $263 million. In less than 6 months, we purchased more than half of the $1.5 billion of shares under our previously announced program. As such, we ended the third quarter with $3.7 billion of cash on the balance sheet, which positions us well to address the challenges and opportunities ahead.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $70 million, unchanged sequentially. We have recently implemented enhanced controls on capital spending to ensure that we maintain the needed discipline and focus on returns when activity begins to ramp up. For all of 2016, we still expect our capital expenditures to range between $300 million and $400 million.
Depreciation and amortization for the third quarter was $262 million, down $43 million or 14% sequentially. The asset impairments recorded in the third quarter are expected to result in approximately $35 million of annualized depreciation and amortization savings going forward.
To summarize, we've made good progress on our cost-reduction initiatives. Not only have we exceeded our original target for the year, but we've identified opportunities for further cost efficiencies. We have also continued to generate positive cash flow through managing our cost structure, reducing our working capital and maximizing return on invested capital.
And with that, let's go to Q&A. Alondra?"

What other items should we look at that were driving the sequential increase in EBITDA? Was it mix or some other things that helped drive that?

And as we said, now on an annualized basis, we do expect to get $650 million, of which $600 million is now done. With that said, there were some Q2 to Q3 items. Recall that in Q2, we had about $166 million of bad debt that didn't reoccur this quarter. Also, we had valuation allowances on indirect taxes last quarter, about $45 million. And in this quarter, we also recognized some non-reoccurring benefits, which were a bunch of small items largely related to some of the initiatives that we had with regard to cost reductions. And then also, we had provisions for excess inventories and -- that don't repeat this quarter. Then if we think of the Q4, I think there are a couple of things to recognize. First of all, again, we said that we have about $20 million more of savings that we expect in quarter 4. Obviously, the $45 million of one-offs this quarter will not repeat next quarter. And then a lot depends on activity. And keeping in mind that in Q4 last year, we saw some pullback during the holiday season, and so that could repeat this quarter again. And also, we don't expect to have a significant peak in direct sales in Q4, which historically has been a quarter when there are quite a bit of direct sales coming through."

You couple that bottom hole assembly with the drill bit in terms of maximizing steerability and durability, I mean, it's a beautiful thing to watch. You move to the production side, and a big part of our business in North America is the production portfolio. And as we migrate less and less from the pressure pumping, it's only going to become more. And the artificial lift, I think, is kind of a hidden goldmine. We continue to innovate in that space.

So if I had to frame it up, it's, first and foremost, drilling technology, followed by the artificial lift. And then as you've heard me say over and over, Byron, we've discussed the great thing about North American production is as wells get older, it's like people getting older, they need drugs. Our wells -- these wells need chemicals. And just as I highlighted in the oil sands, our chemical expertise and our folks in that area are constantly innovating for some new flow assurance and items.

It's just a -- it is going through a transition our customers are just battling their balance sheets, trying to get the costs in line. We still have a very positive view on a dollar-per-barrel recovery cost. It makes all the sense in the world. But at these commodity prices, I think my customers in West Africa need about $65. I think it's probably about $55 in the North Sea, and I think it's about the same in the Gulf. And until we see that, as we've said before, you just have to have some period of stability for them to come back. The nice thing about that market, as you know, is the focus on technology, reliability, quality. That's right up our alley.

So I think -- I can't give you the proxy as to some kind of indication out there of how you would model our North American revenue. It's been our intention, Bill, I can tell you, to continue to make this company focused on what it does best, which, in many regards, is going to make us increasingly more unique than our peers.

And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. This morning, I'm going to address several topics with you. First, I will provide an overview of our third quarter results and the improvement we achieved. Second, I will update you on our progress against the 3 financial and strategic objectives that we outlined in early May and provide further details on how we are aggressively executing on these plans. And finally, I will give you our perspective on the market, including how our views have evolved and how Baker Hughes is positioned for the opportunities ahead.
But look, before I get started, I want to take a moment and thank all of our employees for their commitment and effort in delivering a vastly improved quarter. The last 2 years have been extraordinarily challenging, and I'm very proud of their leadership and how they've responded to those challenges, remaining focused on working safely and compliantly and taking care of our customers.
Okay. Starting with the third quarter, we've made progress on all fronts. This is evident in our third quarter results. We recorded an adjusted net loss of $64 million or $0.15 per diluted share, an improvement of $328 million sequentially. While revenue declined 2% sequentially to $2.4 billion, reflecting lower activity levels and pricing pressure in key markets, we generated an adjusted operating profit of $7 million in the quarter. This represents an improvement of $462 million compared to the prior quarter and is an indication of the momentum in our cost reduction and business restructuring efforts.
Now let me provide an overview of our performance against the 3 objectives we outlined in May: one, reducing $500 million of costs by year-end through simplifying our organizational structure and operational footprint; two, focusing on our core strengths in product innovation by fortifying our full-service model and building broader sales channels for our products and technology; and three, optimizing our capital structure by paying down debt and buying back shares while ensuring we maintain financial flexibility. We've made significant progress against all of those objectives, and we are doing so with an overarching focus on profitable growth and return on invested capital.
Starting with costs. Last month, we said that we expected to achieve the $500 million in savings by the end of the third quarter, 3 months ahead of our original time line, and that we had identified additional savings opportunities beyond that. To that end, I'm pleased to say that we not only have achieved that goal, but we now expect the total annualized savings run rate to increase by 30% to $650 million by year-end. Kimberly will provide more details later in the call.
Turning to our efforts to fortify our core full-service business and build new sales channels for our products and technology, we continue to make significant progress. Previously, we said that we had identified opportunities to prune our product line portfolio and geomarket presence in certain markets by either exiting the market or converting it to an alternative sales channel. As previously highlighted, these exits and conversions represented less than 5% of total second quarter revenue. We expect to have 2/3 of these exits and conversions completed by the end of 2016.
As an example, we have recently converted select geographical areas within our drilling and completion fluids business in North America to a distribution model. We've completed one such conversion in the South Texas and Permian market, which will not only allow us to retain product revenue but will also take our products into new markets and increase our market share. For this particular product line, we will replicate this model elsewhere in the United States while retaining our current model in markets where the financial returns are more appealing. This business conversion illustrates how these alternative sales channels provide us an opportunity to grow with a minimal asset base.
This is just one example of how we are fine-tuning our business with a surgical approach to improve efficiency, profitability and return on invested capital. That's the same philosophical view we are taking as we consider a range of ownership models for our North America land pressure pumping business. While we will continue to participate in this market, we are looking at models that will allow us to do so while mitigating the resource requirements and capital intensity that are inherent in this particular business segment.
To be clear, some of the changes to our full-service offerings provide an opportunity for conversion to an alternative business model by selling products and services to local service providers in the markets that we're rationalizing. However, I want to emphasize that the opportunities extend to markets where we have a limited or zero presence today. I'm very pleased by the customer responses so far, and we currently have a line of sight to a steady pipeline of revenue growth opportunities in this space, including some that could materialize in Latin America and the Middle East/Asia Pacific as early as the first quarter of 2017. 
We believe these local service providers represent a market segment that is under-supported. We've seen numerous examples of government programs with the goal of keeping more of the oilfield service and supply chain spending in-country by establishing homegrown companies. This is an ideal opportunity for Baker Hughes. Because of our leading technology, innovator mindset and catalog of world-class brands, we are uniquely positioned to enable this emerging customer segment in all facets of their business, spanning products, services training, technical support and consulting services, and position them to compete for and win local contracts, not just in a onetime transactional way but as part of a recurring, longer-term relationship that grows over time. While this opportunity needs some runway to develop, the growth potential is real, and it's obtainable.
Next, let me give you some thoughts on the market, how it's evolving and where we think it's heading. As we said in July and reiterated again in September, we continue to believe that oil prices in the mid- to upper $50s are required for a sustainable recovery in North America. Our customers also need to be more confident on the durability of those oil prices before making any significant change to their spending patterns. As we previously projected, the North American market has been continuing to grind slowly upward, and we expect that to continue. 
In order for a broader recovery to take place, a series of milestones need to be reached before the market can respond in a more predictable way. First, supply-demand surplus has to rebalance, allowing commodity prices to improve. Second, those commodity prices need to stabilize for confidence in the customer community to improve and their investment to accelerate. And third, activity needs to increase meaningfully before service capacity can be substantially absorbed and pricing recovery take place. Until then, we will continue to see this dislocation we have today in the relationship between commodity prices and services pricing.
In North America, we have seen a recent shift in land activity from what was predominantly small private operators adding rigs opportunistically to include larger, more established E&P companies. While we've seen customers growing more optimistic about the industry outlook, volatility and uncertainty remain. We expect the ramp-up to remain slow and pricing to remain challenging. And as a result, we expect only modest growth in the fourth quarter in North America.
Internationally, we see activity declines and pricing pressure continuing in the near term. And with customers controlling spending, we don't expect year-end seasonal product sales to offset those declines.
In Africa, where we have a significant deepwater drilling position, we expect our revenue to further decline as a result of ongoing reductions in deepwater activity. Additionally, in Norway, we expect to see a sequential revenue reduction as a result of the recently resolved local strikes, which impacted the first 2 weeks of the fourth quarter.
Conversely, in the Middle East/Asia Pacific region, we expect to see growth opportunities in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, India and Oman. And in Saudi Arabia, we continue to fortify our position with a focus on flawless execution across our full suite of product lines.
And finally, in Latin America, we expect the overall market to remain relatively flat, although a onetime product sell in Colombia during the third quarter will create a sequential headwind.
Now as we look ahead, it's also worth reiterating the obvious, that the oil and gas ecosystem remains fragile and susceptible to shocks from headlines, difficult [ph] policy changes, currency fluctuation and geopolitical dynamics. And as I've said previously, the difference in this cycle is the more prominent role of the North American shale producer, who can achieve production growth and get it into the pipe far faster than conventional producers. As such, the elasticity of the unconventional segment could act as an effective ceiling on the commodity price.
So while we remain optimistic about recovery's prospects, we are positioning the company to prosper in a lower-for-longer market environment. In simple terms, that means delivering solutions to our customers that result in more efficient wells, optimized production and improved recovery.
Let me give you an example of how we are delivering more efficient wells for our customers. The DJ Basin in the Rockies has historically been a drilling motor market, but operators there are challenged to reach further with more and longer laterals. Conventional drilling systems lack the ability to stay in the target zone on longer laterals, and that limits the reach.
Last quarter, Baker Hughes combined 2 industry-leading products, our AutoTrak Curve rotary steerable system, the only continuous, proportional steering system in the market, with our Talon Force bit technology to increase lateral length from 5,000 feet to 10,000 feet while drilling 30% faster and delivering gun barrel quality holes.
Speed and reach are important, but speed and reach without borehole quality is a recipe for increased completions costs and premature wear on lift systems. So when you hit the sweet spot of fast and good, you have a clear competitive advantage, and that is what Baker Hughes does really well. We bring technology, products, systems and people that differentiate in the markets in which we choose to play. That's why one customer in the DJ Basin awarded us 100% of their work through 2017, and it's not just one customer. We now hold nearly 50% of the drilling share in that critical basin.
Touching on optimizing production. While it's always high on our customers' agenda, given today's market conditions, it's nothing short of an imperative. In some basins, particularly the Canadian oil sands, with high costs and long cycle time for new projects, frankly, it's a lifeline. Our chemicals portfolio is uniquely positioned to improve and sustain productivity for our customers in that market today, and we are seeing an increase in the demand for technology solutions in that area. For example, last month we launched our new TRETOLITE SNAP water clarifier product designed for wells that require oil and water separation, like the steam-assisted gravity drainage, or SAGD, production facilities in Canada. 
During the oil and water separation process, dry oil and clean water usually come with undesired costs and operational instability, resulting from heat exchange refiling, oil and water recycling and slop oil generation. These issues drive costs up and production down. Prior to its commercial launch, we worked with an operator in Canada to trial run our TRETOLITE SNAP water clarifier, and the results were overwhelmingly differentiating. Over the treatment period, we lowered oil and water rates, basic sediment and water levels in the oil. This significantly reduced recycling, costly equipment clean-outs and slop production, all while increasing throughput capacity.
And finally, to increase ultimate recovery in a meaningful way, we require not only the aforementioned well construction and production improvement but also the development of a new range of sensing and intelligent products integrated into a broader digital framework. For several years now, we've been investing in next-generation electronics to deploy in the extreme environments that we face in drilling and completions. 
Our recent launch of SureSENS Elite is a great example for this in our completions business, designed to provide 20 years of downhole data in high-pressure, high-temperature wells. This design incorporates application-specific integrated circuits, or ASIC, technology that does not break down in high temperatures and delivers a next generation of reliability and accuracy for downhole gauges. The SureSENS Elite gauge delivers ongoing pressure, temperature, flow and fluid density readings required to calculate estimated returns and optimize intelligent production systems. Initial market uptake has been strong, and we're currently ramping up the production.
I'm completely confident that as we focus on what we do best -- differentiate ourselves in the marketplace with leading products and technology, make prudent decisions about where and how we go to market and continue to invest in our people -- Baker Hughes will prosper, no matter the environment.
So with that, let me hand it off to Kimberly, and I'll come back at the end of the call with a few final thoughts. Kimberly?"

Let me start by saying that, like Martin, I am very pleased with the progress our teams have made. We have had a lot of moving parts recently. During the last 6 months, we restructured the organization, and people have now settled into their new role, while at the same time focusing on the customer and executing our cost-reduction initiatives. Additionally, we took steps to optimize our capital structure and continued to enhance processes around cost management, capital discipline and working capital.
Delivering on all these objectives simultaneously ahead of schedule is a true testament of team performance. While we have more work to do, I have no doubt that we are on the right path.
Moving to our third quarter results. Today, we reported revenue for the third quarter of $2.4 billion, down 2% sequentially, primarily as a result of activity reductions in our Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and Norwegian deepwater operations. On a GAAP basis, the net loss for the quarter was $429 million or $1 per share. The adjusted net loss for the third quarter was $64 million or $0.15 per share. Adjusted net loss excluded $365 million in after-tax adjusting items or $0.85 per share, primarily related to additional impairments and restructuring charges. 
As a result of the restructuring actions taken this quarter, we have now achieved $600 million of annualized savings. Approximately 2/3 of the savings are related to lower compensation expense from workforce reductions, and another 1/3 of savings are associated with reduced depreciation and amortization expense from impairments. From a segment perspective, approximately 30% of the cost savings reside in North America, 65% in International and 5% in Industrial Services. The majority of the benefit is reflected in our third quarter results, with an estimate incremental benefit in the fourth quarter of approximately $20 million. Based on this progress, and as Martin alluded to earlier, we now expect to achieve a new annualized savings target of $650 million by year-end.
Heading into 2017, we fully expect those efforts to continue. For example, we are evaluating opportunities to further optimize our global manufacturing footprint, thus reducing under-absorption and achieving other sourcing efficiencies throughout the supply chain. Also, we continue to carry costs associated with North America land pressure pumping business as we work through our process to maximize shareholder value for that business.
Turning back to the third quarter. Adjusted operating profit before tax and interest for the quarter was $7 million, a sequential improvement of $462 million. Most of the improvement is driven by a reduction in operating costs as a result of the actions we have taken to align our cost structure to the realities in the market and by the reduction and provisions for doubtful accounts and excess inventory resulting mainly from the controls and processes we're establishing around receivables and inventory. Also, the third quarter results included the benefit of several non-reoccurring items totaling $45 million.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter was a negative 19%. Our income tax rate has remained and will continue to remain volatile between the quarters as a result of the geographic mix of earnings, valuation allowances and certain discrete items.
Taking a closer look at our results from operations. In North America, revenue of $674 million increased 1% sequentially. The increase in U.S. onshore activity and the seasonal uptick in Canada were almost entirely offset by a steep decline of activity in the Gulf of Mexico. In the Gulf of Mexico, we experienced project delays and reduced drilling activity as reflected by the 22% drop in the U.S. offshore rig count. 
In the U.S. onshore, where most of the activity increases were driven by small, private E&P companies, we managed to outpace the sequential rig count growth in our drilling services and drill bits product lines. However, with almost half of our operations in the region associated with production, our business experiences less of an immediate correlation between revenue and the rig count. We see a similar dynamic in Canada, where we are less impacted by the seasonality as a result of this mix.
Adjusted operating losses for the quarter were $74 million, with operating margins improving 1,192 basis points sequentially. This improvement was driven primarily by cost reductions, including lower depreciation and amortization expense from impairments and reduced provisions for excess inventory. The third quarter includes the benefit of approximately 410 basis points associated with non-reoccurring items.
Moving to international results. We reported revenue of $1.4 billion, which is a 4% decrease versus the prior quarter. Despite the overall decline, our Latin America revenue grew 3% sequentially. This increase was driven primarily by onetime product sales in Colombia, partially offset by reduced activity in the region, mainly in Venezuela, within IOC and in Mexico. 
In our Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian segment, revenue was down 11% sequentially as a result of steep activity reductions, primarily in Norway and West Africa. In Norway, activity was impacted not only by the timing of drilling and completion schedules but also by delays that resulted from the recent union strikes. In West Africa, where we have a significant market share position in drilling, several large projects were temporarily suspended. 
The Middle East/Asia Pacific segment revenue was relatively flat sequentially as activity declines and price erosion across most of the region were offset by pockets of activity growth, primarily in Saudi and Kuwait.
International adjusted operating profit was $92 million, with operating margins up 2,540 basis points sequentially despite the decline in revenue. Sequentially, margins include a 1,300 basis point benefit from provision of doubtful accounts mostly related to Ecuador and valuation allowances on indirect taxes in Africa not repeating in the third quarter. Margins also benefited from cost reductions and reduced provisions for excess inventory. Note that our current quarter margins include the benefit of approximately 180 basis points related to non-reoccurring items.
For Industrial Services segment, revenue for the third quarter was $268 million, down 2% sequentially. The decrease in revenue was mainly related to project delays in the pipeline inspection and maintenance business causing an earlier-than-usual seasonal decline. Industrial Services adjusted operating profit was $26 million, with operating margins increasing 824 basis points sequentially on declining revenue. The increase in margins was driven by cost savings and provision for doubtful accounts from the second quarter not reoccurring. Also, the current quarter margins include the benefit of approximately 110 basis points related to non-reoccurring items.
Looking at cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $109 million in free cash flow, which includes $103 million of restructuring payments during the quarter. This quarter, we repurchased approximately 5.3 million shares on the open market totaling $263 million. In less than 6 months, we purchased more than half of the $1.5 billion of shares under our previously announced program. As such, we ended the third quarter with $3.7 billion of cash on the balance sheet, which positions us well to address the challenges and opportunities ahead.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $70 million, unchanged sequentially. We have recently implemented enhanced controls on capital spending to ensure that we maintain the needed discipline and focus on returns when activity begins to ramp up. For all of 2016, we still expect our capital expenditures to range between $300 million and $400 million.
Depreciation and amortization for the third quarter was $262 million, down $43 million or 14% sequentially. The asset impairments recorded in the third quarter are expected to result in approximately $35 million of annualized depreciation and amortization savings going forward.
To summarize, we've made good progress on our cost-reduction initiatives. Not only have we exceeded our original target for the year, but we've identified opportunities for further cost efficiencies. We have also continued to generate positive cash flow through managing our cost structure, reducing our working capital and maximizing return on invested capital.
And with that, let's go to Q&A. Alondra?"

I think you may have -- you touched on this, but looking at your results, revenue is down slightly sequentially, but you had over -- about a $200 million increase in EBITDA sequentially. Did I hear you right that you recognized about $600 million of savings already, annualized savings in the third quarter, and that accounts for probably the majority of the increase in EBITDA? What other items should we look at that were driving the sequential increase in EBITDA? Was it mix or some other things that helped drive that? 
And then thinking about the fourth quarter, it sounds like we have some more cost savings to kind of roll through. I just wanted to just kind of have you touch on that, please."

So clearly we did have some cost savings in the quarter that -- both from the initiatives that we did in Q2 as well as in Q3.

So clearly we did have some cost savings in the quarter that -- both from the initiatives that we did in Q2 as well as in Q3. And as we said, now on an annualized basis we do expect to get $650 million, of which $600 million is now done. 
With that said, there were some Q2 to Q3 items. Recall that in Q2, we had about $166 million of bad debt that didn't reoccur this quarter. Also, we had valuation allowances on indirect taxes last quarter of about $45 million. And in this quarter, we also recognized some non-reoccurring benefits, which were a bunch of small items largely related to some of the initiatives that we had with regard to cost reductions. And then also, we had provisions for excess inventories and -- that don't repeat this quarter. 
Then if we think of the Q4, I think there are a couple of things to recognize. First of all, again, we said that we have about $20 million more of savings that we expect in quarter 4. Obviously, the $45 million of one-offs this quarter will not repeat next quarter. And then a lot depends on activity. And keeping in mind that in Q4 last year we saw some pullback during the holiday season, and so that could repeat this quarter again. And also, we don't expect to have a significant peak in direct sales in Q4, which historically has been a quarter when there are quite a bit of direct sales coming through."

There are things like continuing to negotiate with our suppliers. We're also evaluating what and where we manufacture things, whether it's internally, externally. We're looking at that. We're looking at processes to reduce costs in our products and also to bring our products to market faster. We're looking at logistics and distribution.

I know you said you wanted -- you definitely want to have access, so some type of strategy around maybe taking that off of your plate to put it on somebody else's plate for -- at least for the time being.

I'll tell you, the -- by far, the competitive advantage as well as the secular change in the market with regards to longer laterals lines itself up very well to a proportional steering, rotary steerable, which is the AutoTrak Curve, we're the only one with that, and being able to drill a gauge hole the entire -- through the curve, through the lateral, avoid all the micro-doglegs that the competitor tools create. As these completions get longer and you've got to get your pipe to bottom, I mean, the market is rapidly steering itself right into our drilling bailiwick, if you will. You couple that bottom hole assembly with the drill bit in terms of maximizing steerability and durability, I mean, it's a beautiful thing to watch. 
You move to the production side, and a big part of our business in North America is the production portfolio. And as we migrate less and less from the pressure pumping, it's only going to become more. And the artificial lift, I think, is kind of a hidden gold mine. We continue to innovate in that space. I don't think our customers are paying attention to the electric bill as much as they should be. I think that's going to be another opportunity where technology is going to make a difference for our customers' lifting costs. 
So if I had to frame it up, it's first and foremost drilling technology, followed by the artificial lift. And then as you've heard me say over and over, Byron, we've discussed the great thing about North American production is, as wells get older, it's like people getting older, they need drugs, our wells -- these wells need chemicals. And just as I highlighted in the oil sands, our chemical expertise and our folks in that area are constantly innovating for some new flow assurance and items. So I'd stack it up in that category."

And so there might be some other initiatives like that, that will have -- where we'll spend some CapEx. 
So again, we haven't given the color for 2017 at this point. Very clearly right now I want to make sure everyone realizes it's not that we're starving the business from CapEx by any means; it's very much about what kind of returns are we getting. And obviously, there's been a decline in the overall activity, therefore, less requirements for CapEx. 
But with that said, not having the investments in rolling stocks and large facilities and other things for North America pressure pumping will obviously take some of the capital intensity away."

Internationally, I hate to say this, Jim, if we don't see $55 oil in the North Sea, it's not coming back. And I think we need $65 in West Africa. Russia is staying steady, I think for reasons that is really around production-level mandates versus pure economics. Parts of the Caspian and so forth are flat to trending down. 
Now Middle East is -- definitely continues to be a bright spot. And it gets back to low-cost producer wins in this market. So substantial, I think -- I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say substantial opportunity in Kuwait, Saudi, the United Arab Emirates and so forth, Oman.

And good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. This morning, I'm going to address several topics with you. First, I will provide an overview of our third quarter results and the improvement we achieved. Second, I will update you on our progress against the 3 financial and strategic objectives that we outlined in early May and provide further details on how we are aggressively executing on these plans. And finally, I will give you our perspective on the market, including how our views have evolved and how Baker Hughes is positioned for the opportunities ahead.
But look, before I get started, I want to take a moment and thank all of our employees for their commitment and effort in delivering a vastly improved quarter. The last 2 years have been extraordinarily challenging, and I'm very proud of their leadership and how they've responded to those challenges, remaining focused on working safely and compliantly and taking care of our customers.
Okay. Starting with the third quarter, we've made progress on all fronts. This is evident in our third quarter results. We recorded an adjusted net loss of $64 million or $0.15 per diluted share, an improvement of $328 million sequentially. While revenue declined 2% sequentially to $2.4 billion, reflecting lower activity levels and pricing pressure in key markets, we generated an adjusted operating profit of $7 million in the quarter. This represents an improvement of $462 million compared to the prior quarter and is an indication of the momentum in our cost reduction and business restructuring efforts.
Now let me provide an overview of our performance against the 3 objectives we outlined in May: one, reducing $500 million of costs by year-end through simplifying our organizational structure and operational footprint; two, focusing on our core strengths in product innovation by fortifying our full-service model and building broader sales channels for our products and technology; and three, optimizing our capital structure by paying down debt and buying back shares while ensuring we maintain financial flexibility. We've made significant progress against all of those objectives, and we are doing so with an overarching focus on profitable growth and return on invested capital.
Starting with costs. Last month, we said that we expected to achieve the $500 million in savings by the end of the third quarter, 3 months ahead of our original time line, and that we had identified additional savings opportunities beyond that. To that end, I'm pleased to say that we not only have achieved that goal, but we now expect the total annualized savings run rate to increase by 30% to $650 million by year-end. Kimberly will provide more details later in the call.
Turning to our efforts to fortify our core full-service business and build new sales channels for our products and technology, we continue to make significant progress. Previously, we said that we had identified opportunities to prune our product line portfolio and geomarket presence in certain markets by either exiting the market or converting it to an alternative sales channel. As previously highlighted, these exits and conversions represented less than 5% of total second quarter revenue. We expect to have 2/3 of these exits and conversions completed by the end of 2016.
As an example, we have recently converted select geographical areas within our drilling and completion fluids business in North America to a distribution model. We've completed one such conversion in the South Texas and Permian market, which will not only allow us to retain product revenue but will also take our products into new markets and increase our market share. For this particular product line, we will replicate this model elsewhere in the United States while retaining our current model in markets where the financial returns are more appealing. This business conversion illustrates how these alternative sales channels provide us an opportunity to grow with a minimal asset base.
This is just one example of how we are fine-tuning our business with a surgical approach to improve efficiency, profitability and return on invested capital. That's the same philosophical view we are taking as we consider a range of ownership models for our North America land pressure pumping business. While we will continue to participate in this market, we are looking at models that will allow us to do so while mitigating the resource requirements and capital intensity that are inherent in this particular business segment.
To be clear, some of the changes to our full-service offerings provide an opportunity for conversion to an alternative business model by selling products and services to local service providers in the markets that we're rationalizing. However, I want to emphasize that the opportunities extend to markets where we have a limited or zero presence today. I'm very pleased by the customer responses so far, and we currently have a line of sight to a steady pipeline of revenue growth opportunities in this space, including some that could materialize in Latin America and the Middle East/Asia Pacific as early as the first quarter of 2017. 
We believe these local service providers represent a market segment that is under-supported. We've seen numerous examples of government programs with the goal of keeping more of the oilfield service and supply chain spending in-country by establishing homegrown companies. This is an ideal opportunity for Baker Hughes. Because of our leading technology, innovator mindset and catalog of world-class brands, we are uniquely positioned to enable this emerging customer segment in all facets of their business, spanning products, services training, technical support and consulting services, and position them to compete for and win local contracts, not just in a onetime transactional way but as part of a recurring, longer-term relationship that grows over time. While this opportunity needs some runway to develop, the growth potential is real, and it's obtainable.
Next, let me give you some thoughts on the market, how it's evolving and where we think it's heading. As we said in July and reiterated again in September, we continue to believe that oil prices in the mid- to upper $50s are required for a sustainable recovery in North America. Our customers also need to be more confident on the durability of those oil prices before making any significant change to their spending patterns. As we previously projected, the North American market has been continuing to grind slowly upward, and we expect that to continue. 
In order for a broader recovery to take place, a series of milestones need to be reached before the market can respond in a more predictable way. First, supply-demand surplus has to rebalance, allowing commodity prices to improve. Second, those commodity prices need to stabilize for confidence in the customer community to improve and their investment to accelerate. And third, activity needs to increase meaningfully before service capacity can be substantially absorbed and pricing recovery take place. Until then, we will continue to see this dislocation we have today in the relationship between commodity prices and services pricing.
In North America, we have seen a recent shift in land activity from what was predominantly small private operators adding rigs opportunistically to include larger, more established E&P companies. While we've seen customers growing more optimistic about the industry outlook, volatility and uncertainty remain. We expect the ramp-up to remain slow and pricing to remain challenging. And as a result, we expect only modest growth in the fourth quarter in North America.
Internationally, we see activity declines and pricing pressure continuing in the near term. And with customers controlling spending, we don't expect year-end seasonal product sales to offset those declines.
In Africa, where we have a significant deepwater drilling position, we expect our revenue to further decline as a result of ongoing reductions in deepwater activity. Additionally, in Norway, we expect to see a sequential revenue reduction as a result of the recently resolved local strikes, which impacted the first 2 weeks of the fourth quarter.
Conversely, in the Middle East/Asia Pacific region, we expect to see growth opportunities in Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, India and Oman. And in Saudi Arabia, we continue to fortify our position with a focus on flawless execution across our full suite of product lines.
And finally, in Latin America, we expect the overall market to remain relatively flat, although a onetime product sell in Colombia during the third quarter will create a sequential headwind.
Now as we look ahead, it's also worth reiterating the obvious, that the oil and gas ecosystem remains fragile and susceptible to shocks from headlines, difficult [ph] policy changes, currency fluctuation and geopolitical dynamics. And as I've said previously, the difference in this cycle is the more prominent role of the North American shale producer, who can achieve production growth and get it into the pipe far faster than conventional producers. As such, the elasticity of the unconventional segment could act as an effective ceiling on the commodity price.
So while we remain optimistic about recovery's prospects, we are positioning the company to prosper in a lower-for-longer market environment. In simple terms, that means delivering solutions to our customers that result in more efficient wells, optimized production and improved recovery.
Let me give you an example of how we are delivering more efficient wells for our customers. The DJ Basin in the Rockies has historically been a drilling motor market, but operators there are challenged to reach further with more and longer laterals. Conventional drilling systems lack the ability to stay in the target zone on longer laterals, and that limits the reach.
Last quarter, Baker Hughes combined 2 industry-leading products, our AutoTrak Curve rotary steerable system, the only continuous, proportional steering system in the market, with our Talon Force bit technology to increase lateral length from 5,000 feet to 10,000 feet while drilling 30% faster and delivering gun barrel quality holes.
Speed and reach are important, but speed and reach without borehole quality is a recipe for increased completions costs and premature wear on lift systems. So when you hit the sweet spot of fast and good, you have a clear competitive advantage, and that is what Baker Hughes does really well. We bring technology, products, systems and people that differentiate in the markets in which we choose to play. That's why one customer in the DJ Basin awarded us 100% of their work through 2017, and it's not just one customer. We now hold nearly 50% of the drilling share in that critical basin.
Touching on optimizing production. While it's always high on our customers' agenda, given today's market conditions, it's nothing short of an imperative. In some basins, particularly the Canadian oil sands, with high costs and long cycle time for new projects, frankly, it's a lifeline. Our chemicals portfolio is uniquely positioned to improve and sustain productivity for our customers in that market today, and we are seeing an increase in the demand for technology solutions in that area. For example, last month we launched our new TRETOLITE SNAP water clarifier product designed for wells that require oil and water separation, like the steam-assisted gravity drainage, or SAGD, production facilities in Canada. 
During the oil and water separation process, dry oil and clean water usually come with undesired costs and operational instability, resulting from heat exchange refiling, oil and water recycling and slop oil generation. These issues drive costs up and production down. Prior to its commercial launch, we worked with an operator in Canada to trial run our TRETOLITE SNAP water clarifier, and the results were overwhelmingly differentiating. Over the treatment period, we lowered oil and water rates, basic sediment and water levels in the oil. This significantly reduced recycling, costly equipment clean-outs and slop production, all while increasing throughput capacity.
And finally, to increase ultimate recovery in a meaningful way, we require not only the aforementioned well construction and production improvement but also the development of a new range of sensing and intelligent products integrated into a broader digital framework. For several years now, we've been investing in next-generation electronics to deploy in the extreme environments that we face in drilling and completions. 
Our recent launch of SureSENS Elite is a great example for this in our completions business, designed to provide 20 years of downhole data in high-pressure, high-temperature wells. This design incorporates application-specific integrated circuits, or ASIC, technology that does not break down in high temperatures and delivers a next generation of reliability and accuracy for downhole gauges. The SureSENS Elite gauge delivers ongoing pressure, temperature, flow and fluid density readings required to calculate estimated returns and optimize intelligent production systems. Initial market uptake has been strong, and we're currently ramping up the production.
I'm completely confident that as we focus on what we do best -- differentiate ourselves in the marketplace with leading products and technology, make prudent decisions about where and how we go to market and continue to invest in our people -- Baker Hughes will prosper, no matter the environment.
So with that, let me hand it off to Kimberly, and I'll come back at the end of the call with a few final thoughts. Kimberly?"

Let me start by saying that, like Martin, I am very pleased with the progress our teams have made. We have had a lot of moving parts recently. During the last 6 months, we restructured the organization, and people have now settled into their new role, while at the same time focusing on the customer and executing our cost-reduction initiatives. Additionally, we took steps to optimize our capital structure and continued to enhance processes around cost management, capital discipline and working capital.
Delivering on all these objectives simultaneously ahead of schedule is a true testament of team performance. While we have more work to do, I have no doubt that we are on the right path.
Moving to our third quarter results. Today, we reported revenue for the third quarter of $2.4 billion, down 2% sequentially, primarily as a result of activity reductions in our Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and Norwegian deepwater operations. On a GAAP basis, the net loss for the quarter was $429 million or $1 per share. The adjusted net loss for the third quarter was $64 million or $0.15 per share. Adjusted net loss excluded $365 million in after-tax adjusting items or $0.85 per share, primarily related to additional impairments and restructuring charges. 
As a result of the restructuring actions taken this quarter, we have now achieved $600 million of annualized savings. Approximately 2/3 of the savings are related to lower compensation expense from workforce reductions, and another 1/3 of savings are associated with reduced depreciation and amortization expense from impairments. From a segment perspective, approximately 30% of the cost savings reside in North America, 65% in International and 5% in Industrial Services. The majority of the benefit is reflected in our third quarter results, with an estimate incremental benefit in the fourth quarter of approximately $20 million. Based on this progress, and as Martin alluded to earlier, we now expect to achieve a new annualized savings target of $650 million by year-end.
Heading into 2017, we fully expect those efforts to continue. For example, we are evaluating opportunities to further optimize our global manufacturing footprint, thus reducing under-absorption and achieving other sourcing efficiencies throughout the supply chain. Also, we continue to carry costs associated with North America land pressure pumping business as we work through our process to maximize shareholder value for that business.
Turning back to the third quarter. Adjusted operating profit before tax and interest for the quarter was $7 million, a sequential improvement of $462 million. Most of the improvement is driven by a reduction in operating costs as a result of the actions we have taken to align our cost structure to the realities in the market and by the reduction and provisions for doubtful accounts and excess inventory resulting mainly from the controls and processes we're establishing around receivables and inventory. Also, the third quarter results included the benefit of several non-reoccurring items totaling $45 million.
The effective tax rate for the third quarter was a negative 19%. Our income tax rate has remained and will continue to remain volatile between the quarters as a result of the geographic mix of earnings, valuation allowances and certain discrete items.
Taking a closer look at our results from operations. In North America, revenue of $674 million increased 1% sequentially. The increase in U.S. onshore activity and the seasonal uptick in Canada were almost entirely offset by a steep decline of activity in the Gulf of Mexico. In the Gulf of Mexico, we experienced project delays and reduced drilling activity as reflected by the 22% drop in the U.S. offshore rig count. 
In the U.S. onshore, where most of the activity increases were driven by small, private E&P companies, we managed to outpace the sequential rig count growth in our drilling services and drill bits product lines. However, with almost half of our operations in the region associated with production, our business experiences less of an immediate correlation between revenue and the rig count. We see a similar dynamic in Canada, where we are less impacted by the seasonality as a result of this mix.
Adjusted operating losses for the quarter were $74 million, with operating margins improving 1,192 basis points sequentially. This improvement was driven primarily by cost reductions, including lower depreciation and amortization expense from impairments and reduced provisions for excess inventory. The third quarter includes the benefit of approximately 410 basis points associated with non-reoccurring items.
Moving to international results. We reported revenue of $1.4 billion, which is a 4% decrease versus the prior quarter. Despite the overall decline, our Latin America revenue grew 3% sequentially. This increase was driven primarily by onetime product sales in Colombia, partially offset by reduced activity in the region, mainly in Venezuela, within IOC and in Mexico. 
In our Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian segment, revenue was down 11% sequentially as a result of steep activity reductions, primarily in Norway and West Africa. In Norway, activity was impacted not only by the timing of drilling and completion schedules but also by delays that resulted from the recent union strikes. In West Africa, where we have a significant market share position in drilling, several large projects were temporarily suspended. 
The Middle East/Asia Pacific segment revenue was relatively flat sequentially as activity declines and price erosion across most of the region were offset by pockets of activity growth, primarily in Saudi and Kuwait.
International adjusted operating profit was $92 million, with operating margins up 2,540 basis points sequentially despite the decline in revenue. Sequentially, margins include a 1,300 basis point benefit from provision of doubtful accounts mostly related to Ecuador and valuation allowances on indirect taxes in Africa not repeating in the third quarter. Margins also benefited from cost reductions and reduced provisions for excess inventory. Note that our current quarter margins include the benefit of approximately 180 basis points related to non-reoccurring items.
For Industrial Services segment, revenue for the third quarter was $268 million, down 2% sequentially. The decrease in revenue was mainly related to project delays in the pipeline inspection and maintenance business causing an earlier-than-usual seasonal decline. Industrial Services adjusted operating profit was $26 million, with operating margins increasing 824 basis points sequentially on declining revenue. The increase in margins was driven by cost savings and provision for doubtful accounts from the second quarter not reoccurring. Also, the current quarter margins include the benefit of approximately 110 basis points related to non-reoccurring items.
Looking at cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $109 million in free cash flow, which includes $103 million of restructuring payments during the quarter. This quarter, we repurchased approximately 5.3 million shares on the open market totaling $263 million. In less than 6 months, we purchased more than half of the $1.5 billion of shares under our previously announced program. As such, we ended the third quarter with $3.7 billion of cash on the balance sheet, which positions us well to address the challenges and opportunities ahead.
Capital expenditures for the quarter were $70 million, unchanged sequentially. We have recently implemented enhanced controls on capital spending to ensure that we maintain the needed discipline and focus on returns when activity begins to ramp up. For all of 2016, we still expect our capital expenditures to range between $300 million and $400 million.
Depreciation and amortization for the third quarter was $262 million, down $43 million or 14% sequentially. The asset impairments recorded in the third quarter are expected to result in approximately $35 million of annualized depreciation and amortization savings going forward.
To summarize, we've made good progress on our cost-reduction initiatives. Not only have we exceeded our original target for the year, but we've identified opportunities for further cost efficiencies. We have also continued to generate positive cash flow through managing our cost structure, reducing our working capital and maximizing return on invested capital.
And with that, let's go to Q&A. Alondra?"

I think you may have -- you touched on this, but looking at your results, revenue is down slightly sequentially, but you had over -- about a $200 million increase in EBITDA sequentially. Did I hear you right that you recognized about $600 million of savings already, annualized savings in the third quarter, and that accounts for probably the majority of the increase in EBITDA? What other items should we look at that were driving the sequential increase in EBITDA? Was it mix or some other things that helped drive that? 
And then thinking about the fourth quarter, it sounds like we have some more cost savings to kind of roll through. I just wanted to just kind of have you touch on that, please."

So clearly we did have some cost savings in the quarter that -- both from the initiatives that we did in Q2 as well as in Q3.

So clearly we did have some cost savings in the quarter that -- both from the initiatives that we did in Q2 as well as in Q3. And as we said, now on an annualized basis we do expect to get $650 million, of which $600 million is now done. 
With that said, there were some Q2 to Q3 items. Recall that in Q2, we had about $166 million of bad debt that didn't reoccur this quarter. Also, we had valuation allowances on indirect taxes last quarter of about $45 million. And in this quarter, we also recognized some non-reoccurring benefits, which were a bunch of small items largely related to some of the initiatives that we had with regard to cost reductions. And then also, we had provisions for excess inventories and -- that don't repeat this quarter. 
Then if we think of the Q4, I think there are a couple of things to recognize. First of all, again, we said that we have about $20 million more of savings that we expect in quarter 4. Obviously, the $45 million of one-offs this quarter will not repeat next quarter. And then a lot depends on activity. And keeping in mind that in Q4 last year we saw some pullback during the holiday season, and so that could repeat this quarter again. And also, we don't expect to have a significant peak in direct sales in Q4, which historically has been a quarter when there are quite a bit of direct sales coming through."

With regards to additional cost savings, so we're continuing to identify areas. I've talked in the past about opportunities around manufacturing cost savings. There are things like continuing to negotiate with our suppliers. We're also evaluating what and where we manufacture things, whether it's internally, externally. We're looking at that. We're looking at processes to reduce costs in our products and also to bring our products to market faster. We're looking at logistics and distribution. And we started already some of those initiatives, and they will continue into 2017. But at this point in time, we're not giving a specific number. As I've said, we've increased the cost savings target for this year on a run-rate basis to $650 million. And we'll continue to work for -- look for more opportunities."

I'll tell you, the -- by far, the competitive advantage as well as the secular change in the market with regards to longer laterals lines itself up very well to a proportional steering, rotary steerable, which is the AutoTrak Curve, we're the only one with that, and being able to drill a gauge hole the entire -- through the curve, through the lateral, avoid all the micro-doglegs that the competitor tools create. As these completions get longer and you've got to get your pipe to bottom, I mean, the market is rapidly steering itself right into our drilling bailiwick, if you will. You couple that bottom hole assembly with the drill bit in terms of maximizing steerability and durability, I mean, it's a beautiful thing to watch. 
You move to the production side, and a big part of our business in North America is the production portfolio. And as we migrate less and less from the pressure pumping, it's only going to become more. And the artificial lift, I think, is kind of a hidden gold mine. We continue to innovate in that space. I don't think our customers are paying attention to the electric bill as much as they should be. I think that's going to be another opportunity where technology is going to make a difference for our customers' lifting costs. 
So if I had to frame it up, it's first and foremost drilling technology, followed by the artificial lift. And then as you've heard me say over and over, Byron, we've discussed the great thing about North American production is, as wells get older, it's like people getting older, they need drugs, our wells -- these wells need chemicals. And just as I highlighted in the oil sands, our chemical expertise and our folks in that area are constantly innovating for some new flow assurance and items. So I'd stack it up in that category."

And so there might be some other initiatives like that, that will have -- where we'll spend some CapEx. 
So again, we haven't given the color for 2017 at this point. Very clearly right now I want to make sure everyone realizes it's not that we're starving the business from CapEx by any means; it's very much about what kind of returns are we getting.

We still have a very positive view on a dollar per barrel recovery cost; it makes all the sense in the world. But at these commodity prices, I think my customers in West Africa need about $65.

And also help us, Martin, as we think about 2017 top line in North America, what your expectations may be as relates to the Gulf of Mexico type of recovery. What's going to be a good proxy to determining how your top line grows? Is it just overall spending with regard to the universe of independent E&P companies? Or how do we think about that mix between the U.S. land, Canada and Gulf of Mexico next year?"

In terms of searching for a proxy as it relates to Baker Hughes North America, it's a challenge for you guys because you've got North America that's -- sorry, pressure pumping, which will be separated in some capacity. We have an increasingly strong mix in the production portfolio, which doesn't tie to the rig count as directly. And then you have a fireball with regards to this drilling technology and the growing lateral lengths, which is really polarizing the market and separating guys who can only offer motors and -- to the guys who can offer rotary steerable tools. 
So I think -- I can't give you the proxy as to some kind of indication out there of how you would model our North American revenue. It's been our intention, Bill, I can tell you, to continue to make this company focus on what it does best, which in many regards is going to make us increasingly more unique than our peers. And to -- another thread of all of this will be, as I said, the new channels that are even going to -- will participate in North America, like we did on our drilling fluids, and what that means to revenues versus accretive margins. So I'll leave it to you experts to figure out what that proxy is, but that's the best color I can give you right now."

But we remain very focused on execution. And I think our share position is going to just continue to grow, one, because of performance; and two, which I think is a bit lost on the marketplace, is where these wells are going, and you cannot drill them with a motor. Your torque and drag will just tear you up. So -- and we have the only rotary steerable that has the ability to gently push off and -- versus an on/off type of switch, which creates a pretty torturous well path.

Internationally, I hate to say this, Jim, if we don't see $55 oil in the North Sea, it's not coming back. And I think we need $65 in West Africa. Russia is staying steady, I think for reasons that is really around production-level mandates versus pure economics. Parts of the Caspian and so forth are flat to trending down. 
Now Middle East is -- definitely continues to be a bright spot. And it gets back to low-cost producer wins in this market. So substantial, I think -- I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say substantial opportunity in Kuwait, Saudi, the United Arab Emirates and so forth, Oman.
