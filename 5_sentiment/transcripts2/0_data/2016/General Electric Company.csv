Let me start with some thoughts on the macro environment and GE's fit in it. For the last few years, I've talked about a slow growth and volatile economy. This is still my view. In the fourth quarter, across our own large industrial footprin",1355,"Thanks, Matt. Let me start with some thoughts on the macro environment and GE's fit in it. For the last few years, I've talked about a slow growth and volatile economy. This is still my view. In the fourth quarter, across our own large industrial footprint, orders grew by 1% organically, and our backlog is at a record of $315 billion, up 7% organically. Our biggest industrial business, which is power, had organic orders growth of 29% in the quarter. I have a difficult time reconciling this with the mood that is in the market. Clearly, oil pricing is a concern and will have an impact, but our organic orders growth in the Middle East were up 14% in the quarter, so economic activity is ongoing. I know there's a concern about emerging markets in total, but our organic growth was up 7% in the quarter, x Alstom, and our business in China grew slightly organically in the year and backlog grew by 11%. So we're seeing a lot of economic volatility, but there's still enough business out there for GE to hit its goals. 
The GE team had a good quarter in a volatile environment. Total operating EPS was $0.52, up 27%, and Industrial EPS was $0.47, up 27%. Orders were up slightly and organic growth was down slightly versus a year ago. Total Industrial margins expanded by 80 basis points, and 2015 CFOA grew by 8% to $16.4 billion. Industrial profit expanded by 3% organically. 
We hit or exceeded all of our goals in 2015. Organic growth was up 3% with 80 [ph] basis points of margin expansion, leading to 7% organic profit growth. EPS was $1.31, up 17%. We achieved this despite having $0.05 of FX headwind. The verticals hit their plan, and capital returned $4.3 billion to the parent. Our cash and free cash flow execution was ahead of plan. We returned $33 billion to investors, including the excellent execution with Synchrony. We also executed a massive amount of portfolio change in the year. GE Capital exits are ahead of plan, with $157 billion of signings to date. The impact of Alstom was flat on EPS, slightly better than expected. Alstom had an impact on several segments, and Jeff will take you through those results. But on balance, we like what we see in Alstom. 
And last week, we announced the disposition of appliances to Haier for $5.4 billion. This will create an attractive gain and allow us to significantly increase our restructuring targets in 2016. So we're committed to our 2016 framework in the face of macroeconomic volatility. 
Now for orders. Orders grew by 3%, which was up 1% organically. And as I said earlier, our backlog is $315 billion, up 7%, x Alstom. Alstom added $29 billion to our backlog. Services grew by 5%, which is up 3% organically, and equipment grew by 2%, which was down slightly organically. 
Service orders were strong. Power Gen service orders grew by 13% x Alstom, and commercial aviation service 
were up 14%. Healthcare service orders were up 3%, and Alstom orders were $2.6 billion. We had some nice wins with Alstom in China on the hydro business. Several combined cycle gas turbine power plants with richer GE content, and the Hinckley Point nuclear steam turbine in the United Kingdom. 
On the product side of GE, we also had some solid highlights. Two I'll call out. Power booked 12 age terminal orders in the quarter, and we now have 33 in backlog. In addition, we have another 49 technical selections. And in Healthcare, our MRO orders grew by 18% in the quarter, and our bioprocessing grew by 16% in the quarter, so great results by those businesses. 
Globally, orders were generally positive growing 8% in total and 12% in growth regions. As I said earlier, we had strength in the Middle East and ASEAN and India, and Latin America was also decent. Including Alstom, China was up 15% in orders in the quarter and backlog grew by 16% to $21 billion. 
Order pricing was up 0.9% in the quarter, and we have good pricing momentum in both aviation and power. So overall, our backlog and orders pricing gives us high visibility as we approach our organic growth targets in 2016. 
So let's talk about the execution of the team and what you saw in the segment results. Overall, the team executed in a tough environment and the quarter organic growth was down slightly. But for the year, organic growth was up 3% with 7 of 8 segments growing. Service remained steady, up 5% in the year and 4% in the quarter organically. The oil and gas team, I'd really like to call out, because I think they executed very well in 2015. With a 7% decline in revenue, their organic operating profit grew by 1%, and this is ahead of what we said last year. Our team executed on restructuring. They improved their value gap and they invested in the core franchise. And we expect the team to continue to execute in 2016. 
Looking at revenue in 2016. Let me just give you a few metrics and some things to think about. We primarily shipped from backlogs, so orders and backlog growth matter. In 2015, 6 of 7 businesses grew backlog, some substantially. When we do our analytics around convertible backlog and business performance, we see a path to 2% to 4% organic growth for '16, even with a very difficult oil and gas market. The most robust part of our business is service. Service backlog grew by 16% in 2015, and we expect another year of 20%-plus growth in our digital applications. Both of these support sustained growth and services. We had another strong quarter and year-end margins. For the year, Industrial margins were up 80 basis points at the segment level and 110 basis points overall. Services were up 40 basis points and equipment was up 20 basis points. We continue to make good progress on value gap, up more than $450 million on the year in cost productivity. Mix was favorable in the quarter. And in addition, we have solid momentum for cost out. Again, due to the higher appliances gain, we can do a record level of restructuring in '16 to fortify our framework. Specifically, we believe we can execute on an incremental $1.7 billion in the year, which should yield incremental benefit. 
Last year, we discussed the new compensation plan that's aligned with investors and deliver results. I'm convinced that this incentivize our team to deliver superior results in '15, and we have set our 2016 targets to drive our framework. Our strategy and business model is paying off, and we believe we can deliver strong performance in the face of economic volatility. 
Now for cash. CFOA grew for the year by 8%. Industrial free cash flow grew by 4%, and total free cash flow grew by 14% to $13.5 billion. Total year core industrial cash flow, x Alstom, was $12.6 billion, up 3%. And total year free cash flow conversion was 85%, in line with our expectations. 
GE Capital dividends were $4.3 billion for the year, and we're still on track for $18 billion of dividends for the parent in 2016. The balance sheet is very strong, and the price for appliances was a pleasant surprise. The business had been improving, and there's strong interest in the business. And a price of $5.4 billion gives us more than $1.3 billion of incremental cash. 
For capital allocation, we returned $33 billion in the year, including Synchrony. And looking at 2016, we're still on track to return $26 billion to investors in dividend and buyback. 
So before I turn over to Jeff, let me reflect a little on the Alstom results. We've integrated 2 months of revenue, all of the deal-related costs and the impact of the joint ventures, all for the first time. There's inherent complexities as we go through it, so bear with us. But in general, I would say the business and our outlook and our execution are on track, and we're still excited about Alstom."
177031,314408325,920262,"General Electric Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2016",2016-01-22,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the fourth quarter summary. Revenues were $33.9 billion, up 1% in the quarter. Industrial revenues, including corporate, were up 3% to $31.3 billion. You can see on the right side that Industrial segments were down 1% reporte",4493,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the fourth quarter summary. Revenues were $33.9 billion, up 1% in the quarter. Industrial revenues, including corporate, were up 3% to $31.3 billion. You can see on the right side that Industrial segments were down 1% reported and down 1% organic. Alstom revenue of $2 billion in the quarter was offset by a $1.3 billion of foreign exchange and dispositions of $700 million. 
Industrial operating plus verticals EPS was $0.52, up 27%, and that's driven by industrial up 27% and verticals flat. The operating EPS number of $0.31 includes other continuing GE Capital activity, including headquarter runoff and other exit-related items I'll cover in more detail shortly. $0.26 of continuing EPS includes the impact of nonoperating pension, and net EPS of $0.64 includes discontinued operations. The total disc ops act was a positive $3.7 billion, driven by the $3.4 billion gain from Synchrony and earnings from the businesses held in sale. 
As Jeff said, we generated $16.4 billion of CFOA for the year. That's up 8%. Industrial CFOA was $12.1 billion, down 1%, but up 3% when you exclude Alstom CFOA and taxes associated with the disposition signaling. The GE tax rate was 5%, bringing the total year rate to 14%. The tax rate in the quarter was driven by the appliances transaction moving into 2016, tax benefits associated with integrating our existing service business with Alstom's business in Switzerland, higher tax benefits principally on the signaling gain we had in the quarter and legislation made in the U.S. research credit permanent. The reported GE Capital tax rate in the quarter of 39% reflects a tax benefit on a pretax loss. The tax rate for the vertical businesses was a negative 13%, reflecting reduced income in DFS and international tax benefits that will diminish as we complete the GE Capital exit plan. Going forward, as we complete the exit, we expect GE Capital vertical tax rate to be approximately 10%. 
On the right side of the segment results. As I've mentioned, Industrial segment revenues were down 1% reported and down 1% organic with foreign exchange and dispositions offsetting Alstom. The foreign exchange was a $1.3 billion drag on Industrial segment revenue and $163 million impact on Industrial segment op profit. The power renewables and energy management businesses were impacted by the Alstom acquisition, and I'll walk you through the impact on the next page. At the December outlook meeting, we said we would present Industrial results including corporate operating cost. On that basis, industrial op profit for the quarter was down 6% reported, but up 3% organically on strong corporate cost performance. 
To give you context on the quarter, organic revenue at down 1% was a little over $1 billion lower than we expected. This was driven by power, lower by about $350 million, on expanded scope and BOP, arrow and reciprocating engines that did not close in the quarter, about $400 million in renewables on lower wind turbines, which I'll cover more on shortly, and $300 million of softness in oil and gas and $100 million of softness in convertible orders in our energy management business. Most of the $1 billion was timing, and we expect it to convert in 2016. For the full year, organic revenue was up 3%. 
What's laid out on this page is the impact of Alstom on the power, renewables and energy management businesses. You can see the reported op profit of the businesses in the first column, the impact of Alstom in the middle column and the op profit in these, excluding Alstom, on the right. Power on a stand-alone basis would have been down 5%, renewables would've been down 54% and energy management would've been up 4%. The outsized impact of Alstom in Energy Management business is due to the JV structure of Digital Energy in the Alstom Grid business. We contributed positive earnings from Digital Energy to Alstom's business that had negative earnings. Remember, this is a 50-50 JV and we consolidate 100% of the revenue but record only 50% of the earnings. In the case of Energy Management, the 17% [ph] organic V reflects the organic performance for the Power Conversion in Industrial Solutions business, which is how we report organic for this segment going forward. The organic including Digital Energy, would have been plus 19%. In the quarter, the EPS impact of Alstom was breakeven. With a pretax loss of $234 million in the segments and an additional $160 million of deal cost and accounting items at corporate, offset by a positive tax benefits. Revenue was $2 billion, and orders were $2.6 billion. As we look to 2016, no change in the guidance we gave you of $0.05 of EPS from Alstom. 
Next, I'll do the earnings walk as we've been doing for the last number of quarters, so you'll understand the dynamics clearly on what's going on in earnings. Starting with the first column on the left and working down. Industrial operating net income was $4.6 billion, and vertical income was $438 million, for total industrial plus verticals operating earnings of $5.1 billion. 
On the other GE Capital line, we incurred $2.1 billion of costs in the quarter. This was driven by restructuring charges, the preferred dividend payment, headquarter runoff, operating expenses and excess interest cost. We also took an impairment of about $800 million related to the city power plant asset, which I'll cover more on in the GE Capital page. As a result, total operating earnings were $3 billion. Including nonoperating pension cost, continuing earnings were $2.6 billion. We had a $3.7 billion of income in discontinued operations, principally related to the Synchrony gain. Adjusting for these items, net earnings for the quarter were $6.3 billion. In the center and the far right columns, you can see the associated EPS numbers and the variants versus prior year. On the next page, industrial other items for the quarter, we had $0.04 of charges related to industrial restructuring and other items. They were taken at corporate. Charges were $567 million on a pretax basis with $160 million of those charges related to the Alstom deal cost and accounting items. We also had $1 billion of industrial gains in the quarter, which equated to $0.08 of EPS at the transactional tax rate. The pretax signaling gain was $622 million, and the appliance breakup fee was $175 million. Additionally, we sold our embedded controls businesses in Energy Management and our business in Healthcare. 
On the bottom of the page, you can see the total year restructuring gains profile. We incurred restructuring charges of $0.12 and had gains of $0.11, for a net charge of $0.01 for the year. This was $0.02 better than we communicated in December, driven by about $0.01 of lower restructuring, primarily Alstom-related, and slightly higher gains driven by predominantly tax at the transaction level. 
For 2016, we expect gains in restructuring to largely offset for the year. However, there will be a quarterly variability in the timing. As Jeff mentioned, we signed the appliances transaction, which we expect to contribute about $0.20 of gain midyear this year. That, combined with some smaller transactions, should yield gains of about $0.25 in 2016. We will use this opportunity to continue to invest in improving the Industrial margins and costs. This will benefit us not only in 2016 but will position us well for 2017 and 2018. 
Now I'll go through the segments, starting with the power business. With the combination of Alstom into the power segment, we have reorganized some of the sub businesses, so I'll take a minute to walk through these changes. First, the thermal business was renamed gas power systems. This business includes gas turbines and steam and generators for combined cycle applications. And additionally, we moved the equipment side of the arrow turbines business to gas power system. Second, those power services business includes our PGS business and services related to arrow turbines. The distributed power business now includes just our reciprocating engines and the service businesses for yen Bogra and Waukesha. Additionally, as you know, we have a stand-alone steam business that we acquired from Alstom. 
Moving to the financial results. Orders in the quarter of $9.6 billion, including $1 billion of Alstom orders, grew 40%. Excluding Alstom, orders were $8.6 billion, up 25%, with equipment orders up 46% and services up 8%. Within equipment orders, gas power systems was higher by 60%, ex Alstom. The increase was driven by orders for 55 gas turbines versus 41 last year and expanded scope, including BOP, for a large Saudi 7F order. In the fourth quarter, we took new orders for 12 H turbines versus 2 last year, 5 units in the U.S., 4 in Pakistan and 3 in Asia. Our H backlog now totals 33 with an additional 49 technical selections for a total of 82 units. 
Arrow turbine orders were down 14% on 43 units versus 50 last year and Distributed Power engines were lower by 12% with weakness in Waukesha gas compression, partly offset by strong orders in yen Bogra. Equipment OPI was strong at 6.7%, driven by H turbine demand. 
Service orders, excluding Alstom, grew 8% on higher installations, growth in multiyear contracts and strong upgrades. AGP sold total 42 for the quarter versus 26 a year ago, bringing total year orders on AGPs to 119. Alstom orders, as I mentioned, totaled $1 billion, including 2 steam turbines and 6 HSRGs, one in conjunction with GE orders. Ex Alstom, equipment backlog ended at $8.3 billion, up 15%. [ph] Service backlog grew 4% to $53 billion. In total, power backlog ended the year at $62 billion, ex Alstom, and $77 billion with Alstom. 
Core GE revenues were $6.2 billion, down 10% and down 7% organically. Equipment revenues were down 25%, driven by fewer gas turbine shipments, foreign exchange and lower balance of plant. In the quarter, the business shipped 28 gas turbines versus 44 a year ago. Total year shipments were 107 units. Lower units and lower BOP were driven by no repeatable large Algerian deal in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Service revenues were up 1%, driven by power services up 8%. AGPs were 35 in the quarter versus 24 a year ago, bringing total shipments to 104 for the year. Strength in power services partly offset by lower Distributed Power service, down 15%. Alstom revenues in the quarter totaled $917 million with $255 million from equipment and $662 million from services. 
GE core operating profit was $1.7 billion, down 5%. The decrease was driven by lower volume and partially offset by positive value gap. Margins improved to 140 basis points in the quarter. Alstom operating profit was a loss of $80 million, reflecting operations, deal costs and accounting adjustments. Given the scale of the Alstom consolidation on our first close, things went reasonably well. The core business came in a little lower in revenue than expected driven by the timing of BOP and arrow engine shipments. However, orders were better than expected on strong demand for both H&F products, particularly in Saudi and Pakistan. 
2016 is a big execution year with the Alstom integration, shipping approximately 24 H turbines and executing on our product cost strategy. In total, we expect to ship 110 gas turbines and 125 AGTs, with 60% to 65% of these units shipping in the second half of the year in 2016. 
Next, I'll cover Renewables. Total renewable orders were $2.5 billion in the quarter, up 1%. Excluding Alstom, orders were $2 billion, down 18% and down 10% ex foreign exchange. We took orders for 827 wind turbines versus 1,251 a year ago in the quarter. The decline was a result of lower U.S. orders, partly driven by the strength of the fourth quarter of last year related to the PTC extension. This year, the PTC extension includes a multiyear phaseout. 
Orders were also impacted by the shift from the 1 dotx product line to the new 2.x and 3.x products that drive fewer units but more megawatts. Additionally, we have 3 deals delayed to 2016 for a total of 240 turbines or about $550 million of orders. 
Orders outside the U.S. were up 19%, ex FX, and down 2% reported, with strength in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia. Backlog in the Renewables core business ended at $7.1 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Alstom renewable orders were $469 million in the quarter, with a large hydro wind of $400 million in China at the 3 Gorges Project. Alstom added $5.3 billion of backlog to the Renewables business. 
Renewables revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $1.9 billion, lower by 16% and down 8%, ex exchange. The legacy GE business had revenue of $1.9 billion, down 20% reported and down 12% ex foreign exchange. Core unit shipments were 847 in the quarter versus 1,081 last year. This was lower than expected as 2 deals for 165 turbines pushed into 2016. 
Operating profit, ex Alstom, was $125 million, down 54%. The decline was attributable to lower volume of 234 units, negative mix from the new 2.x product as we come down the cost curve and foreign exchange. Alstom op profit was a loss of $69 million. 
In 2016, we expect to ship about 3,050 onshore turbines, including 250 of Alstom wind units. As Jeff discussed earlier, 2016 organic revenues should be high single digits or low double digits, depending on the mix of unit shipped. Core op profit should be flat to up slightly as the business focus on improving the cost curve for the new 2.0 and 3.0 megawatt product launches and delivering $100 million of Alstom cost synergies. 
Next, on aviation. Global passenger travel continues to grow robustly, up 6.7% November year-to-date. Both domestic and international markets are strong, particularly in the Middle East and Asia Pacific. Airfreight volume grew 2.3% November year-to-date. Orders in the fourth quarter of $6.8 billion were down 16%. Commercial engine orders were down 47%, as expected. We booked $1.9 billion of engine orders including $100 million of GE90, $600 million of GEnx orders, $400 million of LEAP CFM orders and $500 million of CF6 orders. Commercial equipment backlog ended the year at $29.5 billion, up 11%. Military equipment orders of $353 million in the quarter were higher by 2x on a large Navy F414 order. 
Service orders were higher by 9% with strong commercial orders, up 10%, to $39 million a day, and CSAs were up 24% in the quarter. Military services were down 20%. Services backlog ended the year at over $116 billion, up 15% versus last year. 
Revenues of $6.7 billion were up 5% with commercial equipment revenues down 5%. We shipped 59 GEnx units versus 77 last year, driven by schedule. We have no delinquencies to Boeing. Military equipment revenue was down 1%, and services revenue was up strongly at 18%, driven by commercial services, up 24%. Operating profit grew 12% on strength of services, positive value gap and good cost productivity. Operating margin rates improved 160 basis points. 
The aviation team delivered another solid execution year. For the year, revenues grew 3%, operating profit grew 11% and margins expanded 160 basis points. Our share in each of our entry platforms is very strong, and the LEAP launch remains on track for midyear. We expect another solid year from David Joyce and the team in aviation. 
Next is oil and gas. The segment continues to operate in a very difficult environment, and we continue to be focused on being hypercompetitive on new opportunities and very aggressive on the cost structure. For the fourth quarter, orders of $3.3 billion were down 35% and down 28% organically. Equipment orders were down 52% or 44% organically. All segments had lower orders driven by delays and reduced CapEx spending with the exception of our downstream platform, which grew orders 51% reported and up 84% organically. 
For the other segments on a reported basis, Subsea was down 49%, TMS was down 78% and surface was down 65%. Service orders were down 17% and down 13% organically. On a reported basis, TMS was down 24%, surface was down 29%, Subsea was down 35% and MNC was down 18%, partly offset by downstream, which grew service orders by 20%. Not included in orders but included in backlog, TMS signed 4 new long-term service agreements, totaling $1.5 billion in the quarter. Total backlog ended the year at about $23 billion, which was down 9% versus last year and down 4% ex exchange. 
Revenues in the quarter were down 16% reported and down 6% organic. Foreign exchange reduced revenues $437 million in the quarter. Equipment revenues were down 21% reported and 12% organically. By business, surface was down 49%, TMS down 18%, Subsea down 15%. Organically, TMS was down 8%, Subsea was down 5%. Service revenues were down 9% and flat organically, with MNC down 5%, offset by TMS, up 22% organically. 
Operating profit in the quarter was down 19% and down 7% organic. Foreign exchange in the quarter was a $93 million headwind. The business continue to deliver on cost reductions and deflation was partially offset the negative volume and price. Margin rates were down 70 basis points. On an organic basis, margins contracted 10 basis points. The business executed an early and aggressive cost-out program beginning in 2014, delivering $600 million of cost out during 2015. For the year, revenue and op profit were down 5% and up 1%, respectively. And organic margin rates actually expanded 90 basis points. 
For 2016, our best view for revenues and op profit continues to be down 10% to 15%, most likely at the bottom end of that range given the outlook for the industry and our view of volume and price. 
Our base plan at December outlook called for $400 million of cost out in 2016 to get to the $1 billion run rate over 2015 and '16. We are working on another $400 million of additional cost-out reductions to offset the likely lower volume and price pressure. We expect the first half to be tougher year-over-year versus the second half, and Lorenzo and his team have executed very well in 2015, and we expect the business will continue to outperform on a relative basis in 2016. 
Next up is Healthcare. Orders of $5.2 billion were down 4% but up 1% organically. Geographically, orders in the U.S. were down 1%, Europe was down 8% and up 4% ex FX and the Middle East region was down 4% and up 5% ex FX. China was down 6% reported and down 3% ex FX. Tenders in China continue to improve slowly. Year-over-year, tenders were flat after several quarters of contraction. 
In terms of business lines, Healthcare systems orders were down 6% and down 1%, excluding exchange. The U.S. was down 2%, driven by lower molecular imaging and x-ray on tough comparisons, offset partially by strong MR, up 33% and ultrasound up 5% on new product upgrades. Europe was down 8% reported, but grew 5% ex foreign exchange. Europe was up 5% ex FX for the year and has seen 6 consecutive quarters of organic growth. orders were down 11% reported and down 9% excluding exchange. Our current outlook for 2016 is for orders growth in China as government tenders begin to rebound. 
Life Sciences continue to perform very well. In the fourth quarter, orders grew 2%, up 8% ex exchange. Within life sciences, bioprocess grew 16%, ex FX, with strength in Korea, China and the U.S.
Healthcare revenues were down 3% reported and up 3% ex FX. Healthcare systems revenues were lower by 4% reported and up 3% ex FX, and Life Sciences revenues grew 6%, excluding exchange. 
Operating profit was lower versus the fourth quarter of last year by 4%, excluding exchange, and lower by 8% reported. Volume growth and cost productivity were more than offset by price and higher growth investments. Margin rates contracted 100 basis points in the quarter. 
In 2016, we expect Healthcare business to improve operationally in terms of earnings and margin rates. Our outlook is for the Life Science business to continue to grow strongly, profitably and for the HCS business to execute the digital transformation and aggressively reduce product and service cost. 
In transportation, North America carloads were down 6.4% in the quarter, driven by very weak carloads in coal, down almost 20% and petroleum down 13%. Intermodal volume was also down 4% of the quarter. For the year, volume was down 2.2%, driven by commodities with intermodal higher by 2%. Lower volume and operational improvements have improved velocity on the rails, on average 2.4 miles an hour. That's up 10% versus last year. For our business, orders in the quarter were very strong, up 66% to $3.2 billion, driven by equipment orders up 113%. We took our largest order ever of 1,000 locos in India and also secured an order for 100 Tier 4s in the U.S. 
Service orders were down 6%, ex signaling, on lower overall volume driven by increased parked locos. Revenues were up 2% reported and up 11% ex signaling. Equipment revenues were higher by 17%, 27% organically, principally driven by locomotives, partially offset by services, down 8%, on lower overhauls. 
Op profit was higher in the quarter by 18%, ex signaling, and up 8% reported. Increased local volume, value gap and productivity drove earnings higher. Margins improved 100 basis points reported and 120 basis points organically. The transportation team delivered a tremendous year. Excluding the signaling sale, they grew revenue 7%, operating profits 16% and improved margins 150 basis points. They launched and delivered 425 Tier 4 locomotives on time, on cost, and the performance significantly exceeded customer expectations. 2016 is going to be a more challenging year with softer demand in the U.S. and in the commodity markets. We shipped 985 locos in 2015 and expect to ship about 800 in 2016. The team is executing an aggressive cost plan to address the lower volume. We expect the business to be down mid-single-digit on op profit in 2016. 
On Energy Management there, as I mentioned earlier, describing results for Energy Management is complicated by the contribution of our Digital Energy business to the grid JV. For financial reporting purposes, we'll report 100% of the grid JV's orders and revenues but only report 50% of their earnings. Going forward, we'll report results on this basis, but all our organic calculations will include only Industrial Solutions and the Power Conversion business. 
Orders in the quarter were $2.6 billion, up 15% reported. Of the $2.6 billion, $1.1 billion was from the grid business with Alstom contributing $716 million and Digital Energy business contributing $342 million. Digital Energy orders were down 10% reported and down 8% organically. Power Conversion orders were down 17% and down 11% organically on no repeat of large renewable orders in the fourth quarter of last year. For the total year, Power Conversion orders were very strong, up 19% organically. Industrial Solutions orders in the quarter were down 17% reported and down 11% organically, driven by foreign exchange and dispositions. 
North America demand in the quarter was weak across all Industrial Solutions segments. Backlog for the quarter ended at $11.7 billion. Reported revenues of $2.4 billion were higher by 20%. Grid solutions revenue totaled $952 million, inclusive of $393 million of Digital Energy revenue. Industrial Solutions revenues were down 8% and down 4% organically. 
Power Conversion was down 6% but up 9% organically. 
Reported op profit for the Energy Management segment was $33 million, which includes the effects of establishing the grid JV and Alstom's results. Before the effects of Alstom, as I covered earlier, Energy Management earned $118 million of op profit, up 4%, driven by productivity and the gain on sale of our business, partly offset by lower Industrial Solutions volume. The contribution of our Digital Energy business to the grid JV, combined with the Alstom Grid operating results, equal the loss, which we recorded at 50% or $5 million. 
Next, we announced last week and just spoke about it earlier, we have an agreement to sell our appliance unit to Haier, which we expect to close midyear. Fourth quarter results for both appliances and lighting had revenue essentially flat. Appliance revenue was up slightly from last year and lighting saw flat revenue and growth organically. LED growth in the quarter was 28%. Operating profit for the segment was up 28% with very strong performance in appliances, up 51%, on strong cost performance and up 4% organically in lighting, but down 10% reported, driven by foreign exchange. The appliance team had a strong year, essentially doubling profits and expanding margin significantly. They've also done an outstanding job managing the business through this disposition process. 
Lastly, I'll cover GE Capital. Our verticals businesses earned $438 million this quarter. That's up 7% from prior year, driven by operations and higher tax benefits, partially offset by lower gains. Portfolio quality remained stable, and the aviation portfolio finished the quarter with 0 delinquencies and only 2 AOGs. 
Working down the page, GE Capital corporate generated a $2 billion loss in the quarter, principally driven by restructuring and other charges related to the GE Capital transformation, preferred dividend payments, excess interest cost, including the cost associated with the debt exchange we completed in October and headquarters operating cost. 
In the current quarter, we took an impairment of approximately $800 million on our city coal-fired power plant in the U.S. related to a decision to exit the investment over time. This investment was not strategic to the vertical's go-forward business, and this actually align its portfolio more closely to the GE Store going forward. This charge is within the framework of the $23 billion charge to affect the GE Capital transformation. 
Discontinued operations, which now includes the consumer segment, generated earnings of $3.7 billion, primarily driven by $3.4 billion gain associated with the Synchrony split-off as well as the earnings and gains from discontinued operations. Overall, GE Capital reported $2.1 billion of earnings, and we ended the quarter with $157 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity. The verticals ended the quarter with $79 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity. Our liquidity levels remain very strong at $91 billion. Our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 14.5%, which is up 80 basis points from the third quarter after paying dividends of $3.9 billion during the quarter, bringing our total dividend in 2015 to $4.3 billion. 
Asset sales were made ahead of plan, and we ended the year with $157 billion of signed deals and $104 billion of deals closed. 
Overall, Keith and the GE Capital team have executed ahead of schedule on all aspects versus the plan we shared with you back in April. We expect to be largely complete by the end of 2016 and are on track to file for SIFI revision in the first quarter of this year. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

We have no change. We're increasing our goals for disposition cash. I know a lot has happened early in the year, but 2015 closed about where we thought it would. So let's start with organic growth of 2% to 4%. We finished 2015 with $315 billion of backlog. Earlier, I outlined how we achieved those goals even in the face of a tougher oil and gas market. We have broad business and geographic diversity and service, which is 80% of our earnings, should continue to grow by 3% to 5% in 2016. We had 2 months of Alstom in 2015. And so far, so good. We think our synergies are achievable. And with the appliances transaction, we're now looking at the ability to fund incremental restructuring. In addition, this gives us upside to our disposition cash for the year. All of our goals for GE Capital remain on track. Our dispositions are a year ahead of plan. Capital dividends are the key to returning about $26 billion to you this year, and we plan to file for SIFI designation later this quarter. 
We're acting to get more out of this economy. We're aggressively managing our cost structure to capitalize on deflation. We have very strong balance sheet with substantial cash. We have the ability to finance our industrial products, which is a huge advantage. Our diversity in both regions and markets allows us to outperform single-purpose competitors, but we can move production to the lowest-cost regions and capitalize on currency or excess capacity. We have all the elements to help ourselves in a tough economy, buy back capacity, substantial restructuring funding and services growth. And with continued to invest. Our long-term commitments for R&D, globalization, investments like Alstom, have built a huge backlog. 
So just to recap some of our highlights for '16. Double-digit EPS growth, returning $26 billion of cash, Alstom integration, digital execution. There's really a lot of value here in GE. 
So Matt, now let me turn it back over to you for some questions."

And when you add M&C, you've got about a little bit north of 65% of next year's revenues and backlog. So to Jeff's point, the real short-term exposure, today anyway, as we look at it, is service and drilling, and they are very susceptible to volatility around what they see for convertible demand in any period of time, but it's 15% [ph] of the revenue."

And wanted to the full first quarter? So here's what I'd say. So when you look at the profile for the year, when you talk about gas turbines and power systems, I mentioned the fact that a lot of our volume was in the second half of the year. The first quarter in power business, we're going to be down significantly on gas turbines. Last year, we hit the tailwind of Algeria and met some Egyptian shipments in the first quarter. Or even though we're going to up on shipments year-over-year for the total year for power systems, the first quarter is going to be light on gas turbines year-over-year."

Let me start with some thoughts on the macro environment and GE's fit in it. For the last few years, I've talked about a slow growth and volatile economy. This is still my view. In the fourth quarter, across our own large Industrial footprin",1356,"Thanks, Matt. Let me start with some thoughts on the macro environment and GE's fit in it. For the last few years, I've talked about a slow growth and volatile economy. This is still my view. In the fourth quarter, across our own large Industrial footprint, orders grew by 1% organically and our backlog is at a record of $315 billion, up 7% organically. Our biggest Industrial business, which is Power, had organic orders growth of 29% in the quarter. 
I have a difficult time reconciling this with the mood that is in the markets. Clearly, oil pricing is a concern and will have an impact, but our organic orders growth in the Middle East were up 14% in the quarter, so economic activity is ongoing. I know there's a concern about emerging markets in total, but our organic growth was up 7% in the quarter, ex Alstom. And our business in China grew slightly organically in the year, and backlog grew by 11%. So we're seeing a lot of economic volatility, but there's still enough business out there for GE to hit its goals. 
The GE team had a good quarter in a volatile environment. Total operating EPS was $0.52, up 27%, and Industrial EPS was $0.47, up 27%. Orders were up slightly and organic growth was down slightly versus a year ago. Total Industrial margins expanded by 80 basis points, and 2015 CFOA grew by 8% to $16.4 billion. Industrial profit expanded by 3% organically. 
We hit or exceeded all of our goals in 2015. Organic growth was up 3% with 80 basis points of margin expansion, leading to 7% organic profit growth. EPS was $1.31, up 17%. We achieved this despite having $0.05 of FX headwind. The Verticals hit their plan, and Capital returned $4.3 billion to the parent. Our cash and free cash flow execution was ahead of plan. We returned $33 billion to investors, including the excellent execution with Synchrony. 
We also executed a massive amount of portfolio change in the year. GE Capital exits are ahead of plan with $157 billion of signings to date. The impact of Alstom was flat on EPS, slightly better than expected. Alstom had an impact on several segments, and Jeff will take you through those results. But on balance, we like what we see in Alstom. And last week, we announced the disposition of Appliances to Haier for $5.4 billion. This will create an attractive gain and allow us to significantly increase our restructuring targets in 2016. So we're committed to our 2016 framework in the face of macroeconomic volatility. 
Now for orders. Orders grew by 3%, which was up 1% organically. And as I said earlier, our backlog is $315 billion, up 7%, ex Alstom. Alstom added $29 billion to our backlog. Services grew by 5%, which was up 3% organically, and equipment grew by 2%, which was down slightly organically.  Service orders were strong. Power Gen Service orders grew by 13%, ex Alstom, and commercial Aviation service orders were up 14%. Healthcare service orders were up 3%, and Alstom orders were $2.6 billion. We had some nice wins with Alstom in China on the hydro business, several combined-cycle, gas turbine power plants with richer GE content and the Hinkley Point nuclear steam turbine in the United Kingdom. 
On the product side of GE, we also had some solid highlights. Two I'll call out. Power booked 12 H turbine orders in the quarter, and we now have 33 in backlog. In addition, we have another 49 technical selections. And in Healthcare, our MRO orders grew by 18% in the quarter, and our bioprocessing grew by 16% in the quarter, so great results by those businesses. 
Globally, orders were generally positive, growing 8% in total and 12% in the growth regions. As I said earlier, we had strength in the Middle East and ASEAN and India, and Latin America was also decent. Including Alstom, China was up 15% in orders in the quarter and backlog grew by 16% to $21 billion. Order pricing was up 0.9% in the quarter, and we have good pricing momentum in both Aviation and Power. So overall, our backlog and orders pricing gives us high visibility as we approach our organic growth targets in 2016. 
So let's talk about the execution of the team and what you saw in the segment results. Overall, the team executed in a tough environment and the quarter organic growth was down slightly. But for the year, organic growth was up 3% with 7 of 8 segments growing. Service remained steady, up 5% in the year and 4% in the quarter organically. The Oil & Gas team, I'd really like to call out because I think they executed very well in 2015. With a 7% decline in revenue, their organic operating profit grew by 1%, and this is ahead of what we said last year. Our team executed on restructuring, they improved their value gap and they invested in the core franchise. And we expect the team to continue to execute in 2016. 
Looking at revenue in 2016. Let me just give you a few metrics and some things to think about. We primarily shipped from backlogs, so orders and backlog growth matter. In 2015, 6 of 7 businesses grew backlog, some substantially. When we do our analytics around convertible backlog and business performance, we see a path to 2% to 4% organic growth for '16 even with a very difficult oil and gas market. The most robust part of our business is Service. Service backlog grew by 16% in 2015, and we expect another year of 20%-plus growth in our digital applications. Both these support sustained growth in Services. 
We had another strong quarter and year-end margins. For the year, Industrial margins were up 80 basis points at the segment level and 110 basis points overall. Services were up 40 basis points, and equipment was up 20 basis points. We continue to make good progress on value gap, up more than $450 million on the year in cost productivity. Mix was favorable in the quarter, and in addition, we have solid momentum for cost out. Again, due to the higher Appliances gain, we can do a record level of restructuring in '16 to fortify our framework. Specifically, we believe we can execute on an incremental $1.7 billion in the year, which should yield incremental benefit. 
Last year, we discussed a new compensation plan that was aligned with investors and deliver the results. I'm convinced that this incentivized our team to deliver superior results in '15, and we have set our 2016 targets to drive our framework. Our strategy and business model is paying off, and we believe we can deliver strong performance in the face of economic volatility. 
Now for cash. CFOA grew for the year by 8%, Industrial free cash flow grew by 4% and total free cash flow grew by 14% to $13.5 billion. Total year core Industrial cash flow, ex Alstom, was $12.6 billion, up 3%, and total year free cash flow conversion was 85%, in line with our expectations. GE Capital dividends were $4.3 billion for the year, and we're still on track for $18 billion of dividends for the parent in 2016. The balance sheet is very strong, and the price for Appliances was a pleasant surprise. The business had been improving, and there's strong interest in the business. And a price of $5.4 billion gives us more than $1.3 billion of incremental cash. 
For capital allocation, we returned $33 billion in the year, including Synchrony. And looking at 2016, we're still on track to return $26 billion to investors in dividend and buyback. 
So before I turn over to Jeff, let me reflect a little on the Alstom results. We've integrated 2 months of revenue, all of the deal-related costs and the impact of the joint ventures, all for the first time. There's inherent complexities as we go through it, so bear with us. But in general, I would say the business and our outlook and our execution are on track, and we're still excited about Alstom."

I'll start with the fourth quarter summary. Revenues were $33.9 billion, up 1% in the quarter. Industrial revenues, including Corporate, were up 3% to $31.3 billion.

Industrial revenues, including Corporate, were up 3% to $31.3 billion. You could see on the right side that Industrial segments were down 1% reported and down 1% organic. Alstom revenue of $2 billion in the quarter was offset by a $1.3 billion of foreign exchange and dispositions of $700 million. 
Industrial operating plus Verticals EPS was $0.52, up 27%, and that's driven by Industrial up 27% and Verticals flat. The operating EPS number of $0.31 includes other continuing GE Capital activity, including headquarter runoff and other exit-related items I'll cover in more detail shortly. $0.26 of continuing EPS includes the impact of nonoperating pension, and net EPS of $0.64 includes discontinued operations. The total disc ops impact was a positive $3.7 billion, driven by the $3.4 billion gain from Synchrony and earnings from the businesses held in sale. As Jeff said, we generated $16.4 billion of CFOA for the year. That's up 8%. Industrial CFOA was $12.1 billion, down 1%, but up 3% when you exclude Alstom CFOA and taxes associated with the disposition of Signaling. 
The GE tax rate was 5%, bringing the total year rate to 14%. The tax rate in the quarter was driven by the Appliances transaction moving into 2016, tax benefits associated with integrating our existing Service business with Alstom's business in Switzerland, higher tax benefits principally on the Signaling gain we had in the quarter and legislation making the U.S. research credit permanent. 
The reported GE Capital tax rate in the quarter of 39% reflects a tax benefit on a pretax loss. The tax rate for the Vertical businesses was a negative 13%, reflecting reduced income in DFS and international tax benefits that will diminish as we complete the GE Capital exit plan. Going forward, as we complete the exit, we expect GE Capital Vertical tax rate to be approximately 10%. 
On the right side of the segment results. As I mentioned, Industrial segment revenues were down 1% reported and down 1% organic with foreign exchange and dispositions offsetting Alstom. The foreign exchange was a $1.3 billion drag on Industrial segment revenue and $163 million impact on Industrial segment op profit. The Power, Renewables and Energy Management businesses were impacted by the Alstom acquisition, and I'll walk you through the impact on the next page. 
At the December outlook meeting, we said we would present Industrial results including Corporate operating cost. On that basis, Industrial op profit for the quarter was down 6% reported, but up 3% organically on strong Corporate cost performance. 
To give you context on the quarter, organic revenue at down 1% was a little over $1 billion lower than we expected. This was driven by: Power, lowered by about $350 million on expanded scope and BOP, Arrow and reciprocating engines that did not close in the quarter; about $400 million in Renewables on lower wind turbines, which I'll cover more on shortly; and $300 million of softness in Oil & Gas and $100 million of softness in convertible orders in our Energy Management business. Most of the $1 billion was timing, and we expect it to convert in 2016. For the full year, organic revenue was up 3%. 
What's laid out on this page is the impact of Alstom on the Power, Renewables and Energy Management businesses. You can see the reported op profit of the businesses in the first column, the impact of Alstom in the middle column and the op profit and the Vs, excluding Alstom, on the right. Power on a stand-alone basis would've been down 5%, Renewables would've been down 54% and Energy Management would've been up 4%. 
The outsized impact of Alstom in Energy Management business is due to the JV structure of Digital Energy in the Alstom Grid business. We contributed positive earnings from Digital Energy to Alstom's business that had negative earnings. Remember, this is a 50-50 JV and we consolidate 100% of the revenue but record only 50% of the earnings. 
In the case of Energy Management, the 17% organic V reflects the organic performance for the Power Conversion and Industrial Solutions business, which is how we report organic for this segment going forward. The organic V, including Digital Energy, would've been plus 19%. 
In the quarter, the EPS impact of Alstom was breakeven with a pretax loss of $234 million in the segments and an additional $160 million of deal cost and accounting items at Corporate, offset by a positive tax benefits. Revenue was $2 billion, and orders were $2.6 billion. As we look to 2016, no change to the guidance we gave you of $0.05 of EPS from Alstom. 
Next, I'll do the earnings walk as we've been doing for the last number of quarters, so you understand the dynamics clearly on what's going on under earnings. Starting with the first column on the left and working down. Industrial operating net income was $4.6 billion, and Vertical income was $438 million for total Industrial plus Verticals operating earnings of $5.1 billion. 
On the other GE Capital line, we incurred $2.1 billion of cost in the quarter. This was driven by restructuring charges, the preferred dividend payment, headquarter runoff, operating expenses and excess interest cost. We also took an impairment of about $800 million related to the Homer City power plant asset, which I'll cover more on, on the GE Capital page. 
As a result, total operating earnings were $3 billion. Including nonoperating pension cost, continuing earnings were $2.6 billion. We had a $3.7 billion of income in discontinued operations, principally related to the Synchrony gain. Adjusting for these items, net earnings for the quarter were $6.3 billion. In the center and the far right columns, you can see the associated EPS numbers and the variants versus prior year. 
On the next page, Industrial other items for the quarter. We had $0.04 of charges related to Industrial restructuring and other items. They were taken at Corporate. Charges were $567 million on a pretax basis with $160 million of those charges related to the Alstom deal cost and accounting items. We also had $1 billion of Industrial gains in the quarter, which equated to $0.08 of EPS at the transactional tax rates. The pretax Signaling gain was $622 million, and the Appliance breakup fee was $175 million. Additionally, we sold our Embedded Controls businesses in Energy Management and our Clarient business in Healthcare. 
On the bottom of the page, you can see the total year restructuring gains profile. We incurred restructuring charges of $0.12 and had gains of $0.11 for a net charge of $0.01 for the year. This was $0.02 better than we communicated in December, driven by about $0.01 of lower restructuring, primarily Alstom-related, and slightly higher gains driven by predominantly tax at the transaction level. 
For 2016, we expect gains and restructuring to largely offset for the year. However, there will be a quarterly variability in the timing. As Jeff mentioned, we signed the Appliances transaction, which we expect to contribute about $0.20 of gain midyear this year. That, combined with some smaller transactions, should yield gains of about $0.25 in 2016. We will use this opportunity to continue to invest in improving the Industrial margins and costs. This will benefit us not only in 2016, but will position us well for 2017 and 2018. 
Now I'll go through the segments, starting with the Power business. With the combination of Alstom into the Power segment, we have reorganized some of the sub-businesses, so I'll take a minute to walk through these changes. First, the Thermal business was renamed Gas Power Systems. This business includes gas turbines and steam and generators for combined-cycle applications. And additionally, we moved the equipment side of our Arrow turbines business to Gas Power Systems. Second, the Power Services business includes our PGS business and services related to Arrow turbines. The Distributed Power business now includes just our reciprocating engines and the Service businesses for Jenbacher and Waukesha. Additionally, as you know, we have a stand-alone steam business that we acquired from Alstom. 
Moving to the financial results. Orders in the quarter of $9.6 billion, including $1 billion of Alstom orders, grew 40%. Excluding Alstom, orders were $8.6 billion, up 25% with equipment orders up 46% and services up 8%. Within equipment orders, Gas Power Systems was higher by 60%, ex Alstom. The increase was driven by orders for 55 gas turbines versus 41 last year and expanded scope, including BOP, for a large Saudi 7F order. 
In the fourth quarter, we took new orders for 12 H turbines versus 2 last year: 5 units in the U.S., 4 in Pakistan and 3 in Asia. Our H backlog now totals 33 with an additional 49 technical selections for a total of 82 units. Arrow turbine orders were down 14% on 43 units versus 50 last year, and Distributed Power engines were lower by 12% with weakness in Waukesha gas compression, partly offset by strong orders in Jenbacher. Equipment OPI was strong at 6.7%, driven by H turbine demand. 
Service orders, excluding Alstom, grew 8% on higher installations growth in multiyear contracts and strong upgrades. AGP sold 42 for the quarter versus 26 a year ago, bringing total year orders on AGPs to 119. Alstom orders, as I mentioned, totaled $1 billion, including 2 steam turbines and 6 HSRGs (sic) [HRSG], one in conjunction with GE orders. Ex Alstom, equipment backlog ended at $8.3 billion, up 15%. Service backlog grew 4% to $53 billion. In total, Power backlog ended the year at $62 billion, ex Alstom, and $77 billion with Alstom. 
Core GE revenues were $6.2 billion, down 10% and down 7% organically. Equipment revenues were down 25%, driven by fewer gas turbine shipments, foreign exchange and lower balance of plant. In the quarter, the business shipped 28 gas turbines versus 44 a year ago. Total year shipments were 107 units. Lower units and lower BOP were driven by no repeat of the large Algerian deal in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Service revenues were up 1%, driven by Power Services up 8%. AGPs were 35 in the quarter versus 24 a year ago, bringing total shipments to 104 for the year. Strength in Power Service is partly offset by lower Distributed Power Service, down 15%. Alstom revenues in the quarter totaled $917 million with $255 million from equipment and $662 million from services. 
GE core operating profit was $1.7 billion, down 5%. The decrease was driven by lower volume and partially offset by positive value gap. Margins improved 140 basis points in the quarter. Alstom operating profit was a loss of $80 million, reflecting operations, deal costs and accounting adjustments. 
Given the scale of the Alstom consolidation on our first close, things went reasonably well. The core business came in a little lower in revenue than expected, driven by the timing of BOP and Arrow Engine shipments. However, orders were better than expected on strong demand for both H and F products, particularly in Saudi and Pakistan. 2016 is a big execution year with the Alstom integration shipping approximately 24 H turbines and executing on our product cost strategy. In total, we expect to ship 110 gas turbines and 125 AGPs with 60% to 65% of these units shipping in the second half of the year in 2016. 
Next, I'll cover Renewables. Total Renewable orders were $2.5 billion in the quarter, up 1%. Excluding Alstom, orders were $2 billion, down 18% and down 10% ex foreign exchange. We took orders for 827 wind turbines versus 1,251 a year ago in the quarter. The decline was a result of lower U.S. orders, partly driven by the strength of the fourth quarter of last year related to the PTC extension. This year, the PTC extension includes a multiyear phase-out. 
Orders were also impacted by the shift from the 1.x product line to the new 2.x and 3.x products that drive fewer units but more megawatts. Additionally, we had 3 deals delayed to 2016 for a total of 240 turbines or about $550 million of orders. Orders outside the U.S. were up 19%, ex FX, and down 2% reported with strength in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia. 
Backlog in the Renewables core business ended at $7.1 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Alstom Renewable orders were $469 million in the quarter with a large hydro win of $400 million in China at the Three Gorges Project. Alstom added $5.3 billion of backlog for the Renewables business. 
Renewables revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $1.9 billion, lower by 16% and down 8%, ex exchange. The legacy GE business had revenue of $1.9 billion, down 20% reported and down 12%, ex foreign exchange. Core unit shipments were 847 in the quarter versus 1,081 last year. This was lower than expected as 2 deals for 165 turbines pushed into 2016. 
Operating profit, ex Alstom, was $125 million, down 54%. The decline was attributable to lower volume of 234 units, negative mix from the new 2.x product as we come down the cost curve and foreign exchange. Alstom op profit was a loss of $69 million. In 2016, we expect to ship about 3,050 onshore turbines, including 250 of Alstom wind units. As Jeff discussed earlier, 2016 organic revenues should be high single digits or low double digits, depending on the mix of units shipped. Core op profit should be flat to up slightly as the business focus on improving the cost curve for the new 2.0 and 3.0 megawatt product launches and delivering $100 million of Alstom cost synergies. 
Next, on Aviation. Global passenger travel continues to grow robustly, up 6.7% November year-to-date. Both domestic and international markets are strong, particularly in the Middle East and Asia Pacific. Airfreight volume grew 2.3% November year-to-date. 
Orders in the fourth quarter of $6.8 billion were down 16%. Commercial engine orders were down 47%, as expected. We booked $1.9 billion of engine orders, including $100 million of GE90, $600 million of GEnx orders, $400 million of LEAP CFM orders and $500 million of CF6 orders. Commercial equipment backlog ended the year at $29.5 billion, up 11%. Military equipment orders of $353 million in the quarter were higher by 2x on a large Navy F414 order. 
Service orders were higher by 9% with strong commercial spares orders, up 10%, to $39 million a day, and CSAs were up 24% in the quarter. Military services were down 20%. Services backlog ended the year at over $116 billion, up 15% versus last year. 
Revenues of $6.7 billion were up 5% with commercial equipment revenues down 5%. We shipped 59 GEnx units versus 77 last year, driven by schedule. We have no delinquencies to Boeing. Military equipment revenue was down 1%, and services revenue was up strongly at 18%, driven by commercial services, up 24%. 
Operating profit grew 12% on strength of services, positive value gap and good cost productivity. Operating margin rate improved 160 basis points. 
The Aviation team delivered another solid execution year. For the year, revenues grew 3%, operating profit grew 11% and margins expanded 160 basis points. Our share on each of our engine platforms is very strong, and the LEAP launch remains on track for midyear. We expect another solid year from David Joyce and the team at Aviation. 
Next is Oil & Gas. The segment continues to operate in a very difficult environment, and we continue to be focused on being hypercompetitive on new opportunities and very aggressive on the cost structure. For the fourth quarter, orders of $3.3 billion were down 35% and down 28% organically. Equipment orders were down 52% or 44% organically. All segments had lower orders, driven by delays and reduced CapEx spending, with the exception of our Downstream platform, which grew orders 51% reported and up 84% organically. For the other segments on a reported basis, Subsea was down 49%, TMS was down 78% and Surface was down 65%. 
Service orders were down 17% and down 13% organically. On a reported basis, TMS was down 24%, Surface was down 29%, Subsea was down 35% and M&C was down 18%, partly offset by Downstream, which grew service orders by 20%. Not included in orders but included in backlog, TMS signed 4 new long-term service agreements, totaling $1.5 billion in the quarter. Total backlog ended the year at about $23 billion, which was down 9% versus last year and down 4%, ex exchange. 
Revenues in the quarter were down 16% reported and down 6% organic. Foreign exchange reduced revenues $437 million in the quarter. Equipment revenues were down 21% reported and 12% organically. By business, Surface was down 49%, TMS down 18%, Subsea down 15%. Organically, TMS was down 8% and Subsea was down 5%. Service revenues were down 9% and flat organically with M&C down 5%, offset by TMS, up 22% organically. 
Operating profit in the quarter was down 19% and down 7% organic. Foreign exchange in the quarter was a $93 million headwind. The business continue to deliver on cost reductions and deflation, which partially offset the negative volume and price. Margin rates were down 70 basis points. On an organic basis, margins contracted 10 basis points. 
The business executed an early and aggressive cost-out program beginning in 2014, delivering $600 million of cost-out during 2015. For the year, revenue and op profit were down 5% and up 1%, respectively, and organic margin rates actually expanded 90 basis points. For 2016, our best view for revenues and op profit continues to be down 10% to 15%, most likely at the bottom end of that range, given the outlook for the industry and our view of volume and price. 
Our base plan at December outlook called for $400 million of cost-out in 2016 to get to the $1 billion run rate over 2015 and '16. We are working on another $400 million of additional cost-out reductions to offset the likely lower volume and price pressure. We expect the first half to be tougher year-over-year versus the second half, and Lorenzo and his team have executed very well in 2015, and we expect the business will continue to outperform on a relative basis in 2016. 
Next up in Healthcare, orders of $5.2 billion were down 4% but up 1% organically. Geographically, orders in the U.S. were down 1%, Europe was down 8% and up 4%, ex FX, and the Middle East region was down 4% and up 5%, ex FX. China was down 6% reported and down 3%, ex FX. Tenders in China continue to improve slowly. Year-over-year, tenders were flat after several quarters of contraction. 
In terms of business lines, Healthcare Systems orders were down 6% and down 1%, excluding exchange. The U.S. was down 2%, driven by lower molecular imaging and x-ray on tough comparisons, offset partially by strong MR, up 33% and ultrasound up 5% on new product upgrades. 
Europe was down 8% reported, but grew 5%, ex foreign exchange. Europe was up 5%, ex FX, for the year and have seen 6 consecutive quarters of organic growth. China orders were down 11% reported and down 9%, excluding exchange. Our current outlook for 2016 is for orders growth in China as government tenders begin to rebound. 
Life Sciences continue to perform very well. In the fourth quarter, orders grew 2%, up 8%, ex exchange. Within life sciences, bioprocess grew 16%, ex FX, with strength in Korea, China and the U.S.
Healthcare revenues were down 3% reported and up 3%, ex FX, Healthcare Systems revenues were lower by 4% reported and up 3%, ex FX, and Life Sciences revenues grew 6%, excluding exchange. 
Operating profit was lower versus the fourth quarter of last year by 4%, excluding exchange, and lower by 8% reported. Volume growth and cost productivity were more than offset by price and higher growth investments. Margin rates contracted 100 basis points in the quarter. 
In 2016, we expect John and Healthcare business to improve operationally in terms of earnings and margin rates. Our outlook is for the Life Science business to continue to grow strongly, profitably and for the HCS business to execute the digital transformation and aggressively reduce product and service cost. 
In Transportation, North America carloads were down 6.4% in the quarter, driven by very weak carloads in coal, down almost 20%, and petroleum, down 13%. Intermodal volume was also down 1% in the quarter. For the year, volume was down 2.2%, driven by commodities with intermodal higher by 2%. Lower volume and operational improvements have improved velocity on the rails, on average, 2.4 miles an hour. That's up 10% versus last year. For our business, orders in the quarter were very strong, up 66% to $3.2 billion, driven by equipment orders up 113%. We took our largest order ever of 1,000 locos in India and also secured an order for 100 Tier 4s in the U.S. Service orders were down 6%, ex Signaling, on lower overall volume driven by increased parked locos. 
Revenues were up 2% reported and up 11%, ex Signaling. Equipment revenues were higher by 17%, 27% organically, principally driven by locomotives, partly offset by services, down 8%, on lower overhauls. 
Op profit was higher in the quarter by 18%, ex Signaling, and up 8% reported. Increased local volume, value gap and productivity drove earnings higher. Margins improved 100 basis points reported and 120 basis points organically. 
The Transportation team delivered a tremendous year. Excluding the Signaling sale, they grew revenue 7%, operating profits 16% and improved margins 150 basis points. They launched and delivered 425 Tier 4 locomotives on time, on cost and the performance has significantly exceeded customer expectations 2016 is going to be a more challenging year with softer demand in the U.S. and in the commodity markets. We shipped 985 locos in 2015 and expect to ship about 800 in 2016. The team is executing an aggressive cost plan to address the lower volume. We expect the business to be down mid-single-digit on op profit in 2016. 
On Energy Management, as I mentioned earlier, describing results for Energy Management is complicated by the contribution of our Digital Energy business to the Grid JV. For financial reporting purposes, we'll report 100% of the Grid JV's orders and revenues but only report 50% of their earnings. Going forward, we'll report results on this basis, but all our organic calculations will include only Industrial Solutions and the Power Conversion business. 
Orders in the quarter were $2.6 billion, up 15% reported. Of the $2.6 billion, $1.1 billion was from the Grid business with Alstom contributing $716 million and Digital Energy business contributing $342 million. Digital Energy orders were down 10% reported and down 8% organically. Power Conversion orders were down 17% and down 11% organically on no repeat of large Renewable orders in the fourth quarter of last year. 
For the total year, Power Conversion orders were very strong, up 19% organically. Industrial Solutions orders in the quarter were down 17% reported and down 11% organically, driven by foreign exchange and dispositions. North America demand in the quarter was weak across all Industrial Solutions segments. Backlog for the quarter ended at $11.7 billion. 
Reported revenues of $2.4 billion were higher by 20%. Grid Solutions revenue totaled $952 million, inclusive of $393 million of Digital Energy revenue. Industrial Solutions revenues were down 8% and down 4% organically. Power Conversion was down 6%, but up 9% organically. 
Reported op profit for the Energy Management segment was $33 million, which includes the effects of establishing the Grid JV and Alstom's results. Before the effects of Alstom, as I covered earlier, Energy Management earned $118 million of op profit, up 4%, driven by productivity and the gain on sale in our meters business, partly offset by lower Industrial Solutions volume, the contribution of our Digital Energy business to the Grid JV, combined with the Alstom Grid operating results, equal the loss, which we recorded at 50% or $5 million. 
Next, we announced last week and Jeff spoke about it earlier, we have an agreement to sell our Appliance unit to Haier, which we expect to close midyear. Fourth quarter results for both Appliances & Lighting had revenue essentially flat. Appliance revenue was up slightly from last year, and Lighting saw a flat revenue and growth organically. LED growth in the quarter was 28%. 
Operating profit for the segment was up 28% with very strong performance in Appliances, up 51%, on strong cost performance and up 4% organically in Lighting, but down 10% reported, driven by foreign exchange. 
The Appliance team had a strong year, essentially doubling profits and expanding margin significantly. They've also done an outstanding job managing the business through this disposition process. 
Lastly, I'll cover GE Capital. Our Verticals businesses earned $438 million this quarter. That's up 7% from prior year, driven by operations and higher tax benefits, partially offset by lower gains. Portfolio quality remained stable, and the Aviation portfolio finished the quarter with 0 delinquencies and only 2 AOGs. 
Working down the page, GE Capital corporate generated a $2 billion loss in the quarter, principally driven by restructuring and other charges related to the GE Capital transformation; preferred dividend payments; excess interest costs, including the cost associated with the debt exchange we completed in October; and headquarters operating costs. 
In the current quarter, we took an impairment of approximately $800 million on our Homer City coal-fired power plant in the U.S. related to a decision to exit the investment over time. This investment was not strategic to the vertical's go-forward business, and this action will align its portfolio more closely to the GE Store going forward. This charge is within the framework of the $23 billion charge to affect the GE Capital transformation. 
Discontinued operations, which now includes the Consumer segment, generated earnings of $3.7 billion, primarily driven by a $3.4 billion gain associated with the Synchrony split-off as well as the earnings and gains from discontinued operation. Overall, GE Capital reported $2.1 billion of earnings, and we ended the quarter with $157 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity. The verticals ended the quarter with $79 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity. Our liquidity levels remain very strong at $91 billion. Our Basel 3 Tier 1 common ratio was 14.5%, which is up 80 basis points from the third quarter after paying dividends of $3.9 billion during the quarter, bringing our total dividend in 2015 to $4.3 billion. Asset sales were made ahead of plan, and we ended the year with $157 billion of signed deals and $104 billion of deals closed. 
Overall, Keith and the GE Capital team have executed ahead of schedule on all aspects versus the plan we shared with you back in April. We expect to be largely complete by the end of 2016 and are on track to file for SIFI rescission in the first quarter of this year. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

We have no change. We're increasing our goals for disposition cash. I know a lot's happened early in the year, but 2015 closed about where we thought it would. So let's start with organic growth of 2% to 4%. We finished 2015 with $315 billion of backlog. Earlier, I outlined how we achieved those goals even in the face of a tougher oil and gas market. We have broad business and geographic diversity, and service, which is 80% of our earnings, should continue to grow by 3% to 5% in 2016. We had 2 months of Alstom in 2015 and so far, so good. We think our synergies are achievable. And with the appliances transaction, we're now looking at the ability to fund incremental restructuring. In addition, this gives us upside to our disposition cash for the year. 
All of our goals for GE Capital remain on track. Our dispositions are a year ahead of plan. Capital dividends are the key to returning about $26 billion to you this year, and we plan to file for SIFI designation later this quarter. 
We're acting to get more out of this economy. We're aggressively managing our cost structure to capitalize on deflation. We have very strong balance sheet with substantial cash. We have the ability to finance our industrial products, which is a huge advantage. Our diversity in both regions and markets allows us to outperform single-purpose competitors, but we can move production to the lowest-cost regions and capitalize on currency or excess capacity. We have all the elements to help ourselves in a tough economy: buy back capacity, substantial restructuring funding and services growth. And we've continued to invest. Our long-term commitments for R&D, globalization, investments like Alstom, have built a huge backlog. 
So just to recap some of our highlights for '16: double-digit EPS growth, returning $26 billion of cash, Alstom integration, digital execution. There's really a lot of value here in GE. 
So Matt, now let me turn it back over to you for some questions."

So I don't think we've seen really any diminution of pricing in the emerging market orders. As you know, guys, our stuff is lumpy, so there's big transactions.

And then businesses like Drilling & Surface, that are probably the most susceptible as oil pricing goes down to $30, where trying to stay ahead on the cost curve is going to be very difficult in the future, and we just need to be flexible as -- at a $30 environment, the one we see today.

And when you add M&C, you've got about a little bit north of 65% of next year's revenues in backlog. So to Jeff's point, the real short-term exposure, today anyway, as we look at, is service and drilling.

177031,314408325,920397,"General Electric Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2016",2016-01-22,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Matt. Let me start with some thoughts on the macro environment and GE's fit in it. For the last few years, I've talked about a slow growth and volatile economy. This is still my view. In the fourth quarter, across our own large Industrial footprin",1356,"Thanks, Matt. Let me start with some thoughts on the macro environment and GE's fit in it. For the last few years, I've talked about a slow growth and volatile economy. This is still my view. In the fourth quarter, across our own large Industrial footprint, orders grew by 1% organically and our backlog is at a record of $315 billion, up 7% organically. Our biggest Industrial business, which is Power, had organic orders growth of 29% in the quarter. 
I have a difficult time reconciling this with the mood that is in the markets. Clearly, oil pricing is a concern and will have an impact, but our organic orders growth in the Middle East were up 14% in the quarter, so economic activity is ongoing. I know there's a concern about emerging markets in total, but our organic growth was up 7% in the quarter, ex Alstom. And our business in China grew slightly organically in the year, and backlog grew by 11%. So we're seeing a lot of economic volatility, but there's still enough business out there for GE to hit its goals. 
The GE team had a good quarter in a volatile environment. Total operating EPS was $0.52, up 27%, and Industrial EPS was $0.47, up 27%. Orders were up slightly and organic growth was down slightly versus a year ago. Total Industrial margins expanded by 80 basis points, and 2015 CFOA grew by 8% to $16.4 billion. Industrial profit expanded by 3% organically. 
We hit or exceeded all of our goals in 2015. Organic growth was up 3% with 80 basis points of margin expansion leading to 7% organic profit growth. EPS was $1.31, up 17%. We achieved this despite having $0.05 of FX headwind. The Verticals hit their plan, and Capital returned $4.3 billion to the parent. Our cash and free cash flow execution was ahead of plan. We returned $33 billion to investors, including the excellent execution with Synchrony. 
We also executed a massive amount of portfolio change in the year. GE Capital exits are ahead of plan with $157 billion of signings to date. The impact of Alstom was flat on EPS, slightly better than expected. Alstom had an impact on several segments, and Jeff will take you through those results. But on balance, we like what we see in Alstom. And last week, we announced the disposition of Appliances to Haier for $5.4 billion. This will create an attractive gain and allow us to significantly increase our restructuring targets in 2016. So we're committed to our 2016 framework in the face of macroeconomic volatility. 
Now for orders. Orders grew by 3%, which was up 1% organically. And as I said earlier, our backlog is $315 billion, up 7%, ex Alstom. Alstom added $29 billion to our backlog. Services grew by 5%, which was up 3% organically, and equipment grew by 2%, which was down slightly organically.  Service orders were strong. Power Gen Service orders grew by 13%, ex Alstom, and commercial Aviation service orders were up 14%. Healthcare service orders were up 3%, and Alstom orders were $2.6 billion. We had some nice wins with Alstom in China on the hydro business, several combined-cycle, gas turbine power plants with richer GE content and the Hinkley Point nuclear steam turbine in the United Kingdom. 
On the product side of GE, we also had some solid highlights. Two I'll call out. Power booked 12 H turbine orders in the quarter, and we now have 33 in backlog. In addition, we have another 49 technical selections. And in Healthcare, our MR orders grew by 18% in the quarter, and our bioprocessing grew by 16% in the quarter, so great results by those businesses. 
Globally, orders were generally positive, growing 8% in total and 12% in the growth regions. As I said earlier, we had strength in the Middle East and ASEAN and India, and Latin America was also decent. Including Alstom, China was up 15% in orders in the quarter and backlog grew by 16% to $21 billion. Order pricing was up 0.9% in the quarter, and we have good pricing momentum in both Aviation and Power. So overall, our backlog and orders pricing gives us high visibility as we approach our organic growth targets in 2016. 
So let's talk about the execution of the team and what you saw in the segment results. Overall, the team executed in a tough environment and the quarter organic growth was down slightly. But for the year, organic growth was up 3%, with 7 of 8 segments growing. Service remained steady, up 5% in the year and 4% in the quarter organically. The Oil & Gas team I'd really like to call out because I think they executed very well in 2015. With a 7% decline in revenue, their organic operating profit grew by 1%, and this is ahead of what we said last year. Our team executed on restructuring, they improved their value gap and they invested in their core franchise. And we expect the team to continue to execute in 2016. 
Looking at revenue in 2016, let me just give you a few metrics and some things to think about. We primarily ship from backlog, so orders and backlog growth matter. In 2015, 6 of 7 businesses grew backlog, some substantially. When we do our analytics around convertible backlog and business performance, we see a path to 2% to 4% organic growth for '16 even with a very difficult oil and gas market. The most robust part of our business is Service. Service backlog grew by 16% in 2015, and we expect another year of 20%-plus growth in our digital applications. Both these support sustained growth in Services. 
We had another strong quarter and year-end margins. For the year, Industrial margins were up 80 basis points at the segment level and 110 basis points overall. Services were up 40 basis points, and equipment was up 20 basis points. We continue to make good progress on value gap, up more than $450 million on the year in cost productivity. Mix was favorable in the quarter, and in addition, we have solid momentum for cost out. Again, due to the Haier Appliances gain, we can do a record level of restructuring in '16 to fortify our framework. Specifically, we believe we can execute on an incremental $1.7 billion in the year, which should yield incremental benefits. 
Last year, we discussed a new compensation plan that's aligned with investors and delivered results. I'm convinced that this incentivized our team to deliver superior results in '15, and we have set our 2016 targets to drive our framework. Our strategy and business model is paying off, and we believe we can deliver strong performance in the face of economic volatility. 
Now for cash. CFOA grew for the year by 8%, Industrial free cash flow grew by 4% and total free cash flow grew by 14% to $13.5 billion. Total year core Industrial cash flow, ex Alstom, was $12.6 billion, up 3%, and total year free cash flow conversion was 85%, in line with our expectations. GE Capital dividends were $4.3 billion for the year, and we're still on track for $18 billion of dividends to the parent in 2016. The balance sheet is very strong, and the price for Appliances was a pleasant surprise. The business had been improving, and there was strong interest in the business. And a price of $5.4 billion gives us more than $1.3 billion of incremental cash. 
For capital allocation, we returned $33 billion in the year, including Synchrony. And looking at 2016, we're still on track to return $26 billion to investors in dividend and buyback. 
So before I turn it over to Jeff, let me reflect a little on the Alstom results. We've integrated 2 months of revenue, all of the deal-related costs and the impact of the joint ventures, all for the first time. There's inherent complexity as we go through it, so bear with us. But in general, I would say the business and our outlook and our execution are on track, and we're still excited about Alstom."
177031,314408325,920397,"General Electric Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2016",2016-01-22,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the fourth quarter summary. Revenues were $33.9 billion, up 1% in the quarter. Industrial revenues, including Corporate, were up 3% to $31.3 billion. You can see on the right side that Industrial segments were down 1% reporte",4504,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the fourth quarter summary. Revenues were $33.9 billion, up 1% in the quarter. Industrial revenues, including Corporate, were up 3% to $31.3 billion. You can see on the right side that Industrial segments were down 1% reported and down 1% organic. Alstom revenue of $2 billion in the quarter was offset by $1.3 billion of foreign exchange and dispositions of $700 million. 
Industrial operating plus Verticals EPS was $0.52, up 27%, and that's driven by Industrial up 27% and Verticals flat. The operating EPS number of $0.31 includes other continuing GE Capital activity, including headquarter runoff and other exit-related items I'll cover in more detail shortly. $0.26 of continuing EPS includes the impact of nonoperating pension, and net EPS of $0.64 includes discontinued operations. The total disc ops impact was a positive $3.7 billion, driven by the $3.4 billion gain from Synchrony and earnings from the businesses held in sale. As Jeff said, we generated $16.4 billion of CFOA for the year. That's up 8%. Industrial CFOA was $12.1 billion, down 1%, but up 3% when you exclude Alstom CFOA and taxes associated with the disposition of Signaling. 
The GE tax rate was 5%, bringing the total year rate to 14%. The tax rate in the quarter was driven by the Appliances transaction moving into 2016, tax benefits associated with integrating our existing Service business with Alstom's business in Switzerland, higher tax benefits principally on the Signaling gain we had in the quarter and legislation making the U.S. research credit permanent. 
The reported GE Capital tax rate in the quarter of 39% reflects a tax benefit on a pretax loss. The tax rate for the Vertical businesses was a negative 13%, reflecting reduced income in DFS and international tax benefits that will diminish as we complete the GE Capital exit plan. Going forward, as we complete the exit, we expect GE Capital Vertical tax rate to be approximately 10%. 
On the right side are the segment results. As I mentioned, Industrial segment revenues were down 1% reported and down 1% organic with foreign exchange and dispositions offsetting Alstom. The foreign exchange was a $1.3 billion drag on Industrial segment revenue and $163 million impact on Industrial segment op profit. The Power, Renewables and Energy Management businesses were impacted by the Alstom acquisition, and I'll walk you through the impact on the next page. 
At the December outlook meeting, we said we would present Industrial results including Corporate operating costs. On that basis, Industrial op profit for the quarter was down 6% reported, but up 3% organically on strong Corporate cost performance. 
To give you context on the quarter, organic revenue at down 1% was a little over $1 billion lower than we expected. This was driven by Power, lowered by about $350 million on expanded scope and BOP, Arrow and reciprocating engines that did not close in the quarter; about $400 million in Renewables on lower wind turbines, which I'll cover more on shortly; and $300 million of softness in Oil & Gas and $100 million of softness in convertible orders in our Energy Management business. Most of the $1 billion was timing, and we expect it to convert in 2016. For the full year, organic revenue was up 3%. 
What's laid out on this page is the impact of Alstom on the Power, Renewables and Energy Management businesses. You can see the reported op profit of the businesses in the first column, the impact of Alstom in the middle column and the op profit and the Vs, excluding Alstom, on the right. Power on a stand-alone basis would've been down 5%, Renewables would've been down 54% and Energy Management would've been up 4%. 
The outsized impact of Alstom in the Energy Management business is due to the JV structure of Digital Energy in the Alstom Grid business. We contributed positive earnings from Digital Energy to Alstom's business that had negative earnings. Remember, this is a 50-50 JV, and we consolidate 100% of the revenue but record only 50% of the earnings. 
In the case of Energy Management, the 17% organic V reflects the organic performance for the Power Conversion and Industrial Solutions business, which is how we will report organic for this segment going forward. The organic V, including Digital Energy, would've been plus 19%. 
In the quarter, the EPS impact of Alstom was breakeven, with a pretax loss of $234 million in the segments and an additional $160 million of deal costs and accounting items at Corporate offset by positive tax benefits. Revenue was $2 billion, and orders were $2.6 billion. As we look to 2016, no change to the guidance we gave you of $0.05 of EPS from Alstom. 
Next, I'll do the earnings walk as we've been doing for the last number of quarters, so you understand the dynamics clearly on what's going on under earnings. Starting with the first column on the left and working down. Industrial operating net income was $4.6 billion, and Vertical income was $438 million for total Industrial plus Verticals operating earnings of $5.1 billion. 
On the other GE Capital line, we incurred $2.1 billion of costs in the quarter. This was driven by restructuring charges, the preferred dividend payment, headquarter runoff, operating expenses and excess interest costs. We also took an impairment of about $800 million related to the Homer City power plant asset, which I'll cover more on, on the GE Capital page. 
As a result, total operating earnings were $3 billion. Including nonoperating pension costs, continuing earnings were $2.6 billion. We had a $3.7 billion of income in discontinued operations, principally related to the Synchrony gain. Adjusting for these items, net earnings for the quarter were $6.3 billion. In the center and the far right columns, you can see the associated EPS numbers and their variants versus prior year. 
On the next page, Industrial other items for the quarter. We had $0.04 of charges related to Industrial restructuring and other items that were taken at Corporate. Charges were $567 million on a pretax basis, with $160 million of those charges related to the Alstom deal cost and accounting items. We also had $1 billion of Industrial gains in the quarter, which equated to $0.08 of EPS at the transactional tax rates. The pretax Signaling gain was $622 million, and the Appliance break-up fee was $175 million. Additionally, we sold our Embedded Controls business in Energy Management and our Clarient business in Healthcare. 
On the bottom of the page, you can see the total year restructuring gains profile. We incurred restructuring charges of $0.12 and had gains of $0.11 for a net charge of $0.01 for the year. This was $0.02 better than we communicated in December, driven by about $0.01 of lower restructuring, primarily Alstom-related, and slightly higher gains driven by predominantly tax at the transaction level. 
For 2016, we expect gains and restructuring to largely offset for the year. However, there will be quarterly variability in the timing. As Jeff mentioned, we signed the Appliances transaction, which we expect to contribute about $0.20 of gain midyear this year. That, combined with some smaller transactions, should yield gains of about $0.25 in 2016. We will use this opportunity to continue to invest in improving the Industrial margins and costs. This will benefit us not only in 2016, but will position us well for 2017 and 2018. 
Now I'll go through the segments, starting with the Power business. With the combination of Alstom into the Power segment, we have reorganized some of the sub-businesses, so I'll take a minute to walk through these changes. First, the Thermal business was renamed Gas Power Systems. This business includes gas turbines and steam and generators for combined-cycle applications. And additionally, we moved the equipment side of our Arrow turbines business to Gas Power Systems. Second, the Power Services business includes our PGS business and services related to Arrow turbines. The Distributed Power business now includes just our reciprocating engines and the Service businesses for Jenbacher and Waukesha. Additionally, as you know, we have a stand-alone steam business that we acquired from Alstom. 
Moving to the financial results. Orders in the quarter of $9.6 billion, including $1 billion of Alstom orders, grew 40%. Excluding Alstom, orders were $8.6 billion, up 25% with equipment orders up 46% and services up 8%. Within equipment orders, Gas Power Systems was higher by 60%, ex Alstom. The increase was driven by orders for 55 gas turbines versus 41 last year and expanded scope, including BOP, for a large Saudi 7F order. 
In the fourth quarter, we took new orders for 12 H turbines versus 2 last year: 5 units in the U.S., 4 in Pakistan and 3 in Asia. Our H backlog now totals 33 with an additional 49 technical selections for a total of 82 units. Arrow turbine orders were down 14% on 43 units versus 50 last year, and Distributed Power engines were lower by 12% with weakness in Waukesha gas compression partly offset by strong orders in Jenbacher. Equipment OPI was strong at 6.7%, driven by H turbine demand. 
Service orders, excluding Alstom, grew 8% on higher installations growth in multiyear contracts and strong upgrades. AGP sold 42 for the quarter versus 26 a year ago, bringing total year orders on AGPs to 119. Alstom orders, as I mentioned, totaled $1 billion, including 2 steam turbines and 6 HSRGs (sic) [HRSG], one in conjunction with GE orders. Ex Alstom, equipment backlog ended at $8.3 billion, up 15%. Service backlog grew 4% to $53 billion. In total, Power backlog ended the year at $62 billion, ex Alstom, and $77 billion with Alstom. 
Core GE revenues were $6.2 billion, down 10% and down 7% organically. Equipment revenues were down 25%, driven by fewer gas turbine shipments, foreign exchange and lower balance of plant. In the quarter, the business shipped 28 gas turbines versus 44 a year ago. Total year shipments were 107 units. Lower units and lower BOP were driven by no repeat of the large Algerian deal in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Service revenues were up 1%, driven by Power Services up 8%. AGPs were 35 in the quarter versus 24 a year ago, bringing total shipments to 104 for the year. Strength in Power Service was partly offset by lower Distributed Power Service, down 15%. Alstom revenues in the quarter totaled $917 million with $255 million from equipment and $662 million from services. 
GE core operating profit was $1.7 billion, down 5%. The decrease was driven by lower volume and partially offset by positive value gap. Margins improved 140 basis points in the quarter. Alstom operating profit was a loss of $80 million, reflecting operations, deal costs and accounting adjustments. 
Given the scale of the Alstom consolidation on our first close, things went reasonably well. The core business came in a little lower on revenue than expected, driven by the timing of BOP and Arrow Engine shipments. However, orders were better than expected on strong demand for both H and F products, particularly in Saudi and Pakistan. 2016 is a big execution year, with the Alstom integration shipping approximately 24 H turbines and executing on our product cost strategy. In total, we expect to ship 110 gas turbines and 125 AGPs, with 60% to 65% of these units shipping in the second half of the year in 2016. 
Next, I'll cover Renewables. Total Renewable orders were $2.5 billion in the quarter, up 1%. Excluding Alstom, orders were $2 billion, down 18% and down 10% ex foreign exchange. We took orders for 827 wind turbines versus 1,251 a year ago in the quarter. The decline was a result of lower U.S. orders, partly driven by the strength in the fourth quarter of last year related to the PTC extension. This year, the PTC extension includes a multiyear phase-out. 
Orders were also impacted by the shift from the 1.x product line to the new 2.x and 3.x products that drive fewer units but more megawatts. Additionally, we had 3 deals delayed to 2016 for a total of 240 turbines or about $550 million of orders. Orders outside the U.S. were up 19%, ex FX, and down 2% reported with strength in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia. 
Backlog in the Renewables core business ended at $7.1 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Alstom Renewable orders were $469 million in the quarter with a large hydro win of $400 million in China at the Three Gorges Project. Alstom added $5.3 billion of backlog to the Renewables business. 
Renewables revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $1.9 billion, lower by 16% and down 8% ex exchange. The legacy GE business had revenue of $1.9 billion, down 20% reported and down 12% ex foreign exchange. Core unit shipments were 847 in the quarter versus 1,081 last year. This was lower than expected as 2 deals for 165 turbines pushed into 2016. 
Operating profit, ex Alstom, was $125 million, down 54%. The decline was attributable to lower volume of 234 units, negative mix from the new 2.x product as we come down the cost curve and foreign exchange. Alstom op profit was a loss of $69 million. In 2016, we expect to ship about 3,050 onshore turbines, including 250 of Alstom wind units. As Jeff discussed earlier, 2016 organic revenues should be high single digits to low double digits, depending on the mix of units shipped. Core op profit should be flat to up slightly as the businesses focus on improving the cost curve for the new 2.0 and 3.0 megawatt product launches and delivering $100 million of Alstom cost synergies. 
Next, on Aviation. Global passenger travel continues to grow robustly, up 6.7% November year-to-date. Both domestic and international markets are strong, particularly in the Middle East and Asia Pacific. Airfreight volume grew 2.3% November year-to-date. 
Orders in the fourth quarter of $6.8 billion were down 16%. Commercial engine orders were down 47%, as expected. We booked $1.9 billion of engine orders, including $100 million of GE90, $600 million of GEnx orders, $400 million of LEAP CFM orders and $500 million of CF6 orders. Commercial equipment backlog ended the year at $29.5 billion, up 11%. Military equipment orders of $353 million in the quarter were higher by 2x on a large Navy F414 order. 
Service orders were higher by 9% with strong commercial spares orders up 10% to $39 million a day, and CSAs were up 24% in the quarter. Military services were down 20%. Services backlog ended the year at over $116 billion, up 15% versus last year. 
Revenues of $6.7 billion were up 5%, with commercial equipment revenues down 5%. We shipped 59 GEnx units versus 77 last year, driven by schedule. We have no delinquencies to Boeing. Military equipment revenue was down 1%, and services revenue was up strongly at 18%, driven by commercial services up 24%. 
Operating profit grew 12% on strength in Services, positive value gap and good cost productivity. Operating margin rates improved 160 basis points. 
The Aviation team delivered another solid execution year. For the year, revenues grew 3%, operating profit grew 11% and margins expanded 160 basis points. Our share on each of our engine platforms is very strong, and the LEAP launch remains on track for midyear. We expect another solid year from David Joyce and the team at Aviation. 
Next is Oil & Gas. The segment continues to operate in a very difficult environment, and we continue to be focused on being hypercompetitive on new opportunities and very aggressive on the cost structure. For the fourth quarter, orders of $3.3 billion were down 35% and down 28% organically. Equipment orders were down 52% or 44% organically. All segments had lower orders driven by delays and reduced CapEx spending, with the exception of our Downstream platform, which grew orders 51% reported and up 84% organically. For the other segments on a reported basis, Subsea was down 49%, TMS was down 78% and Surface was down 65%. 
Surface orders were down 17% and down 13% organically. On a reported basis, TMS was down 24%, Surface was down 29%, Subsea was down 35% and M&C was down 8%, partly offset by Downstream, which grew service orders by 20%. Not included in orders but included in backlog, TMS signed 4 new long-term service agreements, totaling $1.5 billion in the quarter. Total backlog ended the year at about $23 billion, which was down 9% versus last year and down 4% ex exchange. 
Revenues in the quarter were down 16% reported and down 6% organic. Foreign exchange reduced revenues $437 million in the quarter. Equipment revenues were down 21% reported and 12% organically. By business, Surface was down 49%, TMS down 18%, Subsea down 15%. Organically, TMS was down 8% and Subsea was down 5%. Service revenues were down 9% and flat organically, with M&C down 5%, offset by TMS, up 22% organically. 
Operating profit in the quarter was down 19% and down 7% organic. Foreign exchange in the quarter was a $93 million headwind. The business continued to deliver on cost reductions and deflation, which partially offset the negative volume and price. Margin rates were down 70 basis points. On an organic basis, margins contracted 10 basis points. 
The business executed an early and aggressive cost-out program beginning in 2014, delivering $600 million of cost-out during 2015. For the year, revenue and op profit were down 5% and up 1%, respectively, and organic margin rates actually expanded 90 basis points. For 2016, our best view for revenues and op profit continues to be down 10% to 15%, most likely at the bottom end of that range, given the outlook for the industry and our view of volume and price. 
Our base plan at December outlook called for $400 million of cost-out in 2016 to get to the $1 billion run rate over 2015 and '16. We are working on another $400 million of additional cost-out reductions to offset the likely lower volume and price pressure. We expect the first half to be tougher year-over-year versus the second half, and Lorenzo and his team have executed very well in 2015, and we expect the business will continue to outperform on a relative basis in 2016. 
Next up, in Healthcare, orders of $5.2 billion were down 4% but up 1% organically. Geographically, orders in the U.S. were down 1%, Europe was down 8% and up 4% ex FX, and the Middle East region was down 4% and up 5%, ex FX. China was down 6% reported and down 3% ex FX. Tenders in China continue to improve slowly. Year-over-year, tenders were flat after several quarters of contraction. 
In terms of business lines, Healthcare Systems orders were down 6% and down 1% excluding exchange. The U.S. was down 2%, driven by lower molecular imaging and x-ray on tough comparisons, offset partially by strong MR, up 33% and ultrasound up 5% on new product upgrades. 
Europe was down 8% reported, but grew 5% ex foreign exchange. Europe was up 5% ex FX for the year and has seen 6 consecutive quarters of organic growth. China orders were down 11% reported and down 9% excluding exchange. Our current outlook for 2016 is for orders growth in China as government tenders begin to rebound. 
Life Sciences continued to perform very well. In the fourth quarter, orders grew 2%, up 8% ex exchange. Within life sciences, bioprocess grew 16% ex FX, with strength in Korea, China and the U.S.
Healthcare revenues were down 3% reported and up 3% ex FX, Healthcare Systems revenues were lower by 4% reported and up 3% ex FX, and Life Sciences revenues grew 6% excluding exchange. 
Operating profit was lower versus the fourth quarter of last year by 4% excluding exchange, and lower by 8% reported. Volume growth and cost productivity were more than offset by price and higher growth investments. Margin rates contracted 100 basis points in the quarter. 
In 2016, we expect John and the Healthcare business to improve operationally in terms of earnings and margin rates. Our outlook is for the Life Science business to continue to grow strongly and profitably and for the HCS business to execute their digital transformation and aggressively reduce product and service costs. 
In Transportation, North America carloads were down 6.4% in the quarter, driven by very weak carloads in coal, down almost 20%, and petroleum, down 13%. Intermodal volume was also down 1% in the quarter. For the year, volume was down 2.2% driven by commodities, with intermodal higher by 2%. Lower volume and operational improvements have improved velocity on the rails on average 2.4 miles an hour. That's up 10% versus last year. For our business, orders in the quarter were very strong, up 66% to $3.2 billion, driven by equipment orders up 113%. We took our largest order ever of 1,000 locos in India and also secured an order for 100 Tier 4s in the U.S. Service orders were down 6%, ex Signaling, on lower overall volume driven by increased parked locos. 
Revenues were up 2% reported and up 11% ex Signaling. Equipment revenues were higher by 17%, 27% organically, principally driven by locomotives, partly offset by services, down 8% on lower overhauls. 
Op profit was higher in the quarter by 18%, ex Signaling, and up 8% reported. Increased local volume, value gap and productivity drove earnings higher. Margins improved 100 basis points reported and 120 basis points organically. 
The Transportation team delivered a tremendous year. Excluding the Signaling sale, they grew revenue 7%, operating profits 16% and improved margins 150 basis points. They launched and delivered 425 Tier 4 locomotives on time, on cost and the performance has significantly exceeded customer expectations. 2016 is going to be a more challenging year, with softer demand in the U.S. and in the commodity markets. We shipped 985 locos in 2015 and we expect to ship about 800 in 2016. The team is executing an aggressive cost plan to address the lower volume. We expect the business to be down mid-single digits on op profit in 2016. 
On Energy Management, as I mentioned earlier, describing results for Energy Management is complicated by the contribution of our Digital Energy business to the Grid JV. For financial reporting purposes, we'll report 100% of the Grid JV's orders and revenues but only report 50% of their earnings. Going forward, we will report results on this basis, but all our organic calculations will include only Industrial Solutions and the Power Conversion business. 
Orders in the quarter were $2.6 billion, up 15% reported. Of the $2.6 billion, $1.1 billion was from the Grid business, with Alstom contributing $716 million and Digital Energy business contributing $342 million. Digital Energy orders were down 10% reported and down 8% organically. Power Conversion orders were down 17% and down 11% organically on no repeat of large Renewable orders in the fourth quarter of last year. 
For the total year, Power Conversion orders were very strong, up 19% organically. Industrial Solutions orders in the quarter were down 17% reported and down 11% organically, driven by foreign exchange and dispositions. North America demand in the quarter was weak across all Industrial Solutions segments. Backlog for the quarter ended at $11.7 billion. 
Reported revenues of $2.4 billion were higher by 20%. Grid Solutions revenue totaled $952 million, inclusive of $393 million of Digital Energy revenue. Industrial Solutions revenues were down 8% and down 4% organically. Power Conversion was down 6%, but up 9% organically. 
Reported op profit for the Energy Management segment was $33 million, which includes the effects of establishing the Grid JV and Alstom's results. Before the effects of Alstom, as I covered earlier, Energy Management earned $118 million of op profit, up 4%, driven by productivity and the gain on sale in our meters business, partly offset by lower Industrial Solutions volume, the contribution of our Digital Energy business to the Grid JV, combined with the Alstom Grid operating results, equals a loss, which we recorded at 50% or $5 million. 
Next, we announced last week and Jeff spoke about it earlier, we have an agreement to sell our Appliance unit to Haier, which we expect to close midyear. Fourth quarter results for both Appliances & Lighting had revenue essentially flat. Appliance revenue was up slightly from last year, and Lighting saw a flat revenue and growth organically. LED growth in the quarter was 28%. 
Operating profit for the segment was up 28%, with very strong performance in Appliances, up 51%, on strong cost performance and up 4% organically in Lighting, but down 10% reported, driven by foreign exchange. 
The Appliance team had a strong year, essentially doubling profits and expanding margin significantly. They've also done an outstanding job managing the business through this disposition process. 
Lastly, I'll cover GE Capital. Our Verticals businesses earned $438 million this quarter. That's up 7% from prior year, driven by operations and higher tax benefits, partially offset by lower gains. Portfolio quality remained stable, and the Aviation portfolio finished the quarter with 0 delinquencies and only 2 AOGs. 
Working down the page, GE Capital corporate generated a $2 billion loss in the quarter, principally driven by restructuring and other charges related to the GE Capital transformation; preferred dividend payments; excess interest costs, including the costs associated with the debt exchange we completed in October; and headquarters operating costs. 
In the current quarter, we took an impairment of approximately $800 million on our Homer City coal-fired power plant in the U.S. related to a decision to exit the investment over time. This investment was not strategic to the Vertical's go-forward business, and this action will align its portfolio more closely to the GE Store going forward. This charge is within the framework of the $23 billion charge to affect the GE Capital transformation. 
Discontinued operations, which now includes the Consumer segment, generated earnings of $3.7 billion, primarily driven by a $3.4 billion gain associated with the Synchrony split-off as well as the earnings and gains from discontinued operations. Overall, GE Capital reported $2.1 billion of earnings, and we ended the quarter with $167 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity. The Verticals ended the quarter with $79 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity. Our liquidity levels remain very strong at $91 billion. Our Basel 3 Tier 1 common ratio was 14.5%, which is up 80 basis points from the third quarter after paying dividends of $3.9 billion during the quarter, bringing our total dividends in 2015 to $4.3 billion. Asset sales remained ahead of plan, and we ended the year with $157 billion of signed deals and $104 billion of deals closed. 
Overall, Keith and the GE Capital team have executed ahead of schedule on all aspects versus the plan we shared with you back in April. We expect to be largely complete by the end of 2016 and are on track to file for SIFI rescission in the first quarter of this year. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

We have no change. We're increasing our goals for disposition cash. I know a lot's happened early in the year, but 2015 closed about where we thought it would. So let's start with organic growth of 2% to 4%. We finished 2015 with $315 billion of backlog. Earlier, I outlined how we achieved those goals even in the face of a tougher oil and gas market. We have broad business and geographic diversity, and Service, which is 80% of our earnings, should continue to grow by 3% to 5% in 2016. We had 2 months of Alstom in 2015, and so far, so good. We think our synergies are achievable. And with the appliances transaction, we're now looking at the ability to fund incremental restructuring. In addition, this gives us upside to our disposition cash for the year. 
All of our goals for GE Capital remain on track. Our dispositions are a year ahead of plan. Capital dividends are the key to returning about $26 billion to you this year, and we plan to file for SIFI de-designation later this quarter. 
We're acting to get more out of this economy. We are aggressively managing our cost structure to capitalize on deflation. We have a very strong balance sheet with substantial cash. We have the ability to finance our Industrial products, which is a huge advantage. Our diversity in both regions and markets allows us to outperform single-purpose competitors, but we can move production to the lowest-cost regions and capitalize on currency or excess capacity. We have all the elements to help ourselves in a tough economy: buyback capacity, substantial restructuring funding and Services growth. And we've continued to invest. Our long-term commitments for R&D, globalization and investments like Alstom have built a huge backlog. 
So just to recap some of our highlights for '16: double-digit EPS growth, returning $26 billion of cash, Alstom integration, digital execution. There's really a lot of value here in GE. 
So Matt, now let me turn it back over to you for some questions."

And then businesses like Drilling & Surface, that are probably the most susceptible as oil pricing goes down to $30, where trying to stay ahead on the cost curve is going to be very difficult in the future, and we just need to be flexible as -- at a $30 environment, the one we see today.

And when you add M&C, you've got about a little bit north of 65% of next year's revenues in backlog. So to Jeff's point, the real short-term exposure, today anyway, as we look at it, is service and drilling. And they are very susceptible to volatility around what they see for convertible demand in any period of time, but it's 15% of the revenue."

Healthcare is actually, after several years of flat revenue in Services, has actually grown 3% or 4% the last few quarters. So we're very programmatic in the Service side. I think we see that continuing into next year with digital being the #1 driver. And at the end of the day, I think in an environment like this, this is the ballast for the company, is the installed base."

And you wanted me to do the full first quarter? So here's what I'd say. Is when you look at the profile for the year, when we talked about gas turbines and power systems, I mentioned the fact that a lot of our volume was in the second half of the year. The first quarter in the Power business, we're going to be down significantly on gas turbines. Last year, we had the tail end of Algeria and we had some Egyptian shipments in the first quarter. So even though we're going to up on shipments year-over-year for the total year for power systems, the first quarter is going to be light on gas turbines year-over-year."

Let me start with some thoughts on the macro environment and GE's fit in it. For the last few years, I've talked about a slow growth and volatile economy. This is still my view. In the fourth quarter, across our own large Industrial footprin",1355,"Thanks, Matt. Let me start with some thoughts on the macro environment and GE's fit in it. For the last few years, I've talked about a slow growth and volatile economy. This is still my view. In the fourth quarter, across our own large Industrial footprint, orders grew by 1% organically and our backlog is at a record of $315 billion, up 7% organically. Our biggest Industrial business, which is Power, had organic orders growth of 29% in the quarter. 
I have a difficult time reconciling this with the mood that is in the markets. Clearly, oil pricing is a concern and will have an impact, but our organic orders growth in the Middle East were up 14% in the quarter, so economic activity is ongoing. I know there's a concern about emerging markets in total, but our organic growth was up 7% in the quarter, ex Alstom. And our business in China grew slightly organically in the year, and backlog grew by 11%. So we're seeing a lot of economic volatility, but there's still enough business out there for GE to hit its goals. 
The GE team had a good quarter in a volatile environment. Total operating EPS was $0.52, up 27%, and Industrial EPS was $0.47, up 27%. Orders were up slightly and organic growth was down slightly versus a year ago. Total Industrial margins expanded by 80 basis points, and 2015 CFOA grew by 8% to $16.4 billion. Industrial profit expanded by 3% organically. 
We hit or exceeded all of our goals in 2015. Organic growth was up 3% with 80 basis points of margin expansion leading to 7% organic profit growth. EPS was $1.31, up 17%. We achieved this despite having $0.05 of FX headwind. The Verticals hit their plan, and Capital returned $4.3 billion to the parent. Our cash and free cash flow execution was ahead of plan. We returned $33 billion to investors, including the excellent execution with Synchrony. 
We also executed a massive amount of portfolio change in the year. GE Capital exits are ahead of plan with $157 billion of signings to date. The impact of Alstom was flat on EPS, slightly better than expected. Alstom had an impact on several segments, and Jeff will take you through those results. But on balance, we like what we see in Alstom. And last week, we announced the disposition of Appliances to Haier for $5.4 billion. This will create an attractive gain and allow us to significantly increase our restructuring targets in 2016. So we're committed to our 2016 framework in the face of macroeconomic volatility. 
Now for orders. Orders grew by 3%, which was up 1% organically. And as I said earlier, our backlog is $315 billion, up 7%, ex Alstom. Alstom added $29 billion to our backlog. Services grew by 5%, which was up 3% organically. Equipment grew by 2%, which was down slightly organically.  Service orders were strong. Power Gen Service orders grew by 13%, ex Alstom, and commercial Aviation service orders were up 14%. Healthcare service orders were up 3%, and Alstom orders were $2.6 billion. We had some nice wins with Alstom in China on the hydro business, several combined-cycle, gas turbine power plants with richer GE content and the Hinkley Point nuclear steam turbine in the United Kingdom. 
On the product side of GE, we also had some solid highlights. Two I'll call out. Power booked 12 H turbine orders in the quarter, and we now have 33 in backlog. In addition, we have another 49 technical selections. And in Healthcare, our MR orders grew by 18% in the quarter, and our bioprocessing grew by 16% in the quarter, so great results by those businesses. 
Globally, orders were generally positive, growing 8% in total and 12% in the growth regions. As I said earlier, we had strength in the Middle East and ASEAN and India, and Latin America was also decent. Including Alstom, China was up 15% in orders in the quarter and backlog grew by 16% to $21 billion. Order pricing was up 0.9% in the quarter, and we have good pricing momentum in both Aviation and Power. So overall, our backlog and orders pricing gives us high visibility as we approach our organic growth targets in 2016. 
So let's talk about the execution of the team and what you saw in the segment results. Overall, the team executed in a tough environment and the quarter organic growth was down slightly. But for the year, organic growth was up 3%, with 7 of 8 segments growing. Service remained steady, up 5% in the year and 4% in the quarter organically. The Oil & Gas team I'd really like to call out because I think they executed very well in 2015. With a 7% decline in revenue, their organic operating profit grew by 1%, and this is ahead of what we said last year. Our team executed on restructuring, they improved their value gap and they invested in their core franchise. And we expect the team to continue to execute in 2016. 
Looking at revenue in 2016, let me just give you a few metrics and some things to think about. We primarily ship from backlog, so orders and backlog growth matter. In 2015, 6 of 7 businesses grew backlog, some substantially. When we do our analytics around convertible backlog and business performance, we see a path to 2% to 4% organic growth for '16 even with a very difficult oil and gas market. The most robust part of our business is Service. Service backlog grew by 16% in 2015, and we expect another year of 20%-plus growth in our digital applications. Both these support sustained growth in Services. 
We had another strong quarter and year-end margins. For the year, Industrial margins were up 80 basis points at the segment level and 110 basis points overall. Services were up 40 basis points, and equipment was up 20 basis points. We continue to make good progress on value gap, up more than $450 million on the year in cost productivity. Mix was favorable in the quarter, and in addition, we have solid momentum for cost out. Again, due to the higher Appliances gain, we can do a record level of restructuring in '16 to fortify our framework. Specifically, we believe we can execute on an incremental $1.7 billion in the year, which should yield incremental benefits. 
Last year, we discussed a new compensation plan that's aligned with investors and delivered results. I'm convinced that this incentivized our team to deliver superior results in '15, and we have set our 2016 targets to drive our framework. Our strategy and business model is paying off, and we believe we can deliver strong performance in the face of economic volatility. 
Now for cash. CFOA grew for the year by 8%, Industrial free cash flow grew by 4% and total free cash flow grew by 14% to $13.5 billion. Total year core Industrial cash flow, ex Alstom, was $12.6 billion, up 3%, and total year free cash flow conversion was 85%, in line with our expectations. GE Capital dividends were $4.3 billion for the year, and we're still on track for $18 billion of dividends to the parent in 2016. The balance sheet is very strong, and the price for Appliances was a pleasant surprise. The business had been improving, and there was strong interest in the business. And a price of $5.4 billion gives us more than $1.3 billion of incremental cash. 
For capital allocation, we returned $33 billion in the year, including Synchrony. And looking at 2016, we're still on track to return $26 billion to investors in dividend and buyback. 
So before I turn it over to Jeff, let me reflect a little on the Alstom results. We've integrated 2 months of revenue, all of the deal-related costs and the impact of the joint ventures, all for the first time. There's inherent complexity as we go through it, so bear with us. But in general, I would say the business and our outlook and our execution are on track, and we're still excited about Alstom."

I'll start with the fourth quarter summary. Revenues were $33.9 billion, up 1% in the quarter. Industrial revenues, including Corporate, were up 3% to $31.3 billion. You can see on the right side that Industrial segments were down 1% reporte",4505,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the fourth quarter summary. Revenues were $33.9 billion, up 1% in the quarter. Industrial revenues, including Corporate, were up 3% to $31.3 billion. You can see on the right side that Industrial segments were down 1% reported and down 1% organic. Alstom revenue of $2 billion in the quarter was offset by $1.3 billion of foreign exchange and dispositions of $700 million. 
Industrial operating plus Verticals EPS was $0.52, up 27%, and that's driven by Industrial up 27% and Verticals flat. The operating EPS number of $0.31 includes other continuing GE Capital activity, including headquarter runoff and other exit-related items I'll cover in more detail shortly. $0.26 of continuing EPS includes the impact of nonoperating pension, and net EPS of $0.64 includes discontinued operations. The total disc ops impact was a positive $3.7 billion, driven by the $3.4 billion gain from Synchrony and earnings from the businesses held in sale. As Jeff said, we generated $16.4 billion of CFOA for the year. That's up 8%. Industrial CFOA was $12.1 billion, down 1%, but up 3% when you exclude Alstom CFOA and taxes associated with the disposition of Signaling. 
The GE tax rate was 5%, bringing the total year rate to 14%. The tax rate in the quarter was driven by the Appliances transaction moving into 2016, tax benefits associated with integrating our existing Service business with Alstom's business in Switzerland, higher tax benefits principally on the Signaling gain we had in the quarter and legislation making the U.S. research credit permanent. 
The reported GE Capital tax rate in the quarter of 39% reflects a tax benefit on a pretax loss. The tax rate for the Vertical businesses was a negative 13%, reflecting reduced income at EFS and international tax benefits that will diminish as we complete the GE Capital exit plan. Going forward, as we complete the exit, we expect GE Capital Vertical tax rate to be approximately 10%. 
On the right side are the segment results. As I mentioned, Industrial segment revenues were down 1% reported and down 1% organic with foreign exchange and dispositions offsetting Alstom. The foreign exchange was a $1.3 billion drag on Industrial segment revenue and $163 million impact on Industrial segment op profit. The Power, Renewables and Energy Management businesses were impacted by the Alstom acquisition, and I'll walk you through the impact on the next page. 
At the December outlook meeting, we said we would present Industrial results including Corporate operating costs. On that basis, Industrial op profit for the quarter was down 6% reported, but up 3% organically on strong Corporate cost performance. 
To give you context on the quarter, organic revenue at down 1% was a little over $1 billion lower than we expected. This was driven by Power, lower by about $350 million on expanded scope and BOP, aero and reciprocating engines that did not close in the quarter; about $400 million in Renewables on lower wind turbines, which I'll cover more on shortly; and $300 million of softness in Oil & Gas and $100 million of softness in convertible orders in our Energy Management business. Most of the $1 billion was timing, and we expect it to convert in 2016. For the full year, organic revenue was up 3%. 
What's laid out on this page is the impact of Alstom on the Power, Renewables and Energy Management businesses. You can see the reported op profit of the businesses in the first column, the impact of Alstom in the middle column and the op profit and the Vs, excluding Alstom, on the right. Power on a stand-alone basis would've been down 5%, Renewables would've been down 54% and Energy Management would've been up 4%. 
The outsized impact of Alstom in the Energy Management business is due to the JV structure of Digital Energy and the Alstom Grid business. We contributed positive earnings from Digital Energy to Alstom's business that had negative earnings. Remember, this is a 50-50 JV, and we consolidate 100% of the revenue but record only 50% of the earnings. 
In the case of Energy Management, the 17% organic V reflects the organic performance for the Power Conversion and Industrial Solutions business, which is how we will report organic for this segment going forward. The organic V, including Digital Energy, would've been plus 19%. 
In the quarter, the EPS impact of Alstom was breakeven, with a pretax loss of $234 million in the segments and an additional $160 million of deal costs and accounting items at Corporate offset by positive tax benefits. Revenue was $2 billion, and orders were $2.6 billion. As we look to 2016, no change to the guidance we gave you of $0.05 of EPS from Alstom. 
Next, I'll do the earnings walk as we've been doing for the last number of quarters, so you understand the dynamics clearly on what's going on under earnings. Starting with the first column on the left and working down. Industrial operating net income was $4.6 billion, and Vertical income was $438 million for total Industrial plus Verticals operating earnings of $5.1 billion. 
On the other GE Capital line, we incurred $2.1 billion of costs in the quarter. This was driven by restructuring charges, the preferred dividend payment, headquarter runoff, operating expenses and excess interest costs. We also took an impairment of about $800 million related to the Homer City power plant asset, which I'll cover more on, on the GE Capital page. 
As a result, total operating earnings were $3 billion. Including nonoperating pension costs, continuing earnings were $2.6 billion. We had a $3.7 billion of income in discontinued operations, principally related to the Synchrony gain. Adjusting for these items, net earnings for the quarter were $6.3 billion. In the center and the far right columns, you can see the associated EPS numbers and their variance versus prior year. 
On the next page, Industrial other items for the quarter. We had $0.04 of charges related to Industrial restructuring and other items that were taken at Corporate. Charges were $567 million on a pretax basis, with $160 million of those charges related to the Alstom deal cost and accounting items. We also had $1 billion of Industrial gains in the quarter, which equated to $0.08 of EPS at the transactional tax rates. The pretax Signaling gain was $622 million, and the Appliance break-up fee was $175 million. Additionally, we sold our Embedded Controls business in Energy Management and our Clarient business in Healthcare. 
On the bottom of the page, you can see the total year restructuring gains profile. We incurred restructuring charges of $0.12 and had gains of $0.11 for a net charge of $0.01 for the year. This was $0.02 better than we communicated in December, driven by about $0.01 of lower restructuring, primarily Alstom-related, and slightly higher gains driven by predominantly tax at the transaction level. 
For 2016, we expect gains in restructuring to largely offset for the year. However, there will be quarterly variability in the timing. As Jeff mentioned, we signed the Appliances transaction, which we expect to contribute about $0.20 of gain midyear this year. That, combined with some smaller transactions, should yield gains of about $0.25 in 2016. We will use this opportunity to continue to invest in improving the Industrial margins and costs. This will benefit us not only in 2016, but will position us well for 2017 and 2018. 
Now I'll go through the segments, starting with the Power business. With the combination of Alstom into the Power segment, we have reorganized some of the sub-businesses, so I'll take a minute to walk through these changes. First, the Thermal business was renamed Gas Power Systems. This business includes gas turbines and steam and generators for combined-cycle applications. And additionally, we moved the equipment side of our aero turbines business to Gas Power Systems. Second, the Power Services business includes our PGS business and services related to aero turbines. The Distributed Power business now includes just our reciprocating engines and the Service businesses for Jenbacher and Waukesha. Additionally, as you know, we have a stand-alone steam business that we acquired from Alstom. 
Moving to the financial results. Orders in the quarter of $9.6 billion, including $1 billion of Alstom orders, grew 40%. Excluding Alstom, orders were $8.6 billion, up 25% with equipment orders up 46% and services up 8%. Within equipment orders, Gas Power Systems was higher by 60%, ex Alstom. The increase was driven by orders for 55 gas turbines versus 41 last year and expanded scope, including BOP, for a large Saudi 7F order. 
In the fourth quarter, we took new orders for 12 H turbines versus 2 last year: 5 units in the U.S., 4 in Pakistan and 3 in Asia. Our H backlog now totals 33 with an additional 49 technical selections for a total of 82 units. Aero turbine orders were down 14% on 43 units versus 50 last year. Distributed Power engines were lower by 12% with weakness in Waukesha gas compression partly offset by strong orders in Jenbacher. Equipment OPI was strong at 6.7%, driven by H turbine demand. 
Service orders, excluding Alstom, grew 8% on higher installations growth in multiyear contracts and strong upgrades. AGP sold 42 for the quarter versus 26 a year ago, bringing total year orders on AGPs to 119. Alstom orders, as I mentioned, totaled $1 billion, including 2 steam turbines and 6 HSRGs (sic) [HRSG], one in conjunction with GE orders. Ex Alstom, equipment backlog ended at $8.3 billion, up 15%. Service backlog grew 4% to $53 billion. In total, Power backlog ended the year at $62 billion, ex Alstom, and $77 billion with Alstom. 
Core GE revenues were $6.2 billion, down 10% and down 7% organically. Equipment revenues were down 25%, driven by fewer gas turbine shipments, foreign exchange and lower balance of plant. In the quarter, the business shipped 28 gas turbines versus 44 a year ago. Total year shipments were 107 units. Lower units and lower BOP were driven by no repeat of the large Algerian deal in the fourth quarter of last year. 
Service revenues were up 1%, driven by Power Services up 8%. AGPs were 35 in the quarter versus 24 a year ago, bringing total shipments to 104 for the year. Strength in Power Service was partly offset by lower Distributed Power Service, down 15%. Alstom revenues in the quarter totaled $917 million with $255 million from equipment and $662 million from services. 
GE core operating profit was $1.7 billion, down 5%. The decrease was driven by lower volume and partially offset by positive value gap. Margins improved 140 basis points in the quarter. Alstom operating profit was a loss of $80 million, reflecting operations, deal costs and accounting adjustments. 
Given the scale of the Alstom consolidation on our first close, things went reasonably well. The core business came in a little lower on revenue than expected, driven by the timing of BOP and aero engine shipments. However, orders were better than expected on strong demand for both H and F products, particularly in Saudi and Pakistan. 2016 is a big execution year, with the Alstom integration shipping approximately 24 H turbines and executing on our product cost strategy. In total, we expect to ship 110 gas turbines and 125 AGPs, with 60% to 65% of these units shipping in the second half of the year in 2016. 
Next, I'll cover Renewables. Total Renewable orders were $2.5 billion in the quarter, up 1%. Excluding Alstom, orders were $2 billion, down 18% and down 10% ex foreign exchange. We took orders for 827 wind turbines versus 1,251 a year ago in the quarter. The decline was a result of lower U.S. orders, partly driven by the strength in the fourth quarter of last year related to the PTC extension. This year, the PTC extension includes a multiyear phase-out. 
Orders were also impacted by the shift from the 1.x product line to the new 2.x and 3.x products that drive fewer units but more megawatts. Additionally, we had 3 deals delayed to 2016 for a total of 240 turbines or about $550 million of orders. Orders outside the U.S. were up 19%, ex FX, and down 2% reported with strength in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia. 
Backlog in the Renewables core business ended at $7.1 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Alstom Renewable orders were $469 million in the quarter with a large hydro win of $400 million in China at the Three Gorges Project. Alstom added $5.3 billion of backlog to the Renewables business. 
Renewables revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $1.9 billion, lower by 16% and down 8% ex exchange. The legacy GE business had revenue of $1.9 billion, down 20% reported and down 12% ex foreign exchange. Core unit shipments were 847 in the quarter versus 1,081 last year. This was lower than expected as 2 deals for 165 turbines pushed into 2016. 
Operating profit, ex Alstom, was $125 million, down 54%. The decline was attributable to lower volume of 234 units, negative mix from the new 2.x product as we come down the cost curve and foreign exchange. Alstom op profit was a loss of $69 million. In 2016, we expect to ship about 3,050 onshore turbines, including 250 of Alstom wind units. As Jeff discussed earlier, 2016 organic revenues should be high single digits to low double digits, depending on the mix of units shipped. Core op profit should be flat to up slightly as the business is focused on improving the cost curve for the new 2.0 and 3.0 megawatt product launches and delivering $100 million of Alstom cost synergies. 
Next, on Aviation. Global passenger travel continues to grow robustly, up 6.7% November year-to-date. Both domestic and international markets are strong, particularly in the Middle East and Asia Pacific. Air freight volume grew 2.3% November year-to-date. 
Orders in the fourth quarter of $6.8 billion were down 16%. Commercial engine orders were down 47%, as expected. We booked $1.9 billion of engine orders, including $100 million of GE90, $600 million of GEnx orders, $400 million of LEAP CFM orders and $500 million of CF6 orders. Commercial equipment backlog ended the year at $29.5 billion, up 11%. Military equipment orders of $353 million in the quarter were higher by 2x on a large Navy F414 order. 
Service orders were higher by 9% with strong commercial spares orders up 10% to $39 million a day, and CSAs were up 24% in the quarter. Military services were down 20%. Services backlog ended the year at over $116 billion, up 15% versus last year. 
Revenues of $6.7 billion were up 5%, with commercial equipment revenues down 5%. We shipped 59 GEnx units versus 77 last year, driven by schedule. We have no delinquencies to Boeing. Military equipment revenue was down 1%, and services revenue was up strongly at 18%, driven by commercial services up 24%. 
Operating profit grew 12% on strength in Services, positive value gap and good cost productivity. Operating margin rates improved 160 basis points. 
The Aviation team delivered another solid execution year. For the year, revenues grew 3%, operating profit grew 11% and margins expanded 160 basis points. Our share on each of our engine platforms is very strong, and the LEAP launch remains on track for midyear. We expect another solid year from David Joyce and the team at Aviation. 
Next is Oil & Gas. The segment continues to operate in a very difficult environment, and we continue to be focused on being hypercompetitive on new opportunities and very aggressive on the cost structure. For the fourth quarter, orders of $3.3 billion were down 35% and down 28% organically. Equipment orders were down 52% or 44% organically. All segments had lower orders driven by delays and reduced CapEx spending, with the exception of our Downstream platform, which grew orders 51% reported and up 84% organically. For the other segments on a reported basis, Subsea was down 49%, TMS was down 78% and Surface was down 65%. 
Surface orders were down 17% and down 13% organically. On a reported basis, TMS was down 24%, Surface was down 29%, Subsea was down 35% and M&C was down 8%, partly offset by Downstream, which grew service orders by 20%. Not included in orders but included in backlog, TMS signed 4 new long-term service agreements, totaling $1.5 billion in the quarter. Total backlog ended the year at about $23 billion, which was down 9% versus last year and down 4% ex exchange. 
Revenues in the quarter were down 16% reported and down 6% organic. Foreign exchange reduced revenues $437 million in the quarter. Equipment revenues were down 21% reported and 12% organically. By business, Surface was down 49%, TMS down 18%, Subsea down 15%. Organically, TMS was down 8% and Subsea was down 5%. Service revenues were down 9% and flat organically, with M&C down 5%, offset by TMS, up 22% organically. 
Operating profit in the quarter was down 19% and down 7% organic. Foreign exchange in the quarter was a $93 million headwind. The business continued to deliver on cost reductions and deflation, which partially offset the negative volume and price. Margin rates were down 70 basis points. On an organic basis, margins contracted 10 basis points. 
The business executed an early and aggressive cost-out program beginning in 2014, delivering $600 million of cost-out during 2015. For the year, revenue and op profit were down 5% and up 1%, respectively, and organic margin rates actually expanded 90 basis points. For 2016, our best view for revenues and op profit continues to be down 10% to 15%, most likely at the bottom end of that range, given the outlook for the industry and our view of volume and price. 
Our base plan at December outlook called for $400 million of cost-out in 2016 to get to the $1 billion run rate over 2015 and '16. We are working on another $400 million of additional cost-out reductions to offset the likely lower volume and price pressure. We expect the first half to be tougher year-over-year versus the second half, and Lorenzo and his team have executed very well in 2015, and we expect the business will continue to outperform on a relative basis in 2016. 
Next up, in Healthcare, orders of $5.2 billion were down 4% but up 1% organically. Geographically, orders in the U.S. were down 1%, Europe was down 8% and up 4% ex FX, and the Middle East region was down 4% and up 5%, ex FX. China was down 6% reported and down 3% ex FX. Tenders in China continue to improve slowly. Year-over-year, tenders were flat after several quarters of contraction. 
In terms of business lines, Healthcare Systems orders were down 6% and down 1% excluding exchange. The U.S. was down 2%, driven by lower molecular imaging and x-ray on tough comparisons, offset partially by strong MR, up 33% and ultrasound up 5% on new product upgrades. 
Europe was down 8% reported, but grew 5% ex foreign exchange. Europe was up 5% ex FX for the year and has seen 6 consecutive quarters of organic growth. China orders were down 11% reported and down 9% excluding exchange. Our current outlook for 2016 is for orders growth in China as government tenders begin to rebound. 
Life Sciences continued to perform very well. In the fourth quarter, orders grew 2%, up 8% ex exchange. Within life sciences, bioprocess grew 16% ex FX, with strength in Korea, China and the U.S.
Healthcare revenues were down 3% reported and up 3% ex FX, Healthcare Systems revenues were lower by 4% reported and up 3% ex FX, and Life Sciences revenues grew 6% excluding exchange. 
Operating profit was lower versus the fourth quarter of last year by 4% excluding exchange, and lower by 8% reported. Volume growth and cost productivity were more than offset by price and higher growth investments. Margin rates contracted 100 basis points in the quarter. 
In 2016, we expect John and the Healthcare business to improve operationally in terms of earnings and margin rates. Our outlook is for the Life Science business to continue to grow strongly and profitably and for the HCS business to execute their digital transformation and aggressively reduce product and service costs. 
In Transportation, North American carloads were down 6.4% in the quarter, driven by very weak carloads in coal, down almost 20%, and petroleum, down 13%. Intermodal volume was also down 1% in the quarter. For the year, volume was down 2.2% driven by commodities, with intermodal higher by 2%. Lower volume and operational improvements have improved velocity on the rails on average 2.4 miles an hour. That's up 10% versus last year. For our business, orders in the quarter were very strong, up 66% to $3.2 billion, driven by equipment orders up 113%. We took our largest order ever of 1,000 locos in India and also secured an order for 100 Tier 4s in the U.S. Service orders were down 6%, ex Signaling, on lower overhaul volume driven by increased parked locos. 
Revenues were up 2% reported and up 11% ex Signaling. Equipment revenues were higher by 17%, 27% organically, principally driven by locomotives, partly offset by services, down 8% on lower overhauls. 
Op profit was higher in the quarter by 18%, ex Signaling, and up 8% reported. Increased loco volume, value gap and productivity drove earnings higher. Margins improved 100 basis points reported and 120 basis points organically. 
The Transportation team delivered a tremendous year. Excluding the Signaling sale, they grew revenue 7%, operating profits 16% and improved margins 150 basis points. They launched and delivered 425 Tier 4 locomotives on time, on cost and the performance has significantly exceeded customer expectations. 2016 is going to be a more challenging year, with softer demand in the U.S. and in the commodity markets. We shipped 985 locos in 2015 and we expect to ship about 800 in 2016. The team is executing an aggressive cost plan to address the lower volume. We expect the business to be down mid-single digits on op profit in 2016. 
On Energy Management, as I mentioned earlier, describing results for Energy Management is complicated by the contribution of our Digital Energy business to the Grid JV. For financial reporting purposes, we'll report 100% of the Grid JV's orders and revenues but only report 50% of their earnings. Going forward, we will report results on this basis, but all our organic calculations will include only Industrial Solutions and the Power Conversion business. 
Orders in the quarter were $2.6 billion, up 15% reported. Of the $2.6 billion, $1.1 billion was from the Grid business, with Alstom contributing $716 million and Digital Energy business contributing $342 million. Digital Energy orders were down 10% reported and down 8% organically. Power Conversion orders were down 17% and down 11% organically on no repeat of large Renewable orders in the fourth quarter of last year. 
For the total year, Power Conversion orders were very strong, up 19% organically. Industrial Solutions orders in the quarter were down 17% reported and down 11% organically, driven by foreign exchange and dispositions. North America demand in the quarter was weak across all Industrial Solutions segments. Backlog for the quarter ended at $11.7 billion. 
Reported revenues of $2.4 billion were higher by 20%. Grid Solutions revenue totaled $952 million, inclusive of $393 million of Digital Energy revenue. Industrial Solutions revenues were down 8% and down 4% organically. Power Conversion was down 6%, but up 9% organically. 
Reported op profit for the Energy Management segment was $33 million, which includes the effects of establishing the Grid JV and Alstom's results. Before the effects of Alstom, as I covered earlier, Energy Management earned $118 million of op profit, up 4%, driven by productivity and the gain on sale in our meters business, partly offset by lower Industrial Solutions volume, the contribution of our Digital Energy business to the Grid JV, combined with the Alstom Grid operating results, equaled the loss which we recorded at 50% or $5 million. 
Next, we announced last week and Jeff spoke about it earlier, we have an agreement to sell our Appliance unit to Haier, which we expect to close midyear. Fourth quarter results for both Appliances & Lighting had revenue essentially flat. Appliance revenue was up slightly from last year, and Lighting saw a flat revenue and growth organically. LED growth in the quarter was 28%. 
Operating profit for the segment was up 28%, with very strong performance in Appliances, up 51%, on strong cost performance and up 4% organically in Lighting, but down 10% reported, driven by foreign exchange. 
The Appliance team had a strong year, essentially doubling profits and expanding margins significantly. They've also done an outstanding job managing the business through this disposition process. 
Lastly, I'll cover GE Capital. Our Verticals businesses earned $438 million this quarter. That's up 7% from prior year, driven by operations and higher tax benefits, partially offset by lower gains. Portfolio quality remained stable, and the Aviation portfolio finished the quarter with 0 delinquencies and only 2 AOGs. 
Working down the page, GE Capital corporate generated a $2 billion loss in the quarter, principally driven by restructuring and other charges related to the GE Capital transformation; preferred dividend payments; excess interest costs, including the costs associated with the debt exchange we completed in October; and headquarters operating costs. 
In the current quarter, we took an impairment of approximately $800 million on our Homer City coal-fired power plant in the U.S. related to a decision to exit the investment over time. This investment was not strategic to the Vertical's go-forward business, and this action will align its portfolio more closely to the GE Store going forward. This charge is within the framework of the $23 billion charge to effect the GE Capital transformation. 
Discontinued operations, which now includes the Consumer segment, generated earnings of $3.7 billion, primarily driven by a $3.4 billion gain associated with the Synchrony split-off as well as the earnings and gains from discontinued operations. Overall, GE Capital reported $2.1 billion of earnings, and we ended the quarter with $167 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity. The Verticals ended the quarter with $79 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity. Our liquidity levels remain very strong at $91 billion. Our Basel 3 Tier 1 common ratio was 14.5%, which is up 80 basis points from the third quarter after paying dividends of $3.9 billion during the quarter, bringing our total dividends in 2015 to $4.3 billion. Asset sales remained ahead of plan, and we ended the year with $157 billion of signed deals and $104 billion of deals closed. 
Overall, Keith and the GE Capital team have executed ahead of schedule on all aspects versus the plan we shared with you back in April. We expect to be largely complete by the end of 2016 and are on track to file for SIFI rescission in the first quarter of this year. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

We have no change. We're increasing our goals for disposition cash. I know a lot's happened early in the year, but 2015 closed about where we thought it would. So let's start with organic growth of 2% to 4%. We finished 2015 with $315 billion of backlog. Earlier, I outlined how we achieved those goals even in the face of a tougher oil and gas market. We have broad business and geographic diversity, and Service, which is 80% of our earnings, should continue to grow by 3% to 5% in 2016. We had 2 months of Alstom in 2015, and so far, so good. We think our synergies are achievable. And with the appliances transaction, we're now looking at the ability to fund incremental restructuring. In addition, this gives us upside to our disposition cash for the year. 
All of our goals for GE Capital remain on track. Our dispositions are a year ahead of plan. Capital dividends are the key to returning about $26 billion to you this year, and we plan to file for SIFI de-designation later this quarter. 
We're acting to get more out of this economy. We are aggressively managing our cost structure to capitalize on deflation. We have a very strong balance sheet with substantial cash. We have the ability to finance our Industrial products, which is a huge advantage. Our diversity in both regions and markets allows us to outperform single-purpose competitors, but we can move production to the lowest-cost regions and capitalize on currency or excess capacity. We have all the elements to help ourselves in a tough economy: buyback capacity, substantial restructuring funding and Services growth. And we've continued to invest. Our long-term commitments for R&D, globalization and investments like Alstom have built a huge backlog. 
So just to recap some of our highlights for '16: double-digit EPS growth, returning $26 billion of cash, Alstom integration, digital execution. There's really a lot of value here in GE. 
So Matt, now let me turn it back over to you for some questions."

I'd say, on balance, that the pricing we've experienced on Power, Rail, Aviation, you see those show up in the pricing in the backlog and the order book. So I don't think we've seen really any diminution of pricing in the emerging market orders. As you know, guys, our stuff is lumpy, so there's big transactions.

And then I would just again segment our business into kind of project-based business, where we're still in execution mode, and that's probably 70% or 80% of our total revenues. And then businesses like Drilling & Surface, that are probably the most susceptible as oil pricing goes down to $30, where trying to stay ahead on the cost curve is going to be very difficult in the future, and we just need to be flexible as -- at a $30 environment, the one we see today.

And of those revenues, more than 70% of those are in backlog. If you add the M&C business on top of that, which tends to be more flow and convertible, but it's about roughly 50% exposure to oil and gas and 50% to non-oil and gas. That's 85% of revenue. And when you add M&C, you've got about a little bit north of 65% of next year's revenues in backlog.

177031,323147610,961709,"General Electric Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2016",2016-04-22,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Matt. GE had a good performance in a slow growth environment. EPS of $0.21 was up 5%. This includes $0.02 of headwind due to foreign exchange. Let me summarize some of the key achievements in the quarter. Industrial organic revenue was down slig",1193,"Thanks, Matt. GE had a good performance in a slow growth environment. EPS of $0.21 was up 5%. This includes $0.02 of headwind due to foreign exchange. 
Let me summarize some of the key achievements in the quarter. Industrial organic revenue was down slightly, and operating profit was about flat despite a very challenging environment in Oil & Gas and tough comparisons in gas turbine shipments. This is in line with our expectations. Industrial margins grew by 30 basis points, up 110 basis points ex FX, and CFOA was $7.9 billion, a good start in the year. We're on track to close appliances in the second quarter, and this will facilitate incremental restructuring and capital allocation optionally. We continue to execute our GE Capital strategy. We have $166 billion of capital deals signed. GE Capital sent $7.5 billion dividend to the parent in the quarter, and GE Capital filed for SIFI de-designation in March. Alstom integration is on track for our $0.05 goal in 2016. We're more comfortable with the business and our ability to create value. We returned $8.3 billion to investors in dividend and buyback, and our capital allocation framework remains on track. 
Importantly, we are reaffirming our 2016 framework goal of $1.45 to $1.55 EPS, 2% to 4% organic growth, CFOA of $29 billion to $32 billion and $26 billion of cash for investors. Our performance in the quarter again validates the strength of the GE operating model. 
Diversity is a key strength during this period of volatility. We're in the midst of a challenging oil and gas market. However, we're seeing sustained strength in Aviation and power markets. Healthcare is rebounding. And I was in China last week and saw improvements in our business. Most of the portfolio is strong, and we're delivering. There's plenty of business out there to achieve our goals. 
Orders were up slightly in the quarter, down organically, and pricing was flat. We ended the quarter with $316 billion of backlog, up 18% year-over-year. Our investments in technology are paying off. Power orders grew by 25%, our backlog of H turbines now totaled 35. Renewable organic orders grew by 88% behind the launch of new 2-megawatt and 3-megawatt turbines.  Healthcare equipment orders grew by 6% with double-digit orders in the U.S. We continue to win in the aviation market as the LEAP remains the engine of choice and on track for a successful launch. Globally, orders were up 9% in developed markets with broad-based growth and down 9% in emerging markets in line with the volatility we see in resource-rich countries. Service continued to be quite robust. Power Services grew by 17%, ex Alstom, and Aviation grew by 13%. Digital orders grew by 29%. We launched Predix and attracted 7,500 developers in just 30 days. Meanwhile, we continue to attract new customers to our additional offerings. Oil & Gas markets remain tough. Activity slowed again in the quarter and was reflected on our orders rate decline. However, we continue to make progress with our customers signing the industry's first performance-based contract with Diamond Offshore. We're confident that GE will outperform in this cycle. Overall, our backlog and momentum support a 2% to 4% organic growth target for the year. 
Revenue was up 6% in the first quarter, down 1% organically, in line with our plan. The main driver of the revenue profile in the first quarter is Power. In the first quarter '15, Power organic revenue grew by 21% as we delivered several large orders. Without this impact, organic revenue would have grown by 3% in the first quarter. 
Some highlights in the quarter include Services up 13%, Aviation up 10%, and China grew by 10% with 15% growth in Healthcare. Healthcare had the best organic growth in 20 quarters, and Renewables grew by 34%. We still believe that organic growth will be up 2% to 4% for the year. Healthcare, Power, Aviation, Renewables are expected to have strong growth, substantially better than '15, and this will more than offset headwinds in Oil & Gas and Transportation. Our second half of '16 is lining up to be about 5% organic growth based on equipment backlog profiles. 
Core industrial margins grew by 30 basis points. Margins would've grown 110 basis points without FX headwinds. We continue to make solid progress in sourcing and simplification. Service margins expanded by 190 basis points as we continue to see benefits from our efforts in analytics. Our integration efforts with Alstom are just beginning, but we see great potential. GE is executing well in a challenging environment. 
Cash was in line with expectations. As I said earlier, we received a $7.5 billion dividend from capital. Industrial was impacted by Alstom with a typical first quarter profile. We expect to hit $29 billion to $32 billion of CFOA in 2016. 
Our balance sheet remains very strong. We ended the quarter with $106 billion of liquidity at GE Capital and $9 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Meanwhile, we returned $8.3 billion of cash to investors in buyback in dividend. We expect to receive $18 billion from GE Capital for the year, and Appliances is expected to close in the second quarter. 
As I said earlier, we applied for SIFI de-designation in March. Our application is quite strong. We would address all the concerns, which led to the original systemic designation. And we'll give you more updates as we learn more. 
Now I'd like to give a sense for our [indiscernible] in 2016. Most of the company is quite strong. Specifically, we feel great about what we're seeing in Aviation, Healthcare, Power and Renewables. The results should be better than what we showed in December. In addition, we're investing in the gains from the appliances business sale into incremental restructuring to achieve lower cost. At the same time, we see pressure in the Oil & Gas business. The team had a decent first quarter, particularly when you take into account foreign exchange. However, we want to take a more conservative position on the year, posting revenue down 15% to 20% and operating profit down 30%. We will continue to outperform our competitors and capitalize on volatility. We've already said the value of GE is the strength of our portfolio, and we are reaffirming our $1.45 to $1.55 EPS framework for 2016. 
I also wanted to spike out our performance in Alstom where we're expecting $0.05 EPS in 2016. We have solid performance in the first quarter, $3 billion of orders with renewed momentum. And I really like our opportunities for gas turbine [indiscernible] of plant, HVDC and steam turbines. In addition, taking a dedicated look at renewables is making us smarter and faster. We have massive potential to utilize the combined supply chain. Synergies were $100 million in the first quarter, on a path to $1.1 billion in the year. Segment operating profit is ahead of plan. Jeff will go through the segments. But big picture, this is working. 
Now I would like to introduce Joe Mastrangelo. Joe leads our Gas Power Systems business. He can bring the Alstom benefits to life and tell you how we're winning in the marketplace."
177031,323147610,961709,"General Electric Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2016",2016-04-22,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with a quick market overview. Overall, demand for Gas Power Systems is steady, and we forecast the market to be between 55 to 60 gigawatts for both heavy-duty and arrow gas turbine. Globally, we continue to see strong demand in No",1359,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with a quick market overview. Overall, demand for Gas Power Systems is steady, and we forecast the market to be between 55 to 60 gigawatts for both heavy-duty and arrow gas turbine. Globally, we continue to see strong demand in North America and Asia with good growth in China. There are also pockets of country-specific growth in the Middle East and Africa, both for utility scale and fast power applications. In addition, commercial activity is increasing in both Argentina and Mexico driven by recent government reforms. 
2016 is the production launch for the HA turbine platform, and our team is ready to meet the challenge of shipping about 24 HA gas turbines this year. The industry continues to shift to the H or high-efficiency technology. Last year, this accounted for 40% of the total industry orders, and we expect that to rise to more than half of all gigawatts sold by 2020. Thus, power demand can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter and customers want megawatts online in months. Using aeroderivative gas turbines, combined with Alstom expanded scope capability, plus local execution financing from the GE Store, we have the ability to quickly go from customer need to power on the grid anywhere in the world. 
Moving to Alstom. This is a great marriage of 2 technology portfolios, high-performing gas turbines from GE and the highest-efficiency steam technology from Alstom. We have industry-leading, fully integrated power island solution capability. Around 10% of our orders came from Alstom Technology in the first quarter, and we are now quoting Alstom steam details on every combined cycle opportunity. A big shift from pre-Alstom, where we sold steam less than 30% of the time. This is our single-biggest growth opportunity in the near term, and we expect strong 2016 orders that will convert into 2017 revenue. 
In the first quarter, we shipped 13 heavy-duty gas turbines, and our forecast is to ship 40 in the first half and 75 in the second half for 115 total year shipments. Right now, 101 of those turbines are in backlog, and we see opportunities to potentially be better than our current forecast. 
The next page covers the HA platform launch. We are very pleased with progress on this program, both commercially where we continue to win in the marketplace, and also on equipment performance, which is exceeding expectations. The H backlog continues to grow. We'll deliver about $2 billion of revenue this year with positive total year margin. Our integrated approach to the market translates into more equipment being sold per megawatt shipped. Alstom improves our steam turbines, generators and heat recovery steam generator performance, and it shows in our orders. In the first 200 days since the acquisition, we have already closed more than double the HRSG orders than Alstom did in the last 3 years combined. Our launch plan for EDF in France has set a world record output for both simple cycle and combined cycle configurations. We're also on track to set another world record for combined cycle efficiency when this plant goes online in the middle of June. We continue to develop and introduce new models at record speed. And during the first quarter, we did a flawless validation of the 7 HA .02 gas turbine. This turbine performed better than our initial engineering models, and our first units were shipped during the first quarter. 
Excellent is another powerful example of the Alstom and GE combination. These 2 projects in Texas have 100% GE Power Island technology. It wasn't sold that way because Alstom wasn't a part of GF the time, but bringing these teams together brings us the ability to derisk project execution and deliver stronger operating performance. The HA platform is one of the biggest product line launches in GE's history. The team is performing well, and this technology is a key driver to both growth and profitability. 
Here are 3 great examples of projects that are improving both business profitability and delivering the lowest cost of electricity power sources. The first example combines new technology with a vertical integration on three-dimensional compressor air foils that improve the output and efficiency for the HA turbine. We deliver a $12 million annual cost savings, raise our supply chain capability and reduce production cycle time. The middle of the page highlights the power of the GE Store. We brought together engineers from GE Power, Alstom and the GRC, who developed new high-temperature material for our F-class fleet. It's less expensive and also improves gas turbine performance where higher temperatures equal better efficiency. Once again, new equipment costs of electricity goes down while creating a new service of great opportunity. Generators are an example of taking existing Alstom technology and putting them it into our product catalog instead of buying it from a third-party. We not only lowered our cost position but also improved performance and reliability. 
The next page will show our 2016 margin profile. The HA will become profitable in 2Q at about the time we ship our 12th unit. We've taken over 30% of cost out of the turbine in our first-year production. Now let's put that into historical perspective. The 10th HA turbine shipment is equal to the 1,000th F-class turbine shipped on a dollar per kilowatt basis. We're delivering higher performance for value with a combination of improved gas turbine output and Alstom steam technology. 
Here are 2 projects in the U.S. The first one is TVA, which we closed in 2014, and our scope was just the gas turbine and the generator, which translated into a value of $178 per kilowatt for GE. Now fast forward to the first quarter of this year, where we closed an HA deal with PSEG, we sold the gas turbine and the generator and added in the Alstom steam tail highlighted in light blue. We more than doubled our dollar sold for the same amount of kilowatts delivered. Our customers get better value. In this case, an incremental $5 million because the power island operates an improved efficiency. 
This is very exciting, and now let me share with you one more thing. Our digital capability is improving our industrial performance. Take the 2 first circles. We are opening new designs spaces and allowing our factory to produce smaller features and tighter tolerances with world-class quality. We build the Digital Twin when we designed the machine and direct link that modeled to advanced manufacturing technologies like 3D printing and additive manufacturing. This allows rapid prototyping and the ability to ramp up production faster. Then we test our equipment harder than it will ever operate in the field at our state-of-the-art full-load test facility. This is one-of-a-kind capability in our industry. During testing, we have more than 7,000 data streams that capture more than 500 terabytes of data. That data goes back to our technology team to both validate designs and improve performance. The blue circle is an example of this. It shows the first 2 stages of turbine bleeding that have thousands of small holes to allow the metal to safely operate above its melting point. We color the blades with thermal paint to validate the design performance on the test end. And now with our new Metem acquisition, we can rapidly prototype and bring into production new cooling hole configurations that optimize performance and efficiency. What once took years can now be accomplished in a matter of weeks. The far right circle shows how combining digital and industrial expertise delivers value. The blue represents a compressor testing campaign compared to the orange, which is 1 year of operating performance for a 537 7F gas turbine fleet. These results create an expanded operating space for our customers. We're moving up into the right and can deliver up to $10 million in incremental value. The data then becomes the basis for Predix-enabled application that allows our customers to maximize performance while operating the equipment safely. This page shows why the HA program launch is proceeding so smoothly, faster than we've ever than before, while continuously innovating our technology platform. 
Thanks for listening, and I'll now turn it over to Jeff Bornstein."
177031,323147610,961709,"General Electric Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2016",2016-04-22,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Joe. I'll start with the first quarter summary. Revenues were $27.8 billion, up 6% in the quarter. Industrial revenues were up 7% to $25 billion. You can see on the right side that Industrial segments were up 6% reported and down 1% organic. Alsto",3582,"Thanks, Joe. I'll start with the first quarter summary. Revenues were $27.8 billion, up 6% in the quarter. Industrial revenues were up 7% to $25 billion. You can see on the right side that Industrial segments were up 6% reported and down 1% organic. Alstom revenue in the quarter was $2.8 billion. Industrial operating plus Verticals EPS was $0.21, up 5%. That includes $0.05 of net restructuring this year versus $0.03 a year ago. If you look at the box at the bottom of the page, we provided the 3% [ph] adjusted for Industrial gains and restructuring. Excluding those impacts on both years, industrial EPS was up 5%, and Industrial plus Vertical EPS was up 14%. 
The operating EPS number of $0.06 includes other continuing GE Capital activity, including headquarter runoff and other exit-related items that I'll cover on the GE Capital page. 
Continuing EPS of $0.02 includes the impact of nonoperating pension and net EPS of $0.01 loss includes discontinued operations. The total disc ops impact was a charge of $300 million in the quarter driven by GE Capital exit costs. 
As Jeff said, we generated $7.9 billion of CFOA in the quarter, up from $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2015, driven by increased dividend from GE Capital. Industrial CFOA was $400 million, down 60%. There were 2 big drivers of the year-over-year decline. First, Alstom used about $400 million of cash in the quarter, and this is primarily timing. consistent with what we said previously, we expect Alstom to be breakeven to slightly positive on CFOA for the year. Second, as you're aware, we have a very second half-loaded volume profile driven by Power. As a result, we began level-loading the factories, which has resulted in higher inventory in the quarter. The GE tax rate was 17%, and the GE Capital tax rate was 36%, which with GE Capital reflects a tax benefit on pretax continuing loss. 
On the right side of the segment results. As I've mentioned, industrial segment revenues were up 6% reported and down 1% organically. Foreign exchange translation of $544 million was a 2-point headwind as was loss revenue from dispositions of $542 million. Those impacts were more than offset by $2.8 billion of revenue from Alstom. 
As Jeff mentioned, foreign exchange had a significant impact on segment op profit this quarter. In total, we had $255 million headwind driven by $33 million of FX translation and $223 million of foreign exchange transactional impacts from remeasurement and mark-to-market on open hedges. Traditionally, we measure the mark-to-market headwind de minimis. For example, in all of 2015, it was about $30 million. And for 2014, it was less than $5 million for the year. It's unusual for us to have this big of an impact, which is why we're calling it out here this quarter. This outsized impact in the quarter was driven by significant movements in certain currencies versus prior quarter. For example, the weakening of the pound sterling, the strengthening of the Japanese yen and the strengthening of the Brazilian real. These impacts were felt in power and oil and gas given the global nature of those businesses, and Alstom was a driver as well, given their broad global footprint. It's important to note that we are economically hedged, and the remeasurement mark-to-market impacts are just timing. The underlying transaction for which these hedges were put in place will occur in sales and cost over the coming quarters, and the net impact of the hedge and the underlying transaction will be roughly 0 over the life of the contract. So again, the $223 million of FX movement will flow back to earnings over time. 
On the right side of the page, you will see the Industrial segment op profit was down 7% reported and done 4% organically. The organic number of 4% excludes the effects of acquisitions and dispositions and FX translation only. Excluding the impacts of transactional FX, as I just discussed, organic segment profit was up 2% in the quarter. 
Next on industrial other items for the quarter. We had $0.05 of charges related to industrial restructuring and other items that were taken at corporate. Charges were $686 million on a pretax basis with $164 million of those charges related to Alstom's synergy investment, deal costs and accounting items. We also had a gain of $59 million pretax related to a sale of our space at 30 Rock, which netted to less than $0.01 impact. 
At the bottom of the page, you can see the profile for the year. We expect gains and restructuring to largely offset, but with quarterly variability in timing. As you know, we signed the appliance transaction, which we expect to contribute about $0.20 of gain in the second quarter. In the second half, we have asset management disposition and some smaller transactions that will contribute an additional $0.05, bringing total year gains to approximately $0.25. This allows us to significantly restructure our cost basis and will make us more competitive in 2017 and beyond. 
Next, I'll go through the segments starting with Power. The Power business had a very strong orders quarter. Total orders of $5.6 billion were up 66%, including $1.5 billion of Alstom orders. Excluding Alstom, orders were up 23% to $4.2 billion, with equipment orders higher by 57% and services higher by 11%. Equipment orders strength was driven by Gas Power Systems where we took orders for 25 gas turbines versus 21 a year ago, including an additional 6H turbine. We also had orders for 7 steam turbines for combined cycle versus 0 a year ago. The U.S. was strong, accounting for 73% of orders value. And international was also strong, up 21%. Our H unit backlog stands at 35 after receiving orders for 6 new units and shipping our first 4 units. 
Alstom steam orders totaled $300 million in the quarter. We took an order for 1 steam turbine and turbo generator for coal application. In conjunction with GE gas turbine, Alstom also took orders for 5 additional HRSGs. 
Core GE services grew orders 11% on strength of Power Services, up 17%. Total upgrades were 52 versus 49 last year, including orders for 25 AGPs, higher by 9 from last year. In addition to AGPs, we're seeing higher demand for other upgrades like dry low NOx and flange to flange upgrades. Alstom services booked $1 billion of orders, including 22 steam turbine retrofits. In total, backlog ended at $78 billion. Excluding Alstom, backlog ended at $63 billion with $9 billion of equipment up 51% and services of $54 billion, up 7%. 
Revenue of $5.2 billion was up 13% with equipment down 24% and services up 40%. Excluding Alstom, revenues were down 18%, driven by equipment revenue, down 48%, on 26 fewer gas turbine shipments and 35 fewer regenerators as we expected. Services, excluding Alstom, grew revenues 5% driven by Power Services, up 7%. Upgrades were 54 this year versus 55 a year ago, including 27 AGPs, which was 6 higher. All profit, excluding Alstom, was $547 million in the quarter, down 28% on the lower gas turbine volume, negative cost leverage and negative currency. This was partly offset by services growth. 
In the quarter, we had $48 million of currency drag, mostly from transactional foreign exchange, principally on the euro and the yen. We expect these transnational hedges to reverse over time. 
Alstom contributed op profit of $26 million in the quarter, including the effects of purchase accounting and currency. Transactional FX for Alstom was a $33 million headwind. 
First quarter results were as expected, and as Joe mentioned, reflect the timing of our gas turbine volume for 2016, which is heavily second-half-loaded. We continue to win with the H turbine, including pulling through Alstom steam, generators and HRSG. We continue to deliver 115-plus [ph] gas turbines this year with 101 in backlog, and we will continue to drive H margins throughout the year. We're on plan for Alstom synergies for the year of about $800 million. 
Next is renewables. Orders in the quarter were $2 billion, up 110% in the quarter. Orders were higher by 86%, excluding Alstom. Our core wind business booked orders for 711 Wind turbines versus 376 a year ago. U.S. orders were very strong, up 144%, including an order for 96 units that slipped from the fourth quarter. Orders for the new 2.x and 3.x products accounted for almost 70% of our unit orders. 
Alstom renewable orders were $225 million driven by hydro, with orders in China, Laos and the U.S. Total backlog of $12.4 billion includes $5 billion contributed by Alstom. Core backlog of $7.4 billion grew 43%. 
Revenue in the quarter of $1.7 billion was higher by 62% with a core business up 34%. The core business shipped 616 turbines versus 472 last year, about half of the shipped units with a new 2.x product. 
Alstom revenues of $295 million were principally attributable to hydro. 
Operating profit in the quarter totaled $83 million, inclusive of $91 million from the core business and an $8 million loss from Alstom. Core profitability was driven by higher volume and a termination payment that was more than offset by 2.x launch costs and negative foreign exchange. The quarter was a good start to the year with strong order growth and execution in both the legacy and the Alstom segments. We continue to expect the business to ship about 3,050 wind turbines in 2016 with about 100 coming from Alstom versus the 250 we originally guided and 150 more from GE. The business is on track to deliver over $100 million of Alstom synergies for the year. 
Next is Aviation. Aviation continues to perform well as does the market. Global passenger air travel from February year-to-date grew 8%, its strongest performance since 2008. Both domestic and international routes saw robust growth. Airfreight volumes contracted about 1.6% through February. Aviation orders in the quarter was $6.6 billion, down 12%. Equipment orders were down 35% to $2.6 billion, as we expected. We booked $1.7 billion of commercial equipment orders, including $800 million of LEAP CFM, $400 million of GE90 and about $100 million of GEnx orders. Military equipment was higher by 91% on large naval orders. 
Service orders grew 13% [ph] to $4 billion on spares up 2%, repairs up 10% and CSAs up 34%. Services backlog grew 11% versus the first quarter of last year. 
Revenues in the quarter of $6.3 billion were up 10% with equipment higher by 2%. The business shipped 53 GEnx units versus 51 last year. Service revenue grew 17% [ph] with spares up 6% and strength in commercial services and military. 
Operating profit in the quarter was higher by 16% on services volume and cost productivity, and operating profit margins expanded 110 basis points. Aviation had another solid quarter. The LEAP launch remains on track, and we expect to ship 15 to 20 units in the second quarter and about 110 engines for the year. We've now accumulated more than 19,000 cycles on the LEAP engine, and all the engines were performing well and all were meeting their fuel specifications. 
Next is Oil & Gas. We're operating in an incredibly difficult environment. In the fourth quarter, U.S. onshore rig counts were down another 27% from year-end and down 72% from the 2014 peak. U.S. well counts are down 64% versus the first quarter of 2015, and CapEx and investment decisions continue to be pushed out in virtually every segment. We continue to be focused on the things we can control, principally on cost and competitiveness. Orders in the quarter were down 44% with equipment orders down 70%. Every segment saw significantly lower equipment orders. Subsea was down 83%. TMS was down 92%. Surface was up [ph] 43% and downstream was down 14%. Service orders were down 19% in total, but all segments also declining. TMS was down 4%; surface, 28%; Subsea, 57%; downstream, 23%; and digital solutions were down 5%, not included in orders, but included in backlog. We signed a contract with Diamond Offshore. The deal covers 4 [indiscernible] sets that was done in conjunction with energy financing business. 
Backlog ended the quarter at $22.6 billion, down 1% from the fourth quarter. Equipment backlog totaled $8.8 billion, down 7% from last year, and service backlog totaled $13.8 billion, up 3% from last year. 
Revenue in the quarter was down 18%, down 14% organically. Equipment revenues were down 23%, 18% organically, driven by service down 45%; TMS down 23%; Subsea down 26%; and downstream grew revenue 14%. [ph] Service revenues were down 13% -- down 9% organic, with all segments low, with the exception of TMS, which grew revenue 6% organically in the quarter. 
Operating profit of $308 million was down 37% and down 31% organically. The business delivered approximately $140 million of cost actions, which was more than offset by lower volume, price and foreign exchange. 
Foreign exchange in the quarter was a $95 million headwind, driven by FX associated with translation of $25 million and transactional FX of $70 million. In an extremely tough market, the team will continue to drive cost and market share. We're on track to deliver against the $800 million cost target. Our restructuring investment will likely increase from $350 million to about $500 million to achieve the benefits as lower volume will offset some of the realization. The increased restructuring is within the restructuring framework we've been sharing with you. As Jeff mentioned, given the difficult market and how orders have started the year, we are now planning Oil & Gas operating profit down approximately 30% in 2016. We expect strength elsewhere in the portfolio and aggressive corporate cost management to maintain our plan. No change in guidance of $1.45 to $1.55. 
Next up is Healthcare, which had a very strong quarter. Orders in the quarter of $4.2 billion were up 5% organic and 1% reported. Geographically, orders grew 3% in the United States, 14% [ph] China, 4% in Europe and 2% in Asia Pacific, partially offset by weakness in Latin America, which was down 12%, principally driven by Brazil. 
In terms of business lines, healthcare Systems grew orders 5% organically and 2% reported with strength in the U.S. driven by strong CT growth of 26% on increased traction on the new evolution CT launch and 16% growth in the ultrasound business. Organically, China was up 12% and Europe grew 6% with broad growth across the region. Our Life Sciences business was up 7% organically with strength in both bioprocess, up 7%, and core imaging, higher by 10%. Healthcare revenues of $4.2 billion were up 3% reported and up 6% organically. Healthcare Systems grew revenue 4% organic, 1% reported and Life Sciences grew 13% organically and 6% reported. 
Operating profit was up 7% reported, up 10% organically. Strong productivity and volume growth offset price and NPI digital spending, and margins improved in the quarter 70 basis points. The business is beginning to deliver on the growth from NPI investments we've made and it's restructuring to deliver lower products and service cost. The business is on track to meet or exceed the framework we shared with you and investors in March. 
Next, Transportation continues to face a very tough domestic markets. Commodity carloads in the first quarter were down 12% driven by coal, down 31%, and petroleum products were down 17%. Intermodal grew modestly, up 1%. 
Orders for the quarter of $653 million were down 56%, as we expected. Equipment orders were weak, down 89%. Service orders were down 3% organically and down 18% reported, principally driven by lower local parts. Backlog ended at $21 billion that's down 2% from the end of the year. Revenues in the quarter were down 25% driven by lower equipment revenues. The business shipped 156 locos in the first quarter versus 215 last year. Service revenues were flat, excluding the sale of signaling. 
Operating profit of $164 million was down 27%, down 22% organically, driven by lower volume and variable cost productivity, partially offset by strong deflation and structural cost takeout. Base cost were lower by 13%. All profit margins contracted 50 basis points in the quarter. The team continues to aggressively drive product and service cost as well as structural cost out given the volume challenges they faced last year. We still expect to ship approximately 800 locos in 2016, and our outlook for the year remains unchanged. 
Energy connection to orders totaled $2.7 billion in the quarter, up 27%. Organically, orders were down 13%, driven by Power Conversion down 20% on weakness in oil and gas, partly offset by strength in Renewables. Industrial Solutions was down 7% organically on weakness in the North American market. Grid orders were $1.25 billion in the quarter, and backlog finished the quarter at $11.9 billion, of which grid solutions contributed $8.4 billion. Revenues in the quarter of $2.3 billion were up 34% reported. Organic revenues were down 6%. Grid solutions revenues totaled $1.1 billion. 
Operating profit was a loss of $85 million. The core business of Industrial Solutions and Power Conversion recorded a loss of $47 million, driven by lower Oil & Gas volume, higher digital investment and lost earnings from the sale of our embedded business in 2015. 
SG&A was down 8% in the quarter. Grid solutions recorded a loss of $38 million, driven by $20 million of operational earnings, offset by a $40 million of purchase accounting charges and $23 million of transactional foreign exchange. 
Alstom synergies in the quarter were ahead of plan, and the is business on track for the year to deliver over $200 million in synergies. We felt good about the progress we are making in integrating Digital Energy and Alstom Grid. Overall, energy connections had a challenging quarter, but we expect the result to improve over the year beginning in the second quarter. We're investing to make this segment more competitive and to improve profitability. We like these businesses for the long term. 
Next, appliances and lighting. We remain on track for a 2Q closing for our sale of appliances to Haier. Haier shareholders approved the transaction on March 31. In the quarter, segment revenue grew 3%, with appliances revenue growth of 8% on strong industry volume, which is up 7%, including strength in both retail, up 6%; and contract, up 9%. Lighting revenue was lower by 6% organically, driven by continued strength in LED, offset by contraction in the legacy lighting business. 
Segment profit of $115 million was higher by 13%, driven by the strength in appliances on strong productivity and commodity deflation. 
The last segment I'll cover is GE Capital. Our Verticals businesses earned $496 million this quarter. That's up 43% from prior year, driven by higher gains, better operations, partially offset by lower tax benefits and impairments. Portfolio quality continues to remain stable. 
Other continuing operations generated $1.4 billion loss in the quarter, principally driven by excess interest expense, the expense associated with the first quarter of 2016 $4 billion hybrid tender, headquarter operating cost restructuring and other charges related to GE Capital transformation, including the cost associated with the preferred equity exchange, which we also executed earlier in the quarter. To date, we've incurred $22.6 billion of cost related to the GE Capital exit plan, and we remain on track versus our $23 billion estimate. Discontinued operations incurred a loss of $300 million in the quarter, largely driven by marks on held for sale assets. Overall, GE Capital reported a $1.2 billion loss in the quarter. 
We ended the quarter with $127 billion of E&I, excluding liquidity, with the verticals at $78 billion of E&I. Liquidity at the end of the first quarter was $106 billion. Our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 14.5%, which is flat from year-end after paying dividends of $7.5 billion during the quarter. The timing of dividends for the rest of the year is dependent on the timing of deal closures, but we expect to pay a roughly half of the $18 billion we've targeted in the first half of the year and the remainder in the second half. 
Asset sales remain ahead of plan. And during the quarter, we closed $42 billion of transactions including $28 billion related to Wells Fargo sale, bringing the total closed transactions to the end of the quarter to $146 billion to date. In addition, we've signed agreements for an additional $9 billion in the first quarter, bringing total signings to $166 billion today. 
Our price to tangible book on deals signed today is 1.3x tangible book, and we're on track for the 1.1x price to tangible book that we estimated a year ago. 
What is left to sign is primarily outside the U.S., with our country platforms in France and Italy and the execution of our IPO of the Czech Bank. We expect to have a small balance of assets left through year-end. 
Overall, GE Capital team have executed ahead of schedule and all aspects of the plan we shared with you 1 year ago. We expect to be largely completed with asset sales by 2016. 
On March 31, we filed the request to the FSOC for the rescission of GE Capital's designation as a SIFI. The filing demonstrates GE Capital's substantial reduces risk profile and significantly less interconnected to financial system and therefore does not pose any threat to the U.S. financial system. We hope to complete that de-designation process as soon as possible. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

And I didn't say it earlier, but when we look at how those marks and remeasurement peel off over the year against the contracts that they're hedging, about 2/3 of that -- of those contracts settle up in the form of cash in the year. So we would expect 2/3 of what we took of the charge here in the first quarter to come back within the year. So that's why the cost productivity line was a negative 40 basis points.

This include $0.02 of headwind due to foreign exchange. 
Let me summarize some of the key achievements in the quarter. Industrial organic revenue was down slightly, and operating profit was about flat despite a very challenging environment in Oil & Gas and tough comparisons in gas turbine shipments. This is in line with our expectations. Industrial margins grew by 30 basis points, up 110 basis points ex FX, and CFOA was $7.9 billion, a good start in the year. We're on track to close Appliances in the second quarter, and this will facilitate incremental restructuring and capital allocation optionality. We continue to execute our GE Capital strategy. We have $166 billion of capital deals signed. GE Capital sent a $7.5 billion dividend to the parent in the quarter, and GE Capital filed for SIFI de-designation in March. Alstom integration is on track for our $0.05 goal in 2016. We're more comfortable with the business and our ability to create value. We returned $8.3 billion to investors in dividend and buyback, and our capital allocation framework remains on track. 
Importantly, we are reaffirming our 2016 framework goal of $1.45 to $1.55 EPS, 2% to 4% organic growth, CFOA of $29 billion to $32 billion and $26 billion of cash for investors. Our performance in the quarter again validates the strength of the GE operating model. 
Diversity is a key strength during this period of volatility. We're in the midst of a challenging Oil & Gas market. However, we're seeing sustained strength in Aviation and Power markets. Healthcare is rebounding. I was in China last week and saw improvements in our business. Most of the portfolio is strong, and we're delivering. There's plenty of business out there to achieve our goals. 
Orders were up slightly in the quarter, down organically, and pricing was flat. We ended the quarter with $316 billion of backlog, up 18% year-over-year. Our investments in technology are paying off. Power orders grew by 25%, our backlog of H turbines now totaled 35. Renewable organic orders grew by 88% behind the launch of new 2-megawatt and 3-megawatt turbines.  Healthcare equipment orders grew by 6% with double-digit orders in the U.S. We continue to win in the Aviation market as the LEAP remains the engine of choice and on track for a successful launch. Globally, orders were up 9% in developed markets with broad-based growth, and down 9% in emerging markets in line with the volatility we see in resource-rich countries. Service continued to be quite robust. Power Services grew by 17%, ex Alstom, and Aviation grew by 13%. Digital orders grew by 29%. We launched Predix and attracted 7,500 developers in just 30 days. Meanwhile, we continue to attract new customers through our Digital offerings. Oil & Gas markets remain tough. Activity slowed again in the quarter and was reflected on our orders rate decline. However, we continue to make progress with our customers signing the industry's first performance-based contract with Diamond Offshore. We're confident that GE will outperform in this cycle. Overall, our backlog and momentum support a 2% to 4% organic growth target for the year. 
Revenue was up 6% in the first quarter, down 1% organically, in line with our plan. The main driver of the revenue profile in the first quarter is Power. In the first quarter '15, Power organic revenue grew by 21% as we delivered several large orders. Without this impact, organic revenue would have grown by 3% in the first quarter. 
Some highlights in the quarter include Services up 13%, Aviation up 10%, and China grew by 10% with 15% growth in Healthcare. Healthcare had the best organic growth in 20 quarters, and Renewables grew by 34%. We still believe that organic growth will be up 2% to 4% for the year. Healthcare, Power, Aviation, Renewables are expected to have strong growth, substantially better than '15, and this will more than offset headwinds in Oil & Gas and Transportation. Our second half of '16 is lining up to be about 5% organic growth based on equipment backlog profiles. 
Core Industrial margins grew by 30 basis points. Margins would've grown 110 basis points without FX headwind. We continue to make solid progress in sourcing and simplification. Service margins expanded by 190 basis points as we continue to see benefits from our efforts in analytics. Our integration efforts with Alstom are just beginning, but we see great potential. GE is executing well in a challenging environment. 
Cash was in line with expectations. As I said earlier, we received a $7.5 billion dividend from Capital. Industrial was impacted by Alstom with a typical first quarter profile. We expect to hit $29 billion to $32 billion of CFOA in 2016. 
Our balance sheet remains very strong, and we ended the quarter with $106 billion of liquidity at GE Capital and $9 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Meanwhile, we returned $8.3 billion of cash to investors in buyback and dividend. We expect to receive $18 billion from GE Capital for the year, and Appliances is expected to close in the second quarter. 
As I said earlier, we applied for SIFI de-designation in March. Our application is quite strong. We would address all the FSOC concerns, which led to the original systemic designation. And we'll give you more updates as we learn more. 
Now I'd like to give you a sense for our dynamics in 2016. Most of the company is quite strong. Specifically, we feel great about what we're seeing in Aviation, Healthcare, Power and Renewables. The results should be better than what we showed in December. In addition, we're investing in the gains from the Appliances business sale into incremental restructuring to achieve lower cost. At the same time, we see pressure in the Oil & Gas business. The team had a decent first quarter, particularly when you take into account foreign exchange. However, we want to take a more conservative position on the year, posting revenue down 15% to 20% and operating profit down 30%. We will continue to outperform our competitors and capitalize on volatility. We've already said the value of GE is the strength of our portfolio, and we are reaffirming our $1.45 to $1.55 EPS framework for 2016. 
I also wanted to spike out our performance in Alstom, where we're expecting $0.05 EPS in 2016. We have solid performance in the first quarter, $3 billion of orders with renewed momentum. And I really like our opportunities for gas turbine [indiscernible] plant, HVDC and steam turbines. In addition, taking a dedicated look at renewables is making us smarter and faster. We have massive potential to utilize the combined supply chain. Synergies were $100 million in the first quarter, on a path to $1.1 billion in the year. Segment operating profit is ahead of plan. Jeff will go through the segments. But big picture, this is working. 
Now I would like to introduce Joe Mastrangelo. Joe leads our Gas Power Systems business. He can bring the Alstom benefits to life and tell you how we're winning in the marketplace."
177031,323147610,961885,"General Electric Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2016",2016-04-22,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with a quick market overview. Overall, demand for Gas Power Systems is steady, and we forecast the market to be between 55 to 60 gigawatts for both heavy-duty and aero gas turbines. Globally, we continue to see strong demand in No",1360,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with a quick market overview. Overall, demand for Gas Power Systems is steady, and we forecast the market to be between 55 to 60 gigawatts for both heavy-duty and aero gas turbines. Globally, we continue to see strong demand in North America and Asia with good growth in China. There are also pockets of country-specific growth in the Middle East and Africa, both for utility scale and fast power applications. In addition, commercial activity is increasing in both Argentina and Mexico driven by recent government reforms. 
2016 is the production launch for the HA turbine platform, and our team is ready to meet the challenge of shipping about 24 HA gas turbines this year. The industry continues to shift to the H or high-efficiency technology. Last year, this accounted for 40% of the total industry orders, and we expect that to rise to more than half of all gigawatts sold by 2020. [ph] Fast Power demand can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter and customers want megawatts online in months. Using aeroderivative gas turbines, combined with Alstom expanded scope capability, plus local execution financing from the GE Store, we have the ability to quickly go from customer need to power on the grid anywhere in the world. 
Moving to Alstom. This is a great marriage of 2 technology portfolios, high-performing gas turbines from GE and the highest-efficiency steam tail technology from Alstom. We have industry-leading, fully integrated power island solution capability. Around 10% of our orders came from Alstom Technology in the first quarter, and we are now quoting Alstom steam tails on every combined cycle opportunity. A big shift from pre-Alstom, where we sold steam tails less than 30% of the time. This is our single-biggest growth opportunity in the near term, and we expect strong 2016 orders that will convert into 2017 revenue. 
In the first quarter, we shipped 13 heavy-duty gas turbines, and our forecast is to ship 40 in the first half and 75 in the second half for 115 total year shipments. Right now, 101 of those turbines are in backlog, and we see opportunities to potentially be better than our current forecast. 
The next page covers the HA platform launch. We are very pleased with progress on this program, both commercially where we continue to win in the marketplace, and also on equipment performance, which is exceeding expectations. The H backlog continues to grow. We'll deliver about $2 billion of revenue this year with positive total year margin. Our integrated approach to the market translates into more equipment being sold per megawatt shipped. Alstom improves our steam turbines, generators and heat recovery steam generator performance, and it shows in our orders. In the first 200 days since the acquisition, we have already closed more than double the HRSG orders than Alstom did in the last 3 years combined. Our launch plan for EDF in France has set a world record output for both simple cycle and combined cycle configurations. We're also on track to set another world record for combined cycle efficiency, when this plant goes online in the middle of June. We continue to develop and introduce new models at record speed. And during the first quarter, we did a flawless validation of the 7HA.02 gas turbine. This turbine performed better than our initial engineering models, and our first units were shipped during the first quarter. 
Excellent is another powerful example of the Alstom and GE combination. These 2 projects in Texas have 100% GE Power Island technology. It wasn't sold that way because Alstom wasn't yet part of GE at the time, but bringing these teams together gives us the ability to derisk project execution and deliver stronger operating performance. The HA platform is one of the biggest product line launches in GE's history. The team is performing well, and this technology is a key driver to both growth and profitability. 
Here are 3 great examples of projects that are improving both business profitability and delivering the lowest cost of electricity to our customers. The first example combines new technology with a vertical integration on three-dimensional compressor airfoils that improve the output and efficiency for the HA turbine. We deliver a $12 million annual cost savings, raise our supply chain capability and reduce production cycle time. The middle of the page highlights the power of the GE Store. We brought together engineers from GE Power, Alstom and the GRC, who developed new high-temperature material for our F-class fleet. It's less expensive and also improves gas turbine performance where higher temperatures equal better efficiency. Once again, new equipment cost of electricity goes down, while creating a new service upgrade opportunity. Generators are an example of taking existing Alstom technology and putting it into our product catalog instead of buying it from a third-party. We not only lowered our cost position, but also improved performance and reliability. 
The next page will exhibit our 2016 margin profile. The HA will become profitable in 2Q at about the time we ship our 12th unit. We've taken over 30% of cost out of the turbine in our first-year production. Now let's put that into historical perspective. The 10th HA turbine shipment is equal to the 1,000th F-class turbine shipped on a $1 per kilowatt basis. We're delivering higher performance for value with the combination of improved gas turbine output and Alstom steam technology. 
Here are 2 projects in the U.S. The first one is TVA, which we closed in 2014, and our scope was just the gas turbine and the generator, which translated into a value of $178 per kilowatt for GE. Now fast forward to the first quarter of this year, where we closed an HA deal with PSEG. We sold the gas turbine and the generator and added in the Alstom steam tail highlighted in light blue. We more than double our dollar sold for the same amount of kilowatts delivered. Our customers get better value. In this case, an incremental $5 million because the power island operates an improved efficiency. 
This is very exciting, and now let me share with you one more thing, how our Digital capability is improving our Industrial performance. Take the 2 first circles. We are opening new design spaces and allowing our factory to produce smaller features and tighter tolerances with world-class quality. We build the Digital Twin, when we design the machine and direct link that model to advanced manufacturing technologies like 3D printing and additive manufacturing. This allows rapid prototyping and the ability to ramp up production faster. Then we test our equipment harder than it will ever operate in the field at our state-of-the-art full-load test facility. This is one-of-a-kind capability in our industry. During testing, we have more than 7,000 data streams that capture more than 500 terabytes of data. That data goes back to our technology team to both validate designs and improve performance. The blue circle is an example of this. It shows the first 2 stages of turbine bleeding that have thousands of small holes to allow the metal to safely operate above its melting point. We color the blades with thermal paint to validate the design performance on the test end. And now with our new Metem acquisition, we can rapidly prototype and bring into production new cooling hole configurations that optimize performance and efficiency. What once took years can now be accomplished in a matter of weeks. The far right circle shows how combining Digital and Industrial expertise delivers value. The blue represents a compressor testing campaign compared to the orange, which is 1 year of operating performance for a 537 7F gas turbine fleet. These results create an expanded operating space for our customers. We're moving up into the right, can deliver up to $10 million in incremental value. The data then becomes the basis for a Predix-enabled application that allows our customers to maximize performance, while operating the equipment safely. This page shows why the HA program launch is proceeding so smoothly, faster than we've ever done before, while continuously innovating our technology platform. 
Thanks for listening. And I'll now turn it over to Jeff Bornstein."
177031,323147610,961885,"General Electric Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2016",2016-04-22,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Joe. I'll start with the first quarter summary. Revenues were $27.8 billion, up 6% in the quarter. Industrial revenues were up 7% to $25 billion. You can see on the right side that Industrial segments were up 6% reported and down 1% organic. Alsto",3587,"Thanks, Joe. I'll start with the first quarter summary. Revenues were $27.8 billion, up 6% in the quarter. Industrial revenues were up 7% to $25 billion. You can see on the right side that Industrial segments were up 6% reported and down 1% organic. Alstom revenue in the quarter was $2.8 billion. Industrial operating plus Verticals EPS was $0.21, up 5%. That includes $0.05 of net restructuring this year versus $0.03 a year ago. If you look at the box at the bottom of the page, we provided the [indiscernible] adjusted for Industrial gains and restructuring. Excluding those impacts on both years, industrial EPS was up 5%, and Industrial plus Vertical EPS was up 14%. 
The operating EPS number of $0.06 includes other continuing GE Capital activity, including headquarter runoff and other exit-related items that I'll cover on the GE Capital page. 
Continuing EPS of $0.02 includes the impact of nonoperating pension and net EPS of $0.01 loss includes discontinued operations. The total disc ops impact was a charge of $300 million in the quarter driven by GE Capital exit costs. 
As Jeff said, we generated $7.9 billion of CFOA in the quarter, up from $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2015, driven by increased dividend from GE Capital. Industrial CFOA was $400 million, down 60%. There were 2 big drivers of the year-over-year decline. First, Alstom used about $400 million of cash in the quarter, and this is primarily timing. Consistent with what we said previously, we expect Alstom to be breakeven to slightly positive on CFOA for the year. Second, as you're aware, we have a very second half-loaded volume profile driven by Power. As a result, we began level-loading the factories, which has resulted in higher inventory in the quarter. The GE tax rate was 17%, and the GE Capital tax rate was 36%, which with GE Capital reflects a tax benefit on a pretax continuing loss. 
On the right side of the segment results. As I've mentioned, Industrial segment revenues were up 6% reported and down 1% organically. Foreign exchange translation of $544 million was a 2-point headwind as was loss revenue from dispositions of $542 million. Those impacts were more than offset by $2.8 billion of revenue from Alstom. 
As Jeff mentioned, foreign exchange had a significant impact on segment op profit this quarter. In total, we had $255 million headwind driven by $33 million of FX translation and $223 million of foreign exchange transactional impacts from remeasurement and mark-to-market on open hedges. Traditionally, remeasurement of mark-to-market have been de minimis. For example, in all of 2015, it was about $30 million. And for 2014, it was less than $5 million for the year. It's unusual for us to have this big of an impact, which is why we're calling it out here this quarter. This outsized impact in the quarter was driven by significant movements in certain currencies versus prior quarter. For example, the weakening of the pound sterling, the strengthening of the Japanese yen and the strengthening of the Brazilian real. These impacts were principally felt in Power and Oil & Gas, given the global nature of those businesses, and Alstom was a driver as well, given their broad global footprint. It's important to note that we are economically hedged, and the remeasurement of mark-to-market impacts are just timing. The underlying transactions for which these hedges were put in place, will occur in sales and costs over the coming quarters, and the net impact of the hedge and the underlying transaction will be roughly 0 over the life of the contract. So again, the $223 million of FX movement will flow back to earnings over time. 
On the right side of the page, you will see the Industrial segment op profit was down 7% reported and down 4% organically. The organic number of 4% excludes the effects of acquisitions and dispositions and FX translation only. Excluding the impacts of transactional FX, as I just discussed, Organic segment profit was up 2% in the quarter. 
Next on Industrial other items for the quarter. We had $0.05 of charges related to Industrial restructuring and other items that were taken at corporate. Charges were $686 million on a pretax basis with $164 million of those charges related to Alstom's synergy investments, deal costs and accounting items. We also had a gain of $59 million pretax related to the sale of our space at 30 Rock, which netted to less than $0.01 impact. 
At the bottom of the page, you can see the profile for the year. We expect gains and restructuring to largely offset, but with quarterly variability and timing. As you know, we signed the Appliance transaction, which we expect to contribute about $0.20 of gain in the second quarter. In the second half, we have asset management disposition and some smaller transactions that will contribute an additional $0.05, bringing total year gains to approximately $0.25. This allows us to significantly restructure our cost basis and will make us more competitive in 2017 and beyond. 
Next, I'll go through the segments starting with Power. The Power business had a very strong orders quarter. Total orders of $5.6 billion were up 66%, including $1.5 billion of Alstom orders. Excluding Alstom, orders were up 23% to $4.2 billion, with equipment orders higher by 57% and services higher by 11%. Equipment orders strength was driven by Gas Power Systems, where we took orders for 25 gas turbines versus 21 a year ago, including an additional 6H turbine. We also had orders for 7 steam turbines for combined cycle versus 0 a year ago. The U.S. was strong, accounting for 73% of orders value. And international was also strong, up 21%. Our H unit backlog stands at 35 after receiving orders for 6 new units and shipping our first 4 units. 
Alstom steam orders totaled $300 million in the quarter. We took an order for 1 steam turbine and the turbo generator for coal application. In conjunction with GE gas turbine, Alstom also took orders for 5 additional HRSGs. 
Core GE services grew orders 11% on strength of Power Services, up 17%. Total upgrades were 52 versus 49 last year, including orders for 25 AGPs, higher by 9 from last year. In addition to AGPs, we're seeing higher demand for other upgrades like Dry Low NOx and Flange-to-Flange upgrades. Alstom services booked $1 billion of orders, including 22 steam turbine retrofits. In total, backlog ended at $78 billion. Excluding Alstom, backlog ended at $63 billion with $9 billion of equipment, up 51% and Services of $54 billion, up 7%. 
Revenue of $5.2 billion was up 13%, with equipment down 24% and Services up 40%. Excluding Alstom, revenues were down 18%, driven by equipment revenue, down 48%, on 26 fewer gas turbine shipments and 35 fewer generators as we expected. Services, excluding Alstom, grew revenues 5% driven by Power Services, up 7%. Upgrades were 54 this year versus 55 a year ago, including 27 AGPs, which was 6 higher. All profit, excluding Alstom, was $547 million in the quarter, down 28% on the lower gas turbine volume, negative cost leverage and negative currency. This was partly offset by services growth. 
In the quarter, we had $48 million of currency drag, mostly from transactional foreign exchange, principally on the euro and the yen. We expect these transnational hedges to reverse over time. 
Alstom contributed op profit of $26 million in the quarter, including the effects of purchase accounting and currency. Transactional FX for Alstom was a $33 million headwind. 
First quarter results were as expected, and as Joe mentioned, reflect the timing of our gas turbine volume for 2016, which is heavily second-half-loaded. We continue to win with the H turbine, including pulling through Alstom steam, generators and HRSG. We expect to deliver 115-plus gas turbines this year with 101 in backlog, and we will continue to drive H margins throughout the year. We're on plan for Alstom synergies for the year of about $800 million. 
Next is Renewables. Orders in the quarter were $2 billion, up 110% in the quarter. Orders were higher by 86%, excluding Alstom. Our core wind business took orders for 711 wind turbines versus 376 a year ago. U.S. orders were very strong, up 144%, including an order for 96 units that slipped from the fourth quarter. Orders for the new 2.x and 3.x products accounted for almost 70% of our unit orders. 
Alstom renewable orders were $225 million driven by hydro, with orders in China, Laos and the U.S. Total backlog of $12.4 billion includes $5 billion contributed by Alstom. Core backlog of $7.4 billion grew 43%. 
Revenue in the quarter of $1.7 billion was higher by 62% with a core business up 34%. The core business shipped 616 turbines versus 472 last year, about half of the shipped units with a new 2.x product. 
Alstom revenues of $295 million were principally attributable to hydro. 
Operating profit in the quarter totaled $83 million, inclusive of $91 million from the core business and an $8 million loss from Alstom. Core profitability was driven by higher volume and a termination payment that was more than offset by 2.x launch costs and negative foreign exchange. The quarter was a good start to the year with strong order growth and execution in both the legacy and the Alstom segments. We continue to expect the business to ship about 3,050 wind turbines in 2016, with about a 100 coming from Alstom versus the 250 we originally guided and 150 more from GE. The business is on track to deliver over $100 million of Alstom synergies for the year. 
Next is Aviation. Aviation continues to perform well as does the market. Global passenger air travel from February year-to-date grew 8%, its strongest performance since 2008. Both domestic and international routes saw robust growth. Airfreight volumes contracted about 1.6% through February. Aviation orders in the quarter was $6.6 billion, down 12%. Equipment orders were down 35% to $2.6 billion, as we expected. We booked $1.7 billion of commercial equipment orders, including $800 million of LEAP CFM, $400 million of GE90 and about $100 million of GEnx orders. Military equipment was higher by 91% on large naval orders. 
Service orders grew 30% to $4 billion on spares up 2%, repairs up 10% and CSAs up 34%. Services backlog grew 11% versus the first quarter of last year. 
Revenues in the quarter of $6.3 billion were up 10% with equipment higher by 2%. The business shipped 53 GEnx units versus 51 last year. Service revenue grew 17% with spares up 6% and strength in commercial services and military. 
Operating profit in the quarter was higher by 16% on Services volume and cost productivity, and operating profit margins expanded 110 basis points. Aviation had another solid quarter. The LEAP launch remains on track, and we expect to ship 15 to 20 units in the second quarter and about 110 engines for the year. We've now accumulated more than 19,000 cycles on the LEAP engine, and all the engines were performing well and all were meeting their fuel specifications. 
Next is Oil & Gas. We're operating in an incredibly difficult environment. In the first quarter, U.S. onshore rig counts were down another 27% from year-end and down 72% from the 2014 peak. U.S. well counts are down 64% versus the first quarter of 2015, and CapEx and investment decisions continue to be pushed out in virtually every segment. We continue to be focused on the things we can control, principally on cost and competitiveness. Orders in the quarter were down 44%, with equipment orders down 70%. Every segment saw significantly lower equipment orders. Subsea was down 83%, TMS was down 92%, Surface was up 43% and Downstream was down 14%. Service orders were down 19% in total, with all segments also declining. TMS was down 4%; Surface, 28%; Subsea, 57%; downstream, 23%; and Digital Solutions were down 5%. Not included in orders, but included in backlog, we signed the CSA contract with Diamond Offshore. The deal covers 4 BOP sets that was done in conjunction with our energy financing business.
Backlog ended the quarter at $22.6 billion, down 1% from the fourth quarter. Equipment backlog totaled $8.8 billion, down 7% from last year, and service backlog totaled $13.8 billion, up 3% from last year.
Revenue in the quarter was down 18%, down 14% organically. Equipment revenues were down 23%, 18% organically, driven by service, down 45%; TMS, down 23%; Subsea, down 26%; and downstream grew revenue 14%. Service revenues were down 13% -- down 9% organic, with all segments low, with the exception of TMS, which grew revenue 6% organically in the quarter.
Operating profit of $308 million was down 37% and down 31% organically. The business delivered approximately $140 million of cost actions, which was more than offset by lower volume, price and foreign exchange.
Foreign exchange in the quarter was a $95 million headwind, driven by FX associated with translation of $25 million and transactional FX of $70 million. In an extremely tough market, the team will continue to drive cost and market share. We are on track to deliver against the $800 million cost target. Our restructuring investment will likely increase from $350 million to about $500 million to achieve the benefits as lower volume will offset some of the realization.
The increased restructuring is within the restructuring framework we've been sharing with you. As Jeff mentioned, given the difficult market and how orders have started the year, we are now planning Oil & Gas operating profit down approximately 30% in 2016. We expect strength elsewhere in the portfolio and aggressive corporate cost management to maintain our plan. No change in guidance of $1.45 to $1.55.
Next up is Healthcare, which had a very strong quarter. Orders in the quarter of $4.2 billion were up 5% organic and 1% reported. Geographically, orders grew 3% in the United States, 14% in China, 4% in Europe and 2% in Asia Pacific, partially offset by weakness in Latin America, which was down 12%, principally driven by Brazil.
In terms of business lines, Healthcare Systems grew orders 5% organically and 2% reported with strength in the U.S. driven by strong CT growth of 26% on increased traction on the new evolution CT launch and 16% growth in the ultrasound business. Organically, China was up 12% and Europe grew 6% with broad growth across the region.
Our Life Sciences business was up 7% organically with strength in both bioprocess, up 7%, and core imaging, higher by 10%. Healthcare revenues of $4.2 billion were up 3% reported and up 6% organically. Healthcare Systems grew revenue 4% organic, 1% reported and Life Sciences grew 13% organically and 6% reported.
Operating profit was up 7% reported, up 10% organically. Strong productivity and volume growth offset price and NPI digital spending, and margins improved in the quarter 70 basis points. The business is beginning to deliver on the growth from NPI investments we've made, and it's restructuring to deliver lower products and service cost. The business is on track to meet or exceed the framework we shared with you and investors in March.
Next, Transportation continues to face a very tough domestic market. Commodity carloads in the first quarter were down 12% driven by coal, down 31%, and petroleum products were down 17%. Intermodal grew modestly, up 1%.
Orders for the quarter of $653 million were down 56% as we expected. Equipment orders were weak, down 89%. Service orders were down 3% organically and down 18% reported, principally driven by lower local parts. Backlog ended at $21 billion, that's down 2% from the end of the year. Revenues in the quarter were down 25% driven by lower equipment revenues. The business shipped 156 locos in the first quarter versus 215 last year. Service revenues were flat, excluding the sale of signaling.
Operating profit of $164 million was down 27%, down 22% organically, driven by lower volume and variable cost productivity, partially offset by strong deflation and structural cost takeout. Base costs were lower by 13%. All profit margins contracted 50 basis points in the quarter. The team continues to aggressively drive product and service cost as well as structural cost out given the volume challenges they faced this year. We still expect to ship approximately 800 locos in 2016, and our outlook for the year remains unchanged.
Energy connection to orders totaled $2.7 billion in the quarter, up 27%. Organically, orders were down 13%, driven by Power Conversion down 20% on weakness in oil and gas, partly offset by strength in Renewables. Industrial Solutions was down 7% organically on weakness in the North American market. Grid orders were $1.25 billion in the quarter, and backlog finished the quarter at $11.9 billion, of which grid solutions contributed $8.4 billion. Revenues in the quarter of $2.3 billion were up 34% reported. Organic revenues were down 6%. Grid solutions revenues totaled $1.1 billion.
Operating profit was a loss of $85 million. The core business of Industrial Solutions and Power Conversion recorded a loss of $47 million, driven by lower Oil & Gas volume, higher digital investment and lost earnings from the sale of our embedded business in 2015.
SG&A was down 8% in the quarter. Grid solutions recorded a loss of $38 million, driven by $20 million of operational earnings, offset by $40 million of purchase accounting charges and $23 million of transactional foreign exchange.
Alstom synergies in the quarter were ahead of plan, and the business is on track for the year to deliver over $200 million of synergies. We feel good about the progress we're making in integrating Digital Energy and Alstom Grid. Overall, energy connections had a challenging quarter, but we expect the results to improve over the year, beginning in the second quarter. We're investing to make this segment more competitive and to improve profitability. We like these businesses for the long term.
Next, Appliances & Lighting. We remain on track for a 2Q closing for our sale of appliances to Haier. Haier shareholders approved the transaction on March 31. In the quarter, segment revenue grew 3%, with appliances revenue growth of 8% on strong industry volume, which is up 7%, including strength in both retail, up 6%; and contract, up 9%. Lighting revenue was lower by 6% organically, driven by continued strength in LED, offset by contraction in the legacy lighting business. Segment profit of $115 million was higher by 13%, driven by the strength in Appliances on strong productivity and commodity deflation. 
The last segment I'll cover is GE Capital. Our Verticals businesses earned $496 million this quarter. That's up 43% from prior year, driven by higher gains, better operations, partially offset by lower tax benefits and impairments. Portfolio quality continues to remain stable.
Other continuing operations generated a $1.4 billion loss in the quarter, principally driven by excess interest expense, the expense associated with the first quarter of 2016 $4 billion hybrid tender, headquarter operating cost restructuring and other charges related to GE Capital transformation, including the cost associated with the preferred equity exchange, which we also executed early in the quarter.
To date, we've incurred $22.6 billion of cost related to the GE Capital exit plan, and we remain on track versus our $23 billion estimate. Discontinued operations incurred a loss of $300 million in the quarter, largely driven by marks on held-for-sale assets. Overall, GE Capital reported a $1.2 billion loss in the quarter.
We ended the quarter with $127 billion of E&I, excluding liquidity, with the verticals at $78 billion of E&I. Liquidity at the end of the first quarter was $106 billion. Our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 14.5%, which is flat from year-end after paying dividends of $7.5 billion during the quarter. The timing of dividends for the rest of the year is dependent on the timing of deal closures, but we expect to pay roughly half of the $18 billion we've targeted in the first half of the year and the remainder in the second half.
Asset sales remain ahead of plan. And during the quarter, we closed $42 billion of transactions, including $28 billion related to Wells Fargo sale, bringing the total closed transactions to the end of the quarter to $146 billion to date. In addition, we've signed agreements for an additional $9 billion in the first quarter, bringing total signings to $166 billion to date.
Our price to tangible book on deals signed to date is 1.3x tangible book, and we're on track for the 1.1x price to tangible book that we estimated a year ago. What is left to sign is primarily outside the U.S. with our country platforms in France and Italy and the execution of our IPO of the Czech bank. We expect to have a small balance of assets left through year-end.
Overall, [indiscernible] the GE Capital team have executed ahead of schedule and on all aspects of the plan we shared with you 1 year ago. We expect to be largely completed with the asset sales by 2016.
On March 31, we filed the request to the FSOC for the rescission of GE Capital's designation as a SIFI. The filing demonstrates that GE Capital substantial reduces risk profile and is significantly less interconnected to a financial system and therefore, does not pose any threat to the U.S. financial system. We hope to complete the de-designation process as soon as possible.
With that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

The GE model is producing for investors in this volatile economy. The strength of our portfolio will deliver strong EPS and cash growth. We're executing well with Alstom.
Before we end, I wanted to give you a sense for how we have aligned the team's compensation with investors. For 2016, our AIP goals, in essence, our internal plan, is above this framework.

Industrial organic revenue was down slig",1194,"Thanks, Matt. GE had a good performance in a slow growth environment. EPS of $0.21 was up 5%. This includes $0.02 of headwind due to foreign exchange. 
Let me summarize some of the key achievements in the quarter. Industrial organic revenue was down slightly, and operating profit was about flat despite a very challenging environment in Oil & Gas and tough comparisons in gas turbine shipments. This is in line with our expectations. Industrial margins grew by 30 basis points, up 110 basis points ex FX, and CFOA was $7.9 billion, a good start in the year. We're on track to close Appliances in the second quarter, and this will facilitate incremental restructuring and capital allocation optionality. We continue to execute our GE Capital strategy. We have $166 billion of capital deals signed. GE Capital sent a $7.5 billion dividend to the parent in the quarter, and GE Capital filed for SIFI de-designation in March. Alstom integration is on track for our $0.05 goal in 2016. We're more comfortable with the business and our ability to create value. We returned $8.3 billion to investors in dividend and buyback, and our capital allocation framework remains on track. 
Importantly, we are reaffirming our 2016 framework goal of $1.45 to $1.55 EPS, 2% to 4% organic growth, CFOA of $29 billion to $32 billion and $26 billion of cash for investors. Our performance in the quarter again validates the strength of the GE operating model. 
Diversity is a key strength during this period of volatility. We're in the midst of a challenging Oil & Gas market. However, we're seeing sustained strength in Aviation and Power markets. Healthcare is rebounding. I was in China last week and saw improvements in our business. Most of the portfolio is strong, and we're delivering. There's plenty of business out there to achieve our goals. 
Orders were up slightly in the quarter, down organically, and pricing was flat. We ended the quarter with $316 billion of backlog, up 18% year-over-year. Our investments in technology are paying off. Power orders grew by 25%, our backlog of H turbines now total 35. Renewable organic orders grew by 88% behind the launch of new 2-megawatt and 3-megawatt turbines.  Healthcare equipment orders grew by 6% with double-digit orders in the U.S. We continue to win in the aviation market as the LEAP remains the engine of choice and on track for a successful launch. Globally, orders were up 9% in developed markets with broad-based growth, and down 9% in emerging markets in line with the volatility we see in resource-rich countries. Service continued to be quite robust. Power Services grew by 17%, ex Alstom, and Aviation grew by 13%. Digital orders grew by 29%. We launched Predix and attracted 7,500 developers in just 30 days. Meanwhile, we continue to attract new customers through our Digital offerings. Oil & Gas markets remain tough. Activity slowed again in the quarter and was reflected on our orders rate decline. However, we continue to make progress with our customers, signing the industry's first performance-based contract with Diamond Offshore. We're confident that GE will outperform in this cycle. Overall, our backlog and momentum support a 2% to 4% organic growth target for the year. 
Revenue was up 6% in the first quarter, down 1% organically, in line with our plan. The main driver of the revenue profile in the first quarter is Power. In the first quarter '15, Power organic revenue grew by 21% as we delivered several large orders. Without this impact, organic revenue would have grown by 3% in the first quarter. 
Some highlights in the quarter include Services up 13%, Aviation up 10%, and China grew by 10% with 15% growth in Healthcare. Healthcare had the best organic growth in 20 quarters, and Renewables grew by 34%. We still believe that organic growth will be up 2% to 4% for the year. Healthcare, Power, Aviation, Renewables are expected to have strong growth, substantially better than '15, and this will more than offset headwinds in Oil & Gas and Transportation. Our second half of '16 is lining up to be about 5% organic growth based on equipment backlog profiles. 
Core Industrial margins grew by 30 basis points. Margins would've grown 110 basis points without FX headwind. We continue to make solid progress in sourcing and simplification. Service margins expanded by 190 basis points as we continue to see benefits from our efforts in analytics. Our integration efforts with Alstom are just beginning, but we see great potential. GE is executing well in a challenging environment. 
Cash was in line with expectations. As I said earlier, we received a $7.5 billion dividend from Capital. Industrial was impacted by Alstom with a typical first quarter profile. We expect to hit $29 billion to $32 billion of CFOA in 2016. 
Our balance sheet remains very strong, and we ended the quarter with $106 billion of liquidity at GE Capital and $9 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Meanwhile, we returned $8.3 billion of cash to investors in buyback and dividend. We expect to receive $18 billion from GE Capital for the year, and Appliances is expected to close in the second quarter. 
As I said earlier, we applied for SIFI de-designation in March. Our application is quite strong. We addressed all the FSOC concerns, which led to the original systemic designation. And we'll give you more updates as we learn more. 
Now I'd like to give you a sense for our dynamics in 2016. Most of the company is quite strong. Specifically, we feel great about what we're seeing in Aviation, Healthcare, Power and Renewables. Their results should be better than what we showed in December. In addition, we're investing the gains from the Appliances business sale into incremental restructuring to achieve lower cost. At the same time, we see pressure in the Oil & Gas business. The team had a decent first quarter, particularly when you take into account foreign exchange. However, we want to take a more conservative position on the year, posting revenue down 15% to 20% and operating profit down 30%. We will continue to outperform our competitors and capitalize on volatility. We've always said the value of GE is the strength of our portfolio, and we are reaffirming our $1.45 to $1.55 EPS framework for 2016. 
I also wanted to spike out our performance in Alstom, where we're expecting $0.05 EPS in 2016. We have solid performance in the first quarter, $3 billion of orders with renewed momentum. And I really like our opportunities for gas turbine balance of plan, HVDC and steam turbines. In addition, taking a dedicated look at Renewables is making us smarter and faster. We have massive potential to utilize the combined supply chain. Synergies were $100 million in the first quarter, on a path to $1.1 billion in the year. Segment operating profit is ahead of plan. Jeff will go through the segments. But big picture, this is working. 
Now I would like to introduce Joe Mastrangelo. Joe leads our Gas Power Systems business. He can bring the Alstom benefits to life and tell you how we're winning in the marketplace."
177031,323147610,961968,"General Electric Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2016",2016-04-22,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with a quick market overview. Overall, demand for Gas Power Systems is steady, and we forecast the market to be between 55 to 60 gigawatts for both heavy-duty and aero gas turbines. Globally, we continue to see strong demand in No",1358,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with a quick market overview. Overall, demand for Gas Power Systems is steady, and we forecast the market to be between 55 to 60 gigawatts for both heavy-duty and aero gas turbines. Globally, we continue to see strong demand in North America and Asia with good growth in China. There are also pockets of country-specific growth in the Middle East and Africa, both for utility scale and fast power applications. In addition, commercial activity is increasing in both Argentina and Mexico, driven by recent government reforms. 
2016 is the production launch for the HA turbine platform, and our team is ready to meet the challenge of shipping about 24 HA gas turbines this year. The industry continues to shift to the H or high-efficiency technology. Last year, this accounted for 40% of the total industry orders, and we expect that to rise to more than half of all gigawatts sold by 2020. Fast Power demand can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter and customers want megawatts online in months. Using aeroderivative gas turbines, combined with Alstom expanded scope capability, plus local execution and financing from the GE Store, we have the ability to quickly go from customer need to power on the grid anywhere in the world. 
Moving to Alstom. This is a great marriage of 2 technology portfolios: high-performing gas turbines from GE and the highest-efficiency steam tail technology from Alstom. We have industry-leading, fully integrated power island solution capability. Around 10% of our orders came from Alstom Technology in the first quarter, and we are now quoting Alstom steam tails on every combined-cycle opportunity. A big shift from pre-Alstom, where we sold steam tails less than 30% of the time. This is our single-biggest growth opportunity in the near term, and we expect strong 2016 orders that will convert into 2017 revenue. 
In the first quarter, we shipped 13 heavy-duty gas turbines, and our forecast is to ship 40 in the first half and 75 in the second half for 115 total year shipments. Right now, 101 of those turbines are in backlog, and we see opportunities to potentially be better than our current forecast. 
The next page covers the HA platform launch. We are very pleased with progress on this program, both commercially where we continue to win in the marketplace, and also on equipment performance, which is exceeding expectations. The H backlog continues to grow. We'll deliver about $2 billion of revenue this year with positive total year margin. Our integrated approach to the market translates into more equipment being sold per megawatt shipped. Alstom improves our steam turbines, generators and heat recovery steam generator performance, and it shows in our orders. In the first 200 days since the acquisition, we have already closed more than double the HRSG orders than Alstom did in the last 3 years combined. Our launch plan for EDF in France has set a world record output for both simple-cycle and combined-cycle configurations. We're also on track to set another world record for combined-cycle efficiency when this plant goes online in the middle of June. We continue to develop and introduce new models at record speed. And during the first quarter, we did a flawless validation of the 7HA.02 gas turbine. This turbine performed better than our initial engineering models, and our first units were shipped during the first quarter. 
Exelon is another powerful example of the Alstom and GE combination. These 2 projects in Texas have 100% GE power island technology. It wasn't sold that way because Alstom wasn't yet part of GE at the time, but bringing these teams together gives us the ability to derisk project execution and deliver stronger operating performance. The HA platform is one of the biggest product line launches in GE's history. The team is performing well, and this technology is a key driver to both growth and profitability. 
Here are 3 great examples of projects that are improving both business profitability and delivering the lowest cost of electricity to our customers. The first example combines new technology with a vertical integration on three-dimensional compressor airfoils that improve the output and efficiency for the HA turbine. We deliver a $12 million annual cost savings, raise our supply chain capability and reduce production cycle time. The middle of the page highlights the power of the GE Store. We brought together engineers from GE Power, Alstom and the GRC, who developed new high-temperature material for our F-class fleet. It's less expensive and also improves gas turbine performance, where higher temperatures equal better efficiency. Once again, new equipment cost of electricity goes down while creating a new service upgrade opportunity. Generators are an example of taking existing Alstom technology and putting it into our product catalog instead of buying it from a third party. We not only lowered our cost position, but also improved performance and reliability. 
The next page looks at our 2016 op margin profile. The HA will become profitable in 2Q at about the time we ship our 12th unit. We've taken over 30% of cost out of the turbine in our first year of production. Now let's put that into historical perspective. The 10th HA turbine shipment is equal to the 1,000th F-class turbine shipped on a dollar-per-kilowatt basis. We're delivering higher performance for value with the combination of improved gas turbine output and Alstom steam technology. 
Here are 2 projects in the U.S. The first one is TVA, which we closed in 2014, and our scope was just the gas turbine and the generator, which translated into a value of $178 per kilowatt for GE. Now fast forward to the first quarter of this year, where we closed an HA deal with PSEG. We sold the gas turbine and the generator and added in the Alstom steam tail, highlighted in light blue. We more than double our dollars sold for the same amount of kilowatts delivered. Our customers get better value, in this case, an incremental $5 million, because the power island operates at improved efficiency. 
This is very exciting, and now let me share with you one more thing, how our Digital capability is improving our Industrial performance. Take the 2 first circles. We are opening new design spaces and allowing our factory to produce smaller features and tighter tolerances with world-class quality. We build the Digital Twin when we design the machine and direct link that model to advanced manufacturing technologies like 3D printing and additive manufacturing. This allows rapid prototyping and the ability to ramp up production faster. Then we test our equipment harder than it will ever operate in the field at our state-of-the-art full-load test facility. This is one-of-a-kind capability in our industry. During testing, we have more than 7,000 data streams that capture more than 500 terabytes of data. That data goes back to our technology team to both validate designs and improve performance. The blue circle is an example of this. It shows the first 2 stages of turbine bleeding that have thousands of small holes to allow the metal to safely operate above its melting point. We color the blades with thermal paint to validate the design performance on the test end. And now with our new Metem acquisition, we can rapidly prototype and bring into production new cooling hole configurations that optimize performance and efficiency. What once took years can now be accomplished in a matter of weeks. The far-right circle shows how combining Digital and Industrial expertise delivers value. The blue represents a compressor testing campaign compared to the orange, which is 1 year of operating performance for a 537 7F gas turbine fleet. These results create an expanded operating space for our customers, where moving up and to the right can deliver up to $10 million in incremental value. The data then becomes the basis for a Predix-enabled application that allows our customers to maximize performance while operating the equipment safely. This page shows why the HA program launch is proceeding so smoothly, faster than we've ever done before, while continuously innovating our technology platform. 
Thanks for listening. And I'll now turn it over to Jeff Bornstein."
177031,323147610,961968,"General Electric Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 22, 2016",2016-04-22,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Joe. I'll start with the first quarter summary. Revenues were $27.8 billion, up 6% in the quarter. Industrial revenues were up 7% to $25 billion. You can see on the right side that Industrial segments were up 6% reported and down 1% organic. Alsto",3590,"Thanks, Joe. I'll start with the first quarter summary. Revenues were $27.8 billion, up 6% in the quarter. Industrial revenues were up 7% to $25 billion. You can see on the right side that Industrial segments were up 6% reported and down 1% organic. Alstom revenue in the quarter was $2.8 billion. Industrial operating plus Verticals EPS was $0.21, up 5%. That includes $0.05 of net restructuring this year versus $0.03 a year ago. If you look at the box at the bottom of the page, we provided the V% adjusted for Industrial gains and restructuring. Excluding those impacts in both years, industrial EPS was up 5%, and Industrial plus Vertical EPS was up 14%. 
The operating EPS number of $0.06 includes other continuing GE Capital activity, including headquarter runoff and other exit-related items that I'll cover on the GE Capital page. 
Continuing EPS of $0.02 includes the impact of nonoperating pension, and net EPS of $0.01 loss includes discontinued operations. The total disc ops impact was a charge of $300 million in the quarter, driven by GE Capital exit costs. 
As Jeff said, we generated $7.9 billion of CFOA in the quarter, up from $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2015, driven by increased dividend from GE Capital. Industrial CFOA was $400 million, down 60%. There were 2 big drivers of the year-over-year decline. First, Alstom used about $400 million of cash in the quarter, and this is primarily timing. Consistent with what we said previously, we expect Alstom to be breakeven to slightly positive on CFOA for the year. Second, as you're aware, we have a very second-half-loaded volume profile driven by Power. As a result, we began level loading the factories, which has resulted in higher inventory in the quarter. The GE tax rate was 17%, and the GE Capital tax rate was 36%, which with GE Capital reflects a tax benefit on a pretax continuing loss. 
On the right side are the segment results. As I've mentioned, Industrial segment revenues were up 6% reported and down 1% organically. Foreign exchange translation of $544 million was a 2-point headwind as was lost revenue from dispositions of $542 million. Those impacts were more than offset by $2.8 billion of revenue from Alstom. 
As Jeff mentioned, foreign exchange had a significant impact on segment op profit this quarter. In total, we had $255 million headwind driven by $33 million of FX translation and $223 million of foreign exchange transactional impacts from remeasurement and mark-to-market on open hedges. Traditionally, remeasurement of mark-to-market have been de minimis. For example, in all of 2015, it was about $30 million. And for 2014, it was less than $5 million for the year. It's unusual for us to have this big of an impact, which is why we're calling it out here this quarter. This outsized impact in the quarter was driven by significant movements in certain currencies versus prior quarter. For example, the weakening of the pound sterling, the strengthening of the Japanese yen and the strengthening of the Brazilian real. These impacts were principally felt in Power and Oil & Gas, given the global nature of those businesses, and Alstom was a driver as well, given their broad global footprint. It's important to note that we are economically hedged, and the remeasurement of mark-to-market impacts are just timing. The underlying transactions for which these hedges were put in place will occur in sales and costs over the coming quarters, and the net impact of the hedge and the underlying transaction will be roughly 0 over the life of the contract. So again, the $223 million of FX movement will flow back through earnings over time. 
On the right side of the page, you will see the Industrial segment op profit was down 7% reported and down 4% organically. The organic number of 4% excludes the effects of acquisitions and dispositions and FX translation only. Excluding the impacts of transactional FX, as I just discussed, organic segment profit was up 2% in the quarter. 
Next on Industrial other items for the quarter. We had $0.05 of charges related to Industrial restructuring and other items that were taken at corporate. Charges were $686 million on a pretax basis with $164 million of those charges related to Alstom's synergy investments, deal costs and accounting items. We also had a gain of $59 million pretax related to the sale of our space at 30 Rock, which netted to less than $0.01 impact. 
At the bottom of the page, you can see the profile for the year. We expect gains and restructuring to largely offset, but with quarterly variability in timing. As you know, we signed the Appliance transaction, which we expect to contribute about $0.20 of gain in the second quarter. In the second half, we have asset management disposition and some smaller transactions that will contribute an additional $0.05, bringing total year gains to approximately $0.25. This allows us to significantly restructure our cost basis and will make us more competitive in 2017 and beyond. 
Next, I'll go through the segments, starting with Power. The Power business had a very strong orders quarter. Total orders of $5.6 billion were up 66%, including $1.5 billion of Alstom orders. Excluding Alstom, orders were up 23% to $4.2 billion, with equipment orders higher by 57% and services higher by 11%. Equipment order strength was driven by Gas Power Systems, where we took orders for 25 gas turbines versus 21 a year ago, including an additional 6 H turbines. We also had orders for 7 steam turbines for combined cycle versus 0 a year ago. The U.S. was strong, accounting for 73% of orders value. And international was also strong, up 21%. Our H unit backlog stands at 35 after receiving orders for 6 new units and shipping our first 4 units. 
Alstom steam orders totaled $300 million in the quarter. We took an order for 1 steam turbine and a turbo generator for coal application. In conjunction with GE gas turbine, Alstom also took orders for 5 additional HRSGs. 
Core GE services grew orders 11% on strength of Power Services, up 17%. Total upgrades were 52 versus 49 last year, including orders for 25 AGPs, higher by 9 from last year. In addition to AGPs, we're seeing higher demand for other upgrades like Dry Low NOx and flange-to-flange upgrades. Alstom services booked $1 billion of orders, including 22 steam turbine retrofits. In total, backlog ended at $78 billion. Excluding Alstom, backlog ended at $63 billion, with $9 billion of equipment, up 51%, and services of $54 billion, up 7%. 
Revenue of $5.2 billion was up 13%, with equipment down 24% and services up 40%. Excluding Alstom, revenues were down 18%, driven by equipment revenue, down 48%, on 26 fewer gas turbine shipments and 35 fewer generators, as we expected. Services, excluding Alstom, grew revenues 5%, driven by Power Services, up 7%. Upgrades were 54 this year versus 55 a year ago, including 27 AGPs, which was 6 higher. Op profit, excluding Alstom, was $547 million in the quarter, down 28% on the lower gas turbine volume, negative cost leverage and negative currency. This was partly offset by services growth. 
In the quarter, we had $48 million of currency drag, mostly from transactional foreign exchange, principally on the euro and the yen. We expect these transnational hedges to reverse over time. 
Alstom contributed op profit of $26 million in the quarter, including the effects of purchase accounting and currency. Transactional FX for Alstom was a $33 million headwind. 
First quarter results were as expected, and as Joe mentioned, reflect the timing of our gas turbine volume for 2016, which is heavily second half loaded. We continue to win with the H turbine, including pulling through Alstom steam, generators and HRSGs. We expect to deliver 115-plus gas turbines this year with 101 in backlog, and we will continue to drive H margins throughout the year. We're on plan for Alstom synergies for the year of about $800 million. 
Next is Renewables. Orders in the quarter were $2 billion, up 110% in the quarter. Orders were higher by 86%, excluding Alstom. Our core Wind business took orders for 711 wind turbines versus 376 a year ago. U.S. orders were very strong, up 144%, including an order for 96 units that slipped from the fourth quarter. Orders for the new 2.x and 3.x products accounted for almost 70% of our unit orders. 
Alstom renewable orders were $225 million driven by hydro, with orders in China, Laos and the U.S. Total backlog of $12.4 billion includes $5 billion contributed by Alstom. Core backlog of $7.4 billion grew 43%. 
Revenue in the quarter of $1.7 billion was higher by 62%, with the core business up 34%. The core business shipped 616 turbines versus 472 last year. About half of the shipped units were the new 2.x product. 
Alstom revenues of $295 million were principally attributable to hydro. 
Operating profit in the quarter totaled $83 million, inclusive of $91 million from the core business and an $8 million loss from Alstom. Core profitability was driven by higher volume and a termination payment that was more than offset by 2.x launch costs and negative foreign exchange. The quarter was a good start to the year with strong order growth and execution in both the legacy and the Alstom segments. We continue to expect the business to ship about 3,050 wind turbines in 2016, with about 100 coming from Alstom versus the 250 we originally guided, and 150 more from GE. The business is on track to deliver over $100 million of Alstom synergies for the year. 
Next is Aviation. Aviation continues to perform well, as does the market. Global passenger air travel from February year-to-date grew 8%, its strongest performance since 2008. Both domestic and international routes saw robust growth. Airfreight volumes contracted about 1.6% through February. Aviation orders in the quarter was $6.6 billion, down 12%. Equipment orders were down 35% to $2.6 billion, as we expected. We booked $1.7 billion of commercial equipment orders, including $800 million of LEAP CFM, $400 million of GE90 and about $100 million of GEnx orders. Military equipment was higher by 91% on large naval orders. 
Service orders grew 13% to $4 billion on spares up 2%, repairs up 10% and CSAs up 34%. Services backlog grew 11% versus the first quarter of last year. 
Revenues in the quarter of $6.3 billion were up 10%, with equipment higher by 2%. The business shipped 53 GEnx units versus 51 last year. Service revenue grew 17%, with spares up 6% and strength in commercial services and military. 
Operating profit in the quarter was higher by 16% on Services volume and cost productivity, and operating profit margins expanded 110 basis points. Aviation had another solid quarter. The LEAP launch remains on track, and we expect to ship 15 to 20 units in the second quarter and about 110 engines for the year. We've now accumulated more than 19,000 cycles on the LEAP engine, and all the engines were performing well and all were meeting their fuel specifications. 
Next is Oil & Gas. We're operating in an incredibly difficult environment. In the first quarter, U.S. onshore rig counts were down another 27% from year-end and down 72% from the 2014 peak. U.S. well counts are down 64% versus the first quarter of 2015, and CapEx and investment decisions continue to be pushed out in virtually every segment. We continue to be focused on the things we can control, principally on cost and competitiveness. Orders in the quarter were down 44%, with equipment orders down 70%. Every segment saw significantly lower equipment orders. Subsea was down 83%, TMS was down 92%, Surface was down 43% and Downstream was down 14%. Service orders were down 19% in total, with all segments also declining. TMS was down 4%; Surface, 28%; Subsea, 57%; downstream, 23%; and Digital Solutions were down 5%. Not included in orders, but included in backlog, we signed the CSA contract with Diamond Offshore. The deal covers 4 BOP sets and was done in conjunction with our energy financing business
Backlog ended the quarter at $22.6 billion, down 1% from the fourth quarter. Equipment backlog totaled $8.8 billion, down 7% from last year, and service backlog totaled $13.8 billion, up 3% from last year.
Revenue in the quarter was down 18%, down 14% organically. Equipment revenues were down 23%, 18% organically, driven by service, down 45%; TMS, down 23%; Subsea, down 26%; and downstream grew revenue 14%. Service revenues were down 13%, down 9% organic, with all segments lower, with the exception of TMS, which grew revenue 6% organically in the quarter.
Operating profit of $308 million was down 37% and down 31% organically. The business delivered approximately $140 million of cost actions, which was more than offset by lower volume, price and foreign exchange.
Foreign exchange in the quarter was a $95 million headwind, driven by FX associated with translation of $25 million and transactional FX of $70 million. In an extremely tough market, the team will continue to drive cost and market share. We are on track to deliver against the $800 million cost target. Our restructuring investment will likely increase from $350 million to about $500 million to achieve the benefits, as lower volume will offset some of the realization.
The increased restructuring is within the restructuring framework we've been sharing with you. As Jeff mentioned, given the difficult market and how orders have started the year, we are now planning Oil & Gas operating profit down approximately 30% in 2016. We expect strength elsewhere in the portfolio and aggressive corporate cost management to maintain our plan. No change in guidance of $1.45 to $1.55.
Next up is Healthcare, which had a very strong quarter. Orders in the quarter of $4.2 billion were up 5% organic and 1% reported. Geographically, orders grew 3% in the United States, 14% in China, 4% in Europe and 2% in Asia Pacific, partially offset by weakness in Latin America, which was down 12%, principally driven by Brazil.
In terms of business lines, Healthcare Systems grew orders 5% organically and 2% reported, with strength in the U.S. driven by strong CT growth of 26% on increased traction on the new Revolution [ph] CT launch and 16% growth in the ultrasound business. Organically, China was up 12% and Europe grew 6% with broad growth across the region.
Our Life Sciences business was up 7% organically with strength in both bioprocess, up 7%, and core imaging, higher by 10%. Healthcare revenues of $4.2 billion were up 3% reported and up 6% organically. Healthcare Systems grew revenue 4% organic, 1% reported, and Life Sciences grew 13% organically and 6% reported.
Operating profit was up 7% reported, up 10% organically. Strong productivity and volume growth offset price and NPI digital spending, and margins improved in the quarter 70 basis points. The business is beginning to deliver on the growth from NPI investments we've made, and it's restructuring to deliver lower products and service cost. The business is on track to meet or exceed the framework we shared with you and investors in March.
Next, Transportation continues to face a very tough domestic market. Commodity carloads in the first quarter were down 12%, driven by coal, down 31%, and petroleum products were down 17%. Intermodal grew modestly, up 1%.
Orders for the quarter of $653 million were down 56%, as we expected. Equipment orders were weak, down 89%. Service orders were down 3% organically and down 18% reported, principally driven by lower local parts. Backlog ended at $21.1 billion, that's down 2% from the end of the year. Revenues in the quarter were down 25% driven by lower equipment revenues. The business shipped 156 locos in the first quarter versus 215 last year. Service revenues were flat, excluding the sale of Signaling.
Operating profit of $164 million was down 27%, down 22% organically, driven by lower volume and variable cost productivity, partially offset by strong deflation and structural cost takeout. Base costs were lower by 13%. Op profit margins contracted 50 basis points in the quarter. The team continues to aggressively drive product and service cost as well as structural cost out given the volume challenges they faced this year. We still expect to ship approximately 800 locos in 2016, and our outlook for the year remains unchanged.
Energy Connections orders totaled $2.7 billion in the quarter, up 27%. Organically, orders were down 13%, driven by Power Conversion down 20% on weakness in Oil & Gas, partly offset by strength in Renewables. Industrial Solutions was down 7% organically on weakness in the North American market. Grid orders were $1.25 billion in the quarter, and backlog finished the quarter at $11.9 billion, of which grid solutions contributed $8.4 billion. Revenues in the quarter of $2.3 billion were up 34% reported. Organic revenues were down 6%. Grid solutions revenues totaled $1.1 billion.
Operating profit was a loss of $85 million. The core business of Industrial Solutions and Power Conversion recorded a loss of $47 million, driven by lower Oil & Gas volume, higher Digital investment and lost earnings from the sale of our embedded business in 2015.
SG&A was down 8% in the quarter. Grid solutions recorded a loss of $38 million, driven by $20 million of operational earnings, offset by $40 million of purchase accounting charges and $23 million of transactional foreign exchange.
Alstom synergies in the quarter were ahead of plan, and the business is on track for the year to deliver over $200 million of synergies. We feel good about the progress we're making in integrating Digital Energy and Alstom Grid. Overall, Energy Connections had a challenging quarter, but we expect the results to improve over the year, beginning in the second quarter. We're investing to make this segment more competitive and to improve profitability. We like these businesses for the long term.
Next, Appliances & Lighting. We remain on track for a 2Q closing for our sale of Appliances to Haier. Haier shareholders approved the transaction on March 31. In the quarter, segment revenue grew 3%, with Appliances revenue growth of 8% on strong industry volume, which is up 7%, including strength in both retail, up 6%; and contract, up 9%. Lighting revenue was lower by 6% organically, driven by continued strength in LED, offset by contraction in the legacy lighting business. Segment profit of $115 million was higher by 13%, driven by the strength in Appliances on strong productivity and commodity deflation. 
The last segment I'll cover is GE Capital. Our Verticals businesses earned $496 million this quarter. That's up 43% from prior year, driven by higher gains, better operations, partially offset by lower tax benefits and impairments. Portfolio quality continues to remain stable.
Other continuing operations generated a $1.4 billion loss in the quarter, principally driven by excess interest expense, the expense associated with the first quarter of 2016 $4 billion hybrid tender, headquarter operating cost restructuring and other charges related to GE Capital transformation, including the cost associated with the preferred equity exchange, which we also executed early in the quarter.
To date, we've incurred $22.6 billion of cost related to the GE Capital exit plan, and we remain on track versus our $23 billion estimate. Discontinued operations incurred a loss of $300 million in the quarter, largely driven by marks on held-for-sale assets. Overall, GE Capital reported a $1.2 billion loss in the quarter.
We ended the quarter with $127 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity, with the verticals at $78 billion of ENI. Liquidity at the end of the first quarter was $106 billion. Our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 14.5%, which is flat from year-end after paying dividends of $7.5 billion during the quarter. The timing of dividends for the rest of the year is dependent on the timing of deal closures, but we expect to pay roughly half of the $18 billion we've targeted in the first half of the year and the remainder in the second half.
Asset sales remain ahead of plan. And during the quarter, we closed $42 billion of transactions, including $28 billion related to Wells Fargo sale, bringing the total closed transactions through the end of the quarter to $146 billion to date. In addition, we've signed agreements for an additional $9 billion in the first quarter, bringing total signings to $166 billion to date.
Our price to tangible book on deals signed to date is 1.3x tangible book, and we're on track for the 1.1x price to tangible book that we estimated a year ago. What is left to sign is primarily outside the U.S. with our country platforms in France and Italy and the execution of our IPO of the Czech bank. We expect to have a small balance of assets left through year-end.
Overall, Keith and the GE Capital team have executed ahead of schedule and on all aspects of the plan we shared with you 1 year ago. We expect to be largely completed with the asset sales by 2016.
On March 31, we filed the request to the FSOC for the rescission of GE Capital's designation as a SIFI. The filing demonstrates that GE Capital substantially reduced its risk profile and is significantly less interconnected to a financial system and therefore, does not pose any threat to the U.S. financial system. We hope to complete the de-designation process as soon as possible.
With that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

The GE model is producing for investors in this volatile economy. The strength of our portfolio will deliver strong EPS and cash growth. We're executing well with Alstom.
Before we end, I wanted to give you a sense for how we have aligned the team's compensation with investors. For 2016, our AIP goals, in essence, our internal plan, is above this framework. And for 2016 to '18, our LTIP ties to the 3-year EPS and capital allocation lock we showed you at the outlook meeting.

If you adjust for that, cost productivity was actually up 40 basis points. And that's how you get to 80 basis points of gross margins, excluding the effects of that foreign exchange. And I didn't say it earlier, but when we look at how those marks and remeasurements peel off over the year against the contracts that they're hedging, about 2/3 of that -- of those contracts settle up in the form of cash in the year. So we would expect 2/3 of what we took as a charge here in the first quarter to come back within the year. So that's why the cost productivity line was at negative 40 basis points.

And I think the margin rate in the second quarter, based on LEAP, both launch and initial shipments, and H, we'll get better sequentially every quarter on H costs. I think margin rate will be a little bit of a challenge in the second quarter. No change on how we think about it for the year. We talked about 50 basis points of improvement in the core business or the ex Alstom business, I should say. No change in view on that. But the second quarter could a little bit challenged with what we go on -- what we got going on with the LEAP, the H and the Wind launch on 2.x and 3.x."

So we haven't detailed out by product exactly what that is, but everything else we're doing around trying to change the cost footprint of this company and around product and service cost within gross margins and running a better supply chain is going to provide us enough headwind to grow margins, notwithstanding those incremental costs on those products."

And there's a road map to continue to push the thermal efficiency above 62% and our plan is to get it to 65%.

GE had a good quarter in a slow growth and volatile environment. I will describe our markets in 2 segments really. The resource sector remains tough, putting pressure on our Oil & Gas and Transportation businesses. Meanwhile, the rest of our markets have plenty of growth available. The strength of GE is our diversity and we remain on track for our '16 framework and our bridge for 2018. In the second quarter, our portfolio execution was the real highlight. This includes GE Capital de-designation, the appliances sale of the substantial gain and the sale of GE asset management. 
From an operations standpoint, we had EPS of $0.51 and that is growth of 65%. Industrial EPS was up 35% excluding gains from restructuring. Margins were flat x Alstom and up 10 basis points year-to-date and we're on track for our margin goals for the year. Alstom $0.01 a share in the second quarter and we're on track to hit our plan in '16. CFOA was $10.7 billion and we're on track for our CFOA goals for the year. Industrial operating profit and organic revenue growth are down slightly in the first half, consistent with our expectations. However, we are positioned for strong organic growth in the second half and we're able to help our earnings goals despite a $0.03 headwind in foreign exchange year-to-date. Looking forward, we have no change to our framework for the year. We still expect organic revenue growth of 2% to 4% or strong organic growth in the second half. We expect margins to expand and Alstom to deliver $0.05 a share. We still expect free cash flow plus dispositions to be $29 billion to $32 billion for the year including a capital dividend of $18 billion. Year-to-date, we've returned $18 billion to investors and we're on track for $26 billion in the year. So despite the macro volatility, we are delivering. 
Orders were $27 billion, down 2%, down 16% organically. Alstom orders were in $4.5 billion in the quarter and $7.5 billion for the first half. Backlog grew by $4 billion from the first quarter '16 and sit at $320 billion of record. Core service backlog grew by 11%. Orders pricing was down slightly versus a year ago. Power in Aviation pricing was positive but Oil & Gas continues to be pressured. Equipment orders were down 11% which was 30% organically. We saw sustained pressure in Oil & Gas and Transportation while power in Aviation had tough comps versus a year ago. 
There are a few highlights. Aviation had another excellent airshow with more than $25 billion in commitments and we have 34 H turbines in backlog. Total service orders were up 9% with solid growth in Aviation renewables. Globally, the wind markets are strong and we expect solid growth for the year. Our pipeline of activity in Oil & Gas is improving and we're working on several large global local deals to offset sluggishness in the U.S. Our global orders are $31 billion year-to-date about flat versus a year ago including Alstom. We've increased Alstom backlog by about $2 billion since the acquisition. Digital orders x AGP were up 15% in the second quarter with revenue up 17%. AGP revenue was up 2% and orders were down. We expect 50% growth in AGPs in the second half. We now have 54 partners and 12,000 developers which is ahead of plan. Recently, we announced the partnership with Microsoft to put Predix in Azure nature and with Huawei to expand in China. In addition, we launched major customer collaborations with Schindler [ph], PSEG [ph] and the city of Tianjin [ph]. We're on track to hit $7 billion in additional orders this year. In the second half, we expect orders to be about flat. Service orders will be up and equipment will be down slightly, and on-balance orders are coming in about where we expected. 
I wanted to give you a little bit more context for revenues since our plan is back-end loaded. In the first half, organic revenue is down 1%. We expect the second half will strengthen to be up about 5%. We see organic growth at 2% to 4% for 2016 likely trending close to the bottom end of the range. There are 3 main dynamics. Oil & Gas faces major cyclical headwinds, but by the second half, they have easier comps. We have line of sight to several big projects in the second half, which will help build backlog for '17. Power's shipping 65% of its gas turbine volume in the second half including 50% more AGPs in the last year and most of these units are in backlog. The rest of the company is sustaining organic growth in the 5% range comparable to the run rate, and this should continue in the second half. 
We had several businesses that are sustaining strong organic growth rates in the first half. [indiscernible] improving with Life Sciences up 12%. China is up 19% and ultrasound's up 9%. Renewables grew by 27%, and services grew by 5% with momentum in Power and Aviation. Including Alstom, global revenue grew by 12% a quarter including significant growth in Europe, India, Africa and ASEAN. Bottom line, we're seeing organic growth accelerating in the second half. Margins are trending consistent with our expectations. Excluding foreign exchange, core margins were up 40 basis points in total and with segment gross margins also up [ph] 40 basis points. We're making great progress on value gap and cost productivity. We expect this to improve in the second half. Service margins are at 90 basis points year-to-date excluding Alstom. 
Next an update on our Alstom execution. As I mentioned earlier, we remain on track for $0.05 a share in 2016 and we're on track for $1.1 billion in synergies for the year. We're seeing significant benefits including coordinated technical and cost performance on gas turbines. The system performance is exceeding our expectations and Alstom equipment backlog in Power is up 22%. This improved market acceptance for energy and the grid and steam turbine business, our customers see this as good fits for GE and we're winning incremental business. As expected, we're seeing strong cost execution and sourcing and play restructuring. Services integration and power is ahead of plan. We see significant opportunities for upgrades in coal to improve energy efficiency. So we really expect to see favorability in Alstom revenue synergies that we didn't count on when we did the deal. We see Alstom favorably so far and expect this momentum to continue. So we have a lot going on with the integration of Alstom but the team is doing well. 
Our cash performance was good overall but our industrial cash performance is impacted by a range of issues and trail our expectations. Capital dividends are now $15 billion on track for their $18 billion goal including another $4 billion this week. We faced several CFOA headwinds in the first half. It should unwind during the year. We have a large inventory build behind new NPI with LEAP H and wind products. These are all shipping in the second half. Alstom exacerbates our profiles. Their earnings synergies and tax benefits are also back half loaded. We still expect Alstom to be neutral on cash for the year. We expect earnings to accelerate in the second half with substantial improvement in working capital. And finally, we had about $1 billion of comp and tax payments in the first half that won't repeat. We've returned $18 billion to investors in the first half through buybacks and dividends and are on track for $26 billion for the year. Free cash flow is a big metric on the company comp plans and the team is incented to hit these goals. 
Now I want to introduce, Dave Joyce, who will give you an update on our great Aviation business and our wins at Farnborough."
177031,331824366,1010569,"General Electric Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2016",2016-07-22,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. Let me start with a quick perspective on our performance over the last 3 years. Aviation has been a strong segment for GE with good leverage, annual growth rate and operating profit of 13% on 6% growth in revenue. Over that same period, we'v",1076,"Thanks, Jeff. Let me start with a quick perspective on our performance over the last 3 years. Aviation has been a strong segment for GE with good leverage, annual growth rate and operating profit of 13% on 6% growth in revenue. Over that same period, we've been investing in the next generation of products and technologies, growing our installed base of engines and service, positioning our supply chain and business for the transition in new products, building out our digital services for both GE and our customers while strengthening our operating profit of the business by 250 basis points. Performance has been very consistent with our strategic imperatives. And as we look at '16, we see another strong year, led by the commercial environment, which is depicted on the next page. Traffic growth, estimated at just over 6% after growth of almost 7.5% in '15; freight traffic estimated to grow again in '16; over 2 million departures added in the last year with very healthy airplane load factors across the networks at 80% for second year in a row; and jet fuel cost, which is the largest variable cost for our airline customers estimated to be deflationary again in '16. If you look at the trend in jet fuel, over the last 3 years, it's down almost 50%, and all these factors fuel profits in the industry estimated to grow again in '16. 
Now switching over to the defense environment. U.S. defense spending is anticipated to be flat in '17. However, we see an increase in science and technology spend as well as operations and maintenance. Additionally, international defense spending is growing, anticipated to be up 4% across the globe excluding the U.S. At Aviation, we're experiencing growth in our military spare sales. 9% in '15 and 6% through the first half of this year, and we forecast our installed base growth to be 14.5% by 2020. 2016 has been a busy year in the military segment with some terrific wins. Just last month, we were awarded the $1 billion contract to develop the next-generation fire engine, with our adaptive cycle technology, combining high efficiency with high performance situationally. This technology promises 25% improvement in fuel efficiency, 30% in range and up to 20% more thrust relative to today's most advanced engines. 
We're also chosen to power the Korean indigenous fighter and re-engine the U.K. Apaches. We're growing our services contracts with all 3 military branches including the F110 overhaul service work with the Air Force that was awarded to us earlier this year. And we're delivering on some very important milestones to support the new [indiscernible] powered by our 414 and the CH 53 King Stallion [ph] powered by our new heavy lift helicopter engine, the T48. So the impact of both the commercial and military environments on our Aviation business has resulted in an unprecedented backlog totaling $156 billion, up $46 billion in the last 3 years. 
Focusing on the critical pieces of that backlog story, equipment up 11% CAGR over the last 3 years, thanks to the successful launch of our new products. Services, up 13% CAGR over the same time period, enabling us to fund the product transition. Last week was a terrific Farnborough airshow for our GE Aviation. $25.9 billion of business in total at list price, over 800 new engine commitments. And we surpassed 30,000 CFM engines produced at the same time we surpassed 11,000 LEAP engines committed. 
So let's talk LEAP, terrific product positioning. Sole source on the 737 MAX. On the COMAC C919 [ph] and over 50% win rate on the A320neos. We delivered our first LEAP powered A320neo to Pegasys on Tuesday entering service this weekend. We're forecasting to deliver 110 engines this year, building to 1,900 by 2019. This year, we also reached record levels of delivery on our current CFM engines, exceeding 1,700 engines. My point is that the rates for LEAP are not unchartered territories for CFM and we're very confident in our plan to deliver on time. 
Now switching to margins. Of course, this transition investment is dilutive as we march down our learning curve and deliver on launch orders, but we have some build tailwinds that allow us to maintain margin rates through the transition. First is our services growth, 44,000 installed commercial engines by 2020. Over 61% of our entire installed fleets has seen one shop visit or less. Second, lower company funded research and development. We've completed certification on our Passport engine, our GE Honda engine and the LEAP engines for both Airbus and Boeing, and we'll complete the C919 LEAP engine [indiscernible] in fourth quarter of this year. And finally, our digital productivity. In both services, as we improved time on [indiscernible] and cost per shop visit on $122 billion backlog and an operations accelerating our variable cost productivity and LEAP learning curve. Only GE has the strength of its installed base to support this magnitude of product transformation, creating both the next-generation of our installed base and service while delivering for our shareholders today. 
So let me finish with a look at GE Aviation as a digital industrial business. First, the impact for our customers, transitioning to predictive maintenance on 35,000 engines. So far, we've experienced a 25% improvement in unscheduled disruptions for those customers engaged in our digital programs. As an example, Emirates, a big, big GE Aviation customer, has realized for the first 6 months of 2016 a 43% reduction in disruptions and a reduction in planned maintenance resulting in 12 additional days of utilization across their fleet of 777s for the first half of this year. For our business, it's all about productivity. In engineering, we have the most sophisticated turbine blade designs on test in 2 weeks versus 9 months. We've launched 13 [indiscernible] factories where operations data connected to our data lake [ph] is available to critical experts across the business in engineering, supply chain and services resulting in a 0.5 point improvement in variable cost productivity year-to-date. At the enterprise level, our new advanced turboprop has eliminated 845 parts using digital design tools coupled with additive manufacturing, eliminating engineering hours, drawings, purchasing activities, quality plans, shipping, assembly hours and, ultimately, reducing costs while improving speed and quality. We're just beginning to understand the value of the digital industrial GE Aviation and the impact on the customers and our operational productivity. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jeff Borenstein."
177031,331824366,1010569,"General Electric Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2016",2016-07-22,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, David. I'll start with the second quarter summary. Revenues were $33.5 billion, up 15% in the quarter. Industrial revenues were up 16% to $30.7 billion. You can see on the right side that the industrial segments were up 7% reported and down 1% org",3623,"Thanks, David. I'll start with the second quarter summary. Revenues were $33.5 billion, up 15% in the quarter. Industrial revenues were up 16% to $30.7 billion. You can see on the right side that the industrial segments were up 7% reported and down 1% organic. Alstom revenue in the quarter was $3.2 billion. Industrial operating post vertical EPS was $0.51 up 65%. The operating EPS number of $0.39 includes other continuing GE Capital activity including headquarter runoff and other exit-related items and I'll cover on GE Capital page. Continuing EPS of $0.36 includes the impact of nonoperating pension. The net EPS of $0.30 includes discontinued operations. The total disc ops impact was a charge of $544 million in he quarter, driven by GE Capital exit costs. 
As Jeff said, we generated $10.7 billion of CFOA in the half, up from $3.9 [ph] billion last year driven by the increased dividend from GE Capital. Industrial CFOA was a $400 million for the half, down 89%. This was driven by a number of known items including our 3-year long-term incentive program payout, Nonrepeat of last year NBC settlement, negative Alstom CFOA in the quarter and timing on our service billings. While we plan to be down in the first half, we underperformed our own expectations by roughly $1 billion, driven by lower collections, accelerated inventory build and earlier closing of appliances transaction in the quarter than we have originally planned. Fortunately, most of this is timing between the first half and the second half. For the second half, we are planning for income plus depreciation and amortization of around $8 billion, working capital improvement of $3 billion to $4 billion driven by second half shipments and improvement in AR performance particularly delinquency and other timing items such as tax of $1 billion to $2 billion. Now [indiscernible] total framework of $12 billion to $14 billion of industrial CFOA. No change for our framework for the year. 
In addition, in the second quarter, GE borrowed $5 billion from GE Capital, which will return in the fourth quarter of this year. This makes a ton of sense for the company as we already own the excess debt and the borrowing cost is lower than our dividend yield. The proceeds were used for an accelerated share repurchase program launched in June. This helps accelerate our buyback within the year. 
The GE tax rate was 15% [ph] and the GE Capital tax rate was 27%, which, for the GE Capital tax rate, reflects a benefit on the pretax continuing loss. For the year, we expect the GE rate to be in the midteens. On the right side of the segment results. As I mentioned, Industrial segment revenues were up 7% reported and down 1% organically. Foreign exchange translation of $148 million was a 1 point headwind and lost revenue from disposition was a 4-point impact. Each of those impacts were more than offset by a 12 point revenue increase in Alstom. Industrial segment op profit was down 5% reported and 6% organically. The organic number excludes impact of $13 million of FX translation headwind. We also had an additional $120 million of FX transactional impacts, which is not adjusted for in the organic calculation. This is related to remeasurement at mark to market on open hedges, principally in the Oil & Gas, Renewables and Power segments. Including corporate operating cost, industrial op profit was down 2% reported and down 4% organically. 
As you see at the bottom of the page, as I mentioned earlier, industrial operating plus vertical EPS was $0.51, up 65%. That includes $0.11 of gains net of restructuring this year versus 0 a year ago. In the box, we provided the 3% [ph] adjusted for industrial gains and restructuring. Excluding those impacts in both years, industrial operating EPS was up 35%. In total, industrial operating plus vertical EPS was up 29%. 
Next I'll talk about one-time items. We had $0.09 of charges related to industrial restructuring and other items that were taken in corporate. Charges were $1.2 billion on a pretax basis with about $400 million related to Oil & Gas and $300 million related to Alstom synergy investments and accounting items. The $0.09 was a little bit lower than what we were estimating driven by timing of restructuring projects. As you know, the appliance sale closed in the quarter contributing about $0.20 of gain. At the bottom of the page, you can see the profile for the year. We continue to expect gains in restructuring to offset for the year. In the third quarter, we have the asset management disposition and some smaller transactions in the fourth quarter that will contribute an additional $0.05 for the total year gains to approximately $0.25. 
Next, I'll cover each of the segments, starting with the power business. Orders in the quarter totaled $7.7 billion, up 41%. Excluding Alstom, orders are $2.9 billion. Core orders were down 11% with equipment down 26% and services lower by 4%. Core equipment orders were lower primarily due to units mix into smaller aero and steam units partially offset by 4 additional H orders year-over-year. Total gas turbine orders were 16 units versus 18 a year ago. Through the half, core equipment orders were up 1% with heavy-duty frames up 25%. Core equipment backlog excluding Alstom grew 37% year-over-year to $8.3 billion, driven by H technology strength. Our HVAC log stands at 34 units inclusive of 5 new orders offset by 6 unit shipments. 
Service orders excluding Alstom were down 4% on lower AGPs of 24 versus 39 last year and lower Aero services. Through the first half, AGP orders totaled 49 versus 55 last year. For the total year, we remain on plan for 135 to 150 AGPs versus 119 a year ago. Through the half, total upgrades grew 18% to 153 versus 130 units a year ago driven by drive NOx compressor upgrades and [indiscernible] planned upgrades. Year-to-date, total service orders grew 2% led by Power Services up 5%. Service backlog excluding Alstom ended the quarter at $54.3 billion which is up 5% versus prior year. Alstom orders in the quarter were $2.9 billion including $1.7 billion of equipment orders. In the second quarter, we took an order for the [indiscernible] supercritical steam coal plant in Dubai as well as orders for 5 more HRSGs. The Alstom equipment backlog is up 22% since we closed the acquisition in the power systems business. Alstom service orders of $1.1 billion included 8 steam upgrades. Alstom service backlog ended the quarter at $9.8 billion. 
Power revenue in the second quarter totaled $6.6 billion up 31%. Excluding Alstom, core revenues are $5.2 billion, grew 2% with equipment revenue down 5% on lower VOP associated with last year's large Egypt equipment deal partially offset by higher H shipments. We shipped 26 gas turbines versus 24 last year including 6 H units. Service revenues excluding Alstom grew 7% driven by Power Services up 12%. We shipped 28 AGPs versus 26 a year ago. Alstom revenue of $1.5 billion included 600 million equipment and 900 million of services. 
Operating profit was higher by 9% in the quarter. Excluding Alstom, core op profit of $1.1 billion was up slightly on positive value gap and cost out partially offset by H [indiscernible] . Margins on the 6 H [ph] shipments were roughly breakeven and we expect shipments to be margin-positive beginning in the third quarter. Margin rates are excluding Alstom contracted 40 basis points. Alstom earned $89 million of op profit in the quarter and was higher than planned on better synergy execution. 
We continue to see strong demand for the H technology. Our cost position continues to improve on the H, and we expect there positive margins in the third quarter on the profit line. We're also [indiscernible] Alstom technology including steam units, generators and HRSGs. We're on track to ship about 115 gas turbines for the year with a heavy fourth quarter. The Alstom integration is also on track and the business will deliver about $800 million of synergies or better for the year. 
Next on Renewables. Orders in the quarter of $2 billion were down 6%. Orders through the first half grew 29%. The business [indiscernible] was 637 wind turbines in the quarter versus 888 wind turbines in the second quarter of last year. For the first half, core orders excluding Alstom for wind were higher by 15%. 2/3 of the turbines ordered were for our new 2-megawatts and 3-megawatt machines. In addition, we booked orders for 218 wind turbine upgrades. Alstom orders in the quarter were $206 million. Backlog finished the quarter at $12.6 billion including $5.1 billion associated with Alstom. GE core backlog grew 26% versus the second quarter of 2015. 
Revenues in the quarter grew 28% to $2.1 billion with core GE revenue up 14%. We shipped 856 wind turbines versus 806 last year. Alstom contributed $221 million of revenue. Operating profit of $128 million was down 11% year-over-year. GE core earnings of $127 million were down 12% driven by launch cost of the new NPI. Margins in the quarter contracted 200 basis points in the quarter. Through the half, the business is on track notwithstanding the foreign exchange challenges. Alstom synergies of $38 million through the second quarter puts the business on track to deliver $100 million-plus of synergies for the year. The market reception of the new wind products has been solid and we are progressing down the cost curve. We think the outlook for the onshore wind business is very encouraging. 
Next is Aviation. The business delivered another strong quarter, and David gave you an update on where the market stands. Orders in the quarter of $6.4 billion were down 15% with equipment orders down 37% driven by no repeat of 2 large NYNEX orders in 2015 from Qatar and ANA. This quarter, we booked $1.4 billion of commercial engine orders including a [indiscernible] jet order for 200 LEAP 1B engines. In addition, we took orders for 348 CFM engines, 21 CF6 engines and 29 GEnx engines. Not included in the second quarter results, and as David mentioned, we won more than $25 billion awards and commitments at the Farnborough Airshow. 
Military equipment orders were up 49% driven by large orders from the Korean military for F414 engines and T700 helicopter [indiscernible] and the Indian Navy for 14 [indiscernible] 2500 engines. Total equipment backlog of $34 billion was down 3% versus last year. Service orders grew 8% in the second quarter with commercial services up 9%, driven by spares up 5% and CSA were just higher by 17%. Military services grew 11%. Total service backlog was higher by 14% in the quarter to $122 billion. Revenues of $6.5 billion were up 4%. Equipment revenues were down 7% with commercial equipment down 2%. We shipped 78 GEnx engines versus 86 a year ago. We also shipped 11 LEAP 1A engines. Military equipment was down 31% as we expected on lower engine shipments. Service revenues grew 16% in the quarter with the commercial spares right up 3% and CSAs up 20%. 
Operating profit was higher by 6% driven by services volume, positive value gap and cost productivity. Margins in the quarter expanded 40 basis points. For the half, op profit grew 11% and margins expanded by 80 basis points. The Aviation team continues to execute well, and as mentioned, we shipped our first 11 LEAP engines and are on schedule to ship about 110 for the year. 
Next Oil & Gas. The environment remains very, very tops. U.S. rig and well counts continue to contract over the second quarter. Rig counts are down 55% year-over-year and down 79% from year-end 2014. Well counts are down 58% in the U.S. versus the second quarter of last year and down 76% from the third quarter of '14 [indiscernible] peak. Based on the latest industry expectations, CapEx spending in 2016 is expected to be down about 14% for IOCs, 9% for NOCs and about 40% for North American independents. We continue to focus on remaking the cost structure of the business and improving our competitiveness. Orders in the quarter were down 34%. Equipment orders were down 58% versus 2015 with all segments lower. Service orders contacted 10% versus last year. Backlog ended the quarter at $22.7 billion, up 1% from the first quarter and down 7% from the second quarter of last year. Year-over-year equipment backlog was down 31% but the services backlog is actually up 15%. Revenues in the quarter of $3.2 billion were down 22% with equipment revenues down 31% and services revenue down 13%. All segments were lower year-over-year on equipment and service revenue except the Turbomachinery business where their Service business grew revenues 4% in the quarter. Operating profit of $320 million was down 48% versus 2015 driven by lower volume and negative fixed cost leverage, partially offset by $140 million in structural cost out. The team remains focused on their plan for about $800 million of cost actions in the year. Through the half, approximately $280 million of benefits have been realized with stronger paybacks expected in the second half of 2016. Oil & Gas is down 40% organically and op profit through the half and continues to execute against the framework of down 30% organic op profit for the year. 
Next is Healthcare. The Healthcare team is executing well and delivered strong second quarter and first half. Orders grew 3% and 4% organically. Geographically, organic orders were higher by 2% in the U.S., 9% in China, 11% in Europe and 17% in ASEAN. Growth in those markets was partially offset by Latin America which was down 9% organically on weakness in Brazil. In terms of business lines, Healthcare system orders grew 2% reported and 3% organic, driven by ultrasound up 8% on strength in the U.S. and Europe. Imaging orders were higher by 2% organically with both CT and MRI up double digits partially offset by x-ray and mamma weakness. Life Sciences continues to grow smartly with orders up 12% organically. Bioprocess grew 26% and core imaging grew 6%. In the second quarter, our Life Sciences business [indiscernible] first and China's largest bio park with a QBO [ph] product. We believe this modulized [ph] bioprocess facilities will be the future of all Biologics. 
Revenues in the quarter of $4.5 billion were up 4% and up 6% organic. Healthcare Systems revenues were higher by 4% organically driven by imaging and ultrasound up 8% and 7%, respectively. Life Sciences continued strong revenue growth up 8% reported and up at 11% organic. Operating profit in the quarter was up 11% to $782 million. Strong volume and cost productivity more than offset negative price and investments for digital NPI supply chain costs. Margin rates expanded 110 basis points in the quarter and are up 80 basis points for the half. The Healthcare team is driving technology competitiveness, transforming their portfolio of digital and reducing their product and service costs. The team has delivered roughly half the cost on target, up $350 million for the year. The team is on track to deliver or beat the 50 basis points of margin improvement that we set out as a goal for the year. 
Our Transportation business continues to deal with a very difficult cycle. In the second quarter, North American commodity carloads were down 11% driven by coal down 27% and petroleum down 20%. Intermodal volume was down 5%. Park locomotives have more than doubled over the last year. Orders of $678 million were down 51% in the quarter. Equipment orders of $117 million were down 77% on orders for 21 local this year versus 120 units a year ago. Service orders of $561 million were lower by 36% driven by lower local parts partly due to the parking and no repeat of a movement plan on order we took last year. Backlog ended the $20.7 billion, which is down 2%, with equipment backlog down 4% and services down 1%. Revenues were lower by 13% and down 6% organically, reflecting a signaling disposition. Organically, equipment revenues were up 3% on higher local shipments, 222 units versus 191 last year, offset by lower services revenue, which was down 14%. Op profit of $273 million was down 18% and down 14% organically, driven by lower volume and unfavorable mix offset partially by favorable value gap and cost-outs. No doubt, the U.S. environment is challenging. The Transportation team is focused on growing our international business, driving cost out and executing on our digital strategy. 
In our energy connections business, as we've discussed in the last 2 calls, organic performance reflects Power Conversion and Industrial Solutions only. GE's Digital Energy business is treated as a disposition to the grid JV. Also as we've discussed, we consolidated 100% of the grid JVs revenue by only 50% of their operating profit. Quarters for the business totaled $3 billion in the second quarter, up 45%. Orders for Power Conversion and Industrial Solutions totaled $1.6 billion down 2% organic and grid orders totaled $1.4 billion. Core orders were driven by Power Conversion down 17% organically on weakness in Oil & Gas and no repeatable large wind order for converters last year, offset by 1% organic growth in Industrial Solutions. 
Backlog finished quarter at $11.9 billion, with grid solutions at $8.2 billion. Revenues in the quarter of $2.7 billion were higher by 55%. Grid solutions revenues totals $1.4 billion. Core revenues were down 4% organically. The business is beginning to make progress. Operating profit improved from a loss of $85 million in the first quarter to a profit of $35 million in the second quarter. The core business recorded a loss of $9 million on lower Oil & Gas volume, higher digital spend and dispositions, and the grid solutions business grew $45 million in the quarter. Alstom synergies remain on track to deliver $200-plus million of benefits for the year, and we expect the business will continue to improve earnings sequentially in the second half. 
Next on Appliances & Lighting. We closed the appliance transaction on June 6, as I mentioned on the one-time items page, with a pretax gain of $3.1 billion which translated to $0.20 of EPS. In the quarter, revenue was down 25%, driven by Appliances down 31% due to the sale. Lighting revenues were down 11% with the legacy Lighting business down 23% and the LED product line up 4%. Segment profit of $96 million was down 42% driven by the sale of Appliances and our investment in [indiscernible]. Going forward, we'll be reporting energy connections and lighting as a single segment. 
Last I'll cover GE Capital. As mentioned earlier, on June 28, GE Capital was de-designated for the systemically important financial institution, marking a major step in our GE Capital exit plan. Our vertical businesses are in $452 million this quarter, down 15% from prior year including higher base earnings offset by lower gains and higher insurance reserve provisions resulting from updates to our models on a runoff long-term care [indiscernible]. Portfolio quality remains stable. In the second quarter, the verticals are on $2.1 billion of on-book volume, 75% of which supported our industrial businesses. In addition, GE Capital range third-party financing we supported an additional $1.1 billion of industrial orders. 
Other continuing operations generated a $1.1 billion loss in the quarter, principally driven by excess interest expense, preferred dividend payments, headquarter operating cost, restructuring and asset liability management actions. Discontinued operations incurred a loss of $0.5 billion largely driven by marks on held for sale assets. Overall, GE Capital reported a $1.1 billion loss. 
GE Capital ended the quarter with $116 billion of ENI excluding liquidity with continuing ENI of $79 billion. Liquidity at the end of the second quarter was $56 billion, which was down $50 billion from the first quarter driven by debt maturities and lower deposits as a result of the sale of GE Capital money bank in the U.S. in the IP of our check platforms. Asset sales remained ahead of plan. During the quarter, we closed $12 billion of transactions, bringing the total closed transactions through the end of the quarter to $158 billion [ph]. In July, we've added $10 billion of closings driven by the sale of our French and German CLL businesses, bringing the total to date of closes to $168 [ph] million. 
In addition to closings, we signed agreements to sell $16 billion of ENI in the second quarter, taking our total signings to $181 billion [ph] during the first half of the year. Our price at tangible book on deal signed to date is 1.2x and we're on track to deliver the 1.1x price to book we estimated when we announced the restructuring. Of the remaining $25 billion assets to go, we anticipate that we will run off about $10 billion of assets where it makes more economic sense to do so. The remaining assets are comprised of our Italian back, our French mortgage book and other smaller [indiscernible] of investments. That will be largely signed, we believe, by the end of the third quarter of this year. 
GE Capital paid $3.5 billion of dividends during the quarter for a total of $11 billion during the first half of the year. In July, GE Capital has paid an additional $4 billion, bringing our year-to-date total to $15 billion, well ahead of our original plan. We remain on track to meet or $18 billion target of dividends for the year. Overall, Keith and the GE Capital team have continued to execute well ahead of schedule on all aspects of the plan. We expect to be largely completed by the end of 2016. And with that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

There are always a few puts and takes but we remain on track. We will hit our $1.45 to $1.55 EPS goal despite FX headwinds of $0.02 to $0.04 in the year, and we expect to deliver $29 billion to $32 billion of free cash flow plus dispositions in line with our plans. 
I thought we'd give you some context for the company beyond 2016, particularly given the volatility of our markets. First, Alstom is on track and I expect us to hit all of our goals. Transportation and Oil & Gas are in tough cycles. They represent 15% of our earnings and it's hard to see them improving in 2017. But at the same time, Power and Aviation remain strong. They're 6% of our earnings and we see consistent performance year-over-year. They have very strong service franchises, productivity programs and our market positions are growing.  Healthcare, energy connections and Renewables had generally favorable markets and real opportunities for growth and margin expansion. In particular, Healthcare feels sustainable with diverse growth in market momentum. These businesses represent 25% of our earnings, and we'll continue to execute on GE Capital and corporate. So really, 85% of our companies in great shape, winning in markets with high visibility, and so we remain on track for the 2018 bridge to $2 a share of EPS. The strength of our diversified model is key in a volatile environment. 
Matt, now over to you for questions."

On value gap for the year, I don't think we've changed our outlook. We said we expect value gap in the year to be roughly flat or neutral for the year with strong roughly $1 billion kind of direct material benefits offset by pricing and a little bit of inflation on our other variable costs. So no change on our outlook on value gap. Value gap in the second quarter discreetly was a positive, not huge, but it was a positive in the second quarter. As you work on that margin [indiscernible] 110 basis points and other, 40 basis points of that is foreign exchange. It's the marks generally on our hedges are moving through that lines. Maybe you'll get about 40 basis points of inflation on other base cost including compensation, et cetera, and then a small impact associated with minority interest and JVs which is about a 20 basis point negative in the quarter."

So when we look through the second half, we've guided $12 billion to $14 billion for the year. We've not changed anything about that guidance. So how do you go from $400 million of industrial CFOA in the first half to $12 billion to $14 billion for the year? We look at earnings, cash earnings, so adding back depreciation and amortization. As you look forward to the second half, we see that as about [ph] $8 billion [ph]. We think we're going to reduce working capital $3 billion to $4 billion. A big part of that is the inventory reductions that we talked about partly driven by power but also through renewal on our other businesses, but we need to be better on receivables. Our delinquency rates in the first half were higher than we estimated. We think we can get that back on par. So if we just get back to the inventory performance we went out of '15 with, if we get back to delinquency and receivable performance that we ended 2015 with, that in total generates about $3 billion to $4 billion of working capital cash flow. And then I just talked about Alstom. So we used a little more than $800 million of cash in the first half of the year on Alstom. We still expect to be roughly neutral in the second half of the year. So that's an $800 million turnaround. And then I think earlier, when I went to the results, I talked about we had some unfavorable timing on tax. That's not an issue for the year. That's just the first half second half issue. So that's how we got to work our way back to $12 billion to $14 billion of CFOA for the year which supports what Jeff talked about of $29 billion to $32 billion of free cash flow plus dispositions for the total company."

I think looking forward, we are again confirming the bridge to $2 a share by '18. And it's really driven by real strength in Power and Aviation, strong turnarounds in energy conversion, Healthcare, renewables, good Alstom execution. And the strength of the GE portfolio I think offsets weaknesses in the Oil & Gas and Transportation business, and that really is the strength of the company, is the diversified portfolio and the ability to meet our commitments even with this volatility."

GE had a good quarter in a slow growth and volatile environment. I will describe our markets in 2 segments, really. The resource sector remains tough, putting pressure on our Oil & Gas and Transportation businesses. Meanwhile, the rest of our markets have plenty of growth available. The strength of GE is our diversity, and we remain on track for our '16 framework and our bridge to 2018. In the second quarter, our portfolio execution was the real highlight. This includes GE Capital de-designation, the Appliances sale with a substantial gain and the sale of GE Asset Management. 
From an operations standpoint, we had EPS of $0.51 and that is growth of 65%. Industrial EPS was up 35% excluding gains from restructuring. Margins were flat ex Alstom and up 10 basis points year-to-date, and we're on track for our margin goals for the year. Alstom was $0.01 a share in the second quarter, and we're on track to hit our plan in '16. CFOA was $10.7 billion, and we're on track for our CFOA goals for the year. Industrial operating profit and organic revenue growth are down slightly in the first half, consistent with our expectations. However, we are positioned for strong organic growth in the second half, and we're able to hit our earnings goals despite a $0.03 headwind in foreign exchange year-to-date. Looking forward, we have no change to our framework for the year. We still expect organic revenue growth of 2% to 4%, or strong organic growth in the second half. We expect margins to expand and Alstom to deliver $0.05 a share. We still expect free cash flow plus dispositions to be $29 billion to $32 billion for the year including a capital dividend of $18 billion. Year-to-date, we've returned $18 billion to investors and we're on track for $26 billion in the year. So despite the macro volatility, we are delivering. 
Orders were $27 billion, down 2%, down 16% organically. Alstom orders were $4.5 billion in the quarter and $7.5 billion for the first half. Backlog grew by $4 billion from the first quarter '16 and sit at $320 billion, a record. Core service backlog grew by 11%. Orders pricing was down slightly versus a year ago. Power and Aviation pricing was positive, but Oil & Gas continues to be pressured. Equipment orders were down 11%, which was 30% organically. We saw sustained pressure in Oil & Gas and Transportation, while Power and Aviation had tough comps versus a year ago. 
There are a few highlights. Aviation had another excellent airshow with more than $25 billion in commitments and we have 34 H turbines in backlog. Total service orders were up 9% with solid growth in Aviation renewables. Globally, the wind markets are strong and we expect solid growth for the year. Our pipeline of activity in Oil & Gas is improving and we're working on several large global local deals to offset sluggishness in the U.S. Our global orders are $31 billion year-to-date, about flat versus a year ago, including Alstom. We've increased Alstom backlog by about $2 billion since the acquisition. Digital orders ex AGP were up 15% in the second quarter, with revenue up 17%. AGP revenue was up 2% and orders were down. We expect 50% growth in AGPs in the second half. We now have 54 partners and 12,000 developers, which is ahead of plan. Recently, we announced the partnership with Microsoft to put Predix in Azure and with Huawei to expand in China. In addition, we launched major customer collaborations with Schindler, PSEG and the city of Tianjin. We're on track to hit $7 billion in additional orders this year. In the second half, we expect orders to be about flat. Service orders will be up and equipment will be down slightly, and on-balance orders are coming in about where we expected. 
I wanted to give you a little bit more context for revenues since our plan is back-end loaded. In the first half, organic revenue is down 1%. We expect the second half will strengthen, to be up about 5%. We see organic growth at 2% to 4% for 2016, likely trending close to the bottom end of the range. There are 3 main dynamics. Oil & Gas faces major cyclical headwinds, but by the second half, they have easier comps. We have line of sight to several big projects in the second half, which will help build backlog for '17. Power's shipping 65% of its gas turbine volume in the second half, including 50% more AGPs than last year and most of these units are in backlog. The rest of the company is sustaining organic growth in the 5% range, comparable to the run rate, and this should continue in the second half. 
We had several businesses that are sustaining strong organic growth rates in the first half. Healthcare is improving with Life Sciences up 12%. China is up 19% and ultrasound's up 9%. Renewables grew by 27%, and services grew by 5% with momentum in Power and Aviation. Including Alstom, global revenue grew by 12% a quarter, including significant growth in Europe, India, Africa and ASEAN. Bottom line, we're seeing organic growth accelerating in the second half. Margins are trending consistent with our expectations. Excluding foreign exchange, core margins were up 40 basis points in total and with segment gross margins also up 40 basis points. We're making great progress on value gap and cost productivity. We expect this to improve in the second half. Service margins are 90 basis points year-to-date, excluding Alstom. 
Next an update on our Alstom execution. As I mentioned earlier, we remain on track for $0.05 a share in 2016 and we're on track for $1.1 billion in synergies for the year. We're seeing significant benefits, including coordinated technical and cost performance on gas turbines. The system performance is exceeding our expectations and Alstom equipment backlog in Power is up 22%. There's improved market acceptance for GE in the grid and steam turbine business. Our customers see this as good fits for GE, and we're winning incremental business. As expected, we're seeing strong cost execution and sourcing and plain restructuring. Services integration in Power is ahead of plan. We see significant opportunities for upgrades in coal to improve energy efficiency. So we really expect to see favorability in Alstom revenue synergies that we didn't count on when we did the deal. We see Alstom favorably so far and expect this momentum to continue. So we have a lot going on with the integration of Alstom, but the team is doing well. 
Our cash performance was good overall, but our industrial cash performance is impacted by a range of issues and trail our expectations. Capital dividends are now $15 billion on track for their $18 billion goal, including another $4 billion this week. We faced several CFOA headwinds in the first half. It should unwind during the year. We have a large inventory build behind new NPI with LEAP, H and wind products. These are all shipping in the second half. Alstom exacerbates our profiles. Their earnings synergies and tax benefits are also back half loaded. We still expect Alstom to be neutral on cash for the year. We expect earnings to accelerate in the second half with substantial improvement in working capital. And finally, we had about $1 billion of comp and tax payments in the first half that won't repeat. We've returned $18 billion to investors in the first half through buybacks and dividends and are on track for $26 billion for the year. Free cash flow is a big metric on the company comp plans and the team is incented to hit these goals. 
Now I want to introduce David Joyce, who will give you an update on our great Aviation business and our wins at Farnborough."
177031,331824366,1010941,"General Electric Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2016",2016-07-22,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. Let me start with a quick perspective on our performance over the last 3 years. Aviation has been a strong segment for GE with good leverage, annual growth rate and operating profit of 13% on 6% growth in revenue. Over that same period, we'v",1072,"Thanks, Jeff. Let me start with a quick perspective on our performance over the last 3 years. Aviation has been a strong segment for GE with good leverage, annual growth rate and operating profit of 13% on 6% growth in revenue. Over that same period, we've been investing in the next generation of products and technologies, growing our installed base of engines and service, positioning our supply chain and business for the transition in new products, building out our digital services for both GE and our customers while strengthening our operating profit of the business by 250 basis points. Performance has been very consistent with our strategic imperatives. And as we look at '16, we see another strong year, led by the commercial environment, which is depicted on the next page. Traffic growth, estimated at just over 6% after growth of almost 7.5% in '15; freight traffic estimated to grow again in '16; over 2 million departures added in the last year with very healthy airplane load factors across the networks at 80% for second year in a row; and jet fuel cost, which is the largest variable cost for our airline customers, estimated to be deflationary again in '16. If you look at the trend in jet fuel over the last 3 years, it's down almost 50%, and all these factors fuel profits in the industry estimated to grow again in '16. 
Now switching over to the defense environment. U.S. defense spending is anticipated to be flat in '17. However, we see an increase in science and technology spending, as well as operations and maintenance. Additionally, international defense spending is growing, anticipated to be up 4% across the globe, excluding the U.S. At Aviation, we're experiencing growth in our military spare sales. 9% in '15 and 6% through the first half of this year, and we forecast our installed base growth to be 14.5% by 2020. 2016 has been a busy year in the military segment with some terrific wins. Just last month, we were awarded the $1 billion contract to develop the next-generation fire engine with our adaptive cycle technology, combining high efficiency with high performance situationally. This technology promises 25% improvement in fuel efficiency, 30% in range and up to 20% more thrust relative to today's most advanced engines. 
We're also chosen to power the Korean indigenous fighter and re-engine the U.K. Apache. We're growing our services contracts with all 3 military branches including the F110 overhaul service work with the Air Force that was awarded to us earlier this year. And we're delivering on some very important milestones in support of the new Saab Gripen, powered by our 414; and the CH-53 King Stallion, powered by our new heavy lift helicopter engine, the T408. So the impact of both the commercial and military environments on our Aviation business has resulted in an unprecedented backlog totaling $156 billion, up $46 billion in the last 3 years. 
Focusing on the critical pieces of that backlog story, equipment up 11% CAGR over the last 3 years, thanks to the successful launch of our new products. Services, up 13% CAGR over the same time period, enabling us to fund the product transition. Last week was a terrific Farnborough Airshow for GE Aviation. $25.9 billion of business in total at list price, over 800 new engine commitments and we surpassed 30,000 CFM engines produced at the same time we surpassed 11,000 LEAP engines committed. 
So let's talk LEAP. Terrific product positioning, sole source on the 737 MAX, on the COMAC C919 and over 50% win rate on the A320neos. We delivered our first LEAP-powered A320neo to Pegasus on Tuesday, entering service this weekend. We're forecasting to deliver 110 engines this year, building to 1,900 by 2019. This year, we also reached record levels of delivery on our current CFM engines, exceeding 1,700 engines. My point is that the rates for LEAP are not unchartered territory for CFM and we're very confident in our plan to deliver on time. 
Now switching to margins. Of course, this transition investment is dilutive as we march down our learning curve and deliver on launch orders, but we have some big tailwinds that allow us to maintain margin rates through the transition. First is our services growth. 44,000 installed commercial engines by 2020. Over 61% of our entire installed fleet has seen one shop visit or less. Second, lower company funded research and development. We've completed certification on our Passport engine, our GE Honda engine and the LEAP engines for both Airbus and Boeing, and we'll complete the C919 LEAP engine cert in fourth quarter of this year. And finally, our digital productivity. In both services, as we improved time on wing and cost per shop visit on $122 billion backlog and an operations accelerating our variable cost productivity and LEAP learning curve. Only GE has the strength of its installed base to support this magnitude of product transformation, creating both the next-generation of our installed base and service while delivering for our shareholders today. 
So let me finish with a look at GE Aviation as a digital industrial business. First, the impact for our customers, transitioning to predictive maintenance on 35,000 engines. So far, we've experienced a 25% improvement in unscheduled disruptions for those customers engaged in our digital program. As an example, Emirates, a big, big GE Aviation customer, has realized for the first 6 months of 2016 a 43% reduction in disruptions and a reduction in planned maintenance resulting in 12 additional days of utilization across their fleet of 777s for the first half of this year. For our business, it's all about productivity. In engineering, we have the most sophisticated turbine blade designs on test in 2 weeks versus 9 months. We've launched 13 brilliant factories where operations data connected to our Data Lake is available to critical experts across the business in engineering, supply chain and services, resulting in a 0.5 point improvement in variable cost productivity year-to-date. At the enterprise level, our new advanced turboprop has eliminated 845 parts using digital design tools coupled with additive manufacturing, eliminating engineering hours, drawings, purchasing activities, quality plans, shipping, assembly hours and, ultimately, reducing costs while improving speed and quality. We're just beginning to understand the value of a digital industrial GE Aviation and the impact on the customers and our operational productivity. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jeff Bornstein."
177031,331824366,1010941,"General Electric Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2016",2016-07-22,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, David. I'll start with the second quarter summary. Revenues were $33.5 billion, up 15% in the quarter. Industrial revenues were up 16% to $30.7 billion. You can see on the right side that the industrial segments were up 7% reported and down 1% org",3606,"Thanks, David. I'll start with the second quarter summary. Revenues were $33.5 billion, up 15% in the quarter. Industrial revenues were up 16% to $30.7 billion. You can see on the right side that the industrial segments were up 7% reported and down 1% organic. Alstom revenue in the quarter was $3.2 billion. Industrial operating plus vertical EPS was $0.51, up 65%. The operating EPS number of $0.39 includes other continuing GE Capital activity, including headquarter runoff and other exit-related items. And I'll cover on the GE Capital page. Continuing EPS of $0.36 includes the impact of nonoperating pension. The net EPS of $0.30 includes discontinued operations. The total disc ops impact was a charge of $544 million in the quarter, driven by GE Capital exit costs. 
As Jeff said, we generated $10.7 billion of CFOA in the half, up from $3.9 billion last year, driven by the increased dividend from GE Capital. Industrial CFOA was a $400 million for the half, down 89%. This was driven by a number of known items including our 3-year long-term incentive program payout, nonrepeat of last year's NBC settlement, negative Alstom CFOA in the quarter and timing on our service billings. While we plan to be down in the first half, we underperformed our own expectations by roughly $1 billion, driven by lower collections, accelerated inventory build and earlier closing of appliances transaction in the quarter than we have originally planned. Fortunately, most of this is timing between the first half and the second half. For the second half, we are planning for income plus depreciation and amortization of around $8 billion, working capital improvement of $3 billion to $4 billion, driven by second half shipments and improvement in AR performance, particularly delinquency, and other timing items such as tax of $1 billion to $2 billion. That walks you to the total framework of $12 billion to $14 billion of industrial CFOA. No change for our framework for the year. 
In addition, in the second quarter, GE borrowed $5 billion from GE Capital, which will return in the fourth quarter of this year. This makes a ton of sense for the company as we already own the excess debt and the borrowing cost is lower than our dividend yield. The proceeds were used for an accelerated share repurchase program launched in June. This helps accelerate our buyback within the year. 
The GE tax rate was 15% and the GE Capital tax rate was 27%, which, for the GE Capital tax rate, reflects a benefit on a pretax continuing loss. For the year, we expect the GE rate to be in the mid-teens. On the right side of the segment results. As I mentioned, Industrial segment revenues were up 7% reported and down 1% organically. Foreign exchange translation of $148 million was a 1-point headwind and lost revenue from disposition was a 4-point impact. Each of those impacts were more than offset by a 12-point revenue increase from Alstom. Industrial segment op profit was down 5% reported and 6% organically. The organic number excludes the impact of $13 million of FX translation headwind. We also had an additional $120 million of FX transactional impacts, which is not adjusted for in the organic calculation. This is related to remeasurement at mark-to-market on open hedges, principally in the Oil & Gas, Renewables and Power segments. Including corporate operating costs, industrial op profit was down 2% reported and down 4% organically. 
As you see at the bottom of the page, as I mentioned earlier, industrial operating plus vertical EPS was $0.51, up 65%. That includes $0.11 of gains net of restructuring this year versus 0 a year ago. In the box, we provided the V% adjusted for industrial gains and restructuring. Excluding those impacts in both years, industrial operating EPS was up 35%. In total, industrial operating plus vertical EPS was up 29%. 
Next, I'll talk about onetime items. We had $0.09 of charges related to industrial restructuring and other items that were taken in corporate. Charges were $1.2 billion on a pretax basis with about $400 million related to Oil & Gas and $300 million related to Alstom synergy investments and accounting items. The $0.09 was a little bit lower than what we were estimating, driven by timing of restructuring projects. As you know, the Appliance sale closed in the quarter, contributing about $0.20 of gain. At the bottom of the page, you can see the profile for the year. We continue to expect gains in restructuring to offset for the year. In the third quarter, we have the asset management disposition and some smaller transactions in the fourth quarter that will contribute an additional $0.05, bringing total year gains to approximately $0.25. 
Next, I'll cover each of the segments, starting with the power business. Orders in the quarter totaled $7.7 billion, up 41%. Excluding Alstom orders of $2.9 billion, core orders were down 11%, with equipment down 26% and services lower by 4%. Core equipment orders were lower primarily due to units mixed into smaller aero and steam units, partially offset by 4 additional H orders year-over-year. Total gas turbine orders were 16 units versus 18 a year ago. Through the half, core equipment orders were up 1%, with heavy-duty frames up 25%. Core equipment backlog, excluding Alstom, grew 37% year-over-year to $8.3 billion, driven by H technology strength. Our H backlog stands at 34 units, inclusive of 5 new orders, offset by 6-unit shipments. 
Service orders, excluding Alstom, were down 4% on lower AGPs of 24 versus 39 last year and lower Aero services. Through the first half, AGP orders totaled 49 versus 55 last year. For the total year, we remain on plan for 135 to 150 AGPs versus 119 a year ago. Through the half, total upgrades grew 18% to 153 versus 130 units a year ago, driven by Dry Low NOx, compressor upgrades and [indiscernible] upgrades. Year-to-date, total service orders grew 2%, led by Power Services, up 5%. Service backlog, excluding Alstom, ended the quarter at $54.3 billion, which is up 5% versus prior year. Alstom orders in the quarter were $2.9 billion, including $1.7 billion of equipment orders. In the second quarter, we took an order for the Hassyan supercritical steam coal plant in Dubai, as well as orders for 5 more HRSGs. The Alstom equipment backlog is up 22% since we closed the acquisition in the power systems business. Alstom service orders of $1.1 billion included 8 steam upgrades. Alstom service backlog ended the quarter at $9.8 billion. 
Power revenue in the second quarter totaled $6.6 billion, up 31%. Excluding Alstom, core revenues of $5.2 billion grew 2%, with equipment revenue down 5% on lower BOP associated with last year's large Egypt equipment deal, partially offset by higher H shipments. We shipped 26 gas turbines versus 24 last year, including 6 H units. Service revenues, excluding Alstom, grew 7%, driven by Power Services, up 12%. We shipped 28 AGPs versus 26 a year ago. Alstom revenue of $1.5 billion included $600 million of equipment and $900 million of services. 
Operating profit was higher by 9% in the quarter. Excluding Alstom, core op profit of $1.1 billion was up slightly on positive value gap and costs are partially offset by H mix. Margins on the 6 H shipments were roughly breakeven and we expect shipments to be margin-positive beginning in the third quarter. Margin rates, excluding Alstom, contracted 40 basis points. Alstom earned $89 million of op profit in the quarter and was higher than planned on better synergy execution. 
We continue to see strong demand for the H technology. Our cost position continues to improve on the H, and we expect that positive margins in the third quarter on the profit line. We're also pulling through Alstom technology, including steam units, generators and HRSGs. We're on track to ship about 115 gas turbines for the year with a heavy fourth quarter. The Alstom integration is also on track and the business will deliver about $800 million of synergies or better for the year. 
Next on Renewables. Orders in the quarter of $2 billion were down 6%. Orders through the first half grew 29%. The business took orders for 637 wind turbines in the quarter versus 888 wind turbines in the second quarter of last year. For the first half, core orders, excluding Alstom, for wind were higher by 15%. 2/3 of the turbines ordered were for our new 2-megawatt and 3-megawatt machines. In addition, we booked orders for 218 wind turbine upgrades. Alstom orders in the quarter were $206 million. Backlog finished the quarter at $12.6 billion, including $5.1 billion associated with Alstom. GE core backlog grew 26% versus the second quarter of 2015. 
Revenues in the quarter grew 28% to $2.1 billion, with core GE revenue up 14%. We shipped 856 wind turbines versus 806 last year. Alstom contributed $221 million of revenue. Operating profit of $128 million was down 11% year-over-year. GE core earnings of $127 million were down 12%, driven by launch costs of the new NPI. Margins in the quarter contracted 200 basis points in the quarter. Through the half, the business is on track, notwithstanding the foreign exchange challenges. Alstom synergies of $38 million through the second quarter puts the business on track to deliver $100 million-plus of synergies for the year. The market reception of the new wind products has been solid and we're progressing down the cost curve. We think the outlook for the onshore wind business is very encouraging. 
Next is Aviation. The business delivered another strong quarter, and David gave you an update on where the market stands. Orders in the quarter of $6.4 billion were down 15%, with equipment orders down 37%, driven by no repeat of 2 large 9X orders in 2015 from Qatar and ANA. This quarter, we booked $1.4 billion of commercial engine orders, including Aviajet order for 200 LEAP 1B engines. In addition, we took orders for 348 CFM engines, 21 CF6 engines and 29 GEnx engines. Not included in the second quarter results, and as David mentioned, we won more than $25 billion awards and commitments at the Farnborough Airshow. 
Military equipment orders were up 49%, driven by large orders from the Korean military for F414 engines and T700 helicopter engines and the Indian Navy for 14 LM2500 engines. Total equipment backlog of $34 billion was down 3% versus last year. Service orders grew 8% in the second quarter, with commercial services up 9%, driven by spares, up 5%, and CSA were just higher by 17%. Military services grew 11%. Total service backlog was higher by 14% in the quarter to $122 billion. Revenues of $6.5 billion were up 4%. Equipment revenues were down 7%, with commercial equipment down 2%. We shipped 78 GEnx engines versus 86 a year ago. We also shipped 11 LEAP-1A engines. Military equipment was down 31%, as we expected, on lower engine shipments. Service revenues grew 16% in the quarter, with the commercial spares right up 3% and CSAs up 20%. 
Operating profit was higher by 6%, driven by services volume, positive value gap and cost productivity. Margins in the quarter expanded 40 basis points. For the half, op profit grew 11% and margins expanded by 80 basis points. The Aviation team continues to execute well, and as mentioned, we shipped our first 11 LEAP engines and are scheduled to ship about 110 for the year. 
Next, Oil & Gas. The environment remains very, very tough. U.S. rig and well counts continue to contract over the second quarter. Rig counts are down 55% year-over-year and down 79% from year-end 2014. Well counts are down 58% in the U.S. versus the second quarter of last year and down 76% from the third quarter '14, their peak. Based on the latest industry expectations, CapEx spending in 2016 is expected to be down about 14% for IOCs, 9% for NOCs and about 40% for North American independents. We continue to focus on remaking the cost structure of the business and improving our competitiveness. Orders in the quarter were down 34%. Equipment orders were down 58% versus 2015 with all segments lower. Service orders contracted 10% versus last year. Backlog ended the quarter at $22.7 billion, up 1% from the first quarter and down 7% from the second quarter of last year. Year-over-year, equipment backlog was down 31%, but the services backlog is actually up 15%. Revenues in the quarter of $3.2 billion were down 22%, with equipment revenues down 31% and services revenue down 13%. All segments were lower year-over-year on equipment and service revenue, except the Turbomachinery business where their service business grew revenues 4% in the quarter. Operating profit of $320 million was down 48% versus 2015, driven by lower volume and negative fixed cost leverage, partially offset by $140 million of structural cost out. The team remains focused on their plan for about $800 million of cost actions in the year. Through the half, approximately $280 million of benefits have been realized, with stronger paybacks expected in the second half of 2016. Oil & Gas is down 40% organically and op profit through the half and continues to execute against the framework of down 30% organic op profit for the year. 
Next is Healthcare. The Healthcare team is executing well and delivered strong second quarter and first half. Orders grew 3% and 4% organically. Geographically, organic orders were higher by 2% in the U.S., 9% in China, 11% in Europe and 17% in ASEAN. Growth in those markets was partially offset by Latin America, which was down 9% organically on weakness in Brazil. In terms of business lines, Healthcare Systems orders grew 2% reported and 3% organic, driven by ultrasound, up 8%, on strength in the U.S. and Europe. Imaging orders were higher by 2% organically, with both CT and MRI up double digits, partially offset by x-ray and mamma weakness. Life Sciences continues to grow smartly with orders up 12% organically. Bioprocess grew 26% and core imaging grew 6%. In the second quarter, our Life Sciences business [indiscernible] its first, and China's largest, bio park with a QBO product. We believe this modulized bioprocess facilities will be the future of all Biologics. 
Revenues in the quarter of $4.5 billion were up 4% and up 6% organic. Healthcare Systems revenues were higher by 4% organically, driven by imaging and ultrasound, up 8% and 7%, respectively. Life Sciences continued strong revenue growth, up 8% reported and up 11% organic. Operating profit in the quarter was up 11% to $782 million. Strong volume and cost productivity more than offset negative price and investments for digital NPI and supply chain costs. Margin rates expanded 110 basis points in the quarter and they're up 80 basis points for the half. The Healthcare team is driving technology competitiveness, transforming their portfolio of digital and reducing their product and service costs. The team has delivered roughly half the cost on target, up $350 million for the year. The team is on track to deliver or beat the 50 basis points of margin improvement that we set out as a goal for the year. 
Our Transportation business continues to deal with a very difficult cycle. In the second quarter, North American commodity carloads were down 11%, driven by coal, down 27%; and petroleum, down 20%. Intermodal volume was down 5%. Park locomotives have more than doubled over the last year. Orders of $678 million were down 51% in the quarter. Equipment orders of $117 million were down 77% on orders for 21 locos this year versus 120 units a year ago. Service orders of $561 million were lower by 36%, driven by lower local parts, partly due to the parking and no repeat of a movement plan on order we took last year. Backlog ended at $20.7 billion, which is down 2%, with equipment backlog down 4% and services down 1%. Revenues were lower by 13% and down 6% organically, reflecting the signaling disposition. Organically, equipment revenues were up 3% on higher loco shipments, 222 units versus 191 last year, offset by lower services revenue, which was down 14%. Op profit of $273 million was down 18% and down 14% organically, driven by lower volume and unfavorable mix, offset partially by favorable value gap and cost-outs. No doubt, the U.S. environment is challenging. The Transportation team is focused on growing our international business, driving cost-out and executing on our digital strategy. 
In our Energy Connections business, as we've discussed in the last 2 calls, organic performance reflects Power Conversion and Industrial Solutions only. GE's Digital Energy business is treated as a disposition to the grid JV. Also as we've discussed, we consolidated 100% of the grid JVs revenue by only 50% of their operating profit. Orders for the business totaled $3 billion in the second quarter, up 45%. Orders for Power Conversion and Industrial Solutions totaled $1.6 billion down 2% organic and grid orders totaled $1.4 billion. Core orders were driven by Power Conversion, down 17% organically on weakness in Oil & Gas and no repeat of a large wind order for converters last year, offset by 1% organic growth in Industrial Solutions. 
Backlog finished the quarter at $11.9 billion, with grid solutions at $8.2 billion. Revenues in the quarter of $2.7 billion were higher by 55%. Grid solutions revenues totaled $1.4 billion. Core revenues were down 4% organically. The business is beginning to make progress. Operating profit improved from a loss of $85 million in the first quarter to a profit of $35 million in the second quarter. The core business recorded a loss of $9 million on lower Oil & Gas volume, higher digital spend and dispositions, and the grid solutions business earned $45 million in the quarter. Alstom synergies remain on track to deliver $200-plus million of benefits for the year, and we expect the business will continue to improve earnings sequentially in the second half. 
Next on Appliances & Lighting. We closed the appliance transaction on June 6, as I mentioned on the onetime items page, with a pretax gain of $3.1 billion, which translated to $0.20 of EPS. In the quarter, revenue was down 25%, driven by Appliances down 31% due to the sale. Lighting revenues were down 11%, with the legacy Lighting business down 23% and the LED product line up 4%. Segment profit of $96 million was down 42%, driven by the sale of Appliances and our investment at [indiscernible]. Going forward, we'll be reporting Energy Connections and Lighting as a single segment. 
Last, I'll cover GE Capital. As mentioned earlier, on June 28, GE Capital was de-designated for the systemically important financial institution, marking a major step in our GE Capital exit plan. Our vertical businesses are $452 million this quarter, down 15% from prior year, including higher base earnings offset by lower gains and higher insurance reserve provisions resulting from updates to our model on a runoff long-term care book. Portfolio quality remains stable. In the second quarter, the verticals were $2.1 billion of on-book volume, 75% of which supported our industrial businesses. In addition, GE Capital range third-party financing we supported an additional $1.1 billion of industrial orders. 
Other continuing operations generated a $1.1 billion loss in the quarter, principally driven by excess interest expense, preferred dividend payments, headquarter operating costs, restructuring and asset liability management actions. Discontinued operations incurred a loss of $0.5 billion, largely driven by marks on held for sale assets. Overall, GE Capital reported a $1.1 billion loss. 
GE Capital ended the quarter with $116 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity, with continuing ENI of $79 billion. Liquidity at the end of the second quarter was $56 billion, which was down $50 billion from the first quarter driven by debt maturities and lower deposits as a result of the sale of GE Capital money bank in the U.S. and the IPO of our check platforms. Asset sales remained ahead of plan. During the quarter, we closed $12 billion of transactions, bringing the total closed transactions through the end of the quarter to $158 billion. In July, we've added $10 billion of closings, driven by the sale of our French and German CLL businesses, bringing the total to-date of closings to $168 million. 
In addition to closings, we signed agreements to sell $16 billion of ENI in the second quarter, taking our total signings to $181 billion during the first half of the year. Our price of tangible book on deals signed to-date is 1.2x, and we're on track to deliver the 1.1x price to book we estimated when we announced the restructuring. Of the remaining $25 billion assets to go, we anticipate that we will run off about $10 billion of assets where it makes more economic sense to do so. The remaining assets are comprised of our Italian bank, our French mortgage book and other smaller peripherals and investments. That will be largely signed, we believe, by the end of the third quarter of this year. 
GE Capital paid $3.5 billion of dividends during the quarter for a total of $11 billion during the first half of the year. In July, GE Capital has paid an additional $4 billion, bringing our year-to-date total to $15 billion, well ahead of our original plan. We remain on track to meet or $18 billion target of dividends for the year. Overall, Keith and the GE Capital team have continued to execute well ahead of schedule on all aspects of the plan. We expect to be largely completed by the end of 2016. And with that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

There are always a few puts and takes, but we remain on track. We will hit our $1.45 to $1.55 EPS goal despite FX headwinds of $0.02 to $0.04 in the year, and we expect to deliver $29 billion to $32 billion of free cash flow plus dispositions in line with our plans. 
I thought we'd give you some context for the company beyond 2016, particularly given the volatility of our markets. First, Alstom is on track, and I expect us to hit all of our goals. Transportation and Oil & Gas are in tough cycles. They represent 15% of our earnings and it's hard to see them improving in 2017. But at the same time, Power and Aviation remain strong. They're 60% of our earnings and we see consistent performance year-over-year. They have very strong service franchises, productivity programs and our market positions are growing.  Healthcare, energy connections and Renewables had generally favorable markets and real opportunities for growth and margin expansion. In particular, Healthcare feels sustainable with diverse growth in market momentum. These businesses represent 25% of our earnings, and we'll continue to execute on GE Capital and corporate. So really, 85% of our companies in great shape, winning in markets with high visibility, and so we remain on track for the 2018 bridge to $2 a share of EPS. The strength of our diversified model is key in a volatile environment. 
Matt, now over to you for questions."

So I think we feel pretty good about that. On the leverage, the leverage is going to be paced by the opportunities to put that capital to work, if we in fact do it, and the returns that we can generate for shareholders. And I would say everything else being equal, I think we've consistently said we're more focused on M&A and where those opportunities are than we are on anything else. And that will be paced on the ideas that we have."

We're still pushing hard for the 800 in the second half of the year. So you got a real acceleration between what we started and executed in '15, what we've executed in the first half of '16, that every thing else being equal, we expect to deliver an additional $500 million of costs in the second half of the year. So if volume stays intact and our outlook on revenue in the second half is roughly close, we ought to be in reasonably good shape. There are some risks, obviously, that if volume's a little bit lighter that some of the benefits even though the actions have been taken because you lose the volume leverage, may not materialize. But I think we feel, and the rest of the team, feel really good about the execution they're doing around restructuring and the projects inside the business."

I think, similarly, grid revenue growth, which is something that we hadn't put a lot of benefits towards, I think we see grid as being potential upside as time goes on as well. So I would say, balance of plant, more steam activity than we had anticipated, better grid acceptance than we had forecasted and services, which was really the way we underwrote the deal in the first place, is quite positive for Alstom."

We've not change",341,"Well, there's multiple questions in there. Let me start with this. Let me start with CFOA. So the half, industrial CFOA was about $400 million. So when we look through the second half, we've guided $12 billion to $14 billion for the year. We've not changed anything about that guidance. So how do you go from $400 million of industrial CFOA in the first half to $12 billion to $14 billion for the year? We look at earnings, cash earnings, so adding back depreciation and amortization. As you look forward to the second half, we see that is about $8 billion. We think we're going to reduce working capital $3 billion to $4 billion. A big part of that is the inventory reductions that we talked about, partly driven by power but also through renewal on our other businesses. And we need to be better on receivables. We -- our delinquency rates in the first half were higher than we estimated. We think we can get that back on par. So if we just get back to the inventory performance we went out of '15 with, if we get back to delinquency and receivable performance that we ended 2015 with, that, in total, generates about $3 billion to $4 billion of working capital cash flow. And then I just talked about Alstom. So we used a little more than $800 million of cash in the first half of the year on Alstom. We still expect to be roughly neutral in the second half of the year. So that's an $800 million turnaround. And then I think earlier, when I went to the results, I talked about we had some unfavorable timing on tax. That's not an issue for the year. That's just the first half second half issue. So that's how we got to work our way back to $12 billion to $14 billion of CFOA for the year, which supports what Jeff talked about of $29 billion to $32 billion of free cash flow plus dispositions for the total company."

The power market is okay, but there's plenty of growth out there for us to go after and go get. Healthcare is better, not just in the U.S., but globally. Energy Connections, the Oil & Gas stuff is tough, but the rest of the stuff is quite strong. And we think renewables is in a very good cycle right now, both in the U.S. and globally. So that's kind of the mix of the world. Now if you bore in on some place like China, the Healthcare business was awesome in China. Our energy orders grew by more than 30% in the second quarter in China. Aviation was negative but that really wasn't because of revenue pass-through because we had big orders last year. So we see -- I would say, around the edges, China getting better, Europe is stable. And then you can put some takes in the rest of the world.

GE had a good quarter and a slow growth and volatile environment. I will describe our markets in 2 segments, really. The resource sector remains tough, putting pressure on our Oil & Gas and Transportation businesses. Meanwhile, the rest of our markets have plenty of growth available. The strength of GE is our diversity, and we remain on track for our '16 framework and our bridge to 2018. In the second quarter, our portfolio execution was the real highlight. This includes GE Capital de-designation, the Appliances sale with a substantial gain and the sale of GE Asset Management. 
From an operations standpoint, we had EPS of $0.51 and that is growth of 65%. Industrial EPS was up 35% excluding gains from restructuring. Margins were flat ex Alstom and up 10 basis points year-to-date, and we're on track for our margin goals for the year. Alstom was $0.01 a share in the second quarter, and we're on track to hit our plan in '16. CFOA was $10.7 billion, and we're on track for our CFOA goals for the year. Industrial operating profit and organic revenue growth are down slightly in the first half, consistent with our expectations. However, we are positioned for strong organic growth in the second half, and we're able to hit our earnings goals despite a $0.03 headwind in foreign exchange year-to-date. Looking forward, we have no change to our framework for the year. We still expect organic revenue growth of 2% to 4%, or strong organic growth in the second half. We expect margins to expand and Alstom to deliver $0.05 a share. We still expect free cash flow plus dispositions to be $29 billion to $32 billion for the year including a capital dividend of $18 billion. Year-to-date, we've returned $18 billion to investors and we're on track for $26 billion in the year. So despite the macro volatility, we are delivering. 
Orders were $27 billion, down 2%, down 16% organically. Alstom orders were $4.5 billion in the quarter and $7.5 billion for the first half. Backlog grew by $4 billion from the first quarter '16 and sit at $320 billion, a record. Core service backlog grew by 11%. Orders pricing was down slightly versus a year ago. Power and Aviation pricing was positive, but Oil & Gas continues to be pressured. Equipment orders were down 11%, which was 30% organically. We saw sustained pressure in Oil & Gas and Transportation, while Power and Aviation had tough comps versus a year ago. 
There were a few highlights. Aviation had another excellent airshow with more than $25 billion in commitments and we have 34 H turbines in backlog. Total service orders were up 9% with solid growth in Aviation renewables. Globally, the wind markets are strong and we expect solid growth for the year. Our pipeline of activity in Oil & Gas is improving and we're working on several large global local deals to offset sluggishness in the U.S. Our global orders are $31 billion year-to-date, about flat versus a year ago, including Alstom. We've increased Alstom backlog by about $2 billion since the acquisition. Digital orders ex AGP were up 15% in the second quarter, with revenue up 17%. AGP revenue was up 2% and orders were down. We expect 50% growth in AGPs in the second half. We now have 54 partners and 12,000 developers, which is ahead of plan. Recently, we announced the partnership with Microsoft to put Predix in Azure and with Huawei to expand in China. In addition, we launched major customer collaborations with Schindler, PSEG and the city of Tianjin. We're on track to hit $7 billion in additional orders this year. In the second half, we expect orders to be about flat. Service orders will be up and equipment will be down slightly, and on-balance orders are coming in about where we expected. 
I wanted to give you a little bit more context for revenues since our plan is back-end loaded. In the first half, organic revenue is down 1%. We expect the second half will strengthen, to be up about 5%. We see organic growth at 2% to 4% for 2016, likely trending close to the bottom end of the range. There are 3 main dynamics. Oil & Gas faces major cyclical headwinds, but by the second half, they have easier comps. We have line of sight to several big projects in the second half, which will help build backlog for '17. Power's shipping 65% of its gas turbine volume in the second half, including 50% more AGPs than last year and most of these units are in backlog. The rest of the company is sustaining organic growth in the 5% range, comparable to the run rate, and this should continue in the second half. 
We have several businesses that are sustaining strong organic growth rates in the first half. Healthcare is improving with Life Sciences up 12%. China is up 19% and ultrasound's up 9%. Renewables grew by 27%, and services grew by 5% with momentum in Power and Aviation. Including Alstom, global revenue grew by 12% a quarter, including significant growth in Europe, India, Africa and ASEAN. Bottom line, we're seeing organic growth accelerating in the second half. Margins are trending consistent with our expectations. Excluding foreign exchange, core margins were up 40 basis points in total and with segment gross margins also up 40 basis points. We're making great progress on value gap and cost productivity. We expect this to improve in the second half. Service margins are 90 basis points year-to-date, excluding Alstom. 
Next, an update on our Alstom execution. As I mentioned earlier, we remain on track for $0.05 a share in 2016 and we're on track for $1.1 billion in synergies for the year. We're seeing significant benefits, including coordinated technical and cost performance on gas turbines. The system performance is exceeding our expectations and Alstom equipment backlog in Power is up 22%. There's improved market acceptance for GE in the grid and steam turbine business. Our customers see these as good fits for GE, and we're winning incremental business. As expected, we're seeing strong cost execution and sourcing and plain restructuring. Services integration in Power is ahead of plan. We see significant opportunities for upgrades in coal to improve energy efficiency. So we really expect to see favorability in Alstom revenue synergies that we didn't count on when we did the deal. We see Alstom favorably so far and expect this momentum to continue. So we have a lot going on with the integration of Alstom, but the team is doing well. 
Our cash performance was good overall, but our industrial cash performance is impacted by a range of issues and trail our expectations. Capital dividends are now $15 billion on track for their $18 billion goal, including another $4 billion this week. We face several CFOA headwinds in the first half that should unwind during the year. We have a large inventory build behind new NPI with LEAP, H and wind products. These are all shipping in the second half. Alstom exacerbates our profiles. Their earnings synergies and tax benefits are also back half loaded. We still expect Alstom to be a neutral on cash for the year. We expect earnings to accelerate in the second half with substantial improvement in working capital. And finally, we had about $1 billion of comp and tax payments in the first half that won't repeat. We've returned $18 billion to investors in the first half through buybacks and dividends and are on track for $26 billion for the year. Free cash flow is a big metric on the company comp plans and the team is incented to hit these goals. 
Now I want to introduce David Joyce, who will give you an update on our great Aviation business and our wins at Farnborough."

Let me start with a quick perspective on our performance over the last 3 years.

Let me start with a quick perspective on our performance over the last 3 years. Aviation has been a strong segment for GE with good leverage, annual growth rate and operating profit of 13% on 6% growth in revenue. Over that same period, we've been investing in the next generation of products and technologies, growing our installed base of engines and service, positioning our supply chain and business for the transition in new products, building out our digital services for both GE and our customers while strengthening our operating profit of the business by 250 basis points. Performance has been very consistent with our strategic imperatives. And as we look at '16, we see another strong year, led by the commercial environment, which is depicted on the next page. Traffic growth, estimated at just over 6% after growth of almost 7.5% in '15; freight traffic estimated to grow again in '16; over 2 million departures added in the last year with very healthy airplane load factors across the networks at 80% for the second year in a row; and jet fuel cost, which is the largest variable cost for our airline customers, estimated to be deflationary again in '16. If you look at the trend in jet fuel over the last 3 years, it's down almost 50%, and all these factors fuel profits in the industry estimated to grow again in '16. 
Now switching over to the defense environment. U.S. defense spending is anticipated to be flat in '17. However, we see an increase in science and technology spending, as well as operations and maintenance. Additionally, international defense spending is growing, anticipated to be up 4% across the globe, excluding the U.S. At Aviation, we're experiencing growth in our military spare sales. 9% in '15 and 6% through the first half of this year, and we forecast our installed base growth to be 14.5% by 2020. 2016 has been a busy year in the military segment with some terrific wins. Just last month, we were awarded the $1 billion contract to develop the next-generation fire engine with our adaptive cycle technology, combining high efficiency with high performance situationally. This technology promises 25% improvement in fuel efficiency, 30% in range and up to 20% more thrust relative to today's most advanced engines. 
We're also chosen to power the Korean indigenous fighter and re-engine the U.K. Apaches. We're growing our services contracts with all 3 military branches including the F110 overhaul service work with the Air Force that was awarded to us earlier this year. And we're delivering on some very important milestones in support of the new Saab Gripen, powered by our 414; and the CH-53 King Stallion, powered by our new heavy lift helicopter engine, the T408. So the impact of both the commercial and military environments on our Aviation business has resulted in an unprecedented backlog totaling $156 billion, up $46 billion in the last 3 years. 
Focusing on the critical pieces of that backlog story, equipment up 11% CAGR over the last 3 years, thanks to the successful launch of our new products. Services, up 13% CAGR over the same time period, enabling us to fund the product transition. Last week was a terrific Farnborough Airshow for GE Aviation. $25.9 billion of business in total at list price, over 800 new engine commitments and we surpassed 30,000 CFM engines produced at the same time we surpassed 11,000 LEAP engines committed. 
So let's talk LEAP. Terrific product positioning, sole source on the 737 MAX, on the COMAC C919 and over 50% win rate on the A320neos. We delivered our first LEAP-powered A320neo to Pegasus on Tuesday, entering service this weekend. We're forecasting to deliver 110 engines this year, building to 1,900 by 2019. This year, we also reached record levels of delivery on our current CFM engines, exceeding 1,700 engines. My point is that the rates for LEAP are not unchartered territory for CFM and we're very confident in our plan to deliver on time. 
Now switching to margins. Of course, this transition investment is dilutive as we march down our learning curve and deliver on launch orders, but we have some big tailwinds that allow us to maintain margin rates through the transition. First is our services growth. 44,000 installed commercial engines by 2020. Over 61% of our entire installed fleet has seen one shop visit or less. Second, lower company funded research and development. We've completed certification on our Passport engine, our GE Honda engine and the LEAP engines for both Airbus and Boeing, and we'll complete the C919 LEAP engine cert in fourth quarter of this year. And finally, our digital productivity. In both services, as we improved time on wing and cost per shop visit on $122 billion backlog and an operations accelerating our variable cost productivity and LEAP learning curve. Only GE has the strength of its installed base to support this magnitude of product transformation, creating both the next-generation of our installed base and service while delivering for our shareholders today. 
So let me finish with a look at GE Aviation as a digital industrial business. First, the impact for our customers, transitioning to predictive maintenance on 35,000 engines. So far, we've experienced a 25% improvement in unscheduled disruptions for those customers engaged in our digital programs. As an example, Emirates, a big, big GE Aviation customer, has realized for the first 6 months of 2016 a 43% reduction in disruptions and a reduction in planned maintenance resulting in 12 additional days of utilization across their fleet of 777s for the first half of this year. For our business, it's all about productivity. In engineering, we have the most sophisticated turbine blade designs on test in 2 weeks versus 9 months. We've launched 13 brilliant factories where operations data connected to our Data Lake is available to critical experts across the business in engineering, supply chain and services, resulting in a 0.5 point improvement in variable cost productivity year-to-date. At the enterprise level, our new advanced turboprop has eliminated 845 parts using digital design tools coupled with additive manufacturing, eliminating engineering hours, drawings, purchasing activities, quality plans, shipping, assembly hours and, ultimately, reducing costs while improving speed and quality. We're just beginning to understand the value of a digital industrial GE Aviation and the impact on the customers and our operational productivity. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jeff Bornstein."
177031,331824366,1011015,"General Electric Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2016",2016-07-22,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, David. I'll start with the second quarter summary. Revenues were $33.5 billion, up 15% in the quarter. Industrial revenues were up 16% to $30.7 billion. You can see on the right side that the industrial segments were up 7% reported and down 1% org",3610,"Thanks, David. I'll start with the second quarter summary. Revenues were $33.5 billion, up 15% in the quarter. Industrial revenues were up 16% to $30.7 billion. You can see on the right side that the industrial segments were up 7% reported and down 1% organic. Alstom revenue in the quarter was $3.2 billion. Industrial operating plus vertical EPS was $0.51, up 65%. The operating EPS number of $0.39 includes other continuing GE Capital activity, including headquarter runoff and other exit-related items. And I'll cover on the GE Capital page. Continuing EPS of $0.36 includes the impact of nonoperating pension. The net EPS of $0.30 includes discontinued operations. The total disc ops impact was a charge of $544 million in the quarter, driven by GE Capital exit costs. 
As Jeff said, we generated $10.7 billion of CFOA in the half, up from $3.9 billion last year, driven by the increased dividend from GE Capital. Industrial CFOA was $400 million for the half, down 89%. This was driven by a number of known items including our 3-year long-term incentive program payout, nonrepeat of last year's NBC settlement, negative Alstom CFOA in the quarter and timing on our service billings. While we plan to be down in the first half, we underperformed our own expectations by roughly $1 billion, driven by lower collections, accelerated inventory build and earlier closing of appliances transaction in the quarter than we had originally planned. Fortunately, most of this is timing between the first half and the second half. In the second half, we are planning for income plus depreciation and amortization of around $8 billion, working capital improvement of $3 billion to $4 billion, driven by second half shipments and improvement in AR performance, particularly delinquency, and other timing items such as tax of $1 billion to $2 billion. That walks you to the total framework of $12 billion to $14 billion of industrial CFOA. No change for our framework for the year. 
In addition, in the second quarter, GE borrowed $5 billion from GE Capital, which will mature in the fourth quarter of this year. This makes a ton of sense for the company as we already own the excess debt and the borrowing cost is lower than our dividend yield. The proceeds were used for an accelerated share repurchase program launched in June. This helps accelerate our buyback within the year. 
The GE tax rate was 15% and the GE Capital tax rate was 27%, which, for the GE Capital tax rate, reflects a benefit on a pretax continuing loss. For the year, we expect the GE rate to be in the mid-teens. On the right side are the segment results. As I mentioned, Industrial segment revenues were up 7% reported and down 1% organically. Foreign exchange translation of $148 million was a 1-point headwind and lost revenue from disposition was a 4-point impact. Each of those impacts were more than offset by a 12-point revenue increase from Alstom. Industrial segment op profit was down 5% reported and 6% organically. The organic number excludes the impact of $13 million of FX translation headwind. We also had an additional $120 million of FX transactional impacts, which is not adjusted for in the organic calculation. This is related to remeasurement at mark-to-market on open hedges, principally in the Oil & Gas, Renewables and Power segments. Including corporate operating costs, industrial op profit was down 2% reported and down 4% organically. 
As you see at the bottom of the page, as I mentioned earlier, industrial operating plus vertical EPS was $0.51, up 65%. That includes $0.11 of gains net of restructuring this year versus 0 a year ago. In the box, we provided the V% adjusted for industrial gains and restructuring. Excluding those impacts in both years, industrial operating EPS was up 35%. In total, industrial operating plus vertical EPS was up 29%. 
Next, I'll talk about onetime items. We had $0.09 of charges related to industrial restructuring and other items that were taken at corporate. Charges were $1.2 billion on a pretax basis with about $400 million related to Oil & Gas and $300 million related to Alstom synergy investments and accounting items. The $0.09 was a little bit lower than what we were estimating, driven by timing of restructuring projects. As you know, the Appliance sale closed in the quarter, contributing about $0.20 of gain. At the bottom of the page, you can see the profile for the year. We continue to expect gains in restructuring to offset for the year. In the third quarter, we have the asset management disposition and some smaller transactions in the fourth quarter that will contribute an additional $0.05, bringing total year gains to approximately $0.25. 
Next, I'll cover each of the segments, starting with the power business. Orders in the quarter totaled $7.7 billion, up 41%. Excluding Alstom orders of $2.9 billion, core orders were down 11%, with equipment down 26% and services lower by 4%. Core equipment orders were lower primarily due to units mixed into smaller aero and steam units, partially offset by 4 additional H orders year-over-year. Total gas turbine orders were 16 units versus 18 a year ago. Through the half, core equipment orders were up 1%, with heavy-duty frames up 25%. Core equipment backlog, excluding Alstom, grew 37% year-over-year to $8.3 billion, driven by H technology strength. Our H backlog stands at 34 units, inclusive of 5 new orders, offset by 6-unit shipments. 
Service orders, excluding Alstom, were down 4% on lower AGPs of 24 versus 39 last year and lower Aero services. Through the first half, AGP orders totaled 49 versus 55 last year. For the total year, we remain on plan for 135 to 150 AGPs versus 119 a year ago. Through the half, total upgrades grew 18% to 153 versus 130 units a year ago, driven by Dry Low NOx, compressor upgrades and FLNG [ph] appliance upgrades. Year-to-date, total service orders grew 2%, led by Power Services, up 5%. Service backlog, excluding Alstom, ended the quarter at $54.3 billion, which is up 5% versus prior year. Alstom orders in the quarter were $2.9 billion, including $1.7 billion of equipment orders. In the second quarter, we took an order for the Hassyan supercritical steam coal plant in Dubai, as well as orders for 5 more HRSGs. The Alstom equipment backlog is up 22% since we closed the acquisition in the power systems business. Alstom service orders of $1.1 billion included 8 steam upgrades. Alstom service backlog ended the quarter at $9.8 billion. 
Power revenue in the second quarter totaled $6.6 billion, up 31%. Excluding Alstom, core revenues of $5.2 billion grew 2%, with equipment revenue down 5% on lower BOP associated with last year's large Egypt equipment deal, partially offset by higher H shipments. We shipped 26 gas turbines versus 24 last year, including 6 H units. Service revenues, excluding Alstom, grew 7%, driven by Power Services, up 12%. We shipped 28 AGPs versus 26 a year ago. Alstom revenue of $1.5 billion included $600 million of equipment and $900 million of services. 
Operating profit was higher by 9% in the quarter. Excluding Alstom, core op profit of $1.1 billion was up slightly on positive value gap and costs are partially offset by H mix. Margins on the 6 H shipments were roughly breakeven and we expect shipments to be margin-positive beginning in the third quarter. Margin rates, excluding Alstom, contracted 40 basis points. Alstom earned $89 million of op profit in the quarter and was higher than planned on better synergy execution. 
We continue to see strong demand for the H technology. Our cost position continues to improve on the H, and we expect to have positive margins in the third quarter on the profit line. We're also pulling through Alstom technology, including steam units, generators and HRSGs. We're on track to ship about 115 gas turbines for the year with a heavy fourth quarter. The Alstom integration is also on track and the business will deliver about $800 million of synergies or better for the year. 
Next on Renewables. Orders in the quarter of $2 billion were down 6%. Orders through the first half grew 29%. The business took orders for 637 wind turbines in the quarter versus 888 wind turbines in the second quarter of last year. For the first half, core orders, excluding Alstom, for wind were higher by 15%. 2/3 of the turbines ordered were for our new 2-megawatt and 3-megawatt machines. In addition, we booked orders for 218 wind turbine upgrades. Alstom orders in the quarter were $206 million. Backlog finished the quarter at $12.6 billion, including $5.1 billion associated with Alstom. GE core backlog grew 26% versus the second quarter of 2015. 
Revenues in the quarter grew 28% to $2.1 billion, with core GE revenue up 14%. We shipped 856 wind turbines versus 806 last year. Alstom contributed $221 million of revenue. Operating profit of $128 million was down 11% year-over-year. GE core earnings of $127 million were down 12%, driven by launch costs for the new NPIs. Margins in the quarter contracted 200 basis points in the quarter. Through the half, the business is on track, notwithstanding the foreign exchange challenges. Alstom synergies of $38 million through the second quarter has the business on track to deliver $100 million-plus of synergies for the year. The market reception of the new wind products has been solid and we're progressing down the cost curve. We think the outlook for the onshore wind business is very encouraging. 
Next is Aviation. The business delivered another strong quarter, and David gave you an update on where the market stands. Orders in the quarter of $6.4 billion were down 15%, with equipment orders down 37%, driven by no repeat of 2 large 9X orders in 2015 from Qatar and ANA. This quarter, we booked $1.4 billion of commercial engine orders, including Aviajet order for 200 LEAP 1B engines. In addition, we took orders for 348 CFM engines, 21 CF6 engines and 29 GEnx engines. Not included in the second quarter results, and as David mentioned, we won more than $25 billion of orders and commitments at the Farnborough Airshow. 
Military equipment orders were up 49%, driven by large orders from the Korean military for F414 engines and T700 helicopter engines and the Indian Navy for 14 LM2500 engines. Total equipment backlog of $34 billion was down 3% versus last year. Service orders grew 8% in the second quarter, with commercial services up 9%, driven by spares, up 5%, and CSA orders higher by 17%. Military services grew 11%. Total service backlog was higher by 14% in the quarter to $122 billion. Revenues of $6.5 billion were up 4%. Equipment revenues were down 7%, with commercial equipment down 2%. We shipped 78 GEnx engines versus 86 a year ago. We also shipped 11 LEAP-1A engines. Military equipment was down 31%, as we expected, on lower engine shipments. Service revenues grew 16% in the quarter, with the commercial spares rate up 3% and CSAs up 20%. 
Operating profit was higher by 6%, driven by services volume, positive value gap and cost productivity. Margins in the quarter expanded 40 basis points. For the half, op profit grew 11% and margins expanded by 80 basis points. The Aviation team continues to execute well, and as mentioned, we shipped our first 11 LEAP engines and are scheduled to ship about 110 for the year. 
Next, Oil & Gas. The environment remains very, very tough. U.S. rig and well counts continue to contract over the second quarter. Rig counts are down 55% year-over-year and down 79% from year-end 2014. Well counts are down 58% in the U.S. versus the second quarter of last year and down 76% from the third quarter '14, their peak. Based on the latest industry expectations, CapEx spending in 2016 is expected to be down about 14% for IOCs, 9% for NOCs and about 40% for North American independents. We continue to focus on remaking the cost structure of the business and improving our competitiveness. Orders in the quarter were down 34%. Equipment orders were down 58% versus 2015 with all segments lower. Service orders contracted 10% versus last year. Backlog ended the quarter at $22.7 billion, up 1% from the first quarter and down 7% from the second quarter of last year. Year-over-year, equipment backlog was down 31%, but the services backlog is actually up 15%. Revenues in the quarter of $3.2 billion were down 22%, with equipment revenues down 31% and services revenue down 13%. All segments were lower year-over-year on equipment and service revenue, except the Turbomachinery business where their service business grew revenues 4% in the quarter. Operating profit of $320 million was down 48% versus 2015, driven by lower volume and negative fixed cost leverage, partially offset by $140 million of structural cost out. The team remains focused on their plan for about $800 million of cost actions in the year. Through the half, approximately $280 million of benefits have been realized, with stronger paybacks expected in the second half of 2016. Oil & Gas is down 40% organically and op profit through the half and continues to execute against the framework of down 30% organic op profit for the year. 
Next is Healthcare. The Healthcare team is executing well and delivered a strong second quarter and first half. Orders grew 3% and 4% organically. Geographically, organic orders were higher by 2% in the U.S., 9% in China, 11% in Europe and 17% in ASEAN. Growth in those markets was partially offset by Latin America, which was down 9% organically on weakness in Brazil. In terms of business lines, Healthcare Systems orders grew 2% reported and 3% organic, driven by ultrasound, up 8%, on strength in the U.S. and Europe. Imaging orders were higher by 2% organically, with both CT and MRI up double digits, partially offset by x-ray and mammo weakness. Life Sciences continues to grow smartly with orders up 12% organically. Bioprocess grew 26% and core imaging grew 6%. In the second quarter, our Life Sciences business delivered its first, and China's largest, bio park with a QBO product. We believe these modulized bioprocess facilities will be the future of all Biologics. 
Revenues in the quarter of $4.5 billion were up 4% and up 6% organic. Healthcare Systems revenues were higher by 4% organically, driven by imaging and ultrasound, up 8% and 7%, respectively. Life Sciences continued strong revenue growth, up 8% reported and up 11% organic. Operating profit in the quarter was up 11% to $782 million. Strong volume and cost productivity more than offset negative price and investments for digital NPI and supply chain costs. Margin rates expanded 110 basis points in the quarter and they're up 80 basis points for the half. The Healthcare team is driving technology competitiveness, transforming their portfolio digitally and reducing their product and service costs. The team has delivered roughly half the cost-out target, up $350 million for the year. The team is on track to deliver or beat the 50 basis points of margin improvement that we set out as a goal for the year. 
Our Transportation business continues to deal with a very difficult cycle. In the second quarter, North American commodity carloads were down 11%, driven by coal, down 27%; and petroleum, down 20%. Intermodal volume was down 5%. Park locomotives have more than doubled over the last year. Orders of $678 million were down 51% in the quarter. Equipment orders of $117 million were down 77% on orders for 21 locos this year versus 120 units a year ago. Service orders of $561 million were lower by 36%, driven by lower loco parts, partly due to the parking and no repeat of a movement plan or order we took last year. Backlog ended at $20.7 billion, which is down 2%, with equipment backlog down 4% and services down 1%. Revenues were lower by 13% and down 6% organically, reflecting the signaling disposition. Organically, equipment revenues were up 3% on higher loco shipments, 222 units versus 191 last year, offset by lower services revenue, which was down 14%. Op profit of $273 million was down 18% and down 14% organically, driven by lower volume and unfavorable mix, offset partially by favorable value gap and cost-out. No doubt, the U.S. environment is challenging. The Transportation team is focused on growing our international business, driving cost out and executing on our digital strategy. 
In our Energy Connections business, as we've discussed in the last 2 calls, organic performance reflects Power Conversion and Industrial Solutions only. GE's Digital Energy business is treated as a disposition to the grid JV. Also as we've discussed, we consolidate 100% of the grid JV's revenue but only 50% of their operating profit. Orders for the business totaled $3 billion in the second quarter, up 45%. Orders for Power Conversion and Industrial Solutions totaled $1.6 billion down 2% organic and grid orders totaled $1.4 billion. Core orders were driven by Power Conversion, down 17% organically on weakness in Oil & Gas and no repeat of a large wind order for converters last year, offset by 1% organic growth in Industrial Solutions. 
Backlog finished the quarter at $11.9 billion, with grid solutions at $8.2 billion. Revenues in the quarter of $2.7 billion were higher by 55%. Grid solutions revenues totaled $1.4 billion. Core revenues were down 4% organically. The business is beginning to make progress. Operating profit improved from a loss of $85 million in the first quarter to a profit of $35 million in the second quarter. The core business recorded a loss of $9 million on lower Oil & Gas volume, higher digital spend and dispositions, and the grid solutions business earned $45 million in the quarter. Alstom synergies remain on track to deliver $200-plus million of benefits for the year, and we expect the business will continue to improve earnings sequentially in the second half. 
Next on Appliances & Lighting. We closed the appliance transaction on June 6, as I mentioned on the onetime items page. We had a pretax gain of $3.1 billion, which translated to $0.20 of EPS. In the quarter, revenue was down 25%, driven by Appliances down 31% due to the sale. Lighting revenues were down 11%, with the legacy Lighting business down 23% and the LED product line up 4%. Segment profit of $96 million was down 42%, driven by the sale of appliances and our investment at Kern. Going forward, we'll be reporting Energy Connections and Lighting as a single segment. 
Last, I'll cover GE Capital. As mentioned earlier, on June 28, GE Capital was de-designated as a systemically important financial institution, marking a major step in our GE Capital exit plan. Our vertical businesses are $452 million this quarter, down 15% from prior year, including higher base earnings offset by lower gains and higher insurance reserve provisions resulting from updates to our models on our runoff long-term care book. Portfolio quality remains stable. In the second quarter, the verticals were up $2.1 billion of on-book volume, 75% of which supported our industrial businesses. In addition, GE Capital arranged third-party financing which supported an additional $1.1 billion of industrial orders. 
Other continuing operations generated a $1.1 billion loss in the quarter, principally driven by excess interest expense, preferred dividend payments, headquarter operating costs, restructuring and asset liability management actions. Discontinued operations incurred a loss of $0.5 billion, largely driven by marks on held for sale assets. Overall, GE Capital reported a $1.1 billion loss. 
GE Capital ended the quarter with $116 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity, with continuing ENI of $79 billion. Liquidity at the end of the second quarter was $56 billion, which was down $50 billion from the first quarter driven by debt maturities and lower deposits as a result of the sale of GE Capital money bank in the U.S. and the IPO of our check platform. Asset sales remained ahead of plan. During the quarter, we closed $12 billion of transactions, bringing the total closed transactions through the end of the quarter to $158 billion. In July, we've added $10 billion of closings, driven by the sale of our French and German CLL businesses, bringing the total to-date of closings to $168 million. 
In addition to closings, we signed agreements to sell $16 billion of ENI in the second quarter, taking our total signings to $181 billion during the first half of the year. Our price of tangible book on deals signed to-date is 1.2x, and we're on track to deliver the 1.1x price to book we estimated when we announced the restructuring. Of the remaining $25 billion assets to go, we anticipate that we will run off about $10 billion of assets where it makes more economic sense to do so. The remaining assets are comprised of our Italian bank, our French mortgage book and other smaller peripherals and investments. That will be largely signed, we believe, by the end of the third quarter of this year. 
GE Capital paid $3.5 billion of dividends during the quarter for a total of $11 billion during the first half of the year. In July, GE Capital has paid an additional $4 billion, bringing our year-to-date total to $15 billion, well ahead of our original plan. We remain on track to meet our $18 billion target of dividends for the year. Overall, Keith and the GE Capital team have continued to execute well ahead of schedule on all aspects of the plan. We expect to be largely completed by the end of 2016. And with that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

We will hit our $1.45 to $1.55 EPS goal despite FX headwinds of $0.02 to $0.04 in the year, and we expect to deliver $29 billion to $32 billion of free cash flow plus dispositions in line with our plans. 
I thought we'd give you some context for the company beyond 2016, particularly given the volatility of our markets. First, Alstom is on track, and I expect us to hit all of our goals. Transportation and Oil & Gas are in tough cycles. They represent 15% of our earnings and it's hard to see them improving in 2017. But at the same time, Power and Aviation remain strong. They're 60% of our earnings and we see consistent performance year-over-year. They have very strong service franchises, productivity programs and our market positions are growing.  Healthcare, energy connections and Renewables had generally favorable markets and real opportunities for growth and margin expansion. In particular, Healthcare feels sustainable with diverse growth and market momentum. These businesses represent 25% of our earnings, and we'll continue to execute on GE Capital and corporate. So really, 85% of our company's in great shape, winning in markets with high visibility, and so we remain on track for the 2018 bridge to $2 a share of EPS. The strength of our diversified model is key in a volatile environment. 
Matt, now over to you for questions."

We've said we expect value gap in the year to be roughly flat or neutral for the year with strong roughly $1 billion kind of direct material benefits offset by price and a little bit of inflation on our other variable costs. So no change on our outlook on value gap. Value gap in the second quarter discreetly was a positive, not huge, but it was a positive in the second quarter. As you work down that margin walk, 110 basis points and other, 40 basis points of that is foreign exchange. It's the marks generally on our hedges are moving through that line.

Let me start with CFOA. So through the half, industrial CFOA was about $400 million. So when we look through the second half, we've guided $12 billion to $14 billion for the year. We've not changed anything about that guidance. So how do you go from $400 million of industrial CFOA in the first half to $12 billion to $14 billion for the year? We look at earnings, cash earnings, so adding back depreciation and amortization. As you look forward to the second half, we see that is about $8 billion. We think we're going to reduce working capital $3 billion to $4 billion. A big part of that is the inventory reductions that we talked about, partly driven by power but also through renewal on our other businesses. And we need to be better on receivables. We -- our delinquency rates in the first half were higher than we estimated. We think we can get that back on par. So if we just get back to the inventory performance we went out of '15 with, if we get back to delinquency and receivable performance that we ended 2015 with, that, in total, generates about $3 billion to $4 billion of working capital cash flow. And then I just talked about Alstom. So we used a little more than $800 million of cash in the first half of the year on Alstom. We still expect to be roughly neutral in the second half of the year. So that's an $800 million turnaround. And then I think earlier, when I went through the results, I talked about we had some unfavorable timing on tax. That's not an issue for the year. That's just a first half, second half issue. So that's how we got to work our way back to $12 billion to $14 billion of CFOA for the year, which supports what Jeff talked about of $29 billion to $32 billion of free cash flow plus dispositions for the total company."

Our energy orders grew by more than 30% in the second quarter in China. Aviation was negative but that really wasn't because of revenue pass-through miles, that was because we had big orders last year. So we see -- I would say, around the edges, China getting better, Europe is stable. And then you can -- puts and takes in the rest of the world. So there's plenty of growth out there for us to go get in the second half and then to '17. In terms of Brexit, I just think Brexit is just another point of volatility. It wasn't the outcome we hoped for, but we were plenty ready for that as just another point of volatility."

GE had a good quarter in a slow growth environment. We continue to see challenges in the resource sector as customers adjust to a lower-priced environment. Global growth continues, but at a low level. There's sufficient opportunity out there",1186,"Thanks, Matt. GE had a good quarter in a slow growth environment. We continue to see challenges in the resource sector as customers adjust to a lower-priced environment. Global growth continues, but at a low level. There's sufficient opportunity out there to achieve our goals. At the same time, we plan to control our cost even tighter as we navigate this environment. 
GE grew organically by 1%, and EPS grew by 10%. Segment profit grew by 1% year-to-date, ex FX. Industrial margins were up 40 basis points, again excluding foreign exchange. CFOA was $8 billion, including $2.9 billion of industrial cash flow. We ended the quarter with $319 billion of backlog, and we accomplished our financial goals despite the impact of $0.04 per share in foreign exchange headwinds year-to-date. 
We continue to execute our capital allocation plan. We adversely [ph] completed our pivot in financial services with $193 billion of signings. Year-to-date, we've returned $24.6 billion to investors through dividends and buyback. For the year, we're increasing the buyback by $4 billion from $18 billion to $22 billion, and total cash return to investors will be at least $30 billion for the year. 
We continue to invest in the company. In the quarter, we announced investments in additive manufacturing, digital platforms and wind turbine supply chain. These will add to earnings in 2018 and position the company in fast-growth markets in the future. 
Orders were $26.9 billion, down 6%. Alstom orders were $5.2 billion, and backlog is up $3.2 billion since the acquisition. Overall, backlog is up 6% versus a year ago with service backlog up 11%. We had substantial strength in renewables, healthcare and power. 
Renewables grew by 59%, including our first substantial offshore order at $600 million and a $400 million order to repower the installed base. 
Health care, HES equipment, had the strongest orders growth in 5 years at 12%. This includes 12% growth in the United States and 15% in China. 
Aviation service orders were up 10% and growth market orders were up 21%. Oil and gas orders were down 21% in the quarter. There are still pockets of growth. Our Middle East orders grew by 5%, and Latin America was up by 19%. We ended the quarter with $22 billion of backlog, and we expect fourth quarter orders to be about flat with the year ago. 
AGPs remain on track for 135 to 150 in the year. Software orders were about $900 million in 3Q, up 11%, and at $2.8 billion were up 15% year-to-date. We saw significant growth in power, up 72%; oil and gas, up 10%; transportation, up 21%; and grid, up 43%. 
Customer wins include Gary Dell [ph], NEC, Aramco, Haier and CM. We continue to build our foundation for growth. We have 243 partners on Predix and are on track for 20,000 developers by year end. Our productivity at $500 million is already above target and should be strong for the year. We see orders strengthening in the fourth quarter versus a year ago, and that will position us for 2017. 
GE is executing well in the environment. As I said earlier, organic growth was up 1%. Excluding oil and gas, organic revenue growth is up 6% in the third quarter and 4% year-to-date. We had several strong business performances. Power was up 7% with 15% growth in equipment. Renewables grew 44%. Aviation service was up 12%. And the GE Store contributed to growth with vertical financings, which supported $4.2 billion of industrial orders. And meanwhile, GE2GE revenue, which is a measure of internal pull-through, grew by 25%. 
Organic growth is accelerating through the year. The fourth quarter will be at 4%. And for the year, we expect organic growth to be 0 to 2%. We continue to see a drag on oil and gas with revenue down 15% to 20% for the year, and the rest of GE will grow at a healthy pace. The oil and gas team is executing well on a tough environment. We continue to aggressively manage costs while positioning for long-term growth. The business fully leverages the GE Store and will come out of this cycle stronger. 
Core margins grew by 40 basis points, and gross margins grew by 110 basis points, ex FX. We've seen solid work in value cap and cost productivity, slightly offset by index. Service margins again led the way with 220 basis points of expansion. Our analytical tools have been critical to enhance service margins. 
Our businesses have done a nice job in a slow-growth environment. For instance, transportation grew margins by 90 basis points despite lower volume. 
We continue to invest in the growth and competitiveness of GE. Alstom remains on track, and we're building backlog and winning key new orders. We're on track for synergies of $1.2 billion in the year. Year-to-date, Alstom orders are $12.7 billion, up 13% versus 2015. We pulled forward more restructuring, which should help 2017 and beyond. Alstom remains on track to deliver $0.05 of EPS this year, ex FX. And we expect to complete purchase accounting in the fourth quarter by booking an incremental reserve of $2.4 billion to cover customer contracts and legal and tax reserves. This is consistent with expectations. The net present value of synergies is more than $21 billion, and Alstom will generate a mid-teen return over time. 
In September, we announced the acquisition of SLM and Arcam, which will position GE as a leader in the fast-growth market for additive manufacturing equipment while opening up potential for an additional $3 billion to $5 billion of productivity over time. Also in September, we announced the acquisition of Meridium, a leader in asset performance management. This completes our suite of maintenance optimization, machine and equipment health and reliability management. It's a perfect fit for our digital strategy and will accelerate our growth. 
Last week, we announced the acquisition of LM Wind Power. This gives us enhanced margins and technical expertise. In addition, this opens up growth in emerging markets. LM and GE have a deep pipeline of innovation, which will lead the industry. 
We had a pretty good quarter for cash. Industrial CFOA was $2.9 billion, up 13% from 2015. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $17.3 billion, including a capital dividend of $5 billion. We received an additional $2 billion dividend from Capital in October. In the fourth quarter, we expect industrial CFOA to be more than $9 billion based on higher earnings and lower working capital. In addition, we should receive a $4 billion dividend from GE Capital. So for the year, we expect free cash flow plus dispositions to be more than $32 billion above our goal. 
As I noted earlier, we continue to invest in long-term growth and competitiveness. And with the improved outlook on CFOA, we plan to boost our buyback by $4 billion to $22 billion with a total cash return to investors expected to be $30 billion, including the dividend. Our balance sheet remains very strong. All of our cash metrics look solid for the year. 
So now let me turn it over to Jeff to go through operations."
177031,377641314,1058546,"General Electric Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2016",2016-10-21,"Earnings Calls","General Electric Company","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the third quarter summary. Revenues of $29.3 billion, up 4% in the quarter. Industrial revenues were up 5% to $26.7 billion. You could see on the right side that Industrial segments were up 4% reported and up 1% organic. Alst",3428,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the third quarter summary. Revenues of $29.3 billion, up 4% in the quarter. Industrial revenues were up 5% to $26.7 billion. You could see on the right side that Industrial segments were up 4% reported and up 1% organic. Alstom revenue in the quarter was $3.2 billion. Industrial operating plus verticals EPS was $0.32 in the quarter, up 10%. The operating EPS number of $0.27 includes other continuing GE Capital activity, including headquarter runoff and other exit-related items that I'll cover on the GE [indiscernible] page. Continuing EPS of $0.23 includes the impact of nonoperating pension. The net EPS of $0.22 includes discontinued operations. Total discounts impact was a charge of $103 million in the quarter, driven by GE Capital exit costs. 
As Jeff said, we generated $18.3 billion of CFOA year-to-date, up from $6.5 billion last year, driven by increased dividends from GE Capital. Excluding deal taxes, industrial CFOA was $3.4 billion year-to-date, down 45%. We generated $2.9 billion of Industrial CFOA in the third quarter, which was up 13%versus last year. This was driven primarily by working capital improvements in receivables and inventory. Progress collections was a usage in the quarter on lower orders, principally in oil and gas. 
Free cash flow was up 17%, and free cash flow conversion was 93% in the quarter. Adjusting free cash flow conversion for the mismatch of gain income and cash, which is included in other investing activities, free cash flow conversion would be 99%. 
Alstom generated $25 million of CFOA in the quarter. 
As Jeff said earlier, we now expect GE Capital dividends for the year of $20 billion versus the planned $18 billion. Fourth quarter will be another large industrial cash quarter on $5 billion of cash income and continued progress on working capital, principally around inventories related to higher volume of deliveries in the quarter. 
Industrial CFOA is expected to generate between $11 billion and $12 billion of cash for the total year. 
The tax rate was 11% in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date tax rate to 13%. In the third quarter, we adopted an accounting standards change related to the treatment of tax benefits on stock option exercises, which had a favorable impact on our 3Q tax rate of about 2 points. The impact on our year-to-date rate was about 1 point. Given that change, we now expect the total year GE rate to be in the low teens versus the mid-teens rate we guided to previously. The GE Capital tax rate was favorable, reflecting a tax benefit on pretax continuing loss. 
On the right side of the segment results, as I mentioned, Industrial segment revenues were up 4% reported and up 1% organically. Excluding oil and gas, which has clearly been challenging, organic revenue was up 6%, with strength in power, renewables, Aviation and Healthcare. 
Industrial segment, op profit was down 5% reported and down 3% organically. The organic number excludes the impact of $14 million of FX translation headwind. We also had an additional $128 million of negative FX transactional impacts year-over-year, which is not adjusted for the organic calculation. This related to remeasurement and mark-to-market on open hedges principally in oil and gas, renewables and Energy Connections. Excluding all FX, organic operating profit was flat in the quarter. 
Including corporate operating costs, industrial op profit was down 6% reported and down 4% organically and flat, excluding all FX. As you see at the bottom of the page, and as I mentioned earlier, industrial operating plus vertical EPS was $0.32, up 10%, with industrial operating EPS up 8%. On a year-to-date basis, we delivered $1.03 of EPS, which was up 29% versus the prior year. 
Next on industrial other items for the quarter. We had $0.05 of charges related to industrial restructuring and other items that were taken at corporate. Charges were $683 million on a pretax basis with $200 million related to Alstom synergies, investments that we've made to drive results, $100 million related to continuing cost-out actions in oil and gas and actions taken in lighting and other segments. 
We also closed the asset management transaction in the quarter, resulting in a $400 million pretax gain. This gain was partially offset by a charge associated with the anticipated sale of our majority share in a nonstrategic business in aviation that makes aerial [ph] structures. The net gains for the quarter were $0.02. 
At the bottom the page, you can see the profile for 2016. We continue to expect gains and restructured to offset for the year at about $0.24, both in earnings and charges. 
Next I'll cover the segments. First is Power. Power orders in the quarter totaled $7.5 billion, up 56%, including Alstom. Excluding Alstom, orders were $4.7 billion, down 3%. Core equipment orders were flat at $1.7 billion. Gas-powered system orders were higher by 6%, driven by aero and gas turbines, offset partially by Distributed Power resets. We booked 36 aeroderivative units in the quarter versus 26 last year on strong demand in sub-Saharan Africa and Argentina. Gas turbine units were 11 versus 22 a year ago. Although the number of units were lower, the dollar value of the orders were up 10% on much larger units, principally the H with 6 units ordered versus 4 last year. We have 33 Hs in backlog and received orders for 50 inception to date on the program. 
One of the H orders in the quarter for 3 units was full scope and included additional Alstom scope totaling $760 million. We continue to see a real opportunity for growth and equipment pull-through between GE and the Alstom businesses. Core equipment backlog was 34% versus last year. Core service orders of $3 billion were lower by 4% on lower Power Services, driven by no repeat of a large [indiscernible] in Japan last year and timing on 10 AGP orders. AGP orders in the quarter were 24 versus 22 last year. We have booked 50% of the 10 AGPs are moved to the fourth quarter as of this call and are still on track for the year for 135 to 150 AGPs in total. 
Alstom orders in the quarter were $2.8 billion. Equipment orders totaled $2 billion, including $1.1 billion for the Hinkley Point U.K. power project. We also booked another 3 HRSGs and 3 steam turbines related to the full-scope H ones I mentioned earlier. Alstom service orders were just under $900 million. Alstom backlog ended the quarter at $17.7 billion, which is up 15% since the acquisition with equipment up 49% and services down slightly. 
Power revenue in the quarter totaled $6.5 billion, up 37%. Core GE revenue of $5.1 billion was higher by 7%. Core equipment revenue of $2 billion grew 15% driven by Gas Power Systems, higher by 16%. We shipped 30 gas turbines, including 7Hs versus 16 a year ago. Aero units were higher by 9 versus last year. Core services revenues of $3.1 billion grew 2% on average volume and upgrades. We shipped 28 AGPs in the quarter versus 22 a year ago. Alstom revenue in the quarter totaled $1.5 billion with $530 million of equipment and $920 million of service revenues. 
Operating profit in total was just shy of $1.2 billion, with core op profit of $1.1 billion, and Alstom op profit of $91 million. Core earnings were higher by 3% on positive value gap and volume partly offset by the mix impact of 7Hs versus 0 last year. The Hs we shipped in the third quarter were profitable, but drove a 70 basis point margin contraction in the quarter. The $91 million of Alstom earnings included the $16 million FX headwind.
Through the third quarter, the team has delivered $650 million of Alstom synergies versus the $777 million total year target that we shared with you last year, and the businesses delivering on its H profitability in the second half. For the year, we expect to ship 25 H turbines and about 110 to 115 gas turbines in total. 
Next up is Renewables. Orders in the quarter totaled $3 billion, up 59%. Core orders, excluding Alstom, of $1.9 billion grew 3%. Core orders were driven by large service orders for $400 million associated with repowering and upgrading existing units, offset partly by fewer new unit orders by 592 turbines versus 821 a year ago. Over 90% of the new unit orders were the large new machines. We expect fourth quarter orders to be strong as the final fully qualified U.S. PTC orders are placed. Repowering, upgrades and new units provide a strong outlook for the fourth quarter and the future. 
Alstom orders in the quarter totaled $1 billion, driven by large offshore wind win in Germany of over $600 million and $400 million of hydro orders. Backlog finished the quarter at $12.9 billion. Revenues of $2.8 billion grew 66% with core GE revenues of $2.4 billion, higher by 43%. The business ships 970 wind units versus 735 wind units in the third quarter of last year. Alstom revenue totaled $381 million in the quarter. Operating profit of $202 million was up 16% with the core business higher by 22% driven by higher volume, offsetting negative foreign exchange. Our profit rate was down 150 basis points, excluding Alstom, reflecting new product mix and $58 million of negative foreign exchange versus last year. We continue to improve margins on the new 2-megawatt machine. Alstom synergies in the quarter totaled $46 million, and Alstom op profit was a loss of $12 million. For the year, we now expect to ship 3,000 to 3,200 wind turbines versus the 3,000 we had previously communicated to. 
Next on Aviation. Global passenger air travel continues to see strong growth despite a slight increase in capacity relative to demand. Year-to-date, August traffic was up 5.8% with strength in both domestic and international markets. Airfreight volumes were up 1.4% August year-to-date, with FT case growing 3.9% year-over-year versus last year. Orders in the quarter were $6.2 billion, down 6%. Equipment orders of $2.1 billion were down 27% on lower commercial engine orders, driven by 9 XGE90 and GEnx. In the quarter, we booked $1.4 billion of new engine orders, including about $400 million in LEAP, $250 million of CFM and $350 million of GEnx. Military corporate orders of $204 million were up sharply, driven principally by T700 orders from Turkey. Total equipment backlog of $33.7 billion was down 4%. Service orders grew 10% with commercial service orders up 13%, driven by CSAs, up strongly at 29%, overhaul up 9% and the spares order rate up 6% at $42 million a day. Military service orders were down 12% on no repeat of a large Air Force order over last year. Total service backlog grew 15% to $122 billion. Revenues of $6.3 billion were up 5%. Equipment revenue was down 3% with commercial up 5% on higher deliveries, including 22 LEAP engines, while military equipment revenue was down 33% on lower shipments. Service revenues were higher by 12%. The commercial spare shipment rate was up 5% to $39.7 million a day, Operating profit of $1.5 billion was up 10%, driven by higher volume and cost productivity. Margin rates improved 120 basis points in the quarter. 
Third quarter was another solid execution quarter for the Aviation team, and we are on track for the ramp-up on LEAP shipments this year. We have shipped 33 LEAP engines to date, and there are currently 6 LEAP-powered planes flying with 2 airlines, with departure performance of 100%, and some of those planes operating more than 10 cycles a day. We expect to deliver about 105 engines this year. 
Next is Oil & Gas. The industry remains very challenging. Some market indicators showed modest sequential improvement in the third quarter. U.S. onshore rig counts were higher by 15% versus the second quarter, and U.S. well counts rose 3% versus the second quarter. Both rig and well counts remain down about 50% from where they were last year. External forecast for upstream spending for 2016 have been revised to be less negative and with 2017 slightly more positive. Flow markets on our industrial applications remain stable, but oil and gas flow and OpEx markets continue to be weak. Orders for oil and gas of $2.5 billion were down 21% in the quarter with equipment down 22% and services down 21%. All segments saw equipment declines, except Subsea and drilling, which was up 33% on easier comparisons to last year. Service orders declined in all segments. 
Backlog ended the quarter at $21.6 billion, which is down 7%. Equipment backlog down 32% versus last year, while services backlog grew 14%. Revenues in the quarter of $3 billion were down 25% with equipment revenue down 33%. All segments were lower, except downstream technologies, which grew 16% in the third quarter. Service revenues were down 16% with declines across all the segments. Op profit of $353 million was down 42% driven by lower volume, price and foreign exchange, partially offset by cost execution. The business took out $245 million of cost in the quarter. 
Total cost out year-to-date is $535 million. The team expects to deliver total cost out for the year of between $700 million and $800 million, adjusting for cost actions related to volume. The business remains on track for op profit down about 30%, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. No doubt, it's an incredibly tough environment, but Lorenzo and the team have executed well on their cost-out initiatives and capturing available growth opportunities as they present themselves. 
On Healthcare. Healthcare business had another solid quarter. Orders in the quarter grew 6% to $4.8 billion. In terms of geography, orders grew organically 5% in the U.S., 6% in Europe and 10% in Asia Pacific. China orders were up 2%, but up 13%, excluding the KUBio bioprocess facility order we took last year. In terms of business lines, Healthcare Systems organic orders were up 8%, driven by strength in imaging, up 12%; on strong CT and MI and ultrasound higher by 11%. Life Science orders grew 4% organically with bioprocess and core imaging both up 5%. Excluding the prior year KUBio order I just referred to, Life Science orders grew 11% with bioprocess higher by 22%. 
Revenues in the quarter of $4.5 billion were up 5%. Healthcare Systems revenues grew 4% organic with ultrasound higher by 13%, partly offset by imaging, down 1%. Life Sciences grew revenues 11% organically. Op profit was up 10% in the third quarter and up 12% organically. Strong volume and cost performance more than offset pricing program spending. Margin rates expanded 70 basis points in the quarter. Gross margins improved 90 basis points in the quarter. 
Healthcare continues to execute. Through 3 quarters, they've delivered over $300 million against their $350 million of cost-out commitments for the year. We expect to outperform the 50 basis point margin goal. China growth continues to improve, public tender activity up 20% in the third quarter. And the U.S. and Europe markets are seeing stable growth. 
Next is Transportation. The difficult cycle for transportation continued in the third quarter. North American carloads were down 5.4%, driven by coal lower by 14.6%, petroleum down 23.4%. And immortal [ph] volume was down 3.6%. August and September volumes did improve versus July, but are still well below 2015. We expect the trend to continue through year-end. Orders in the third quarter of $695 million were down 21% and down 15% organically. Equipment orders of $109 million were down 23%, but up 18% organically on orders for 5 locomotives versus 3 a year ago. Service orders of $586 million were down 21%, driven by lower local parts and mining. Backlog ended the quarter at $19.9 billion, which is essentially flat with last year. 
Revenues in the third quarter of $1,249,000,000 were down 22%, down 17% organically, with equipment lower by 22% and services lower by 13%. We shipped 200 locos versus 259 a year ago. Op profit of $309 million was down 18% on lower volume, partially offset by positive mix and the benefits of restructuring. Gross margins improved 180 basis points, and op profit margins were higher by 90 basis points. The business continues to grow its international businesses. Demand in the U.S. continues to be a challenge, while driving hard on products and service cost. We expect total year locomotive shipments up between 740 and 750 units. 
Energy and connection system -- Energy Connections and Lighting. This is the first new presentation of the 2 segments together. The businesses have not changed. We are reporting orders for lighting for the first time. Lighting has really has 2 businesses: the current business and the legacy core lighting business, which we are in the process of restructuring. The current business represents professional lighting sales for North America and other key countries, energy Management and control systems and software. Reported orders in backlog applied to only the current business as these are longer-term projects. Orders for this segment totaled $3 billion with energy connection orders of $2.7 billion and current orders of $328 million. Energy connection orders were up 31% reported with core GE orders of $1.4 billion, down 14% organically. Power Conversion was down 33% on tough comparison to last year, when our Renewables orders were up 4x. Industrial Solutions orders were up 6%, and the market was down 4% in North America. Grid orders totaled $1.4 billion in the quarter. Total backlog finished at $11.5 billion. Current orders of $328 million were driven by LED rental [indiscernible] including large orders from financial services. Revenues for Energy Connections were $2.6 billion, up 45%. Core Energy Connections revenues were down 9% organic with Power Conversion down 12% and Industrial Solutions down 7%. Grid revenues totaled $1.4 billion. Lighting revenues were down 8% with current growing revenues 10% and legacy lighting down 22% as the non-LED market continues to decline and we restructure and exit many markets. Operating profit in the quarter of $48 million was driven by $63 million of earnings from Energy Connections and a $15 million loss in lighting. Energy connection and $64 million of profit from grid and a small loss in the core. The quarter was driven by lower volume, foreign exchange and mix, partially offset by value gap. The lighting losses driven by build-out of our current business. This segment continues to make incremental progress, improving each of the last 3 quarters, and we expect the fourth quarter will improve again relative to the third quarter. 
Next, I'll cover GE Capital. Our vertical businesses earned $466 million in this quarter, up 33% from prior year, driven by lower impairments in energy and finance, partially offset by lower gains. GE [indiscernible] and finance industrial finance all had strong quarters, and overall portfolio quality remains stable. In the third quarter, the verticals funded $2.8 billion of unbooked volume and enabled $4.2 billion of industrial orders. 
Other continuing operations generated $441 million loss in the quarter, principally driven by excess interest expense, restructuring costs related to portfolio transformation and headquarter operating cost, partially offset by tax benefits. These costs will continue to come down as excess debt matures and we right-size the organization structure. 
Discontinued operations incurred a loss of $100 million, largely driven by marks on held for sale assets, partially offset by tax benefits and other items. Overall, GE Capital reported a $78 million loss. We ended the quarter at $103 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity, with continuing E&I of $79 billion. Liquidity at the end of the quarter was $57 billion. Asset sales remained ahead of plan. During the quarter, we closed $16 billion of transactions, bringing the total closed transactions through the end of the quarter to $173 billion. We have signed agreements for an additional $12 billion in the third quarter, bringing the total signings to $193 billion. We expect to be largely done with signings by the end of the year, and we're on track for the 1.1x price tangible book that we originally estimated. GE Capital paid $5 billion of dividends during the third quarter. In October, they paid an additional $2 billion, and we expect an incremental $2 billion dividend before the end of the year, for a total of $20 billion in 2016 versus the $18 billion target. 
Overall, the Capital team has continued to execute ahead of schedule in all aspects of the plan that we shared with you 18 months ago. We expect to be largely complete by the end of 2016. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

In this number, we're offsetting $0.04 to $0.06 of FX headwinds. We expect organic growth to be positive, but near the low end of the range. And our corporate cost control and margin execution remained very strong. Free cash flow plus dispositions will be above plan, mainly due to GE Capital dividends, although the cash metrics remain on track. And we're increasing the buyback from $18 billion to $22 billion, and this makes a total cash return to investors $30 billion for the year, ahead of plan. So in a time of volatility, the GE model is performing. 
Finally, let me reflect on the company's earnings going forward. When we launched the Capital repositioning in April of 2015, we established the goal of $2 EPS by 2018. Since then, our outlook for oil and gas has worsened and foreign exchanges hurt most global companies, and GE is no exception. At the same time, the rest of GE is performing well, and we see that continuing in the future. And we should be even better than our original plan for buyback, and Alstom continues to perform at or above plan. Going forward, we plan to drive out more costs in supply chain, programs spend around product launches and corporate. And we will continue to grow our funding on digital transformation. Incremental leverage exists with the idea of pushing beyond our goals. We'll give you our 2017 outlook in December, but all of our metrics, for compensation purposes, will continue to be linked to $2 of EPS in 2018 or aligned with investors. 
Matt, back over to you for questions."

And in the Power Conversion businesses, which has a higher concentration in Oil & Gas historically in the balance of Energy Connections, that part of that -- of the Power Conversion business has been enormously challenged. We've replaced a lot of that volume with renewables volume. The Renewables volume is not as profitable as what we're doing in Oil & Gas. And so Power Conversion has been always a challenge. We didn't break even. We lose a little bit of money here in the first 3 quarters.

It was a bit of a drag in the quarter, partly because SG&A was up 1% and volume was essentially down slightly on a calculation basis. So it ended up being about a 10 basis point drag in the quarter. Other inflation that sits in the other line is associated with inflation on base cost. And most of that is [indiscernible] it's other indirect expenses that also incur inflation, and that's what you see on that line.

GE had a good quarter in a slow growth environment. We continue to see challenges in the resource sector as customers adjust to a lower-priced environment. Global growth continues, but at a low level. There's sufficient opportunity out there",1184,"Thanks, Matt. GE had a good quarter in a slow growth environment. We continue to see challenges in the resource sector as customers adjust to a lower-priced environment. Global growth continues, but at a low level. There's sufficient opportunity out there to achieve our goals. At the same time, we plan to control our cost even tighter as we navigate this environment. 
GE grew organically by 1%, and EPS grew by 10%. Segment profit grew by 1% year-to-date, ex FX. Industrial margins were up 40 basis points, again excluding foreign exchange. CFOA was $8 billion, including $2.9 billion of industrial cash flow. We ended the quarter with $319 billion of backlog, and we accomplished our financial goals despite the impact of $0.04 per share in foreign exchange headwinds year-to-date. 
We continue to execute our capital allocation plan. We have virtually completed our pivot in financial services with $193 billion of signings. Year-to-date, we've returned $24.6 billion to investors through dividends and buyback. For the year, we're increasing the buyback by $4 billion from $18 billion to $22 billion, and total cash return to investors will be at least $30 billion for the year. 
We continue to invest in the company. In the quarter, we announced investments in additive manufacturing, digital platforms and wind turbine supply chain. These will add to earnings in 2018 and position the company in fast-growth markets in the future. 
Orders were $26.9 billion, down 6%. Alstom orders were $5.2 billion, and backlog is up $3.2 billion since the acquisition. Overall, backlog is up 6% versus a year ago with service backlog up 11%. We had substantial strength in renewables, healthcare and power. 
Renewables grew by 59%, including our first substantial offshore order at $600 million and a $400 million order to repower the installed base. 
Health care, HES equipment, had the strongest orders growth in 5 years at 12%. This includes 12% growth in the United States and 15% in China. 
Aviation service orders were up 10% and growth market orders were up 21%. Oil and gas orders were down 21% in the quarter. There are still pockets of growth. Our Middle East orders grew by 5%, and Latin America was up by 19%. We ended the quarter with $22 billion of backlog, and we expect fourth quarter orders to be about flat with the year ago. 
AGPs remain on track for 135 to 150 in the year. Software orders were about $900 million in 3Q, up 11%, and at $2.8 billion were up 15% year-to-date. We saw significant growth in power, up 72%; oil and gas, up 10%; transportation, up 21%; and grid, up 43%. 
Customer wins include Gerdau, NEC, Aramco, Haier and CM. We continue to build our foundation for growth. We have 243 partners on Predix and are on track for 20,000 developers by year end. Our productivity at $500 million is already above target and should be strong for the year. We see orders strengthening in the fourth quarter versus a year ago, and that will position us for 2017. 
GE is executing well in the environment. As I said earlier, organic growth was up 1%. Excluding oil and gas, organic revenue growth is up 6% in the third quarter and 4% year-to-date. We had several strong business performances. Power was up 7% with 15% growth in equipment. Renewables grew 44%. Aviation service was up 12%. And the GE Store contributed to growth with vertical financings, which supported $4.2 billion of industrial orders. And meanwhile, GE2GE revenue, which is a measure of internal pull-through, grew by 25%. 
Organic growth is accelerating through the year. The fourth quarter will be at 4%. And for the year, we expect organic growth to be 0 to 2%. We continue to see a drag on oil and gas with revenue down 15% to 20% for the year, and the rest of GE will grow at a healthy pace. The oil and gas team is executing well on a tough environment. We continue to aggressively manage costs while positioning for long-term growth. The business fully leverages the GE Store and will come out of this cycle stronger. 
Core margins grew by 40 basis points, and gross margins grew by 110 basis points, ex FX. We've seen solid work in value cap and cost productivity, slightly offset by index. Service margins again led the way with 220 basis points of expansion. Our analytical tools have been critical to enhance service margins. 
Our businesses have done a nice job in a slow-growth environment. For instance, transportation grew margins by 90 basis points despite lower volume. 
We continue to invest in the growth and competitiveness of GE. Alstom remains on track, and we're building backlog and winning key new orders. We're on track for synergies of $1.2 billion in the year. Year-to-date, Alstom orders are $12.7 billion, up 13% versus 2015. We pulled forward more restructuring, which should help 2017 and beyond. Alstom remains on track to deliver $0.05 of EPS this year, ex FX. And we expect to complete purchase accounting in the fourth quarter by booking an incremental reserve of $2.4 billion to cover customer contracts and legal and tax reserves. This is consistent with expectations. The net present value of synergies is more than $21 billion, and Alstom will generate a mid-teen return over time. 
In September, we announced the acquisition of SLM and Arcam, which will position GE as a leader in the fast-growth market for additive manufacturing equipment while opening up potential for an additional $3 billion to $5 billion of productivity over time. Also in September, we announced the acquisition of Meridium, a leader in asset performance management. This completes our suite of maintenance optimization, machine and equipment health and reliability management. It's a perfect fit for our digital strategy and will accelerate our growth. 
Last week, we announced the acquisition of LM Wind Power. This gives us enhanced margins and technical expertise. In addition, this opens up growth in emerging markets. LM and GE have a deep pipeline of innovation, which will lead the industry. 
We had a pretty good quarter for cash. Industrial CFOA was $2.9 billion, up 13% from 2015. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $17.3 billion, including a capital dividend of $5 billion. We received an additional $2 billion dividend from Capital in October. In the fourth quarter, we expect industrial CFOA to be more than $9 billion based on higher earnings and lower working capital. In addition, we should receive a $4 billion dividend from GE Capital. So for the year, we expect free cash flow plus dispositions to be more than $32 billion above our goal. 
As I noted earlier, we continue to invest in long-term growth and competitiveness. And with the improved outlook on CFOA, we plan to boost our buyback by $4 billion to $22 billion with a total cash return to investors expected to be $30 billion, including the dividend. Our balance sheet remains very strong. All of our cash metrics look solid for the year. 
So now let me turn it over to Jeff to go through operations."

Alstom revenue in the quarter was $3.2 billion. Industrial operating plus verticals EPS was $0.32 in the quarter, up 10%. The operating EPS number of $0.27 includes other continuing GE Capital activity, including headquarter runoff and other exit-related items that I'll cover on the GE Capital page. Continuing EPS of $0.23 includes the impact of nonoperating pension. The net EPS of $0.22 includes discontinued operations. Total discounts impact was a charge of $103 million in the quarter, driven by GE Capital exit costs. 
As Jeff said, we generated $18.3 billion of CFOA year-to-date, up from $6.5 billion last year, driven by increased dividends from GE Capital. Excluding deal taxes, industrial CFOA was $3.4 billion year-to-date, down 45%. We generated $2.9 billion of Industrial CFOA in the third quarter, which was up 13%versus last year. This was driven primarily by working capital improvements in receivables and inventory. Progress collections was a usage in the quarter on lower orders, principally in oil and gas. 
Free cash flow was up 17%, and free cash flow conversion was 93% in the quarter. Adjusting free cash flow conversion for the mismatch of gain income and cash, which is included in other investing activities, free cash flow conversion would be 99%. 
Alstom generated $25 million of CFOA in the quarter. 
As Jeff said earlier, we now expect GE Capital dividends for the year of $20 billion versus the planned $18 billion. Fourth quarter will be another large industrial cash quarter on $5 billion of cash income and continued progress on working capital, principally around inventories related to higher volume of deliveries in the quarter. 
Industrial CFOA is expected to generate between $11 billion and $12 billion of cash for the total year. 
The tax rate was 11% in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date tax rate to 13%. In the third quarter, we adopted an accounting standards change related to the treatment of tax benefits on stock option exercises, which had a favorable impact on our 3Q tax rate of about 2 points. The impact on our year-to-date rate was about 1 point. Given that change, we now expect the total year GE rate to be in the low teens versus the mid-teens rate we guided to previously. The GE Capital tax rate was favorable, reflecting a tax benefit on pretax continuing loss. 
On the right side of the segment results, as I mentioned, Industrial segment revenues were up 4% reported and up 1% organically. Excluding oil and gas, which has clearly been challenging, organic revenue was up 6%, with strength in power, renewables, Aviation and Healthcare. 
Industrial segment, op profit was down 5% reported and down 3% organically. The organic number excludes the impact of $14 million of FX translation headwind. We also had an additional $128 million of negative FX transactional impacts year-over-year, which is not adjusted for the organic calculation. This related to remeasurement and mark-to-market on open hedges principally in oil and gas, renewables and Energy Connections. Excluding all FX, organic operating profit was flat in the quarter. 
Including corporate operating costs, industrial op profit was down 6% reported and down 4% organically and flat, excluding all FX. As you see at the bottom of the page, and as I mentioned earlier, industrial operating plus vertical EPS was $0.32, up 10%, with industrial operating EPS up 8%. On a year-to-date basis, we delivered $1.03 of EPS, which was up 29% versus the prior year. 
Next on industrial other items for the quarter. We had $0.05 of charges related to industrial restructuring and other items that were taken at corporate. Charges were $683 million on a pretax basis with $200 million related to Alstom synergies, investments that we've made to drive results, $100 million related to continuing cost-out actions in oil and gas and actions taken in lighting and other segments. 
We also closed the asset management transaction in the quarter, resulting in a $400 million pretax gain. This gain was partially offset by a charge associated with the anticipated sale of our majority share in a nonstrategic business in aviation that makes aerial structures. The net gains for the quarter were $0.02. 
At the bottom the page, you can see the profile for 2016. We continue to expect gains and restructured to offset for the year at about $0.24, both in earnings and charges. 
Next I'll cover the segments. First is Power. Power orders in the quarter totaled $7.5 billion, up 56%, including Alstom. Excluding Alstom, orders were $4.7 billion, down 3%. Core equipment orders were flat at $1.7 billion. Gas-powered system orders were higher by 6%, driven by aero and gas turbines, offset partially by Distributed Power resets. We booked 36 aeroderivative units in the quarter versus 26 last year on strong demand in sub-Saharan Africa and Argentina. Gas turbine units were 11 versus 22 a year ago. Although the number of units were lower, the dollar value of the orders were up 10% on much larger units, principally the H with 6 units ordered versus 4 last year. We have 33 Hs in backlog and received orders for 50 inception to date on the program. 
One of the H orders in the quarter for 3 units was full scope and included additional Alstom scope totaling $760 million. We continue to see a real opportunity for growth and equipment pull-through between GE and the Alstom businesses. Core equipment backlog was 34% versus last year. Core service orders of $3 billion were lower by 4% on lower Power Services, driven by no repeat of a large planned [indiscernible] in Japan last year and timing on 10 AGP orders. AGP orders in the quarter were 24 versus 22 last year. We have booked 50% of the 10 AGPs are moved to the fourth quarter as of this call and are still on track for the year for 135 to 150 AGPs in total. 
Alstom orders in the quarter were $2.8 billion. Equipment orders totaled $2 billion, including $1.1 billion for the Hinkley Point U.K. power project. We also booked another 3 HRSGs and 3 steam turbines related to the full-scope H ones I mentioned earlier. Alstom service orders were just under $900 million. Alstom backlog ended the quarter at $17.7 billion, which is up 15% since the acquisition with equipment up 49% and services down slightly. 
Power revenue in the quarter totaled $6.5 billion, up 37%. Core GE revenue of $5.1 billion was higher by 7%. Core equipment revenue of $2 billion grew 15% driven by Gas Power Systems, higher by 16%. We shipped 30 gas turbines, including 7Hs versus 16 a year ago. Aero units were higher by 9 versus last year. Core services revenues of $3.1 billion grew 2% on average volume and upgrades. We shipped 28 AGPs in the quarter versus 22 a year ago. Alstom revenue in the quarter totaled $1.5 billion with $530 million of equipment and $920 million of service revenues. 
Operating profit in total was just shy of $1.2 billion, with core op profit of $1.1 billion, and Alstom op profit of $91 million. Core earnings were higher by 3% on positive value gap and volume partly offset by the mix impact of 7Hs versus 0 last year. The Hs we shipped in the third quarter were profitable, but drove a 70 basis point margin contraction in the quarter. The $91 million of Alstom earnings included the $16 million FX headwind.
Through the third quarter, the team has delivered $650 million of Alstom synergies versus the $777 million total year target that we shared with you last year, and the businesses delivering on its H profitability in the second half. For the year, we expect to ship 25 H turbines and about 110 to 115 gas turbines in total. 
Next up is Renewables. Orders in the quarter totaled $3 billion, up 59%. Core orders, excluding Alstom, of $1.9 billion grew 3%. Core orders were driven by large service orders for $400 million associated with repowering and upgrading existing units, offset partly by fewer new unit orders by 592 turbines versus 821 a year ago. Over 90% of the new unit orders were the large new machines. We expect fourth quarter orders to be strong as the final fully qualified U.S. PTC orders are placed. Repowering, upgrades and new units provide a strong outlook for the fourth quarter and the future. 
Alstom orders in the quarter totaled $1 billion, driven by large offshore wind win in Germany of over $600 million and $400 million of hydro orders. Backlog finished the quarter at $12.9 billion. Revenues of $2.8 billion grew 66% with core GE revenues of $2.4 billion, higher by 43%. The business ships 970 wind units versus 735 wind units in the third quarter of last year. Alstom revenue totaled $381 million in the quarter. Operating profit of $202 million was up 16% with the core business higher by 22% driven by higher volume, offsetting negative foreign exchange. Our profit rate was down 150 basis points, excluding Alstom, reflecting new product mix and $58 million of negative foreign exchange versus last year. We continue to improve margins on the new 2-megawatt machine. Alstom synergies in the quarter totaled $46 million, and Alstom op profit was a loss of $12 million. For the year, we now expect to ship 3,000 to 3,200 wind turbines versus the 3,000 we had previously communicated to. 
Next on Aviation. Global passenger air travel continues to see strong growth despite a slight increase in capacity relative to demand. Year-to-date, August traffic was up 5.8% with strength in both domestic and international markets. Airfreight volumes were up 1.4% August year-to-date, with FT case growing 3.9% year-over-year versus last year. Orders in the quarter were $6.2 billion, down 6%. Equipment orders of $2.1 billion were down 27% on lower commercial engine orders, driven by 9 XGE90 and GEnx. In the quarter, we booked $1.4 billion of new engine orders, including about $400 million in LEAP, $250 million of CFM and $350 million of GEnx. Military corporate orders of $204 million were up sharply, driven principally by T700 orders from Turkey. Total equipment backlog of $33.7 billion was down 4%. Service orders grew 10% with commercial service orders up 13%, driven by CSAs, up strongly at 29%, overhaul up 9% and the spares order rate up 6% at $42 million a day. Military service orders were down 12% on no repeat of a large Air Force order over last year. Total service backlog grew 15% to $122 billion. Revenues of $6.3 billion were up 5%. Equipment revenue was down 3% with commercial up 5% on higher deliveries, including 22 LEAP engines, while military equipment revenue was down 33% on lower shipments. Service revenues were higher by 12%. The commercial spare shipment rate was up 5% to $39.7 million a day, Operating profit of $1.5 billion was up 10%, driven by higher volume and cost productivity. Margin rates improved 120 basis points in the quarter. 
Third quarter was another solid execution quarter for the Aviation team, and we are on track for the ramp-up on LEAP shipments this year. We have shipped 33 LEAP engines to date, and there are currently 6 LEAP-powered planes flying with 2 airlines, with departure performance of 100%, and some of those planes operating more than 10 cycles a day. We expect to deliver about 105 engines this year. 
Next is Oil & Gas. The industry remains very challenging. Some market indicators showed modest sequential improvement in the third quarter. U.S. onshore rig counts were higher by 15% versus the second quarter, and U.S. well counts rose 3% versus the second quarter. Both rig and well counts remain down about 50% from where they were last year. External forecast for upstream spending for 2016 have been revised to be less negative and with 2017 slightly more positive. Flow markets on our industrial applications remain stable, but oil and gas flow and OpEx markets continue to be weak. Orders for oil and gas of $2.5 billion were down 21% in the quarter with equipment down 22% and services down 21%. All segments saw equipment declines, except Subsea and drilling, which was up 33% on easier comparisons to last year. Service orders declined in all segments. 
Backlog ended the quarter at $21.6 billion, which is down 7%. Equipment backlog down 32% versus last year, while services backlog grew 14%. Revenues in the quarter of $3 billion were down 25% with equipment revenue down 33%. All segments were lower, except downstream technologies, which grew 16% in the third quarter. Service revenues were down 16% with declines across all the segments. Op profit of $353 million was down 42% driven by lower volume, price and foreign exchange, partially offset by cost execution. The business took out $245 million of cost in the quarter. 
Total cost out year-to-date is $535 million. The team expects to deliver total cost out for the year of between $700 million and $800 million, adjusting for cost actions related to volume. The business remains on track for op profit down about 30%, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. No doubt, it's an incredibly tough environment, but Lorenzo and the team have executed well on their cost-out initiatives and capturing available growth opportunities as they present themselves. 
On Healthcare. Healthcare business had another solid quarter. Orders in the quarter grew 6% to $4.8 billion. In terms of geography, orders grew organically 5% in the U.S., 6% in Europe and 10% in Asia Pacific. China orders were up 2%, but up 13%, excluding the KUBio bioprocess facility order we took last year. In terms of business lines, Healthcare Systems organic orders were up 8%, driven by strength in imaging, up 12%; on strong CT and MI and ultrasound higher by 11%. Life Science orders grew 4% organically with bioprocess and core imaging both up 5%. Excluding the prior year KUBio order I just referred to, Life Science orders grew 11% with bioprocess higher by 22%. 
Revenues in the quarter of $4.5 billion were up 5%. Healthcare Systems revenues grew 4% organic with ultrasound higher by 13%, partly offset by imaging, down 1%. Life Sciences grew revenues 11% organically. Op profit was up 10% in the third quarter and up 12% organically. Strong volume and cost performance more than offset pricing program spending. Margin rates expanded 70 basis points in the quarter. Gross margins improved 90 basis points in the quarter. 
Healthcare continues to execute. Through 3 quarters, they've delivered over $300 million against their $350 million of cost-out commitments for the year. We expect to outperform the 50 basis point margin goal. China growth continues to improve, public tender activity up 20% in the third quarter. And the U.S. and Europe markets are seeing stable growth. 
Next is Transportation. The difficult cycle for transportation continued in the third quarter. North American carloads were down 5.4%, driven by coal lower by 14.6%, petroleum down 23.4% and [indiscernible] volume was down 3.6%. August and September volumes did improve versus July, but are still well below 2015. We expect the trend to continue through year-end. Orders in the third quarter of $695 million were down 21% and down 15% organically. Equipment orders of $109 million were down 23%, but up 18% organically on orders for 5 locomotives versus 3 a year ago. Service orders of $586 million were down 21%, driven by lower local parts and mining. Backlog ended the quarter at $19.9 billion, which is essentially flat with last year. 
Revenues in the third quarter of $1,249,000,000 were down 22%, down 17% organically, with equipment lower by 22% and services lower by 13%. We shipped 200 locos versus 259 a year ago. Op profit of $309 million was down 18% on lower volume, partially offset by positive mix and the benefits of restructuring. Gross margins improved 180 basis points, and op profit margins were higher by 90 basis points. The business continues to grow its international businesses. Demand in the U.S. continues to be a challenge, while driving hard on products and service cost. We expect total year locomotive shipments up between 740 and 750 units. 
Energy and connection system -- Energy Connections and Lighting. This is the first new presentation of the 2 segments together. The businesses have not changed. We are reporting orders for lighting for the first time. Lighting has really has 2 businesses: the current business and the legacy core lighting business, which we are in the process of restructuring. The current business represents professional lighting sales for North America and other key countries, energy management and control systems and software. Reported orders in backlog applied to only the current business as these are longer-term projects. Orders for this segment totaled $3 billion with energy connection orders of $2.7 billion and current orders of $328 million. Energy connection orders were up 31% reported with core GE orders of $1.4 billion, down 14% organically. Power Conversion was down 33% on tough comparison to last year when our Renewables orders were up 4x. Industrial Solutions orders were up 6%, and the market there was down 4% in North America. Grid orders totaled $1.4 billion in the quarter. Total backlog finished at $11.5 billion. Current orders of $328 million were driven by LED rental fits, including large orders from financial services. Revenues for Energy Connections were $2.6 billion, up 45%. Core Energy Connection revenues were down 9% organic with Power Conversion down 12% and Industrial Solutions down 7%. Grid revenues totaled $1.4 billion. Lighting revenues were down 8% with current growing revenues 10% and legacy lighting down 22% as the non-LED market continues to decline, and we restructure and exit many markets. Operating profit in the quarter of $48 million was driven by $63 million of earnings from Energy Connections and a $15 million loss in lighting. Energy Connection had $64 million of profit from grid and a small loss in the core. The quarter was driven by lower volume, foreign exchange and mix, partially offset by value gap. The lighting loss was driven by build-out of our current business. The segment continues to make incremental progress, improving each of the last 3 quarters. And we expect the fourth quarter will improve again relative to the third quarter. 
Next, I'll cover GE Capital. Our vertical businesses earned $466 million in this quarter, up 33% from prior year, driven by lower impairments in energy finance, partially offset by lower gains. GECAS energy finance and industrial finance all had strong quarters, and overall portfolio quality remains stable. In the third quarter, the verticals funded $2.8 billion of unbooked volume and enabled $4.2 billion of industrial orders. 
Other continuing operations generated a $441 million loss in the quarter, principally driven by excess interest expense, restructuring costs related to portfolio transformation and headquarter operating cost, partially offset by tax benefits. These costs will continue to come down as excess debt matures and we right-size the organization structure. 
Discontinued operations incurred a loss of $100 million, largely driven by marks on held for sale assets, partially offset by tax benefits and other items. Overall, GE Capital reported a $78 million loss. We ended the quarter at $103 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity, with continuing ENI of $79 billion. Liquidity at the end of the quarter was $57 billion. 
Asset sales remained ahead of plan. During the quarter, we closed $16 billion of transactions, bringing the total closed transactions through the end of the quarter to $173 billion. We have signed agreements for an additional $12 billion in the third quarter, bringing the total signings to $193 billion. We expect to be largely done with signings by the end of the year, and we're on track for the 1.1x price to tangible book that we originally estimated. GE Capital paid $5 billion of dividends during the third quarter. In October, they paid an additional $2 billion, and we expect an incremental $2 billion dividend before the end of the year, for a total of $20 billion in 2016 versus the $18 billion target. 
Overall, the Capital team has continued to execute ahead of schedule on all aspects of the plan that we shared with you 18 months ago. We expect to be largely complete by the end of 2016. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

Now let me punch through our operating metrics for 2016. We're narrowing the EPS range to $1.48 to $1.52. In this number, we're offsetting $0.04 to $0.06 of FX headwind.

In this number, we're offsetting $0.04 to $0.06 of FX headwind. We expect organic growth to be positive, but near the low end of the range. And our corporate cost control and margin execution remained very strong. Free cash flow plus dispositions will be above plan, mainly due to GE Capital dividends, although the cash metrics remain on track. And we're increasing the buyback from $18 billion to $22 billion, and this makes the total cash return to investors $30 billion for the year, ahead of plan. So in a time of volatility, the GE model is performing. 
Finally, let me reflect on the company's earnings going forward. When we launched the Capital repositioning in April of 2015, we established the goal of $2 EPS by 2018. Since then, our outlook for oil and gas has worsened, and foreign exchanges hurt most global companies, and GE is no exception. At the same time, the rest of GE is performing well, and we see that continuing in the future. And we should be even better than our original plan for buyback, and Alstom continues to perform at or above plan. 
Going forward, we plan to drive out more costs in supply chain, program spend around product launches and corporate. And we will continue to grow our funding on digital transformation. Incremental leverage exists with the idea of pushing beyond our goals. We'll give you our 2017 outlook in December. But all of our metrics, for compensation purposes, will continue to be linked to $2 of EPS in 2018 or aligned with investors. 
Matt, back over to you for questions."

And then you have the Power Conversion businesses, which has a higher concentration in Oil & Gas historically and the balance of Energy Connections, that part of that -- of the Power Conversion business has been enormously challenged. We've replaced a lot of that volume with Renewables volume. The Renewables volume is not as profitable as what we're doing in Oil & Gas. And so Power Conversion has been a challenge. We've been break even to lose a little bit of money here through the first 3 quarters. And then that leaves you with our legacy Industrial Solutions business, which had a reasonably -- a good orders quarter -- I mentioned in earlier, up 6% on orders in the North American market. It feels like it was down 4%. But on execution and revenue in the quarter was less than what we expected it to deliver. That business ought to earn between $100 million and $140 million a year. The Power Conversion business, until oil turns around, I think it's going to be a little bit of a challenge. And we have a good outlook for our grid business.

And the fact that kind of underlying Alstom orders that will play out in kind of '17 and beyond are actually quite strong as well. So I view orders as being kind of more or less in line with our expectations as it build up for what we have to do in '17 and '18. And then Q4, I think, we believe, will be a pretty good orders quarter as well. I don't know. Jeff, do you want to add to that?"

So the 2% to 4% -- moving from 2% to 4%, the 0% to 2% is mostly about where we think the revenue number is going to end up with Oil & Gas.

We think the Alstom return still looks solid. And the Alstom earnings outlook for '17 and '18 still looks solid. We're going to continue to execute on the buyback, right? So those were the main -- those are the main components. And then what I would add to that, Jeff, is just a context of driving corporate cost lower, continuing to work hard on supply -- incremental opportunities on supply chain that we see and accelerating progress in gross margins. So I think the way you got to think about it is incremental intensity around cost that we see in our line of sight could sustain good growth on our industrial portfolio. Some of the FX headwind we've seen should come back to us over the next few years, just by the way the contracts are written. Buyback at or ahead of plan, and that realizes the context for an Oil & Gas business that we're executing well, but we're trying to be prudent about how we think about it over the next couple of years."

Although when the volume comes back, it will absolutely be there. There -- I think Lorenzo and the team would say there are additional incremental cost actions we're going to continue to work into 2017. I think you're right. I think the depth of which you can continue to cut cost is somewhat limited, but there is still incremental additional actions that the team can take. I think our comment on more cost actions generally is more of a statement across the entirety of the company given what's happened in Oil & Gas around program cost, structure, corporate.

But my primary question is on the margin side, obviously, good news on gross margins, good news from price cost. But what's driving the SG&A inflation? Because it's about 150 bps of higher SG&A. So if you can just address those 2 questions."

So first on buyback, let me be absolutely clear. The $4 billion buyback is an increase of the model we gave you that went through 2018 that we're buying $4 billion more stock than we said we would when we gave you the plan for 2018, okay? On SG&A, s",194,"Okay. So first on buyback, let me be absolutely clear. The $4 billion buyback is an increase of the model we gave you that went through 2018 that we're buying $4 billion more stock than we said we would when we gave you the plan for 2018, okay? On SG&A, so in the third quarter, structural SG&A was up 1%. That was 12.6% of sales. Third quarter year-to-date, we're actually down 4%, about 13% of sales. It was a bit of a drag in the quarter, partly because SG&A was up 1% and volume was essentially down slightly on a calculation basis. So it ended up being about a 10 basis point drag in the quarter. Other inflation that sits in the other line is associated with inflation on base cost. And most of that is EOP. There's other indirect expenses that also incur inflation, and that's what you see on that line. Other inflation, ex FX, if you take out the impact of FX and some of those marks go through the other line in that walk, was a negative 60 basis points as opposed to what we showed you in the walk."

We still think this is a core GE business and one where our team is managing it extremely well through the cycle. The rest of GE is executing very well. Alstom remains on track in '17 and '18. The buyback is ahead of plan. We've got a really good line of sight to incrementally take more cost out of the company and be even more efficient. And all of our compensation plans, whether it's the long-term incentive plan or the AIP, which is in our AIC Plan, all tied to the bridge that we showed you in 2015 and where we march in '16, '17, '18.

We continue to see challenges in the resource sector as customers adjust to a lower price environment. Globally, growth continues, but at a low level. There is sufficient opportunity out there to achieve our goals. At the same time, we plan to control our cost even tighter as we navigate this environment. 
GE grew organically by 1%, and EPS grew by 10%. Segment profit grew by 1% year-to-date, ex FX. Industrial margins were up 40 basis points, again excluding foreign exchange. CFOA was $8 billion, including $2.9 billion of industrial cash flow. We ended the quarter with $319 billion of backlog, and we accomplished our financial goals despite the impact of $0.04 per share in foreign exchange headwinds year-to-date. 
We continue to execute our capital allocation plan. We have virtually completed our pivot in Financial Services with $193 billion of signings. Year-to-date, we've returned $24.6 billion to investors through dividends and buyback. For the year, we're increasing the buyback by $4 billion from $18 billion to $22 billion, and total cash return to investors will be at least $30 billion for the year. 
We continue to invest in the company. In the quarter, we announced investments in additive manufacturing, digital platforms and wind turbine supply chain. These will add to earnings in 2018 and position the company in fast-growth markets in the future. 
Orders were $26.9 billion, down 6%. Alstom orders were $5.2 billion, and backlog is up $3.2 billion since the acquisition. Overall, backlog is up 6% versus a year ago, with service backlog up 11%. We had substantial strength in Renewables, Healthcare and Power. 
Renewables grew by 59%, including our first substantial offshore order at $600 million and a $400 million order to repower the installed base. 
Healthcare, HCS equipment, had its strongest orders growth in 5 years at 12%. This includes 12% growth in the United States and 15% in China. 
Aviation service orders were up 10% and growth market orders were up 21%. Oil and gas orders were down 21% in the quarter. There are still pockets of growth. Our Middle East orders grew by 5%, and Latin America was up by 19%. We ended the quarter with $22 billion of backlog, and we expect fourth quarter orders to be about flat with the year ago. 
AGPs remain on track for 135 to 150 in the year. Software orders were about $900 million in 3Q, up 11%, and at $2.8 billion, were up 15% year-to-date. We saw significant growth in Power, up 72%; Oil & Gas, up 10%; Transportation, up 21%; and Grid, up 43%. 
Customer wins include Gerdau, NEC, Aramco, Haier and CN [ph]. We continue to build our foundation for growth. We have 243 partners on Predix and are on track for 20,000 developers by year-end. Our productivity at $500 million is already above target and should be strong for the year. We see orders strengthening in the fourth quarter versus a year ago, and that will position us for 2017. 
GE is executing well in the environment. As I said earlier, organic growth was up 1%. Excluding Oil & Gas, organic revenue growth is up 6% in the third quarter and 4% year-to-date. We had several strong business performances. Power was up 7% with 15% growth in equipment. Renewables grew 44%. Aviation service was up 12%. And the GE Store contributed to growth, with vertical financings which supported $4.2 billion of industrial orders. And meanwhile, GE2GE revenue, which is a measure of internal pull-through, grew by 25%. 
Organic growth is accelerating through the year. The fourth quarter will be at 4%. And for the year, we expect organic growth to be 0 to 2%. We continue to see a drag in Oil & Gas, with revenue down 15% to 20% for the year, and the rest of GE will grow at a healthy pace. The Oil & Gas team is executing well in a tough environment. We continue to aggressively manage costs while positioning for long-term growth. The business fully leverages the GE Store and will come out of this cycle stronger. 
Core margins grew by 40 basis points, and gross margins grew by 110 basis points, ex FX. We've seen solid work in value gap and cost productivity, slightly offset by mix. Service margins again led the way with 220 basis points of expansion. Our analytical tools have been critical to enhance service margins. 
Our businesses have done a nice job in a slow-growth environment. For instance, Transportation grew margins by 90 basis points despite lower volume. 
We continue to invest in the growth and competitiveness of GE. Alstom remains on track, and we're building backlog and winning key new orders. We're on track for synergies of $1.2 billion in the year. Year-to-date, Alstom orders are $12.7 billion, up 13% versus 2015. We pulled forward more restructuring, which should help 2017 and beyond. Alstom remains on track to deliver $0.05 of EPS this year, ex FX. And we expect to complete purchase accounting in the fourth quarter by booking an incremental reserve of $2.4 billion to cover customer contracts and legal and tax reserves. This is consistent with expectations. The net present value of synergies is more than $21 billion, and Alstom will generate a mid-teen return over time. 
In September, we announced the acquisition of SLM and Arcam, which will position GE as a leader in the fast-growth market for additive manufacturing equipment while opening up potential for an additional $3 billion to $5 billion of productivity over time. Also in September, we announced the acquisition of Meridium, a leader in asset performance management. This completes our suite of maintenance optimization, machine and equipment health and reliability management. It's a perfect fit for our digital strategy and will accelerate our growth. 
Last week, we announced the acquisition of LM Wind Power. This gives us enhanced margins and technical expertise. In addition, this opens up growth in emerging markets. LM and GE have a deep pipeline of innovation, which will lead the industry. 
We had a pretty good quarter for cash. Industrial CFOA was $2.9 billion, up 13% from 2015. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $17.3 billion, including a Capital dividend of $5 billion. We received an additional $2 billion dividend from Capital in October. In the fourth quarter, we expect industrial CFOA to be more than $9 billion based on higher earnings and lower working capital. In addition, we should receive a $4 billion dividend from GE Capital. So for the year, we expect free cash flow plus dispositions to be more than $32 billion above our goal. 
As I noted earlier, we continue to invest in long-term growth and competitiveness. And with the improved outlook on CFOA, we plan to boost our buyback by $4 billion to $22 billion with a total cash return to investors expected to be $30 billion, including the dividend. Our balance sheet remains very strong. All of our cash metrics look solid for the year. 
So now, let me turn it over to Jeff to go through operations."

I'll start with the third quarter summary. Revenues of $29.3 billion, up 4% in the quarter. Industrial revenues were up 5% to $26.7 billion. You could see on the right side that Industrial segments were up 4% reported and up 1% organic. Alst",3437,"Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with the third quarter summary. Revenues of $29.3 billion, up 4% in the quarter. Industrial revenues were up 5% to $26.7 billion. You could see on the right side that Industrial segments were up 4% reported and up 1% organic. Alstom revenue in the quarter was $3.2 billion. Industrial operating plus verticals EPS was $0.32 in the quarter, up 10%. The operating EPS number of $0.27 includes other continuing GE Capital activity, including headquarter runoff and other exit-related items that I'll cover on the GE Capital page. Continuing EPS of $0.23 included the impact of nonoperating pension. The net EPS of $0.22 includes discontinued operations. Total discounts impact was a charge of $103 million in the quarter, driven by GE Capital exit costs. 
As Jeff said, we generated $18.3 billion of CFOA year-to-date, up from $6.5 billion last year, driven by increased dividends from GE Capital. Excluding deal taxes, industrial CFOA was $3.4 billion year-to-date, down 45%. We generated $2.9 billion of Industrial CFOA in the third quarter, which was up 13% versus last year. This was driven primarily by working capital improvements in receivables and inventory. Progress collections was a usage in the quarter on lower orders, principally in Oil & Gas. 
Free cash flow was up 17%, and free cash flow conversion was 93% in the quarter. Adjusting free cash flow conversion for the mismatch of gain income and cash, which is included in other investing activities, free cash flow conversion would be 99%. 
Alstom generated $25 million of CFOA in the quarter. 
As Jeff said earlier, we now expect GE Capital dividends for the year of $20 billion versus the planned $18 billion. Fourth quarter will be another large industrial cash quarter on $5 billion of cash income and continued progress on working capital, principally around inventories related to higher volume of deliveries in the quarter. 
Industrial CFOA is expected to generate between $11 billion and $12 billion of cash for the total year. 
The tax rate was 11% in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date tax rate to 13%. In the third quarter, we adopted an accounting standards change related to the treatment of tax benefits on stock option exercises, which had a favorable impact on our 3Q tax rate of about 2 points. The impact on our year-to-date rate was about 1 point. Given that change, we now expect the total year GE rate to be in the low teens versus the mid-teens rate we guided to previously. The GE Capital tax rate was favorable, reflecting a tax benefit on pretax continuing loss. 
On the right side of the segment results, as I mentioned, Industrial segment revenues were up 4% reported and up 1% organically. Excluding Oil & Gas, which has clearly been challenging, organic revenue was up 6%, with strength in Power, Renewables, Aviation and Healthcare. 
Industrial segment op profit was down 5% reported and down 3% organically. The organic number excludes the impact of $14 million of FX translation headwind. We also had an additional $128 million of negative FX transactional impacts year-over-year, which is not adjusted for in the organic calculation. This related to remeasurement and mark-to-market on open hedges principally in Oil & Gas, Renewables and Energy Connections. Excluding all FX, organic operating profit was flat in the quarter. 
Including corporate operating costs, Industrial op profit was down 6% reported and down 4% organically and flat excluding all FX. As you see at the bottom of the page, and as I mentioned earlier, Industrial operating plus vertical EPS was $0.32, up 10%, with Industrial operating EPS up 8%. On a year-to-date basis, we delivered $1.03 of EPS, which was up 29% versus the prior year. 
Next, on Industrial other items for the quarter. We had $0.05 of charges related to Industrial restructuring and other items that were taken at corporate. Charges were $683 million on a pretax basis with $200 million related to Alstom synergies, investments that we've made to drive results, $100 million related to continuing cost-out actions in Oil & Gas and actions taken in Lighting and other segments. 
We also closed the asset management transaction in the quarter, resulting in a $400 million pretax gain. This gain was partially offset by a charge associated with the anticipated sale of our majority share in a nonstrategic business in aviation that makes aerial structures. The net gains for the quarter were $0.02. 
At the bottom the page, you can see the profile for 2016. We continue to expect gains and restructured to offset for the year at about $0.24, both in earnings and charges. 
Next I'll cover the segments. First is Power. Power orders in the quarter totaled $7.5 billion, up 56%, including Alstom. Excluding Alstom, orders were $4.7 billion, down 3%. Core equipment orders were flat at $1.7 billion. Gas-powered system orders were higher by 6%, driven by aero and gas turbines, offset partially by Distributed Power resets. We booked 36 aeroderivative units in the quarter versus 26 last year on strong demand in sub-Saharan Africa and Argentina. Gas turbine units were 11 versus 22 a year ago. Although the number of units was lower, the dollar value of the orders were up 10% on much larger units, principally the H, with 6 units ordered versus 4 last year. We have 33 Hs in backlog and received orders for 50 inception to date on the program. 
One of the H orders in the quarter for 3 units was full scope and included additional Alstom scope totaling $760 million. We continue to see a real opportunity for growth and equipment pull-through between GE and the Alstom businesses. Core equipment backlog was 34% versus last year. Core service orders of $3 billion were lower by 4% on lower Power Services, driven by no repeat of a large plant upgrade in Japan last year and timing on 10 AGP orders. AGP orders in the quarter were 24 versus 22 last year. We have booked 50% of the 10 AGPs that moved to the fourth quarter as of this call and are still on track for the year for 135 to 150 AGPs in total. 
Alstom orders in the quarter were $2.8 billion. Equipment orders totaled $2 billion, including $1.1 billion for the Hinkley Point U.K. power project. We also booked another 3 HRSGs and 3 steam turbines related to the full-scope H ones I mentioned earlier. Alstom service orders were just under $900 million. Alstom backlog ended the quarter at $17.7 billion, which is up 15% since the acquisition, with equipment up 49% and services down slightly. 
Power revenue in the quarter totaled $6.5 billion, up 37%. Core GE revenue of $5.1 billion was higher by 7%. Core equipment revenue of $2 billion grew 15% driven by Gas Power Systems higher by 16%. We shipped 30 gas turbines, including 7Hs versus 16 a year ago. Aero units were higher by 9 versus last year. Core services revenues of $3.1 billion grew 2% on outage volume and upgrades. We shipped 28 AGPs in the quarter versus 22 a year ago. Alstom revenue in the quarter totaled $1.5 billion, with $530 million of equipment and $920 million of service revenues. 
Operating profit in total was just shy of $1.2 billion, with core op profit of $1.1 billion and Alstom op profit of $91 million. Core earnings were higher by 3% on positive value gap and volume, partly offset by the mix impact of 7Hs versus 0 last year. The Hs we shipped in the third quarter were profitable, but drove a 70 basis point margin contraction in the quarter. The $91 million of Alstom earnings included a $16 million FX headwind.
Through the third quarter, the team has delivered $650 million of Alstom synergies versus the $777 million total year target that we shared with you last year, and the business is delivering on its H profitability in the second half. For the year, we expect to ship 25 H turbines and about 110 to 115 gas turbines in total. 
Next up is Renewables. Orders in the quarter totaled $3 billion, up 59%. Core orders, excluding Alstom, of $1.9 billion grew 3%. Core orders were driven by large service orders for $400 million associated with repowering and upgrading existing units, offset partly by fewer new unit orders of 592 turbines versus 821 a year ago. Over 90% of the new unit orders were the large new machines. We expect fourth quarter orders to be strong, as the final fully-qualified U.S. PTC orders are placed. Repowering, upgrades and new units provide a strong outlook for the fourth quarter and the future. 
Alstom orders in the quarter totaled $1 billion, driven by a large offshore wind win in Germany of over $600 million and $400 million of hydro orders. Backlog finished the quarter at $12.9 billion. Revenues of $2.8 billion grew 66%, with core GE revenues of $2.4 billion higher by 43%. The business shipped 970 wind units versus 735 wind units in the third quarter of last year. Alstom revenue totaled $381 million in the quarter. Operating profit of $202 million was up 16%, with the core business higher by 22% driven by higher volume offsetting negative foreign exchange. Op profit rate was down 150 basis points, excluding Alstom, reflecting new product mix and $58 million of negative foreign exchange versus last year. We continue to improve margins on the new 2-megawatt machine. Alstom synergies in the quarter totaled $46 million and Alstom op profit was a loss of $12 million. For the year, we now expect to ship 3,000 to 3,200 wind turbines versus the 3,000 we had previously communicated to you. 
Next on Aviation. Global passenger air travel continues to see strong growth despite a slight increase in capacity relative to demand. Year-to-date, August traffic was up 5.8% with strength in both domestic and international markets. Airfreight volumes were up 1.4% August year-to-date, with FTKs growing 3.9% year-over-year versus last year. Orders in the quarter were $6.2 billion, down 6%. Equipment orders of $2.1 billion were down 27% on lower commercial engine orders, driven by 9X, GE90 and GEnx. In the quarter, we booked $1.4 billion of new engine orders, including about $400 million in LEAP, $250 million of CFM and $350 million of GEnx. Military equipment orders of $204 million were up sharply, driven principally by T700 orders from Turkey. Total equipment backlog of $33.7 billion was down 4%. Service orders grew 10% with commercial service orders up 13%, driven by CSAs, up strongly at 29%, overhaul up 9% and the spares order rate up 6% at $42 million a day. Military service orders were down 12% on no repeat of a large Air Force order over last year. Total service backlog grew 15% to $122 billion. Revenues of $6.3 billion were up 5%. Equipment revenue was down 3%, with commercial up 5% on higher deliveries, including 22 LEAP engines, while military equipment revenue was down 33% on lower shipments. Service revenues were higher by 12%. The commercial spare shipment rate was up 5% to $39.7 million a day, Operating profit of $1.5 billion was up 10%, driven by higher volume and cost productivity. Margin rates improved 120 basis points in the quarter. 
Third quarter was another solid execution quarter for the Aviation team, and we are on track for the ramp-up on LEAP shipments this year. We have shipped 33 LEAP engines to date, and there are currently 6 LEAP-powered planes flying with 2 airlines, with departure performance of 100%, and some of those planes operating more than 10 cycles a day. We expect to deliver about 105 engines this year. 
Next is Oil & Gas. The industry remains very challenging. Some market indicators showed modest sequential improvement in the third quarter. U.S. onshore rig counts were higher by 15% versus the second quarter, and U.S. well counts rose 3% versus the second quarter. Both rig and well counts remain down about 50% from where they were last year. External forecasts for upstream spending for 2016 have been revised to be less negative and with 2017 slightly more positive. Flow markets on our industrial applications remain stable, but oil  and gas flow and OpEx markets continue to be weak. Orders for Oil & Gas of $2.5 billion were down 21% in the quarter, with equipment down 22% and services down 21%. All segments saw equipment declines, except Subsea and Drilling, which was up 33% on easier comparisons to last year. Service orders declined in all segments. 
Backlog ended the quarter at $21.6 billion, which is down 7%. Equipment backlog down 32% versus last year, while services backlog grew 14%. Revenues in the quarter of $3 billion were down 25%, with equipment revenue down 33%. All segments were lower, except Downstream Technology, which grew 16% in the third quarter. Service revenues were down 16% with declines across all the segments. Op profit of $353 million was down 42% driven by lower volume, price and foreign exchange, partially offset by cost execution. The business took out $245 million of cost in the quarter. 
Total cost out year-to-date is $535 million. The team expects to deliver total cost out for the year of between $700 million and $800 million, adjusting for cost actions related to volume. The business remains on track for op profit down about 30%, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. No doubt, it's an incredibly tough environment, but Lorenzo and the team have executed well on their cost-out initiatives and capturing available growth opportunities as they present themselves. 
On Healthcare. Healthcare business had another solid quarter. Orders in the quarter grew 6% to $4.8 billion. In terms of geography, orders grew organically 5% in the U.S., 6% in Europe and 10% in Asia Pacific. China orders were up 2%, but up 13%, excluding the KUBio bioprocess facility order we took last year. In terms of business lines, Healthcare Systems organic orders were up 8%, driven by strength in imaging, up 12%, on strong CT and MI and ultrasound higher by 11%. Life Science orders grew 4% organically, with bioprocess and core imaging both up 5%. Excluding the prior year KUBio order I just referred to, Life Science orders grew 11% with bioprocess higher by 22%. 
Revenues in the quarter of $4.5 billion were up 5%. Healthcare Systems revenues grew 4% organic with ultrasound higher by 13%, partly offset by imaging down 1%. Life Sciences grew revenues 11% organically. Op profit was up 10% in the third quarter and up 12% organically. Strong volume and cost performance more than offset price and program spending. Margin rates expanded 70 basis points in the quarter. Gross margins improved 90 basis points in the quarter. 
Healthcare continues to execute. Through 3 quarters, they've delivered over $300 million against their $350 million of cost-out commitments for the year. We expect they will outperform the 50 basis point margin goal. China growth continues to improve, with public tender activity up 20% in the third quarter. And the U.S. and Europe markets are seeing stable growth. 
Next is Transportation. The difficult cycle for Transportation continued in the third quarter. North American carloads were down 5.4%, driven by coal lower by 14.6% and petroleum down 23.4%. And motor [ph] volume was down 3.6%. August and September volumes did improve versus July, but are still well below 2015. We expect the trend to continue through year-end. Orders in the third quarter of $695 million were down 21% and down 15% organically. Equipment orders of $109 million were down 23%, but up 18% organically on orders for 5 locomotives versus 3 a year ago. Service orders of $586 million were down 21%, driven by lower loco parts and mining. Backlog ended the quarter at $19.9 billion, which is essentially flat with last year. 
Revenues in the third quarter of $1,249,000,000 were down 22%, down 17% organically, with equipment lower by 22% and services lower by 13%. We shipped 200 locos versus 259 a year ago. Op profit of $309 million was down 18% on lower volume, partially offset by positive mix and the benefits of restructuring. Gross margins improved 180 basis points and op profit margins were higher by 90 basis points. The business continues to grow its international business, as demand in the U.S. continues to be a challenge, while driving hard on products and service cost. We expect total year locomotive shipments up between 740 and 750 units. 
Energy and connection system -- Energy Connections and Lighting. This is the first new presentation of the 2 segments together. The businesses have not changed. We are reporting orders for Lighting for the first time. Lighting has really has 2 businesses: the current business and the legacy core lighting business, which we are in the process of restructuring. The current business represents professional lighting sales for North America and other key countries, energy management and control systems and software. Reported orders in backlog apply to only the current business as these are longer-term projects. Orders for this segment totaled $3 billion with Energy Connection orders of $2.7 billion and current orders of $328 million. Energy Connection orders were up 31% reported, with core GE orders of $1.4 billion down 14% organically. Power Conversion was down 33% on tough comparison to last year, when our Renewables orders were up 4x. Industrial Solutions orders were up 6%, and the market there was down 4% in North America. Grid orders totaled $1.4 billion in the quarter. Total backlog finished at $11.5 billion. Current orders of $328 million were driven by LED retrofits, including large orders from financial services. Revenues for Energy Connections were $2.6 billion, up 45%. Core Energy Connection revenues were down 9% organic, with Power Conversion down 12% and Industrial Solutions down 7%. Grid revenues totaled $1.4 billion. Lighting revenues were down 8%, with current growing revenues 10% and legacy lighting down 22% as the non-LED market continues to decline, and we restructure and exit many markets. Operating profit in the quarter of $48 million was driven by $63 million of earnings from Energy Connections and a $15 million loss in Lighting. Energy Connection had $64 million of profit from Grid and a small loss in the core. The quarter was driven by lower volume, foreign exchange and mix, partially offset by value gap. The Lighting loss was driven by a build-out of our current business. The segment continues to make incremental progress, improving each of the last 3 quarters, and we expect the fourth quarter will improve again relative to the third quarter. 
Next, I'll cover GE Capital. Our vertical businesses earned $466 million in this quarter, up 33% from prior year, driven by lower impairments in energy finance, partially offset by lower gains. GECAS energy finance and industrial finance all had strong quarters, and overall portfolio quality remains stable. In the third quarter, the verticals funded $2.8 billion of on-book volume and enabled $4.2 billion of industrial orders. 
Other continuing operations generated a $441 million loss in the quarter, principally driven by excess interest expense, restructuring costs related to portfolio transformation and headquarter operating cost, partially offset by tax benefits. These costs will continue to come down as excess debt matures and we right-size the organization structure. 
Discontinued operations incurred a loss of $100 million, largely driven by marks on held-for-sale assets, partially offset by tax benefits and other items. Overall, GE Capital reported a $78 million loss. We ended the quarter with $103 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity, with continuing ENI of $79 billion. Liquidity at the end of the quarter was $57 billion. 
Asset sales remained ahead of plan. During the quarter, we closed $16 billion of transactions, bringing the total closed transactions through the end of the quarter to $173 billion. We have signed agreements for an additional $12 billion in the third quarter, bringing the total signings to $193 billion. We expect to be largely done with signings by the end of the year, and we're on track for the 1.1x price to tangible book that we originally estimated. GE Capital paid $5 billion of dividends during the third quarter. In October, they paid an additional $2 billion, and we expect an incremental $2 billion dividend before the end of the year, for a total of $20 billion in 2016 versus the $18 billion target. 
Overall, the Capital team has continued to execute ahead of schedule on all aspects of the plan that we shared with you 18 months ago. We expect to be largely complete by the end of 2016. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

In this number, we're offsetting $0.04 to $0.06 of FX headwind. We expect organic growth to be positive, but near the low end of the range. And our corporate cost control and margin execution remain very strong. Free cash flow plus dispositions will be above plan, mainly due to GE Capital dividends, although the cash metrics remain on track. And we're increasing the buyback from $18 billion to $22 billion, and this makes the total cash return to investors $30 billion for the year, ahead of plan. So in a time of volatility, the GE model is performing. 
Finally, let me reflect on the company's earnings going forward. When we launched the Capital repositioning in April of 2015, we established the goal of $2 EPS by 2018. Since then, our outlook for Oil & Gas has worsened, and foreign exchange has hurt most global companies, and GE is no exception. At the same time, the rest of GE is performing well, and we see that continuing in the future. And we should be even better than our original plan for buyback, and Alstom continues to perform at or above plan. 
Going forward, we plan to drive out more costs in supply chain, program spend around product launches and corporate. And we will continue to grow our funding on digital transformation. Incremental leverage exists with the idea of pushing beyond our goals. We'll give you our 2017 outlook in December. But all of our metrics for compensation purposes will continue to be linked to $2 of EPS in 2018. We're aligned with investors. 
Matt, back over to you for questions."

It earned $64 million in the quarter. It's delivering on all the Alstom synergies that we talked about of delivering. And then you have the Power Conversion businesses, which has a higher concentration in Oil & Gas historically than the balance of Energy Connections. That part of that -- of the Power Conversion business has been enormously challenged. We've replaced a lot of that volume with Renewables volume. The Renewables volume is not as profitable as what we're doing in Oil & Gas. And so Power Conversion has been a challenge. We've been breakeven to lose a little bit of money here through the first 3 quarters. And then that leaves you with our legacy Industrial Solutions business, which had a reasonably -- a good orders quarter -- I mentioned in earlier, up 6% on orders in the North American market, that feels like it was down 4%. But on execution and revenue in the quarter was less than what we expected it to deliver. That business ought to earn between $100 million and $140 million a year. The Power Conversion business, until oil turns around, I think it's going to be a little bit of a challenge. And we have a good outlook for our Grid business. So when we think about 2017, we expect the Energy Connections business to be a meaningful contributor to earnings growth when we move from this year to next."

So those were the main -- those are the main components. And then what I would add to that, Jeff, is just a context of driving corporate cost lower, continuing to work hard on supply -- incremental opportunities on supply chain that we see and accelerating progress in gross margins. So I think the way you got to think about it is incremental intensity around cost that we see in our line of sight could sustain good growth on our industrial portfolio. Some of the FX headwind we've seen should come back to us over the next few years, just by the way the contracts are written. Buyback at or ahead of plan, and that realizes the context for an Oil & Gas business that we're executing well, but we're trying to be prudent about how we think about it over the next couple of years."

There -- I think Lorenzo and the team would say there are additional incremental cost actions we're going to continue to work into 2017. I think you're right. I think the depth of which you can continue to cut cost is somewhat limited, but there is still incremental additional actions that the team can take. I think our comment on more cost actions generally is more of a statement across the entirety of the company given what's happened in Oil & Gas around program cost, structure, corporate.

And we'll be able to do that and still do the investments we need to make in digital as we go forward. So I think that's the right context."

As you know, we're constantly going back and evaluating our capital allocation plans, most of which we've shared with you, on what makes sense.

The $4 billion buyback is an increase to the model we gave you that went through 2018, that we're buying $4 billion more stock than we said we would when we gave you the plan through 2018, okay? On SG&A, so in the third quarter, structural SG&A was up 1%. That was 12.6% of sales. Third quarter year-to-date, we're actually down 4%, about 13% of sales. It was a bit of a drag in the quarter, partly because SG&A was up 1% and volume was essentially down slightly on a calculation basis. So it ended up being about a 10 basis point drag in the quarter. Other inflation that sits in the other line is associated with inflation on base cost. And most of that is EOP. There's other indirect expenses that also incur inflation, and that's what you see on that line. Other inflation, ex FX, if you take out the impact of FX and some of those marks go through the other line in that walk, was a negative 60 basis points as opposed to what we showed you in the walk."

We continue to see challenges in the resource sector as customers adjust to a lower price environment. Globally, growth continues, but at a low level. There is sufficient opportunity out there to achieve our goals. At the same time, we plan to control our cost even tighter as we navigate this environment. 
GE grew organically by 1%, and EPS grew by 10%. Segment profit grew by 1% year-to-date, ex FX. Industrial margins were up 40 basis points, again excluding foreign exchange. CFOA was $8 billion, including $2.9 billion of industrial cash flow. We ended the quarter with $319 billion of backlog, and we accomplished our financial goals despite the impact of $0.04 per share in foreign exchange headwinds year-to-date. 
We continue to execute our capital allocation plan. We have virtually completed our pivot in Financial Services with $193 billion of signings. Year-to-date, we've returned $24.6 billion to investors through dividends and buyback. For the year, we're increasing the buyback by $4 billion from $18 billion to $22 billion, and total cash return to investors will be at least $30 billion for the year. 
We continue to invest in the company. In the quarter, we announced investments in additive manufacturing, digital platforms and wind turbine supply chain. These will add to earnings in 2018 and position the company in fast-growth markets in the future. 
Orders were $26.9 billion, down 6%. Alstom orders were $5.2 billion, and backlog is up $3.2 billion since the acquisition. Overall, backlog is up 6% versus a year ago, with service backlog up 11%. We had substantial strength in Renewables, Healthcare and Power. 
Renewables grew by 59%, including our first substantial offshore order at $600 million and a $400 million order to repower the installed base. 
Healthcare, HCS equipment, had its strongest orders growth in 5 years at 12%. This includes 12% growth in the United States and 15% in China. 
Aviation service orders were up 10% and growth market orders were up 21%. Oil and gas orders were down 21% in the quarter. There are still pockets of growth. Our Middle East orders grew by 5%, and Latin America was up by 19%. We ended the quarter with $22 billion of backlog, and we expect fourth quarter orders to be about flat with the year ago. 
AGPs remain on track for 135 to 150 in the year. Software orders were about $900 million in 3Q, up 11%, and at $2.8 billion, were up 15% year-to-date. We saw significant growth in Power, up 72%; Oil & Gas, up 10%; Transportation, up 21%; and Grid, up 43%. 
Customer wins include Gerdau, NEC, Aramco, Haier and CN [ph]. We continue to build our foundation for growth. We have 243 partners on Predix and are on track for 20,000 developers by year-end. Our productivity at $500 million is already above target and should be strong for the year. We see orders strengthening in the fourth quarter versus a year ago, and that will position us for 2017. 
GE is executing well in the environment. As I said earlier, organic growth was up 1%. Excluding Oil & Gas, organic revenue growth is up 6% in the third quarter and 4% year-to-date. We had several strong business performances. Power was up 7% with 15% growth in equipment. Renewables grew 44%. Aviation service was up 12%. And the GE Store contributed to growth, with vertical financings which supported $4.2 billion of industrial orders. And meanwhile, GE2GE revenue, which is a measure of internal pull-through, grew by 25%. 
Organic growth is accelerating through the year. The fourth quarter will be at 4%. And for the year, we expect organic growth to be 0 to 2%. We continue to see a drag in Oil & Gas, with revenue down 15% to 20% for the year, and the rest of GE will grow at a healthy pace. The Oil & Gas team is executing well in a tough environment. We continue to aggressively manage costs while positioning for long-term growth. The business fully leverages the GE Store and will come out of this cycle stronger. 
Core margins grew by 40 basis points, and gross margins grew by 110 basis points, ex FX. We've seen solid work in value gap and cost productivity, slightly offset by mix. Service margins again led the way with 220 basis points of expansion. Our analytical tools have been critical to enhance service margins. 
Our businesses have done a nice job in a slow-growth environment. For instance, Transportation grew margins by 90 basis points despite lower volume. 
We continue to invest in the growth and competitiveness of GE. Alstom remains on track, and we're building backlog and winning key new orders. We're on track for synergies of $1.2 billion in the year. Year-to-date, Alstom orders are $12.7 billion, up 13% versus 2015. We pulled forward more restructuring, which should help 2017 and beyond. Alstom remains on track to deliver $0.05 of EPS this year, ex FX. And we expect to complete purchase accounting in the fourth quarter by booking an incremental reserve of $2.4 billion to cover customer contracts and legal and tax reserves. This is consistent with expectations. The net present value of synergies is more than $21 billion, and Alstom will generate a mid-teen return over time. 
In September, we announced the acquisition of SLM and Arcam, which will position GE as a leader in the fast-growth market for additive manufacturing equipment while opening up potential for an additional $3 billion to $5 billion of productivity over time. Also in September, we announced the acquisition of Meridium, a leader in asset performance management. This completes our suite of maintenance optimization, machine and equipment health and reliability management. It's a perfect fit for our digital strategy and will accelerate our growth. 
Last week, we announced the acquisition of LM Wind Power. This gives us enhanced margins and technical expertise. In addition, this opens up growth in emerging markets. LM and GE have a deep pipeline of innovation, which will lead the industry. 
We had a pretty good quarter for cash. Industrial CFOA was $2.9 billion, up 13% from 2015. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $17.3 billion, including a Capital dividend of $5 billion. We received an additional $2 billion dividend from Capital in October. In the fourth quarter, we expect industrial CFOA to be more than $9 billion based on higher earnings and lower working capital. In addition, we should receive a $4 billion dividend from GE Capital. So for the year, we expect free cash flow plus dispositions to be more than $32 billion above our goal. 
As I noted earlier, we continue to invest in long-term growth and competitiveness. And with the improved outlook on CFOA, we plan to boost our buyback by $4 billion to $22 billion with a total cash return to investors expected to be $30 billion, including the dividend. Our balance sheet remains very strong. All of our cash metrics look solid for the year. 
So now, let me turn it over to Jeff to go through operations."

Revenues of $29.3 billion, up 4% in the quarter. Industrial revenues were up 5% to $26.7 billion. You could see on the right side that Industrial segments were up 4% reported and up 1% organic. Alstom revenue in the quarter was $3.2 billion. Industrial operating plus verticals EPS was $0.32 in the quarter, up 10%. The operating EPS number of $0.27 includes other continuing GE Capital activity, including headquarter runoff and other exit-related items that I'll cover on the GE Capital page. Continuing EPS of $0.23 included the impact of nonoperating pension. The net EPS of $0.22 includes discontinued operations. Total discounts impact was a charge of $103 million in the quarter, driven by GE Capital exit costs. 
As Jeff said, we generated $18.3 billion of CFOA year-to-date, up from $6.5 billion last year, driven by increased dividends from GE Capital. Excluding deal taxes, industrial CFOA was $3.4 billion year-to-date, down 45%. We generated $2.9 billion of Industrial CFOA in the third quarter, which was up 13% versus last year. This was driven primarily by working capital improvements in receivables and inventory. Progress collections was a usage in the quarter on lower orders, principally in Oil & Gas. 
Free cash flow was up 17%, and free cash flow conversion was 93% in the quarter. Adjusting free cash flow conversion for the mismatch of gain income and cash, which is included in other investing activities, free cash flow conversion would be 99%. 
Alstom generated $25 million of CFOA in the quarter. 
As Jeff said earlier, we now expect GE Capital dividends for the year of $20 billion versus the planned $18 billion. Fourth quarter will be another large industrial cash quarter on $5 billion of cash income and continued progress on working capital, principally around inventories related to higher volume of deliveries in the quarter. 
Industrial CFOA is expected to generate between $11 billion and $12 billion of cash for the total year. 
The tax rate was 11% in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date tax rate to 13%. In the third quarter, we adopted an accounting standards change related to the treatment of tax benefits on stock option exercises, which had a favorable impact on our 3Q tax rate of about 2 points. The impact on our year-to-date rate was about 1 point. Given that change, we now expect the total year GE rate to be in the low teens versus the mid-teens rate we guided to previously. The GE Capital tax rate was favorable, reflecting a tax benefit on pretax continuing loss. 
On the right side of the segment results, as I mentioned, Industrial segment revenues were up 4% reported and up 1% organically. Excluding Oil & Gas, which has clearly been challenging, organic revenue was up 6%, with strength in Power, Renewables, Aviation and Healthcare. 
Industrial segment op profit was down 5% reported and down 3% organically. The organic number excludes the impact of $14 million of FX translation headwind. We also had an additional $128 million of negative FX transactional impacts year-over-year, which is not adjusted for in the organic calculation. This related to remeasurement and mark-to-market on open hedges principally in Oil & Gas, Renewables and Energy Connections. Excluding all FX, organic operating profit was flat in the quarter. 
Including corporate operating costs, Industrial op profit was down 6% reported and down 4% organically and flat excluding all FX. As you see at the bottom of the page, and as I mentioned earlier, Industrial operating plus vertical EPS was $0.32, up 10%, with Industrial operating EPS up 8%. On a year-to-date basis, we delivered $1.03 of EPS, which was up 29% versus the prior year. 
Next, on Industrial other items for the quarter. We had $0.05 of charges related to Industrial restructuring and other items that were taken at corporate. Charges were $683 million on a pretax basis with $200 million related to Alstom synergies, investments that we've made to drive results, $100 million related to continuing cost-out actions in Oil & Gas and actions taken in Lighting and other segments. 
We also closed the asset management transaction in the quarter, resulting in a $400 million pretax gain. This gain was partially offset by a charge associated with the anticipated sale of our majority share in a nonstrategic business in aviation that makes aerial structures. The net gains for the quarter were $0.02. 
At the bottom the page, you can see the profile for 2016. We continue to expect gains and restructured to offset for the year at about $0.24, both in earnings and charges. 
Next I'll cover the segments. First is Power. Power orders in the quarter totaled $7.5 billion, up 56%, including Alstom. Excluding Alstom, orders were $4.7 billion, down 3%. Core equipment orders were flat at $1.7 billion. Gas-powered system orders were higher by 6%, driven by aero and gas turbines, offset partially by Distributed Power resets. We booked 36 aeroderivative units in the quarter versus 26 last year on strong demand in sub-Saharan Africa and Argentina. Gas turbine units were 11 versus 22 a year ago. Although the number of units was lower, the dollar value of the orders were up 10% on much larger units, principally the H, with 6 units ordered versus 4 last year. We have 33 Hs in backlog and received orders for 50 inception to date on the program. 
One of the H orders in the quarter for 3 units was full scope and included additional Alstom scope totaling $760 million. We continue to see a real opportunity for growth and equipment pull-through between GE and the Alstom businesses. Core equipment backlog was 34% versus last year. Core service orders of $3 billion were lower by 4% on lower Power Services, driven by no repeat of a large plant upgrade in Japan last year and timing on 10 AGP orders. AGP orders in the quarter were 24 versus 22 last year. We have booked 50% of the 10 AGPs that moved to the fourth quarter as of this call and are still on track for the year for 135 to 150 AGPs in total. 
Alstom orders in the quarter were $2.8 billion. Equipment orders totaled $2 billion, including $1.1 billion for the Hinkley Point U.K. power project. We also booked another 3 HRSGs and 3 steam turbines related to the full-scope H ones I mentioned earlier. Alstom service orders were just under $900 million. Alstom backlog ended the quarter at $17.7 billion, which is up 15% since the acquisition, with equipment up 49% and services down slightly. 
Power revenue in the quarter totaled $6.5 billion, up 37%. Core GE revenue of $5.1 billion was higher by 7%. Core equipment revenue of $2 billion grew 15% driven by Gas Power Systems higher by 16%. We shipped 30 gas turbines, including 7Hs versus 16 a year ago. Aero units were higher by 9 versus last year. Core services revenues of $3.1 billion grew 2% on outage volume and upgrades. We shipped 28 AGPs in the quarter versus 22 a year ago. Alstom revenue in the quarter totaled $1.5 billion, with $530 million of equipment and $920 million of service revenues. 
Operating profit in total was just shy of $1.2 billion, with core op profit of $1.1 billion and Alstom op profit of $91 million. Core earnings were higher by 3% on positive value gap and volume, partly offset by the mix impact of 7Hs versus 0 last year. The Hs we shipped in the third quarter were profitable, but drove a 70 basis point margin contraction in the quarter. The $91 million of Alstom earnings included a $16 million FX headwind.
Through the third quarter, the team has delivered $650 million of Alstom synergies versus the $777 million total year target that we shared with you last year, and the business is delivering on its H profitability in the second half. For the year, we expect to ship 25 H turbines and about 110 to 115 gas turbines in total. 
Next up is Renewables. Orders in the quarter totaled $3 billion, up 59%. Core orders, excluding Alstom, of $1.9 billion grew 3%. Core orders were driven by large service orders for $400 million associated with repowering and upgrading existing units, offset partly by fewer new unit orders of 592 turbines versus 821 a year ago. Over 90% of the new unit orders were the large new machines. We expect fourth quarter orders to be strong, as the final fully-qualified U.S. PTC orders are placed. Repowering, upgrades and new units provide a strong outlook for the fourth quarter and the future. 
Alstom orders in the quarter totaled $1 billion, driven by a large offshore wind win in Germany of over $600 million and $400 million of hydro orders. Backlog finished the quarter at $12.9 billion. Revenues of $2.8 billion grew 66%, with core GE revenues of $2.4 billion higher by 43%. The business shipped 970 wind units versus 735 wind units in the third quarter of last year. Alstom revenue totaled $381 million in the quarter. Operating profit of $202 million was up 16%, with the core business higher by 22% driven by higher volume offsetting negative foreign exchange. Op profit rate was down 150 basis points, excluding Alstom, reflecting new product mix and $58 million of negative foreign exchange versus last year. We continue to improve margins on the new 2-megawatt machine. Alstom synergies in the quarter totaled $46 million and Alstom op profit was a loss of $12 million. For the year, we now expect to ship 3,000 to 3,200 wind turbines versus the 3,000 we had previously communicated to you. 
Next on Aviation. Global passenger air travel continues to see strong growth despite a slight increase in capacity relative to demand. Year-to-date, August traffic was up 5.8% with strength in both domestic and international markets. Airfreight volumes were up 1.4% August year-to-date, with FTKs growing 3.9% year-over-year versus last year. Orders in the quarter were $6.2 billion, down 6%. Equipment orders of $2.1 billion were down 27% on lower commercial engine orders, driven by 9X, GE90 and GEnx. In the quarter, we booked $1.4 billion of new engine orders, including about $400 million in LEAP, $250 million of CFM and $350 million of GEnx. Military equipment orders of $204 million were up sharply, driven principally by T700 orders from Turkey. Total equipment backlog of $33.7 billion was down 4%. Service orders grew 10% with commercial service orders up 13%, driven by CSAs, up strongly at 29%, overhaul up 9% and the spares order rate up 6% at $42 million a day. Military service orders were down 12% on no repeat of a large Air Force order over last year. Total service backlog grew 15% to $122 billion. Revenues of $6.3 billion were up 5%. Equipment revenue was down 3%, with commercial up 5% on higher deliveries, including 22 LEAP engines, while military equipment revenue was down 33% on lower shipments. Service revenues were higher by 12%. The commercial spare shipment rate was up 5% to $39.7 million a day, Operating profit of $1.5 billion was up 10%, driven by higher volume and cost productivity. Margin rates improved 120 basis points in the quarter. 
Third quarter was another solid execution quarter for the Aviation team, and we are on track for the ramp-up on LEAP shipments this year. We have shipped 33 LEAP engines to date, and there are currently 6 LEAP-powered planes flying with 2 airlines, with departure performance of 100%, and some of those planes operating more than 10 cycles a day. We expect to deliver about 105 engines this year. 
Next is Oil & Gas. The industry remains very challenging. Some market indicators showed modest sequential improvement in the third quarter. U.S. onshore rig counts were higher by 15% versus the second quarter, and U.S. well counts rose 3% versus the second quarter. Both rig and well counts remain down about 50% from where they were last year. External forecasts for upstream spending for 2016 have been revised to be less negative and with 2017 slightly more positive. Flow markets on our industrial applications remain stable, but oil  and gas flow and OpEx markets continue to be weak. Orders for Oil & Gas of $2.5 billion were down 21% in the quarter, with equipment down 22% and services down 21%. All segments saw equipment declines, except Subsea and Drilling, which was up 33% on easier comparisons to last year. Service orders declined in all segments. 
Backlog ended the quarter at $21.6 billion, which is down 7%. Equipment backlog down 32% versus last year, while services backlog grew 14%. Revenues in the quarter of $3 billion were down 25%, with equipment revenue down 33%. All segments were lower, except Downstream Technology, which grew 16% in the third quarter. Service revenues were down 16% with declines across all the segments. Op profit of $353 million was down 42% driven by lower volume, price and foreign exchange, partially offset by cost execution. The business took out $245 million of cost in the quarter. 
Total cost out year-to-date is $535 million. The team expects to deliver total cost out for the year of between $700 million and $800 million, adjusting for cost actions related to volume. The business remains on track for op profit down about 30%, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. No doubt, it's an incredibly tough environment, but Lorenzo and the team have executed well on their cost-out initiatives and capturing available growth opportunities as they present themselves. 
On Healthcare. Healthcare business had another solid quarter. Orders in the quarter grew 6% to $4.8 billion. In terms of geography, orders grew organically 5% in the U.S., 6% in Europe and 10% in Asia Pacific. China orders were up 2%, but up 13%, excluding the KUBio bioprocess facility order we took last year. In terms of business lines, Healthcare Systems organic orders were up 8%, driven by strength in imaging, up 12%, on strong CT and MI and ultrasound higher by 11%. Life Science orders grew 4% organically, with bioprocess and core imaging both up 5%. Excluding the prior year KUBio order I just referred to, Life Science orders grew 11% with bioprocess higher by 22%. 
Revenues in the quarter of $4.5 billion were up 5%. Healthcare Systems revenues grew 4% organic with ultrasound higher by 13%, partly offset by imaging down 1%. Life Sciences grew revenues 11% organically. Op profit was up 10% in the third quarter and up 12% organically. Strong volume and cost performance more than offset price and program spending. Margin rates expanded 70 basis points in the quarter. Gross margins improved 90 basis points in the quarter. 
Healthcare continues to execute. Through 3 quarters, they've delivered over $300 million against their $350 million of cost-out commitments for the year. We expect they will outperform the 50 basis point margin goal. China growth continues to improve, with public tender activity up 20% in the third quarter. And the U.S. and Europe markets are seeing stable growth. 
Next is Transportation. The difficult cycle for Transportation continued in the third quarter. North American carloads were down 5.4%, driven by coal lower by 14.6% and petroleum down 23.4%. And motor [ph] volume was down 3.6%. August and September volumes did improve versus July, but are still well below 2015. We expect the trend to continue through year-end. Orders in the third quarter of $695 million were down 21% and down 15% organically. Equipment orders of $109 million were down 23%, but up 18% organically on orders for 5 locomotives versus 3 a year ago. Service orders of $586 million were down 21%, driven by lower loco parts and mining. Backlog ended the quarter at $19.9 billion, which is essentially flat with last year. 
Revenues in the third quarter of $1,249,000,000 were down 22%, down 17% organically, with equipment lower by 22% and services lower by 13%. We shipped 200 locos versus 259 a year ago. Op profit of $309 million was down 18% on lower volume, partially offset by positive mix and the benefits of restructuring. Gross margins improved 180 basis points and op profit margins were higher by 90 basis points. The business continues to grow its international business, as demand in the U.S. continues to be a challenge, while driving hard on products and service cost. We expect total year locomotive shipments up between 740 and 750 units. 
Energy and connection system -- Energy Connections and Lighting. This is the first new presentation of the 2 segments together. The businesses have not changed. We are reporting orders for Lighting for the first time. Lighting has really has 2 businesses: the current business and the legacy core lighting business, which we are in the process of restructuring. The current business represents professional lighting sales for North America and other key countries, energy management and control systems and software. Reported orders in backlog apply to only the current business as these are longer-term projects. Orders for this segment totaled $3 billion with Energy Connection orders of $2.7 billion and current orders of $328 million. Energy Connection orders were up 31% reported, with core GE orders of $1.4 billion down 14% organically. Power Conversion was down 33% on tough comparison to last year, when our Renewables orders were up 4x. Industrial Solutions orders were up 6%, and the market there was down 4% in North America. Grid orders totaled $1.4 billion in the quarter. Total backlog finished at $11.5 billion. Current orders of $328 million were driven by LED retrofits, including large orders from financial services. Revenues for Energy Connections were $2.6 billion, up 45%. Core Energy Connection revenues were down 9% organic, with Power Conversion down 12% and Industrial Solutions down 7%. Grid revenues totaled $1.4 billion. Lighting revenues were down 8%, with current growing revenues 10% and legacy lighting down 22% as the non-LED market continues to decline, and we restructure and exit many markets. Operating profit in the quarter of $48 million was driven by $63 million of earnings from Energy Connections and a $15 million loss in Lighting. Energy Connection had $64 million of profit from Grid and a small loss in the core. The quarter was driven by lower volume, foreign exchange and mix, partially offset by value gap. The Lighting loss was driven by a build-out of our current business. The segment continues to make incremental progress, improving each of the last 3 quarters, and we expect the fourth quarter will improve again relative to the third quarter. 
Next, I'll cover GE Capital. Our vertical businesses earned $466 million in this quarter, up 33% from prior year, driven by lower impairments in energy finance, partially offset by lower gains. GECAS energy finance and industrial finance all had strong quarters, and overall portfolio quality remains stable. In the third quarter, the verticals funded $2.8 billion of on-book volume and enabled $4.2 billion of industrial orders. 
Other continuing operations generated a $441 million loss in the quarter, principally driven by excess interest expense, restructuring costs related to portfolio transformation and headquarter operating cost, partially offset by tax benefits. These costs will continue to come down as excess debt matures and we right-size the organization structure. 
Discontinued operations incurred a loss of $100 million, largely driven by marks on held-for-sale assets, partially offset by tax benefits and other items. Overall, GE Capital reported a $78 million loss. We ended the quarter with $103 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity, with continuing ENI of $79 billion. Liquidity at the end of the quarter was $57 billion. 
Asset sales remained ahead of plan. During the quarter, we closed $16 billion of transactions, bringing the total closed transactions through the end of the quarter to $173 billion. We have signed agreements for an additional $12 billion in the third quarter, bringing the total signings to $193 billion. We expect to be largely done with signings by the end of the year, and we're on track for the 1.1x price to tangible book that we originally estimated. GE Capital paid $5 billion of dividends during the third quarter. In October, they paid an additional $2 billion, and we expect an incremental $2 billion dividend before the end of the year, for a total of $20 billion in 2016 versus the $18 billion target. 
Overall, the Capital team has continued to execute ahead of schedule on all aspects of the plan that we shared with you 18 months ago. We expect to be largely complete by the end of 2016. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Jeff."

Now let me punch through our operating metrics for 2016. We're narrowing the EPS range to $1.48 to $1.52. In this number, we're offsetting $0.04 to $0.06 of FX headwind. We expect organic growth to be positive, but near the low end of the ra",290,"Thanks, Jeff. Now let me punch through our operating metrics for 2016. We're narrowing the EPS range to $1.48 to $1.52. In this number, we're offsetting $0.04 to $0.06 of FX headwind. We expect organic growth to be positive, but near the low end of the range. And our corporate cost control and margin execution remain very strong. Free cash flow plus dispositions will be above plan, mainly due to GE Capital dividends, although the cash metrics remain on track. And we're increasing the buyback from $18 billion to $22 billion, and this makes the total cash return to investors $30 billion for the year, ahead of plan. So in a time of volatility, the GE model is performing. 
Finally, let me reflect on the company's earnings going forward. When we launched the Capital repositioning in April of 2015, we established the goal of $2 EPS by 2018. Since then, our outlook for Oil & Gas has worsened, and foreign exchange has hurt most global companies, and GE is no exception. At the same time, the rest of GE is performing well, and we see that continuing in the future. And we should be even better than our original plan for buyback, and Alstom continues to perform at or above plan. 
Going forward, we plan to drive out more costs in supply chain, program spend around product launches and corporate. And we will continue to grow our funding on digital transformation. Incremental leverage exists with the idea of pushing beyond our goals. We'll give you our 2017 outlook in December. But all of our metrics for compensation purposes will continue to be linked to $2 of EPS in 2018. We're aligned with investors. 
Matt, back over to you for questions."

It earned $64 million in the quarter. It's delivering on all the Alstom synergies that we talked about of delivering. And then you have the Power Conversion businesses, which has a higher concentration in Oil & Gas historically than the balance of Energy Connections. That part of that -- of the Power Conversion business has been enormously challenged. We've replaced a lot of that volume with Renewables volume. The Renewables volume is not as profitable as what we're doing in Oil & Gas. And so Power Conversion has been a challenge. We've been breakeven to lose a little bit of money here through the first 3 quarters. And then that leaves you with our legacy Industrial Solutions business, which had a reasonably -- a good orders quarter -- I mentioned in earlier, up 6% on orders in the North American market, that feels like it was down 4%. But on execution and revenue in the quarter was less than what we expected it to deliver. That business ought to earn between $100 million and $140 million a year. The Power Conversion business, until oil turns around, I think it's going to be a little bit of a challenge. And we have a good outlook for our Grid business. So when we think about 2017, we expect the Energy Connections business to be a meaningful contributor to earnings growth when we move from this year to next."

And the fact that kind of underlying Alstom orders that will play out in kind of '17 and beyond are actually quite strong as well. So I view orders as being kind of more or less in line with our expectations as a buildup for what we have to do in '17 and '18.

So those were the main -- those are the main components. And then what I would add to that, Jeff, is just a context of driving corporate cost lower, continuing to work hard on supply -- incremental opportunities on supply chain that we see and accelerating progress in gross margins. So I think the way you got to think about it is incremental intensity around cost that we see in our line of sight could sustain good growth on our industrial portfolio. Some of the FX headwind we've seen should come back to us over the next few years, just by the way the contracts are written. Buyback at or ahead of plan, and that realizes the context for an Oil & Gas business that we're executing well, but we're trying to be prudent about how we think about it over the next couple of years."

Although when the volume comes back, it will absolutely be there. There -- I think Lorenzo and the team would say there are additional incremental cost actions we're going to continue to work into 2017. I think you're right. I think the depth of which you can continue to cut cost is somewhat limited, but there is still incremental additional actions that the team can take. I think our comment on more cost actions generally is more of a statement across the entirety of the company given what's happened in Oil & Gas around program cost, structure, corporate.

We think we've -- between us and LM, we've got good technology that can really innovate in the industry. And what we saw on Avio is we are able to keep the non-GE base in Avio. And we think we can do the same thing with LM. Lastly, your question, it really bolsters us in China and India and lot of the emerging markets where we see growth potential for us in the future. So we look at it is as a reasonably low-risk investment where a lot of the leverage are in our control. And we have, I think, a disproportionate upside if we execute well."

The $4 billion extra this year, that's not a pull-forward from next year, we're still looking at $14 billion, $15 billion, for next year. But my primary question is on the margin side, obviously, good news on gross margins, good news from price cost. But what's driving the SG&A inflation? Because it's about 150 bps of higher SG&A. So if you can just address those 2 questions."

So first on buyback, let me be absolutely clear. The $4 billion buyback is an increase to the model we gave you that went through 2018, that we're buying $4 billion more stock than we said we would when we gave you the plan through 2018, okay? On SG",194,"Okay. So first on buyback, let me be absolutely clear. The $4 billion buyback is an increase to the model we gave you that went through 2018, that we're buying $4 billion more stock than we said we would when we gave you the plan through 2018, okay? On SG&A, so in the third quarter, structural SG&A was up 1%. That was 12.6% of sales. Third quarter year-to-date, we're actually down 4%, about 13% of sales. It was a bit of a drag in the quarter, partly because SG&A was up 1% and volume was essentially down slightly on a calculation basis. So it ended up being about a 10 basis point drag in the quarter. Other inflation that sits in the other line is associated with inflation on base cost. And most of that is EOP. There's other indirect expenses that also incur inflation, and that's what you see on that line. Other inflation, ex FX, if you take out the impact of FX and some of those marks go through the other line in that walk, was a negative 60 basis points as opposed to what we showed you in the walk."

I think we plan to have a solid Q4 and wrap up a really solid 2016. Looking forward, I think we're being realistic about the environment and the resource sector and Oil & Gas. But don't be mistaken, we still think this is a core GE business and one where our team is managing it extremely well through the cycle. The rest of GE is executing very well. Alstom remains on track in '17 and '18. The buyback is ahead of plan. We've got a really good line of sight to incrementally take more cost out of the company and be even more efficient. And all of our compensation plans, whether it's the long-term incentive plan or the AIP, which is our annual IC Plan, all tie to the bridge that we showed you in 2015 and where we march in '16, '17, '18. So we're aligned with investors, Matt. And we're -- I think we're quite confident in the performance of the company."
