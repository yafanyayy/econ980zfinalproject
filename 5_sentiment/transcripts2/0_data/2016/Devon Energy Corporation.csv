As we all know, 2015 provided an extremely challenging business environment for our industry.

As we all know, 2015 provided an extremely challenging business environment for our industry. We responded during the year by proactively taking steps to align our business with these conditions by reducing field level costs by $400 million, delivering efficiencies and cost savings reduced capital requirements by $500 million, and we attained significant productivity gains and improved type curves and IP rates across all our core plays. 
As we look to 2016, our top priority in this environment is to protect the balance sheet by balancing spending requirements with available cash flow. We also see no reason to accelerate production growth into these weak markets, which has led us to take aggressive measures to reduce our capital investment by 75% year-over-year. We also have plans in place to preserve more than $1 billion of cash flow on a go-forward basis through a number of initiatives, including incremental field level cost savings, a reduction of our workforce by about 1,000 people and by adjusting the dividend rate to preserve over $300 million of cash flow. In an effort to further strengthen our balance sheet, we also have noncore divestitures underway with the intent to monetize $2 billion to $3 billion of assets during 2016.
As I've said many times, Devon is in the advantageous position having no long-cycle projects, minimal long-term contracts and nearly all of our acreage is held by production. These favorable attributes allow us to prudently adjust our 2016 capital program to balance cash flows and to protect our balance sheet, but it also gives us the ability to ramp up development activity when commodity prices rebound and to see a quick production response to that ramp when it happens. Our 2016 program -- capital program of 2016 is designed to maximize cash flow and operational continuity with activity directed toward the lowest risk and highest impact opportunities in each of Devon's core areas. This disciplined capital program is expected to maintain relatively flat oil production from Devon's core assets compared to 2015, and we're projecting only a 10% oil decline from Q4 2015 to Q4 2016. This production resiliency is a testament to the quality of our go-forward assets. Overall, top line production in 2016 from core assets is expected to decline by 6%, driven by lower gas volumes. The efficiency of our 2016 budget is also highlighted by our ability to fund our capital program at today's strip pricing within operational cash flow, EnLink distributions and expected Access Pipeline proceeds. Once again, we have the flexibility to ramp up spending or to make additional cuts to our spending plans, depending upon how commodity prices trend going forward. As I mentioned earlier, in addition to balancing near-term spending with cash inflows, we are also working to improve our financial position through the monetization of $2 billion, to $3 billion of assets. We are in the latter stages of discussions for the sale of our 50% interest in Access Pipeline and expect that transaction to occur in the first half of the year, potentially the first quarter. 
We are also in the process of opening data room for the sale of up to 80,000 BOE per day of noncore upstream assets in the U.S. The properties up for sale include 15,000 net undeveloped acres in Martin County, Texas and producing assets in the Southern Midland Wolfcamp, Carthage, Granite Wash and Mississippian Lime plays. We have had direct contact from potential buyers ranging from majors to well-capitalized firms to private equity firms.
We believe these assets are substantially higher quality considered investment by others and are in the market quicker. This gives us a competitive edge. Conversations, thus far, have been encouraging, and we have confidence in our ability to attractively sell these assets throughout 2016 and use the upstream assets sale proceeds for debt retirements. 
Looking at our financial flexibility longer term, if commodity prices remain low, Devon has significant balance sheet strength to withstand an extended downturn. Pro forma for the acquisition, which closed in early January, we had $3.9 billion of liquidity at year-end consisting of $1.5 billion of cash and $2.4 billion of capacity on our senior credit facility. Importantly, this credit facility does not mature until the end of 2019 and contains only 1 material financial covenant, a debt-to-capitalization ratio below 65%. At year-end, this ratio was only 24%. In addition to our strong liquidity, we've done a good job managing our upcoming debt maturities with no significant debt coming due until December 2018. Bottom line, our advantage capital structure provides us a significant amount of financial strength and flexibility. 
So in summary, I hope you come away with 3 important messages today. First, we are committed to living within cash flows in 2016. To do so, we have taken aggressive measures to preserve more than $1 billion of cash flow through operating costs and dividend reductions. Second, we have the financial strength to withstand an extended downturn, and we're looking to further bolster our investment grade balance sheet with ongoing asset divestiture programs. And lastly, the quality, depth and diversification of our go-forward asset base is unmatched. Devon has exposure to some of the best short-cycle projects in the world. We are well positioned to accelerate activity when the markets reward growth again.
With that, will turn the call back to Howard for Q&A."

But that's -- we did make that assumption that's in there higher depending on how everything goes. I think there's really a misperception of the market about the quality of these assets to be quite honest with everybody. These are very high quality assets. You may remember that we did a noncore divestiture program about a 1.5 years ago after we acquired Southern, and that was really what we would consider assets that were towards the bottom of the barrel, I'd say, as far as asset quality. These are high-quality assets, and the feedback that we have received from the market, thus far, is very positive regarding the quality of these assets, the ability to transact these assets at the prices that we have assumed here.

So we have the ability to flex our capital down, and we have the ability to flex our capital back up very quickly. We have maintained, despite the employee we're reduction going through right now, very important to us to maintain organizational capacity to flex our program back up should we see encouragement in prices. We just don't think it makes a lot of sense to accelerate production into a 30 and 2 price environment currently. But if we set see some encouragement, we have the organizational capacity, we will have the service companies lined up where we can quickly accelerate this, and then we'll be in our commensurate adjustment in our production guidance. We have extremely high quality projects. There's no question about that. We're just showing financial the appropriate financial behavior here, given where prices are currently.

When you get into the SAGD portion of the inventory there, we think we have the top tier asset in the play, and we would probably be the last company to have the stress on us from a profitability or immediate cash flow projection. You look at our capital demands for 2016, it's minor. It's minor in 2016, so we've got a lot of flexibility. There may be month to month that we have a neutral cash flow in the SAGD operation but again, we probably have the best project there. I guess when I go back and start looking at our ability to grow oil, it's more, we've got the most flexibility and more immediate impact will be in the U.S. side of the business there. We've got the best inventory our access to the best inventory in the Delaware Basin and STACK in the Eagle Ford. So we're ready to ramp up. We got a deep inventory.

I think the work that we're continuing is really a follow-up to the good work that the Phoenix team was doing. They really focused on the optimal landing zone in each of these Meramec intervals. A lot of detail in concern about maintaining the largest amount of drilled across the interval there. We continue to advance the completion designs. We're pumping about 2500 to 2700 pounds per lateral foot, so we're loading these completions up with a lot of sand. We're using majority of our fluid as a slick water-based fluid with some cross-link on that, so we're experimenting with the -- we're experimenting with the fluid type there.

And we've got Fitch having been concluded their rating currently at BBB+ and also stable. So we've got 2 solid investment grade positions there, which pretty much assures us as an investment grade company. Moody's is a different story. I think you're aware of that as well as others listening that they're debating what they're going to do. There are a lot of moving parts in there. And quite frankly, it's hard for us, I think, anybody at this point in time to tell exactly what they are going to do with this proved. They already made it position on the noninvestment grade group, which resulted in multiple notch downgrades. They've taken a very low price deck kind of view of not really rating through the cycle but rating closer to the bottom of the cycle, and they're shifting how they're thinking about investment grade. So on a historic model, I feel pretty comfortable that we would be okay. It's just very difficult at this point in time to tell exactly how they are going to recalibrate what they consider to be investment grade, and that decision-making process is in play as we speak and probably concluding before the end of the month. So wish I could give you a more firm answer on that. I think the decisions that we've taken here, while they were really primarily targeted at the business, not the rating agencies, are also credit-enhancing and should be confidence-inspiring to the agencies. And that's the best we think we can do is to really focus in the business and let the rating agency portion fall where it falls.

There's nothing in our public debt or indentures that would occur if that is the case.

Our revolver has got a lot of term into. We're out into '19 where it terms up a lot of it's going to happen between now in that point in time have to renegotiate now are going to be dealing with a totally different environment.

The bondholders that I've spoken to are equally confused by this and don't know necessarily how exactly it's going to shake out. We don't think in our portfolio level but there's a lot that will be dependent on Moody's, but there potentially selling bonds for those investors who require a Moody's and an S&P rating both the whole deck, so that could also be another impact.

We had very little trouble time all that is accelerated our time to TD. We're getting better wells completed because of the focus on that detail. So we'll continue that.

It's because we have a flexibility to do that and this current 30 and 2 price environment, but we have the ability to ramp that capital back up just as quickly and bring production back just as quickly should we see encouragement on the commodity price environment.

266510,324401361,934883,"Devon Energy Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2016",2016-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Devon Energy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Howard, and welcome, everyone.

As we all know, 2015 provided an extremely challenging business environment for our industry. We responded during the year by proactively taking steps to align our business with these conditions by reducing field-level costs by $400 million, delivering efficiencies and cost savings that reduced capital requirements by $500 million. And we attained significant productivity gains and improved type curves and IP rates across all our core plays. 
As we look to 2016, our top priority in this environment is to protect the balance sheet by balancing spending requirements with available cash flow. We also see no reason to accelerate production growth into these weak markets, which has led us to take aggressive measures to reduce our capital investment by 75% year-over-year. 
We also have plans in place to preserve more than $1 billion of cash flow on a go-forward basis through a number of initiatives, including incremental field-level cost savings, a reduction of our workforce by about 1,000 people and, by adjusting the dividend rate, preserve over $300 million of cash flow. In an effort to further strengthen our balance sheet, we also have noncore divestitures underway with the intent to monetize $2 billion to $3 billion of assets during 2016.
As I have said many times, Devon is in the advantageous position of having no long-cycle projects, minimal long-term contracts, and nearly all of our acreage is held by production. These favorable attributes allow us to prudently adjust our 2016 capital program to balance cash flows and to protect our balance sheet, but it also gives us the ability to ramp up development activity when commodity prices rebound and to see a quick production response to that ramp when it happens. 
Our 2016 program in -- capital program in 2016 is designed to maximize cash flow and operational continuity with activity directed toward the lowest-risk and highest-impact opportunities in each of Devon's core areas. This disciplined capital program is expected to maintain relatively flat oil production from Devon's core assets compared to 2015, and we're projecting only a 10% oil decline from Q4 2015 to Q4 2016. 
This production resiliency is a testament to the quality of our go-forward assets. Overall, top line production in 2016 from core assets is expected to decline by 6% driven by lower gas volumes. 
The efficiency of our 2016 budget is also highlighted by our ability to fund our capital program at today's strip pricing within operational cash flow, EnLink distributions and expected Access Pipeline proceeds. Once again, we have the flexibility to ramp up spending or to make additional cuts to our spending plans depending upon how commodity prices trend going forward. 
As I mentioned earlier, in addition to balancing near-term spending with cash inflows, we are also working to improve our financial position through the monetization of $2 billion to $3 billion of assets. We are in the latter stages of discussions for the sale of our 50% interest in Access Pipeline and expect that transaction to occur in the first half of the year, potentially the first quarter. 
We are also in the process of opening data room for the sale of up to 80,000 BOE per day of noncore upstream assets in the U.S. The properties up for sale include 15,000 net undeveloped acres in Martin County, Texas and producing assets in the Southern Midland Wolfcamp, Carthage, Granite Wash and Mississippian Lime plays. We have had direct contact from potential buyers ranging from majors to well-capitalized peers to private equity firms.
We believe these assets are substantially higher-quality than those being considered for divestment by others and are in the market quicker. This gives us a competitive edge. Conversations thus far have been encouraging, and we have confidence in our ability to attractively sell these assets throughout 2016 and use the upstream asset sale proceeds for debt retirements. 
Looking at our financial flexibility longer term. If commodity prices remain low, Devon has significant balance sheet strength to withstand an extended downturn. Pro forma for the Felix acquisition, which closed in early January, we had $3.9 billion of liquidity at year-end, consisting of $1.5 billion of cash and $2.4 billion of capacity on our senior credit facility. Importantly, this credit facility does not mature until the end of 2019 and contains only one material financial covenant: a debt-to-capitalization ratio below 65%. At year-end, this ratio was only 24%. 
In addition, our strong -- to our strong liquidity, we've done a good job managing our upcoming debt maturities with no significant debt coming due until December 2018. Bottom line, our advantaged capital structure provides us a significant amount of financial strength and flexibility. 
So in summary, I hope you come away with 3 important messages today. First, we are committed to living within cash flows in 2016. To do so, we have taken aggressive measures to preserve more than $1 billion of cash flow through operating cost and dividend reductions. Second, we have the financial strength to withstand an extended downturn, and we're looking to further bolster our investment-grade balance sheet with ongoing asset divestiture programs. And lastly, the quality, depth and diversification of our go-forward asset base is unmatched. Devon has exposure to some of the best short-cycle projects in the world. We are well positioned to accelerate activity when the markets reward growth again.
With that, I will turn the call back to Howard for Q&A."

I think there's really a misperception in the market about the quality of these assets, to be quite honest with everybody. These are very high-quality assets. You may remember that we did a noncore divestiture program about a 1.5 years ago after we acquired GeoSouthern, and that was really what we would consider assets that were towards the bottom of our barrel, I'd say, as far as asset quality. These are high-quality assets, and the feedback that we have received from the market thus far is very positive regarding the quality of these assets and the ability to transact these assets at the prices that we have assumed here. We are opening data rooms starting next week, and then soon after that, we anticipate that we'd be receiving bids here during the first half of the year and closing on this throughout the year.

It does lean closer to the private equity side from an interest level, but that's something that we had expected when we went out with the package. We're moving very quickly to try to get ahead of what we think may be further asset sales by other peers, and we're on that time line right now, going out here to open data rooms and move aggressively in early March. So we're well positioned, and it's a great package, and that's the feedback we're getting from the potential buyers. But on a scale basis, they're not seeing anything like this in the market, and a quality basis, they're not seeing anything like this in the market.

As I've been saying that we are just short-term project-oriented.

So we have the ability to flex our capital down, and we have the ability to flex our capital back up very quickly. We have maintained -- despite the employee reduction we're going through right now, very important to us to maintain the organizational capacity to flex our program back up should we see encouragement in prices. We just don't think it makes a lot of sense to accelerate production into a $30 and $2 price environment currently. But if we see some encouragement, we have the organizational capacity, we will have the service companies lined up where we can quickly accelerate this, and then there will a commensurate adjustment in our production guidance. We have extremely high-quality projects. There's no question about that. We're just showing financial -- the appropriate financial behavior here given where prices are currently. Now I'll let Tony talk to you a little bit more about the oil sands, where that stands and where we stand on opportunities in the U.S. on the oil side, too."

So we evaluate all those wells, and we're capable of shutting in those wells when they become uneconomic on a well-by-well basis without any concern about the degradation in ultimate recoveries. When you get into the SAGD portion of the inventory there, we think we have the top-tier asset in the play, and we would probably be the last company to have the stress on us from a profitability or a cash -- immediate cash flow projection. If you look at our capital demands for 2016, it's minor. It's minor in 2016, so we've got a lot of flexibility. There may be month-to-month that we have a neutral cash flow in the SAGD operation, but again, we probably have the best project there. I guess when I go back and start looking at our ability to grow oil in -- it's more in -- we've got the most flexibility, and more immediate impact will be in the U.S. side of the business there. We've got the best inventory or access to the best inventory in the Delaware Basin and STACK and Eagle Ford. So we're ready to ramp up. We've got a deep inventory. We have all the permitting and required work done, ready for that ramp-up. So as soon as we generate additional cash flow in the company, we'll be back to work, and we'll be growing that oil base."

If we see prices, if we see the strip moving up and we have confidence that is going to continue to move up, that's when we will consider increasing activity. And again, all of our projects are short-term, so it doesn't -- we can ramp back up very, very quickly. You saw we ramped down quickly. We're going to ramp back up just as quickly. There is no issue there. We just feel that we are being prudent given the current commodity price environment. And where would we ramp up? Tony, I think, answered it. There's 3 areas that really have strong economics for us. Those are the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin and the STACK play. And we'd be looking at all 3 of those plays, see where we'd put the rigs, but they all would have fairly similar economics and strong economics."

All those really were above our type curve. In fact, only on the majority of those wells that we continue the Felix operations. The wells were not only high rate, but they're also about 60% oil, so it's above our overall modeling that we had done previously. I think the work that we're continuing is really a follow-up to the good work that the Felix team was doing. They have really focused on the optimal landing zone in each of these Meramec intervals, a lot of detail and concern about maintaining the largest amount of footage drilled and the porosity interval there. We continue to advance the completion designs. We're pumping about 2,500 to 2,700 pounds per lateral foot, so we're loading these completions up with a lot of sand. We're using majority of our fluid as a slickwater-based fluid with some crosslinked gel in that. So we're experimenting with the fluid type there. So I think all that combined is just leading to improved completions well to well.

We -- obviously, at the end of the year, you go before the agencies to give them your year-end results and talk about the reserve profile within the company. So we've been through that exercise with all them. You've seen the results of that, so let me start with that. So S&P has taken us in BBB, and that's a stable position. And we've got Fitch, having concluded their rating, currently at BBB+ and also stable. So we've got 2 solid investment-grade positions there, which pretty much assures us as an investment-grade company. Moody's is a different story. I think you're aware of that as well as others listening that they're debating what they're going to do. There are a lot of moving parts there. And quite frankly, it's hard for us or, I think, anybody at this point in time to tell exactly what they are going to do with this group. They've already made their decision on the non-investment-grade group, which resulted in multiple-notch downgrades. They've taken a very low price deck kind of a view of not really rating through the cycle but rating closer to the bottom of the cycle. And they're shifting how they're thinking about investment grade. So on a historic model, I feel pretty comfortable that we would be okay. It's just very difficult at this point in time to tell exactly how they're going to recalibrate what they consider to be investment-grade, and that decision-making process is in play as we speak and probably concluding before the end of the month. So wish I could give you a more firm answer on that. I think the decisions that we've taken here, while they were really primarily targeted at the business, not the rating agencies, are also credit-enhancing and should be confidence-inspiring to the agencies. And that's the best we think we can do, is to really focus on the business and let the rating agency portion fall where it falls that -- given, of course, the fact that we want to continue to maintain our strength in investment grade and position ourselves as best as possible."

I'd also like to point out that we know, with a limited capital program, we're completely focused on the base management of our business.

And even if we had a bad result from another rating agency, our liquidity position is solid and doesn't change at all.

There's nothing in our public debt or indentures that would occur if that is the case. I think the real impact to those that this occurs to would just be access to the capital markets and primarily cost. You'd be dealing with higher costs as you tap the markets. Our revolver has got a lot of term left on it. You're out into '19 before that term's up. So a lot of it's going to happen between now and that point in time. Those who have to renegotiate now are going to be dealing with a totally different environment. And then I think the uncertainty that you're seeing at the agencies and how they approach this is going to reach into those types of negotiations. You'll have people who've got near-term debt concerns just dealing with an uncertain bank market and an uncertain capital market. The bondholders that I've spoken to are equally confused by this and don't know necessarily how exactly it's going to shake out. Some of them are -- we don't think in our portfolio, the debt holders, but there's a lot that would be dependent on Moody's. But there potentially are going to be some selling of bonds for those investors who require a Moody's and an S&P rating both to hold debt. So that could also be another impact. But just to reemphasize for Devon, Devon, really nothing would happen. If we were taken fully non-investment grade, which is not going to happen, there would be no change in our debt picture."

As you roll back about 12 months ago, we saw -- early in the year, we saw a nice improvement in the service provider deescalation component. But in the second half of the year, we saw great efficiency gains with just optimizing all of our well construction designs, optimizing our -- the execution of our wells. We had very little troubled time. All that has accelerated our time to TD. We're getting better wells completed because of the focus on that detail. So we'll continue that. And historically, we've always seen, I don't know, somewhere between a 0% and 10% efficiency gain, and I wouldn't expect anything different than that by the time we get to the end of '16."

And so it's not a question of the strength of the portfolio at this point. It's a question of, how much capital are we going to put against that strong portfolio? And I just want to emphasize one last time that we've taken capital down significantly, and we understand that. It's because we had the flexibility to do that in this current $30 and $2 price environment. But we have the ability to ramp that capital back up just as quickly and bring production back just as quickly should we see encouragement on the commodity price environment.

And so we're going to focus less on that and make sure that we make the right decisions for the business overall, for our shareholders and for our bondholders."

As we all know, 2015 provided an extremely challenging business environment for our industry. We responded during the year by proactively taking steps to align our business with these conditions by reducing field-level costs by $400 million, delivering efficiencies and cost savings that reduced capital requirements by $500 million. And we attained significant productivity gains and improved type curves and IP rates across all our core plays. 
As we look to 2016, our top priority in this environment is to protect the balance sheet by balancing spending requirements with available cash flow. We also see no reason to accelerate production growth into these weak markets, which has led us to take aggressive measures to reduce our capital investment by 75% year-over-year. 
We also have plans in place to preserve more than $1 billion of cash flow on a go-forward basis through a number of initiatives, including incremental field-level cost savings, a reduction of our workforce by about 1,000 people and by adjusting the dividend rate to preserve over $300 million of cash flow. In an effort to further strengthen our balance sheet, we also have noncore divestitures underway with the intent to monetize $2 billion to $3 billion of assets during 2016.
As I have said many times, Devon is in the advantageous position of having no long-cycle projects, minimal long-term contracts, and nearly all of our acreage is held by production. These favorable attributes allow us to prudently adjust our 2016 capital program to balance cash flows and to protect our balance sheet, but it also gives us the ability to ramp up development activity when commodity prices rebound and to see a quick production response to that ramp when it happens. 
Our 2016 program in -- capital program in 2016 is designed to maximize cash flow and operational continuity with activity directed toward the lowest-risk and highest-impact opportunities in each of Devon's core areas. This disciplined capital program is expected to maintain relatively flat oil production from Devon's core assets compared to 2015, and we're projecting only a 10% oil decline from Q4 2015 to Q4 2016. 
This production resiliency is a testament to the quality of our go-forward assets. Overall, top line production in 2016 from core assets is expected to decline by 6% driven by lower gas volumes. 
The efficiency of our 2016 budget is also highlighted by our ability to fund our capital program at today's strip pricing within operational cash flow, EnLink distributions and expected Access Pipeline proceeds. Once again, we have the flexibility to ramp up spending or to make additional cuts to our spending plans depending upon how commodity prices trend going forward. 
As I mentioned earlier, in addition to balancing near-term spending with cash inflows, we are also working to improve our financial position through the monetization of $2 billion to $3 billion of assets. We are in the latter stages of discussions for the sale of our 50% interest in Access Pipeline and expect that transaction to occur in the first half of the year, potentially the first quarter. 
We are also in the process of opening data room for the sale of up to 80,000 BOE per day of noncore upstream assets in the U.S. The properties up for sale include 15,000 net undeveloped acres in Martin County, Texas and producing assets in the Southern Midland Wolfcamp, Carthage, Granite Wash and Mississippian Lime plays. We have had direct contact from potential buyers ranging from majors to well-capitalized peers to private equity firms.
We believe these assets are substantially higher-quality than those being considered for divestment by others and are in the market quicker. This gives us a competitive edge. Conversations thus far have been encouraging, and we have confidence in our ability to attractively sell these assets throughout 2016 and use the upstream asset sale proceeds for debt retirements. 
Looking at our financial flexibility longer term. If commodity prices remain low, Devon has significant balance sheet strength to withstand an extended downturn. Pro forma for the Felix acquisition which closed in early January, we had $3.9 billion of liquidity at year-end, consisting of $1.5 billion of cash and $2.4 billion of capacity on our senior credit facility. Importantly, this credit facility does not mature until the end of 2019 and contains only one material financial covenant: a debt-to-capitalization ratio below 65%. At year-end, this ratio was only 24%. 
In addition, our strong -- to our strong liquidity, we've done a good job managing our upcoming debt maturities with no significant debt coming due until December 2018. Bottom line, our advantaged capital structure provides us a significant amount of financial strength and flexibility. 
So in summary, I hope you come away with 3 important messages today. First, we are committed to living within cash flows in 2016. To do so, we have taken aggressive measures to preserve more than $1 billion of cash flow through operating cost and dividend reductions. Second, we have the financial strength to withstand an extended downturn, and we're looking to further bolster our investment-grade balance sheet with ongoing asset divestiture programs. And lastly, the quality, depth and diversification of our go-forward asset base is unmatched. Devon has exposure to some of the best short-cycle projects in the world. We are well positioned to accelerate activity when the markets reward growth again.
With that, I will turn the call back to Howard for Q&A."

But that's -- we did make that assumption that's in there. I mean, it could actually even be higher depending on how everything goes. I think there's really a misperception in the market about the quality of these assets, to be quite honest with everybody. These are very high-quality assets. You may remember that we did a noncore divestiture program about 1.5 years ago after we acquired GeoSouthern, and that was really what we would consider assets that were towards the bottom of our barrel, I'd say, as far as asset quality. These are high-quality assets, and the feedback that we have received from the market thus far is very positive regarding the quality of these assets and the ability to transact these assets at the prices that we have assumed here. We are opening data rooms starting next week, and then soon after that, we anticipate that we'd be receiving bids here during the first half of the year and closing on these throughout the year.

It does lean closer to the private equity side from an interest level, but that's something that we had expected when we went out with the package. We're moving very quickly to try to get ahead of what we think may be further asset sales by other peers, and we're on that time line right now, going out here to open data rooms and move aggressively in early March. So we're well positioned, and it's a great package, and that's the feedback we're getting from the potential buyers.

As I've been saying that we are just short-term project-oriented. We do not have to continue investment into longer-term projects that no longer make economic sense, such as in the deepwater LNG projects, anything like that. So we have the ability to flex our capital down, and we have the ability to flex our capital back up very quickly. We have maintained -- despite the employee reduction we're going through right now, very important to us to maintain the organizational capacity to flex our program back up should we see encouragement in prices. We just don't think it makes a lot of sense to accelerate production into a $30 and $2 price environment currently. But if we see some encouragement, we have the organizational capacity, we will have the service companies lined up where we can quickly accelerate this, and then there will a commensurate adjustment in our production guidance. We have extremely high-quality projects. There's no question about that. We're just showing financial -- the appropriate financial behavior here given where prices are currently.

And Doug, just going back to your question about Canada, on the coal flow side of the business at our Bonville location, we've got a lot of flexibility there. So we evaluate all those wells, and we're capable of shutting in those wells when they become uneconomic on a well-by-well basis without any concern about the degradation in ultimate recoveries. When you get into the SAGD portion of the inventory there, we think we have the top-tier asset in the play, and we would probably be the last company to have the stress on us from a profitability or a cash -- immediate cash flow projection. If you look at our capital demands for 2016, it's minor. It's minor in 2016, so we've got a lot of flexibility. There may be month-to-month that we have a neutral cash flow in the SAGD operation, but again, we probably have the best project there. I guess when I go back and start looking at our ability to grow oil in -- it's more in -- we've got the most flexibility, and more immediate impact will be in the U.S. side of the business there. We've got the best inventory or access to the best inventory in the Delaware Basin and STACK and Eagle Ford. So we're ready to ramp up. We've got a deep inventory. We have all the permitting and required work done, ready for that ramp-up. So as soon as we generate additional cash flow in the company, we'll be back to work, and we'll be growing that oil base."

If we see prices, if we see the strip moving up and we have confidence that is going to continue to move up, that's when we will consider increasing activity. And again, all of our projects are short-term, so it doesn't -- we can ramp back up very, very quickly. You saw we ramped down quickly. We're going to ramp back up just as quickly. There is no issue there. We just feel that we are being prudent given the current commodity price environment. And where would we ramp up? Tony, I think, answered it. There's 3 areas that really have strong economics for us. Those are the Eagle Ford and the Delaware Basin and the STACK play. And we'd be looking at all 3 of those plays to see where we'd put the rigs, but they all would have fairly similar economics and strong economics."

If you look at our operating report, we commented on about 12 Devon wells that we brought on in the Meramec and another 8 that were brought -- or another 4 that were brought on in the Felix position. All those really were above our type curve. In fact, on the majority of those wells that we continued the Felix operations, the wells were not only high rate, but they're also about 60% oil, so it's above our overall modeling that we had done previously. I think the work that we're continuing is really a follow-up to the good work that the Felix team was doing. They have really focused on the optimal landing zone in each of these Meramec intervals, a lot of detail and concern about maintaining the largest amount of footage drilled and the porosity interval there. We continue to advance the completion designs. We're pumping about 2,500 to 2,700 pounds per lateral foot, so we're loading these completions up with a lot of sand. We're using -- a majority of our fluid is a slickwater-based fluid with some crosslinked gel in that. So we're experimenting with the fluid type there. So I think all that combined is just leading to improved completions well to well.

We -- obviously, at the end of the year, you go before the agencies to give them your year-end results and talk about the reserve profile within the company. So we've been through that exercise with all of them. You've seen the results of that, so let me start with that. So S&P has taken us in BBB, and that's a stable position. And we've got Fitch, having concluded their rating, currently at BBB+ and also stable. So we've got 2 solid investment-grade positions there, which pretty much assures us as an investment-grade company. Moody's is a different story. I think you're aware of that as well as others listening, that they're debating what they're going to do. There are a lot of moving parts there. And quite frankly, it's hard for us or, I think, anybody at this point in time to tell exactly what they are going to do with this group. They've already made their decision on the non-investment-grade group, which resulted in multiple-notch downgrades. They've taken a very low price deck kind of a view of not really rating through the cycle but rating closer to the bottom of the cycle. And they're shifting how they're thinking about investment grade. So on a historic model, I feel pretty comfortable that we would be okay. It's just very difficult at this point in time to tell exactly how they're going to recalibrate what they consider to be investment-grade, and that decision-making process is in play as we speak and probably concluding before the end of the month. So wish I could give you a more firm answer on that. I think the decisions that we've taken here, while they were really primarily targeted at the business, not the rating agencies, are also credit-enhancing and should be confidence-inspiring to the agencies. And that's the best we think we can do, is to really focus on the business and let the rating agency portion fall where it falls, that -- given, of course, the fact that we want to continue to maintain our strength in investment grade and position ourselves as best as possible."

They're all well-oriented projects. We don't have any long-term projects within the company. And so that gives us tremendous flexibility to decrease our capital such as we've done just now when we're in a very low commodity price environment and the ability to ramp up capital spending and see commensurate results on the production side should we get some encouragement. So we can make immediate decisions around ramping production back up. We have the projects ready. We have the permits ready. All we have to do -- we have the wells designed. All we have to do is hire the rigs and drill the wells, and then you'll see production impact anywhere from -- some would be completed immediately. Some are pad drilling and may take up to 6 months or so to see the production impact from those, but you start seeing response from higher capital spend very, very quickly for us. And Tony might even be able to fill you in with a little bit more details on that than I -- than what I just said, Arun."

And even if we had a bad result from another rating agency, our liquidity position is solid and doesn't change at all.

There's nothing in our public debt or indentures that would occur if that is the case. I think the real impact to those that this occurs to would just be access to the capital markets and primarily at cost. You'd be dealing with higher costs as you tap the markets. Our revolver has got a lot of term left on it. You're out into '19 before that term's up. So a lot of it's going to happen between now and that point in time. Those who have to renegotiate now are going to be dealing with a totally different environment. And then I think the uncertainty that you're seeing out of the agencies and how they approach this is going to reach into those types of negotiations. You'll have people who've got near-term debt concerns just dealing with an uncertain bank market and an uncertain capital market. The bondholders that I've spoken to are equally confused by this and don't know necessarily how exactly it's going to shake out. Some of them are -- we don't think in our portfolio, the debt holders, that there's a lot that would be dependent on Moody's.

As you roll back about 12 months ago, we saw -- early in the year, we saw a nice improvement in the service provider deescalation component. But in the second half of the year, we saw great efficiency gains with just optimizing all of our well construction designs, optimizing our -- the execution of our wells. We had very little troubled time. All that has accelerated our time to TD. We're getting better wells completed because of the focus on that detail. So we'll continue that.

So we think that we have 3 -- certainly 3 of the plays in our portfolio that position us with the most economic opportunities that you might find in onshore North America. And so it's not a question of the strength of the portfolio at this point. It's the question of, how much capital are we going to put against that strong portfolio? And I just want to emphasize one last time that we've taken capital down significantly, and we understand that. It's because we had the flexibility to do that in this current $30 and $2 price environment. But we have the ability to ramp that capital back up just as quickly and bring production back just as quickly should we see encouragement on the commodity price environment. So we said the first priority right now is balance sheet. That's what we're doing, and we have the ability to ramp it right back up and get back in the game."

There's no question of low commodity prices in the first quarter led to tough conditions for Devon in the industry. However, we respond to these challenges by delivering another outstanding operating performance as we continue to take the appropriate steps to deliver significant cost reductions and accelerate efficiency gains across our portfolio. These successful efforts resulted in us delivering production at the high end of our guidance, driving down both operating cost and G&A down more than 20% over year and increase in our liquidity to $4.6 billion.
This strong execution has improved our full year 2016 outlook with us raising our 2016 production targets by 3%, importantly, without any incremental capital requirements. Additionally, our cost-saving initiatives are well on our way to preserve more than $1 billion of cash flow during the year, and commodity prices are running above our base budgeting expectations.
Even with a meaningful increase in commodity prices from first quarter lows, our disciplined approach to this environment remains unchanged. Our top priority is to protect our balance sheet strength by balancing spending requirements with cash flow, and we see no compelling reason to accelerate production at these improved yet still low pricing points.
As I touched on earlier, our 2016 E&P capital program remains unchanged, and the activity we will deploy is designed to maximize cash flow generation and maintain operational continuity in our top resource plays.
For us to consider adding additional activity, we would need to make additional progress on our asset sales, have the ability to hedge at sustainably higher commodity prices and have comfort that we can secure services and supplies at rational costs. When these conditions are met, we have no shortage of attractive investment opportunities across our research-rich portfolio. 
Our core assets are concentrated in North America's best basins, and we are getting the most out of these assets with best-in-class execution that has consistently exceeded peer results through higher production rates, lower capital cost and reduced operating expenses. While there are several verticals to consider when allocating capital, it is likely that we would initially accelerate activity with our top 2 franchise assets, the STACK and Delaware Basin. Between these 2 world-class resource plays, we have access to over 1 million net acres and thousands of low-risk development opportunities that are delivering rates of return to rank among the very top of our asset portfolio. 
Another strategic imperative for Devon in 2016 is the work we are doing to improve our financial strength through the monetization of $2 billion to $3 billion of noncore assets. In April, we took an important step toward that goal with the announced sale of our Mississippian assets in Northern Oklahoma for $200 million. The daily rooms for our remaining noncore upstream assets have been open since early March, and bids are expected by the end of the second quarter. The interest in our Midland, East Texas and Granite Wash asset packages had been quite strong, and we have great confidence in our ability to sell these assets at attractive prices in 2016. 
In Canada, we're also making progress toward the sale of our 50% interest in Access pipeline. Negotiations are ongoing with discussions centered on contract-related considerations. Given the multi-decade lifespan of heavy oil assets, it is important that we judiciously work through these contractual details to ensure both parties are comfortable with those long-term relationship.
Overall, we are encouraged by the direction of these conversations, and we still expect to announce a transaction in the first half of this year.
Before we move to Q&A, I want to summarize a few key messages from today's call. Even with the recent uptick in pricing, our top priority remains unchanged. We maintain a strong balance sheet. We are committed to balancing capital requirements with cash flow and enhancing our financial strength by utilizing upstream asset sale proceeds to reduce debt.
We are laser-focused on the control -- controllable aspects of our business. This is evidenced by our outstanding operational performance in the first quarter and our continued cost control efforts. We have taken aggressive actions to position Devon not only to weather this downturn but to be positioned to take advantage of our world-class resource plays when market conditions incentivize higher activity levels. And as commodity prices recover, Devon has significant leverage to rising oil, natural gas and NGL prices. For every $1 increase in realized price on a BOE basis, Devon generates more than $200 million of incremental cash flow annually. Additionally, this $1 increase in realized price proportionally expands Devon's margins more than nearly every large producer in North America. Couple this with a catalyst-risk deleveraging of the balance sheet in the asset sales and upside from further delineation of the STACK play, Devon is extremely well positioned for a differential stock price performance.
With that, I will turn the call back to Howard for Q&A."

I think an operating report that we published last night continues to show that our results are above type curve expectations. The interesting thing about this was a lot of the rock and fluid and pressure variability across the play. In fact, the whole play is working from the far northeast to the southwest really well, but there's a lot of different characteristics of the play that are changing across that footprint. And if you look at the results that we've had just in the Devon footprint, our range of results have been very tight. Our P10 to P90 ratio is about 2.4, which is very indicative of a lower risk of element-type play. So I think as we go forward, we'll continue to see optimization of our completion designs. We're changing the fluids. We're changing the profit loads. We're changing the number of stages and tightening up on the perf cluster spacing, just like a lot of people in the industry are doing. So that will continue to optimize our results. We're also engaged in about 6 different pilots across our footprint, and 4 of those are being operated by Devon. We already have the production data coming at us on 2 of those pallets that we commented on in the operations report. It's early but the early indications are on a fairly conservative spacing on a single zone of 5 oils per section, which we're testing in We didn't see interference on the frac work that we were doing. All the well rates are coming in to the type curve, if not better. We published a little bit of information, early information, on the test, which was a staggered-type test in the Meramec and very positive there that we did not see the energy across from one interval to the next. And ultimately, that would be spaced at about 6 wells per common zone, potentially 13 and the 2 that we're testing there. We also had 2 additional pallets that will test 7 and 8 wells per section in a common interval. So I think as the data flow comes in throughout the year, we'll get more information about spacing. We're participating in some other pallets from some of our nonoperated partners in there. They all have information coming in. So really for the second half of '16, I think that spacing question will start being a lot more clear. I think you'll continue to see our performance improve as we optimize the work that we do. But right now, we're extremely pleased. And as you know, if you look at the location camp there, it's just very deep for Devon, and this will be a driver for Devon's future for a long time."

So it is -- and obviously overall, we raised our production guidance. And so overall, I'd say a very positive story. We may be seeing a slightly higher decline in Q2 than some of you may have expected, just mainly because we're such high-rate walls that we delivered, particularly in the Eagle Ford in the last half of 2015 and with the lack of completion activities here early in the year as the completion occurs in the field. But overall, it's a very positive story. I think it may just surprise a couple of people that we're taking it in the second quarter, but the good news is as commodity prices improve, hopefully in the second half of the year, given that we raised our overall guidance would be producing more than originally anticipated second half when prices will be higher.

We actually have a turnaround schedule for Jackfish 2 in the second quarter, which will account for about 10,000 BOEs or BOs per day, but if you look at the Delaware Basin and the STACK position oil production, they're essentially flat over the last portion of the year, the second half of the year. So as Dave mentioned, it's a positive story for the company. I think the -- if you look, specifically talk about the Eagle Ford, you'll notice that we had outstanding results in the second half of 2014, and that carried into Q1 of 2015 -- from second half of 2015 that carried into this first quarter of 2016 and go back and look at that the pace of activity was about 50 to 55 IDs per quarter. The number of the wells we brought on in Q1 of '16 was only 22, and that happened to be early in the quarter. So we ramped down that activity along with working network with a partner there. So the Eagle Ford has taken a larger projected to take a larger drop Q1 of '16 to Q2 of '16. But again, as we bring -- we've taken a completion holiday there as we bring completion units back into the field in the latter part of Q2, we'll see that production stabilize from Q2 through Q4 in the Eagle Ford. Month-to-month is going to be pretty cyclic, just depending on the pace of new wells that we bring on."

Now having said that, I recognize this is a show-me environment, and we understand that very well, but I reiterate our confidence in the asset sales that we are going to get of those asset sales executed without going into a tremendous amount of detail of the discussions and negotiations. We are -- we think that that is something that is working very positively, and we're confident that we're going to get those done in the time frame that we described. But that is the first priority is to make sure that we do that. After that, then there are a number of things that will factor into increasing our activities: commodity prices, capital costs, operating expenses, many more. But directionally, you could look for us to start adding incremental activity when oil prices are $50 or higher. Now that doesn't mean that we go back from the 2 operated rigs to 20 operated rigs immediately at $50. That means start adding operated rigs at that point. I said during the comments that the most likely first place that we would add the rig would be in the Delaware Basin and then the STACK play, obviously, well results are just outstanding amongst the best in the industry in both of those places. And so we would incrementally add rigs as we -- as prices increase, but it will probably take $60 oil or more to really get back to our capital spend level of close to $2 billion versus $1 billion for at right now, which would really, with our maintenance capital, somewhere between $1.5 billion or $2 billion, and that allow us to really flatten the production. Frankly, our #1 priority is not just flattening the production on a 6:1 conversion rate. We're much more, first, the financial strength of the balance sheet and then second, making sure that every dollar that we invest generating strong economic returns, and we included a graph on the operations report that gives you feel that again we have some of that not only in some of the best plays in onshore North America, but we're in the heart of some of the best plays. We're in the core of the core of these plays. We certainly have we think is good of an economic opportunity is anybody out there but again, first, it's going to take the asset sales; second, starting rigs at 50, again, at small increment and continue to ramp up as prices increase into our strong place."

The footprint -- again, when you look at the all the attributes of the STACK play, the project is working all across the play, but the attributes that describe the subsurface are drastically changing. The rock composition changes from the northwest to the southeast. The pressure gradient is -- for the whole play is largely overpressure. It does tend to increase in pressure as you go through the southwestern portion of the field. And then as you move from the northeast to the southwest, you've got a changing fluid composition. All that's working across the field. If you look at ours, we're seeing type curve type results very consistently. I think the best completion we brought on this quarter was about 2100 BOEs per day, so we're feeling pretty good about that. We find that the sweet spot that we've identified in our operating report for the STACK play has got the best combination of all of those attributes, which incorporate depth and cost to complete, so we think that's going to be the high return portion of the development right now."

And I think if you look at the pressure distribution across the footprint there, I think it's a gradational map, if you take an isobar map of that, it's nothing where you go from normal pressure to high pressure in a short distance. It's just a gradual trend from east to west. So I think that's being incorporated. You'll handle that with 3 string design in the Western side of the field on the shallow and east side of the field you will handle it with as few string designs on a cheaper activity on the east and the west, but it's nothing that, I think, some terms of the future development concept."

That's not really the issue. The issue is more just how productive are each of these zones, what spacing can you do in each of these zones and conceptually, just broaden the discussion just a little bit to give you guys an idea what we're doing both in the STACK play and the Delaware Basin. We have so many zones of STACK play in there and in both of these areas we are conducting as many of these pilots as we can early on to assess how to properly develop these areas. It would be really easy right now to just skip the pilots, go in, drill everything on 4 wells per section in 1 zone, produce wells with great rates of returns and then wake up 3 years from now and you've blown through your inventory. That's not what we're doing. We are taking a much more thoughtful approach of understanding the productivity and the spacing in each of these zones so that we can develop each of these areas rather than what may be in this, and I'm talking very conceptually here what may be instead of 4 to 5 wells per section in a single zone when you could have many more wells per section, perhaps 20, 25, 30 wells per section after you understand the proper spacing of each of these -- in each of these intervals and how many of these you can develop within the same area. And so that's why we think it's appropriate at this time of lower activities really do the spacing tests and really understand because it has a huge impact on the ultimate resources going to be recovered in each of these plays and on the value associated with each of these plays. And so that's conceptually where we're trying to go with all these tests."

I don't think any of us have an absolute answer as to what the implications of that are, but it's just something I can say with great confidence that we'd be assessing very carefully to make sure that we are producing still strong returns on these outstanding assets that we have.

I'm not sure how this goes, but we will have to watch that. But so far, across the play, we've been highly encouraged, and I'll tell you that the one anomaly that you've seen has been really testing the far southwest portion of the Meramec there. We've seen oil content is much higher than what we see in the Cana-Woodford, which really we haven't talked much about our legacy acreage position in the Woodford, but that really sets that whole couple of hundred thousand acres of ours for prospective higher-yield production in the future. So really it's a positive story for the play and, specifically, for our footprint."

I can tell you, so far, that we're -- that we have been working with a party for quite some time, and we have had additional interest from some other parties as well, so we're very optimistic about where we stand in the overall process with this. It's just a lot of things you have to make sure you get right and also, we also have beyond the tariffs associated with Jackfish itself right now, we obviously have another project setting up there in the pipe project that we think is as high-quality as of the Jackfish project. this is a project we haven't sanctioned yet, but it's something that perhaps we consider strongly sanctioned in a more normalized commodity price environment. So that has some bearing on the associated tariffs on that on how that would be valued by the potential purchasers. So there's -- we're working through all those type things, but I can tell you, discussions are going extremely well on multiple fronts right now. And so you're never done until you're done, and it's obviously more than just dotting an I and crossing a T, I would say.

And that's to help underpin the cash flows of the company to give us around the capital spend that we can execute. Now we have -- in historical years, with the exception of coming into 2016 but many other years, we had a very, very successful hedging program. In 2015, as you know, we had over -- well over $2 billion of hedge gains. And so it's a program that's worked very well. We have added some very attractive Q2 gas hedges now. We have more than 30% of our expected production hedged at around 2 69 per MCF. And for the remainder of 2016, more than 25% of our oil production is protected primarily through collars with a weighted average ceiling price of 44 and a protected around $39. So we're going to add, on an opportunistic basis, throughout 2016 hedges where we see appropriate. I can also tell you that we have recently implemented a change over to a certain level of the hedging program, not the entire program but the base level of our hedging program on a more programmatic basis where we will enter in a level of hedges each quarter, and we'll probably hedge forward as far as 6 quarters and do it on a consistent programmatic basis, but will still have -- a good portion of the program that's going to be done more in an opportunistic basis as we have historically done a swell with the overall target to be around 50% hedged as we enter in any given year."

However, that demand is starting to increase as you bring on additional petrochemical plants in we continue to add export capacity by water. That has increased in the last 3 years from about 200,000 barrels a day of export capacity up to about pretty close to 1 million barrels a day. By the end of this year, early next year, we'll have added another 250,000 barrels a day export capacity on the water. About half of that is propane, butane gasolines. About half of that is ethane.

There's no question that low commodity prices in the first quarter led to tough conditions for Devon in the industry. However, we responded to these challenges by delivering another outstanding operating performance as we continue to take the appropriate steps to deliver significant cost reductions and accelerate efficiency gains across our portfolio. These successful efforts resulted in us delivering production at the high end of our guidance, driving down both operating costs and G&A down more than 20% over year and increasing our liquidity to $4.6 billion.
This strong execution has improved our full year 2016 outlook, with us raising our 2016 production targets by 3%, importantly, without any incremental capital requirements. Additionally, our cost-saving initiatives are well on their way to preserve more than $1 billion of cash flow during the year, and commodity prices are running above our base budgeting expectations.
Even with a meaningful increase in commodity prices from first quarter lows, our disciplined approach to this environment remains unchanged. Our top priority is to protect our balance sheet strength by balancing spending requirements with cash flow, and we see no compelling reason to accelerate production at these improved yet still low pricing points.
As I touched on earlier, our 2016 E&P capital program remains unchanged, and the activity, we will deploy, is designed to maximize cash flow generation and maintain operational continuity in our top resource plays.
For us to consider adding additional activity, we would need to make additional progress on our asset sales, have the ability to hedge at sustainably higher commodity prices and have comfort that we can secure services and supplies at rational costs. When these conditions are met, we have no shortage of attractive investment opportunities across our resource-rich portfolio. 
Our core assets are concentrated in North America's best basins, and we are getting the most out of these assets with best-in-class execution that has consistently exceeded peer results through higher production rates, lower capital cost and reduced operating expenses. While there are several verticals to consider when allocating capital, it is likely that we would initially accelerate activity with our top 2 franchise assets, the STACK and Delaware Basin. Between these 2 world-class resource plays, we have access to over 1 million net acres and thousands of low-risk development opportunities that are delivering the rates of return to rank among the very top of our asset portfolio. 
Another strategic imperative for Devon in 2016 is the work we are doing to improve our financial strength through the monetization of $2 billion to $3 billion of noncore assets. In April, we took an important step towards that goal, with the announced sale of our Mississippian assets in Northern Oklahoma for $200 million. The data rooms for our remaining noncore upstream assets have been open since early March, and bids are expected by the end of the second quarter. The interest in our Midland, East Texas and Granite Wash asset packages had been quite strong, and we have great confidence in our ability to sell these assets at attractive prices in 2016. 
In Canada, we're also making progress toward the sale of our 50% interest in Access Pipeline. Negotiations are ongoing with discussions centered on contract-related considerations. Given the multi-decade lifespan of heavy oil assets, it is important that we judiciously work through these contractual details to ensure both parties are comfortable with those long-term relationship.
Overall, we are encouraged by the direction of these conversations, and we still expect to announce a transaction in the first half of this year.
Before we move to Q&A, I want to summarize a few key messages from today's call. Even with the recent uptick in pricing, our top priority remains unchanged. To maintain a strong balance sheet. We are committed to balancing capital requirements with cash flow and enhancing our financial strengths by utilizing upstream asset sale proceeds to reduce debt.
We are laser focused on the control -- controllable aspects of our business. This is evidenced by our outstanding operational performance in the first quarter and our continued cost control efforts. We have taken aggressive actions to position Devon not only to weather this downturn but to be positioned to take advantage of our world-class resource plays when market conditions incentivize higher activity levels. And as commodity prices recover, Devon has significant leverage to rising oil, natural gas and NGL prices. For every $1 increase in realized price on a BOE basis, Devon generates more than $200 million of incremental cash flow annually. Additionally, this $1 increase in realized price proportionally expands Devon's margins more than nearly every large producer in North America. Couple this with the catalyst-risk deleveraging of the balance sheet in the asset sales and upside from further delineation of the STACK play, Devon is extremely well positioned for differential stock price performance.
With that, I will turn the call back to Howard for Q&A."

I think in the operating report that we published last night continues to show that our results are above type curve expectations. The interesting thing about this was a lot of the rock and fluid and pressure variability across the play. In fact, the whole play is working from the far northeast to the southwest really well, but there's a lot of different characteristics of the play that are changing across that footprint. And if you look at the results that we've had just in Devon footprint, our range of results have been very tight. Our P10 to P90 ratio is about 2.4, which is very indicative of a lower risk of element-type play. So I think as we go forward, we'll continue to see optimization of our completion designs. We're changing the fluids. We're changing the profit loads. We're changing the number of stages and tightening up on the perf cluster spacing, just like a lot of people in the industry are doing. So that will continue to optimize our results. We're also engaged in about 6 different pilots across our footprint, and 4 of those are being operated by Devon. We already have the production data coming at us on 2 of those pilots that we commented on in the operations report. It's early, but the early indications are on a fairly conservative spacing on a single zone of 5 wells per section, which we're testing in the Alma. We didn't see interference on the frac work that we were doing. All the well rates are coming in to the type curve, if not better. We published a little bit of information, early information, on the Born Free test, which was a staggered-type test in the Meramec, and very positive there that we did not see the energy across from one interval to the next. And ultimately, that would be spaced at about 6 wells per common zone, potentially 13 and the 2 that we're testing there. We also had 2 additional pilots that will test 7 and 8 wells per section in a common interval. So I think as the data flow comes in throughout the year, we'll get more information about spacing. We're participating in some other pilots from some of our nonoperated partners there. They'll have the information coming in. So really for the second half of '16, I think that spacing question will start being a lot more clear. I think you'll continue to see our performance improve as we optimize the work that we do. But right now, we're extremely pleased. And as you know, if you look at the location camp there, it's just very deep for Devon, and this will be a driver for Devon's future for a long time."

So it is a -- and obviously overall, we raised our production guidance. And so overall, I'd say a very positive story. We may be seeing a slightly higher decline in Q2 than some of you may have expected, just mainly because we're such high-rate wells that we delivered, particularly in the Eagle Ford in the last half of 2015 and with the lack of completion activity here earlier in the year as the completion crews left the field. But overall, it's a very positive story. I think it may just surprise a couple of people that we're taking it in the second quarter, but the good news is as commodity prices improve, hopefully in the second half of the year, given that we raised our overall guidance we'll be producing more than what was originally anticipated second half when prices will be higher.

So as Dave mentioned, it's a positive story for the company. I think the -- if you look and specifically talk about the Eagle Ford, you'll notice that we had outstanding results in the second half of 2014, and that carried into Q1 of 2015 -- second half of 2015 that carried into this first quarter of 2016 and as you go back and look at that pace of activity was about 50 to 55 IDs per quarter. The number of the wells we brought on in Q1 of '16 was only 22, and that happened to be early in the quarter. So we ramped down the activity along with working -- that work with a partner there. So the Eagle Ford has taken a larger -- projected to take a larger drop from Q1 of '16 to Q2 of '16. But again, as we bring -- we've taken a completion holiday there as we bring completion units back into the field in the latter part of Q2.

We are -- we think that that is something that is working very positively, and we're confident that we're going to get those done in the time frame that we described. But that is -- the first priority is to make sure that we do that. After that, then there are a number of things we'll factor into increasing our activities: commodity prices; capital costs; operating expenses; many more. But directionally, you could look for us to start adding incremental activity when oil prices are $50 or higher. Now that doesn't mean we go back from the 2 operated rigs to 20 operated rigs immediately at $50. That means we would start adding operated rigs at that point. I said during the comments that the most likely first place that we would add the rig would be in the Delaware Basin and then the STACK play, where obviously, well results are just outstanding amongst the best in the industry in both of those places. And so we would incrementally add rigs as we -- as prices increase, but it will probably take $60 oil or more to really get back to a capital spend level close to $2 billion versus $1 billion where we're at right now, which would really, with our maintenance capital, sitting somewhere between $1.5 billion or $2 billion. That would allow us to really flatten the production although. Frankly, we're not -- our #1 priority is not just flattening the production on a 6:1 conversion rate. We're much more interested in the first, the financial strength of the balance sheet. And then second, making sure that every dollar that we invest is generating strong economic returns, and we included a graph in the operations report that gives you a feel that again, we have some of the not only are we in some of the best plays in onshore North America, but we're in the heart of some of the best plays. We're in the core of the core of these plays. so we certainly have, we think is good of an economic opportunity as anybody out there but again, first, it's going to take the asset sales; second, starting adding rigs at 50, again, a small increment and continue to ramp up as prices increase into our strong place."

I guess, if I had to characterize the results that we're seeing, they're very consistent, but if you look at our type curve of about that 1,300 to 1,500. We brought on about 5 operated wells and 5 nonoperated wells. All of those are at the type curve or better. The footprint -- again, when we look at all the attributes of the STACK play, the project is working all across the play, but the attributes that describe the subsurface are drastically changing. And the rock composition changes from the northwest to the southeast. The pressure gradient is -- for the whole play is largely overpressured. It does tend to increase in pressure as you go to the southwestern portion of the field. And then as you move from the northeast to the southwest, you've got a changing fluid composition. All that's working across the field. If you look at ours, we're seeing type curve type results very consistently. I think the best completion we brought on this quarter was about 2,100 BOEs per day, so we're feeling pretty good about that. We find that the sweet spot that we've identified in our operating report for the STACK play has got the best combination of all those attributes, which incorporate depth and cost to complete. So we think that's going to be the high return portion of the development right now."

One of the things we tried to clarify by including a map and the operations report is that it's a gradational amount of overpressure throughout the play. And there's a map, I think, on Page 7 that shows it very clearly that essentially all of our acreage is located in the overpressure part of the play. It's just the degree to which it is overpressured, and the degree to which its overpressured increases as you move from northeast to southwest. Now as you move further to the northeast in our acreage position, you get more into the normal pressured oil window. That worked too. I think, frankly, Newfield has had some good results up there as well and very economic results, but essentially all of our acreage is in the overpressured part of the window. It's just the degree to which it's overpressured. So if you look at that map, I think that's helpful."

So we have now incorporated the staggered approach into the Lower Eagle Ford, and results will be coming in on the 25 wells in the next couple of quarters, but early indications are that's extremely favorable. So we're seeing reservoir pressures would indicate that we're not seeing interference or influence from each of those wells. One thing that we're going to be testing in the last 3 quarters of this year will be how to incorporate the upper Eagle Ford shale into that development, and there's not a lot of shale barriers between that upper Eagle Ford and the Lower Eagle Ford section, so we're encouraged and I believe BHP is going to be supportive of this work as to pilot the upper Eagle Ford shale completion along with our staggered approach in the Lower Eagle Ford. And that will be what we think will be ultimately the design that we will go forward for the remaining development of the resource base."

We continue to refine that with the new data. I think the guys are very comfortable seeing 5 individual potential landing zones, 3 of those in the upper Meramec, 2 in the lower. I think the technical teams are very confident with that. A lot of the data to date has been in what we call the Meramec 200, with some data in the Meramec 300. We think we had that well understood. The portions that I think, us and industry are needing to appraise would be the very upper member of the Meramec, what we call the Meramec 100 and also the lowest member in the lower Meramec, which is the Meramec 500. And I think if you look at the pressure distribution across the footprint there, I think it's a gradational map. If you take an isobar map of that, it's nothing where you go from normal pressure to high pressure in a short distance. It's just the gradual trend from east to west. So I think that's being incorporated. You'll handle that with 3-strain design on the Western side of the field, on the shallow and east side of the field you'll handle with a 2-strain designs so it'll be a little cheaper activity on the east and the west, but it's nothing that, I think, onerous in terms of the future development concept."

That's not really the issue. The issue is more just how productive are each of these zones, what spacing can you do in each of these zones and conceptually, if I can just broaden the discussion just a little bit to give you guys an idea what we're doing both in the STACK play and the Delaware Basin. We have so many zones of STACK play in there, in both of these areas. We are conducting as many of these pilots as we can early on to assess how to properly develop these areas. It would be really easy right now to just skip the pilots, go in, drill everything on 4 wells per section in 1 zone, produce wells with great rates of returns and then wake up 3 years from now and you've blown through your inventory. That's not what we're doing. We are taking a much more thoughtful approach of understanding the productivity and the spacing in each of these zones so that we can develop each of these areas rather than what may be in this. I'm talking very conceptually here what may be instead of 4 to 5 wells per section in a single zone, where you could have many more wells per section, perhaps 20, 25, 30 wells per section after you understand the proper spacing of each of these -- in each of these intervals and how many of these you can develop within the same area. And so that's why we think as appropriate at this time of lower activity to really do the spacing tests and really understand because it has a huge impact on the ultimate resource that's going to be recovered in each of these plays and on the value associated with each of these plays. And so that's conceptually where we're trying to go with all these tests."

It's the Second Bone Springs but in terms of well returns, it's every bit the same thing as the Second Bone Springs, and industry has done a really good job of derisking the Leonard and the Wolfcamp around us. There's been some industry spacing tests that we've got the data on that have helped us understand where we go from here. Our location camp that we commented on in the past, specifically for the Leonard, has really been directed towards the work that we see, and what we call the Leonard B zones, but the A and the C are prospective as well. Industry is actually working in the A and C and our tests that we commented on have been in the B. So there's the potential to drive the location count up, both on the risk and an unrisked basis.

We most likely would be doing that in an environment or we're not the only one that's increasing activity. The rest of the industry would as well. And so the ability to do so from the same service costs, given the great reduction that we've seen in service companies in terms of their capabilities, the availability of services and the availability of people, that becomes more challenged. So I don't think any of us have an absolute answer as to what the implications of that are, but it's just something I can say with great confidence that we'll be assessing very carefully to make sure that we are producing still strong returns on these outstanding assets that we have. So I would anticipate if we're going to increase from $1 billion to $1.5 billion, there may be some increases associated with that, but they're probably much more manageable increases. If we go up to $2 billion, we just have to see. But again, we're in as good a position as anybody in the industry. This is not a problem that's unique to Devon.

And that's to help underpin the cash flows of the company to give us confidence around the capital spend that we can execute. Now we have -- in historical years, with the exception of coming into 2016 but many other years, we had a very, very successful hedging program. In 2015, as you know, we had over -- well over $2 billion of hedge gains. And so it's a program that's worked very well. We have added some very attractive Q2 gas hedges now. We have more than 30% of our expected production hedged at around 269 per MCF. And for the remainder of 2016, more than 25% of our oil production is protected primarily through collars, with a weighted average ceiling price of $44 and are protected floor of around $39. So we're going to add, on an opportunistic basis, throughout 2016 hedges where we see appropriate. I can also tell you that we have recently implemented a change where we're going to do a certain level of our hedging program, not the entire program but a base level of our hedging program on a more programmatic basis, where we will enter in a level of hedges each quarter, and we'll probably hedge forward as far as 6 quarters and do it on a consistent programmatic basis, but it will still have a -- a good portion of the program is going to be done more on an opportunistic basis as we have historically done as well. But the overall target to be around 50% hedged as we enter in any given year."

In the macro view, we continue to see that improve, although we still think in the short term over the next few months, you're going to see a greater amount of supply and demand. However, that demand is starting to increase as we bring on additional petrochemical plants, and we continue to add export capacity by water. That has increased in the last 3 years from about 200,000 barrels a day, the export capacity up to about pretty close to a million barrels a day. By the end of this year, early next year, we'll have added another 250,000 barrels a day of export capacity on the water. About half of that is propane, butane gasolines, about half of that is ethane. So we're starting to see the export opportunities bring supply-demand back into balance. And so we think there's going to be more upward pressure on NGL products over time than we've seen in the last 1.5 years."

There's no question that low commodity prices in the first quarter led to tough conditions for Devon and the industry. However, we responded to these challenges by delivering another outstanding operating performa",821,"Thank you, Howard, and welcome, everyone. There's no question that low commodity prices in the first quarter led to tough conditions for Devon and the industry. However, we responded to these challenges by delivering another outstanding operating performance as we continue to take the appropriate steps to deliver significant cost reductions and accelerate efficiency gains across our portfolio. These successful efforts resulted in us delivering production at the high end of our guidance, driving down both operating costs and G&A down more than 20% over year [ph] and increasing our liquidity to $4.6 billion.
This strong execution has improved our full year 2016 outlook, with us raising our 2016 production targets by 3%, importantly, without any incremental capital requirements. Additionally, our cost-saving initiatives are well on their way to preserve more than $1 billion of cash flow during the year, and commodity prices are running above our base budgeting expectations.
Even with a meaningful increase in commodity prices from first quarter lows, our disciplined approach to this environment remains unchanged. Our top priority is to protect our balance sheet strength by balancing spending requirements with cash flow, and we see no compelling reason to accelerate production at these improved, yet still low, pricing points.
As I touched on earlier, our 2016 E&P capital program remains unchanged and the activity we will deploy is designed to maximize cash flow generation and maintain operational continuity in our top resource plays.
For us to consider adding additional activity, we would need to make additional progress on our asset sales, have the ability to hedge at sustainably higher commodity prices and have comfort that we can secure services and supplies at rational costs. When these conditions are met, we have no shortage of attractive investment opportunities across our resource-rich portfolio. 
Our core assets are concentrated in North America's best basins, and we are getting the most out of these assets with best-in-class execution that has consistently exceeded peer results through higher production rates, lower capital cost and reduced operating expenses. While there are several verticals to consider when allocating capital, it is likely that we would initially accelerate activity with our top 2 franchise assets, the STACK and Delaware Basin. Between these 2 world-class resource plays, we have access to over 1 million net acres and thousands of low-risk development opportunities that are delivering rates of return that rank among the very top of our asset portfolio. 
Another strategic imperative for Devon in 2016 is the work we are doing to improve our financial strength through the monetization of $2 billion to $3 billion of noncore assets. In April, we took an important step towards that goal with the announced sale of our Mississippian assets in Northern Oklahoma for $200 million. The data rooms for our remaining noncore upstream assets have been open since early March and bids are expected by the end of the second quarter. The interest in our Midland, East Texas and Granite Wash asset packages has been quite strong and we have great confidence in our ability to sell these assets at attractive prices in 2016. 
In Canada, we're also making progress toward the sale of our 50% interest in Access Pipeline. Negotiations are ongoing with discussions centered on contract-related considerations. Given the multi-decade lifespan of heavy oil assets, it is important that we judiciously work through these contractual details to ensure both parties are comfortable with this long-term relationship.
Overall, we are encouraged by the direction of these conversations, and we still expect to announce a transaction in the first half of this year.
Before we move to Q&A, I want to summarize a few key messages from today's call. Even with the recent uptick in pricing, our top priority remains unchanged, to maintain a strong balance sheet. We are committed to balancing capital requirements with cash flow and enhancing our financial strength by utilizing upstream asset sale proceeds to reduce debt.
We are laser focused on the control -- controllable aspects of our business. This is evidenced by our outstanding operational performance in the first quarter and our continued cost control efforts. We have taken aggressive actions to position Devon not only to weather this downturn but to be positioned to take advantage of our world-class resource plays when market conditions incentivize higher activity levels. And as commodity prices recover, Devon has significant leverage to rising oil, natural gas and NGL prices. For every $1 increase in realized price on a BOE basis, Devon generates more than $200 million of incremental cash flow annually. Additionally, this $1 increase in realized price proportionally expands Devon's margins more than nearly every large producer in North America. Couple this with the catalyst-risk deleveraging of the balance sheet from the asset sales and upside from further delineation of the STACK play, Devon is extremely well positioned for differential stock price performance.
With that, I will turn the call back to Howard for Q&A."

Our P10 to P90 ratio is about 2.4, which is very indicative of a lower-risk-of-element type play. So I think as we go forward, we'll continue to see optimization of our completion designs. We're changing the fluids. We're changing the proppant loads. We're changing the number of stages and tightening up on the perf cluster spacing, just like a lot of people in the industry are doing. So that will continue to optimize our results. We're also engaged in about 6 different pilots across our footprint, and 4 of those are being operated by Devon. We already have the production data coming at us on 2 of those pilots that we commented on in the operations report. It's early, but the early indications are on a fairly conservative spacing on a single zone of 5 wells per section, which we're testing in the Alma. We didn't see interference on the frac work that we were doing. All the well rates are coming in to the type curve, if not better. We published a little bit of information, early information, on the Born Free test, which was a staggered-type test in the Meramec, and very positive there that we did not see the energy across from one interval to the next. And ultimately, that would be spaced at about 6 wells per common zone, potentially 13 in the 2 that we're testing there. We also had 2 additional pilots that will test 7 and 8 wells per section in a common interval. So I think as the data flow comes in throughout the year, we'll get more information about spacing. We're participating in some other pilots from some of our non-operated partners there. They'll have information coming in. So really for the second half of '16, I think that spacing question will start being a lot more clear. I think you'll continue to see our performance improve as we optimize the work that we do. But right now, we're extremely pleased. And as you know, if you look at the location count there, it's just very deep for Devon, and this will be a driver for Devon's future for a long time."

So it is a -- and obviously overall, we raised our production guidance. And so overall, I'd say a very positive story. We may be seeing a slightly higher decline in Q2 than some of you may have expected, just mainly because we have such high-rate wells that we delivered, particularly in the Eagle Ford, in the last half of 2015, with the lack of completion activity here earlier in the year as the completion crews left the field. But overall, it's a very positive story. I think it may just surprise a couple of people that we're taking it in the second quarter, but the good news is as commodity prices improve, hopefully in the second half of the year, given that we raised our overall guidance we'd be producing more than what was originally anticipated in the second half when prices will be higher.

So as Dave mentioned, it's a positive story for the company. I think the -- if you look and specifically talk about the Eagle Ford, you'll notice that we had outstanding results in the second half of 2014, and that carried into Q1 of 2015 -- the second half of 2015 that carried into this first quarter of 2016, and as you go back and look at that pace of activity was about 50 to 55 IDs per quarter. The number of the wells we brought on in Q1 of '16 was only 22 and that happened to be early in the quarter. So we ramped down activity along with working -- that work with our partner there. So the Eagle Ford has taken a larger -- projected to take a larger drop from Q1 of '16 to Q2 of '16. But again, as we bring -- we've taken a completion holiday there, as we bring completion units back into the field in the latter part of Q2, we'll see that production stabilize from Q2 through Q4 in the Eagle Ford.

We are -- we think that, that is something that is working very positively and we're confident that we're going to get those done in the time frame that we've described. But that is the first priority is to make sure that we do that. After that, then, there are a number of things that will factor into increasing our activities: commodity prices, capital costs, operating expenses, many more. But directionally, you could look for us to start adding incremental activity when oil prices are $50 or higher. Now that doesn't mean we go back from the 2 operated rigs to 20 operated rigs immediately at $50. That means we would start adding operated rigs at that point. I said during the comments that the most likely first place that we would add the rig would be in the Delaware Basin and then the STACK play, where obviously, well results are just outstanding, amongst the best in the industry in both of those places. And so we would incrementally add rigs as we -- as prices increase, but it would probably take $60 oil or more to really get back to a capital spend level of close to $2 billion versus the $1 billion where we're at right now, which would really, with our maintenance capital sitting somewhere between $1.5 billion or $2 billion, that would allow us to flatten the production. Although, frankly, we're not -- our #1 priority is not just flattening the production on a 6:1 conversion rate. We're much more interested in first, the financial strength of the balance sheet. And then second, making sure that every dollar that we invest is generating strong economic returns, and we included a graph in the operations report that gives you a feel that again, we have some of the -- not only are we in some of the best plays in onshore North America but we're in the heart of some of the best plays. We're in the core of the core of these plays. so we certainly have, we think, as good of an economic opportunity as anybody out there. But again, first, it's going to take the asset sales; second, starting adding rigs at $50, again, a small increment then and continue to ramp up as prices increase into our strong plays."

The footprint -- again, when we look at all the attributes of the STACK play, the project is working all across the play, but the attributes that describe the subsurface are drastically changing. The rock composition changes from the northwest to the southeast. The pressure gradient is -- for the whole play is largely overpressured. It does tend to increase in pressure as you go to the southwestern portion of the field. And then as you move from the northeast to the southwest, you've got a changing fluid composition. All that's working across the field. If you look at ours, we're seeing type curve-type results very consistently. I think the best completion we brought on this quarter was about 2,100 BOEs per day, so we're feeling pretty good about that. We find that the sweet spot that we've identified in our operating report for the STACK play has got the best combination of all those attributes, which incorporate depth and cost to complete.

It's just the degree to which it is overpressured, and the degree to which its overpressured increases as you move from northeast to southwest. Now as you move further to the northeast in our acreage position, you get more into the normal-pressured oil window. That can work, too.

We continue to refine that with the new data. I think the guys are very comfortable seeing 5 individual potential landing zones, 3 of those in the upper Meramec, 2 in the lower. I think the technical teams are very confident with that. A lot of the data to date has been in what we call the Meramec 200, with some data in the Meramec 300. We think we had that well understood. The portions that, I think, us and industry are needing to appraise would be the very upper member of the Meramec, what we call the Meramec 100 and also the lowest member in the lower Meramec, which is the Meramec 500. And I think if you look at the pressure distribution across the footprint there, I think it's a gradational map. If you take an isobar map of that, it's nothing where you go from normal pressure to high pressure in a short distance. It's just a gradual trend from east to west. So I think that's being incorporated. You'll handle that with 3-strain design on the Western side of the field, on the shallow and east side of the field you'll handle it with a 2-strain design. So it'll be a little cheaper activity on the east than the west, but it's nothing that's, I think, onerous in terms of the future development concept."

That's not really the issue. The issue is more just how productive are each of these zones, what spacing can you do in each of these zones and, conceptually, if I can just broaden the discussion just a little bit to give you guys an idea what we're doing both in the STACK play and the Delaware Basin. We have so many zones of STACK play in there, in both of these areas, that we are conducting as many of these pilots as we can early on to assess how to properly develop these areas. It would be real easy right now to just skip the pilots, go in, drill everything on 4 wells per section in 1 zone, produce wells with great rates of return and then wake up 3 years from now and you've blown through your inventory. That's not what we're doing. We are taking a much more thoughtful approach of understanding the productivity and the spacing in each of these zones, so that we can develop each of these areas rather than what may be -- I'm talking very conceptually here, what may be instead of 4 to 5 wells per section in a single zone, where you could have many more wells per section, perhaps 20, 25, 30 wells per section after you understand the proper spacing of each of these -- in each of these intervals and how many of these you can develop within the same area. And so that's why we think it's appropriate at this time of lower activity to really do these spacing tests and really understand, because it has a huge impact on the ultimate resource that's going to be recovered in each of these plays and on the value associated with each of these plays. And so that's conceptually where we're trying to go with all these tests."

So in terms of scale, it probably doesn't -- it's not the same magnitude as the Second Bone Springs but in terms of well returns, it's every bit the same thing as the Second Bone Springs. And industry has done a really good job of derisking the Leonard and the Wolfcamp around us. There's been some industry spacing tests that we've got the data on that have helped us understand where we go from here. Our location camp that we've commented on in the past, specifically for the Leonard, has really been directed towards the work that we see in what we call the Leonard B zones, but the A and the C are prospective as well. Industry is actually working in the A and C and our tests that we commented on have been in the B. So there's the potential to drive the location count up, both on a risked and an unrisked basis. And again, as we start thinking about our development plans to ramp up activity, the Leonard and the Second Bone Springs will be at the top of our list in terms of incremental well returns."

And as you probably double the activity, we most likely would be doing that in an environment where we're not the only one that's increasing activity. The rest of the industry would as well. And so the ability to do so for the same service cost, given the great reduction that we've seen in service companies, in terms of their capabilities, the availability of services and the availability of people, that becomes more challenged. So I don't think any of us have an absolute answer as to what the implications of that are, but it's just something I can say with great confidence that we'd be assessing very carefully to make sure that we are producing still strong returns on these outstanding assets that we have. So I would anticipate if we're going to increase from $1 billion to $1.5 billion, there may be some increases associated with that, but they'd probably be much more manageable increases. If we go up to $2 billion, we just have to see. But again, we're in as good a position as anybody in the industry. This is not a problem that's unique to Devon. This is a problem that's going to exist for everybody as prices recover and the service industry tends to recover and rehire people and retool their industry as well, that we're all going to have to be assessing.

If we had to double -- for example, the industry would double their capital expenditure program. We think the tubulars are in really pretty good shape. While there has been some decrease in the amount of labor that's available, we think with modest increases that labor would be back over a period of time whether that's 6 months or 8 months. The stimulation area is a different animal. Right now, we think that's been cut about 33% in terms of capacity. How long it takes to get that 33% back, we don't know, but that would be the one area that initially would cause us some concern on the cost side of the equation."

But so far, across the play, we've been highly encouraged, and I'll tell you that the one anomaly that we've seen has been really testing the far southwest portion of the Meramec there. We've seen oil contents much higher than what we see in the Cana-Woodford, which really we haven't talked much about our legacy acreage position in the Woodford, but that really sets that whole couple of hundred thousand acres of ours up for prospective higher-yield production in the future.

In the macro view, we continue to see that improve, although we still think in the short term over the next few months, you're going to see a greater amount of supply than demand. However, that demand is starting to increase as we bring on additional petrochemical plants, and we continue to add export capacity by water. That has increased in the last 3 years from about 200,000 barrels a day, the export capacity up to about pretty close to 1 million barrels a day. By the end of this year, early next year, we'll have added another 250,000 barrels a day of export capacity on the water. About half of that is propane, butane and gasolines, about half of that is ethane. So we're starting to see the export opportunities bring supply-demand back into balance. And so we think there's going to be more upward pressure on NGL products over time than we've seen in the last 1.5 years."

The last several months have been very active for Devon. We've continued to deliver strong operating results from our top-tier North American resource plays, and we significantly outperformed skewed expectations on our assets divestitures, which dramatically improved our financial strength. Overall, it was a great quarter of execution for Devon.
I will touch on 3 key messages today: efficiency gains, the portfolio transformation and the quality of our asset base.
First, we continue to achieve significant efficiency gains across Devon's entire portfolio. Productivity from our top 2 franchise assets, the STACK and Delaware Basin, was once again outstanding. We commenced production on approximately 20 wells for these prolific assets during the second quarter with 30-day rates averaging nearly 1,500 BOE per day. Not only did these high-rate wells deliver excellent returns, they also exceeded our type curve expectation by a wide margin. Combined with positive base production performance across our entire portfolio, we were able to drive production above midpoint expectation for all products in the second quarter. Importantly, these productivity gains were attained with substantially lower costs. Drilling and completion costs at our U.S. resource plays have now declined by as much as 40% from peak rates, and we are now on pace to save nearly $1 billion of operating and G&A expenses in 2016.
The second key takeaway is Devon's portfolio transformation is now complete. In December of last year, we announced a bold move to materially add to our position in the STACK play with the Felix acquisition as well as the Rockies along with our intent to monetize noncore assets across our portfolio. Since that announcement, we have successfully integrated Felix assets into our portfolio, and their prolific new well results from this asset continue to support our view that the STACK play is the best emerging development play in North America. 
We have also done a tremendous job executing on our noncore asset divestiture program. We have reached agreement to sell $3.2 billion of assets, well above the top end of our $2 billion to $3 billion guidance range, and these accretive transactions have significantly strengthened our investment grade balance sheet. The majority of proceeds will be used for debt reduction. While there has been tremendous volatility in energy markets over the past year, I have unwavering conviction that these strategic actions were the correct long-term decisions for Devon.
And finally, I want to leave you with some thoughts about the quality and depth of Devon's go-forward asset base, which we believe is unmatched in the industry. With the recent high grading of our portfolio, we sharpened our focus on Devon's top resource plays, all concentrated in North America's best basins. Led by our world-class STACK and Delaware Basin assets, we have exposure to more than 1 million net acres and thousands of low-risk opportunities that can deliver sustainable long-term growth for Devon. Importantly, we are taking significant steps in 2016 to accelerate future development in the STACK and Delaware Basin. In the STACK, we are participating in more than 10 spacing pilots to optimize our 2017 development plans and the overpressured oil window. In the Delaware Basin, our total reservoir Access concept, otherwise known as TRACK, has future development plans in place to efficiently develop up to 9 intervals of STACK play in a given area from super pants. Looking beyond the massive opportunity set in STACK and Delaware Basin, we also have attractive investment opportunities in the Eagle Ford, Rockies and Barnett Shale. And more importantly, these high-quality assets possess the ability to generate substantial amounts of free cash flow.
Outside of our formidable U.S. resource plays, our top-tier heavy oil asset in Canada provides tremendous optionality. These capital-efficient assets can produce large amounts of cash flow and also possess significant growth potential with greater than 1 billion barrels of undeveloped resource in the economic core of the Alberta oil sands. Overall, Devon's go-forward asset base is well balanced between scalable growth assets and top-tier cash flow generating assets.
Given the quality of our go-forward asset portfolio, we have no shortage of attractive investment opportunities across our asset base. And with the success of our asset divestiture program, our strong financial position allows us to accelerate investment in these best-in-class resource plays. As we previously announced in June, we are increasing our upstream capital investment by approximately $200 million to a range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion in 2016. This incremental capital investment will be deployed entirely in the STACK and Delaware Basin beginning in the third quarter. By year-end, we expect to add as many as 7 operated rigs between these 2 areas. The annualized upstream capital spend associated with this activity at year-end is approximately $1.6 billion. While it is still a bit too early to provide any formal targets for 2017, I can tell you that this level of investment is sufficient to generate growth in oil production and stabilize Devon's top line production profile by mid-year 2017.
So in summary, I'm pleased with the way Devon is positioned to navigate the current environment and prosper in the future. We have a great collection of assets and experienced team that has a track record of delivering excellent results and the financial capacity to efficiently convert our resource-rich opportunity set into production and cash flow.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Howard."

And before we head to Q&A, I'll take a few moments to address one of them most asked questions our team has, and that's our production profile. As we reached our sales values on divested assets in excess of our targets, there are certain assets we haven't sold and, therefore, we have rolled into the Devon go-forward look. Also, the production estimates we previously issued showed the full year of the divested assets while we have already closed several and anticipate closing the remaining assets soon. The largest component of retained assets previously in the other category are select Midland assets, which have a relatively shallow decline rate and are high margin. And to be perfectly clear, we see both U.S. and Canadian production stabilizing in the fourth quarter of 2016, and our projected activity levels at the end 2016, we project top line production for our retained assets to stabilize by mid-year 2017, led by growth in the U.S. oil. A key contributor to mitigating gas and NGL declines in the first half of 2017 will be the Hobson Road development in the STACK that we anticipate bringing on in early 2017, and we expect to return to top line growth in the second half of 2017.  Of course, these projections are predicated on an expectation that we see strengthening in commodity prices, which will allow us to add the 3 or 4 additional rigs in the fourth quarter of 2016 we disclosed in our 2Q earnings materials. So based on that level of activity at year-end, you can expect an annual spend of somewhere around $1.6 billion. I hope this helps.

But the numbers you start seeing start boggling the mind sometimes I'd say how many wells you can have individual sections.

I don't think that's probably appropriate for us to comment on hypothetical situations there. But the Eagle Ford, we've had some tremendous results. And again, we have a position there is really we want to do in all of our plays. It's one of the best plays in onshore North America. And if you look at the historical well results that we delivered out there, we have a large proportion of the best wells that have been drilled in the play. So we certainly have lots of position. Right now, we're just in a position where given that capital constraints that we had earlier in the year, ourselves and our partner, that we decreased drilling activity significantly. And along with that and the completion activity, we thought we are going to resume completion activity here in Q3. It's been pushed back. It looks like about 1 quarter now. So that's, I guess, a very short-term challenge. But frankly, it's going to help us a little bit in 2017 as some of those volumes pushed out of '16 into '17, so I think it's a significant event towards the long-term strategy of the Eagle Ford. We still see some high rate or high return-type opportunities in Eagle Ford. We are maturing our way through the best part of the inventory right now. But we're also seeing some upside from the diamond pattern that we describe in the operations report really staggered laterals in the lower Eagle Ford along with the upside in the operating Eagle Ford. So we still thickness of upside it exists to the resource out there albeit it doesn't have -- and we knew it at the time the acquisition just didn't have the Reading room that we see now in the Delaware in the STACK play.

And it probably will work as technology continues to improve and we can improve our frac or completion designs and maintain more a complex near-wellbore frac. So the 4 that we initially commented on when we did the acquisition is liked. And we think we're at least the 6 and not heading north of that right now. So that information the pilots are coming in. We'll have about another 3 pilots showing us some information in Q3 early in the first quarter of '17 but we're starting to get comfortable with the areas were going to go into full development on.

So you get the same quality results across the entire play, but the variability of what you would expect in the, given part of the play, is very low, given the face of maturity that we're in the play overall. Dave, just to elaborate what Dave mentioned is as you characterize the reservoir there's a lot of variation in the reservoir thickness by zone. There's a lot of difference in the fluid content as you move from northeast to southwest. The pressure changes, as I just mentioned, from east to west, so there's a lot about variation in that. The actual total depth to get the wells down varies from the east to the west dramatically. But as Dave mentioned, the results that we're seeing as an industry are pretty darn tight. And the only place that we haven't seen predictable result has really been in the far southwest when we were -- and we need a few more data points to understand the gas versus oil content there.

And we stood up and operations excellent group here that has really done a great job facilitating this focused effort to drive cost down. All of our field -- men and women in the field locations are doing a good job participating with us. So as we have built out our water handling capacity across all of our fields, we have more of our water going through pipe. We own more SWD capacity than we've had in the past. As we've gotten -- as we've brought power grid system into our business, we've been able to release probably about close to 300 rental generators just in the Delaware Basin alone. Really good thoughtful work there, and we have a supply chain group that is closely linked in with our operating team, and they're doing everything from working  reducing compression costs through renegotiating contracts, doing the same thing for chemicals. We're working on the water that we do have to transport and handle costs down. So we've got a great focused effort going on with our supply chain all of our field people. And again, it's something that is really passionate right now. Where we go from there, I mean you can start looking at some of the costs, and they start to flatten out just in terms of the price per unit, but we're still working on this, and we believe a lot of the wins still live together just through the attention to detail and through changes and through managing our business even better than we have in the past."

The last several months have been very active for Devon. We've continued to deliver strong operating results from our top-tier North American resource plays, and we significantly outperformed Street expectations on our assets divestitures, which dramatically improved our financial strength. Overall, it was a great quarter of execution for Devon.
I will touch on 3 key messages today: efficiency gains, the portfolio transformation and the quality of our asset base.
First, we continue to achieve significant efficiency gains across Devon's entire portfolio. Productivity from our top 2 franchise assets, the STACK and Delaware Basin, was once again outstanding. We commenced production on approximately 20 wells from these prolific assets during the second quarter, with 30-day rates averaging nearly 1,500 BOE per day. Not only did these high-rate wells deliver excellent returns, they also exceeded our type curve expectations by a wide margin. Combined with positive base production performance across our entire portfolio, we were able to drive production above midpoint expectations for all products in the second quarter. Importantly, these productivity gains were attained with substantially lower costs. Drilling and completion costs at our U.S. resource plays have now declined by as much as 40% from peak rates, and we are now on pace to save nearly $1 billion of operating and G&A expenses in 2016.
The second key takeaway is that Devon's portfolio transformation is now complete. In December of last year, we announced a bold move to materially add to our position in the STACK play with the Felix acquisition as well as the Rockies, along with our intent to monetize noncore assets across our portfolio. Since that announcement, we've successfully integrated the Felix assets into our portfolio, and their prolific new well results from this asset continue to support our view that the STACK play is the best emerging development play in North America. 
We have also done a tremendous job executing on our noncore asset divestiture program. We have reached agreement to sell $3.2 billion of assets, well above the top end of our $2 billion to $3 billion guidance range, and these accretive transactions have significantly strengthened our investment grade balance sheet. Majority of proceeds will be used for debt reduction. While there has been tremendous volatility in energy markets over the past year, I have unwavering conviction that these strategic actions were the correct long-term decisions for Devon.
And finally, I want to leave you with some thoughts about the quality and depth of Devon's go-forward asset base, which we believe is unmatched in the industry. With the recent high grading of our portfolio, we sharpened our focused on Devon's top resource plays, all concentrated in North America's best basins. Led by our world-class STACK and Delaware Basin assets, we have exposure to more than 1 million net acres and thousands of low-risk opportunities that can deliver sustainable long-term growth for Devon. Importantly, we are taking significant steps in 2016 to accelerate future development in the STACK and Delaware Basin. In the STACK, we are participating in more than 10 spacing pilots to optimize our 2017 development plans in the overpressured oil window. In the Delaware Basin, our total reservoir access concept, otherwise known as TRAC, has future development plans in place to efficiently develop up to 9 intervals of STACK play in a given area from super pads. Looking beyond the massive opportunity set in STACK and Delaware Basin, we also have attractive investment opportunities in the Eagle Ford, Rockies and Barnett Shale. And more importantly, these high-quality assets possess the ability to generate substantial amounts of free cash flow.
Outside of our formidable U.S. resource plays, our top-tier heavy oil asset in Canada provides tremendous optionality. These capital-efficient assets can produce large amounts of cash flow, and also possess significant growth potential with greater than 1 billion barrels of undeveloped resource in the economic core of the Alberta oil sands. Overall, Devon's go-forward asset base is well balanced between scalable growth assets and top-tier cash flow generating assets.
Given the quality of our go-forward asset portfolio, we have no shortage of attractive investment opportunities across our asset base. And with the success of our asset divestiture program, our strong financial position allows us to accelerate investment in these best-in-class resource plays. As we previously announced in June, we are increasing our upstream capital investment by approximately $200 million to a range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion in 2016. This incremental capital investment will be deployed entirely in the STACK and Delaware Basin beginning in the third quarter. By year-end, we expect to add as many as 7 operated rigs between these 2 areas. The annualized upstream capital spend associated with this activity at year-end is approximately $1.6 billion. While it is still a bit too early to provide any formal targets for 2017, I can tell you that this level of investment is sufficient to generate growth in oil production and stabilize Devon's top line production profile by mid-year 2017.
So in summary, I'm pleased with the way Devon is positioned to navigate the current environment and prosper in the future. We have a great collection of assets and experienced team that has a track record of delivering excellent results and in the terms of the financial capacity to efficiently convert our resource-rich opportunity set into production and cash flow.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Howard."

And before we head to Q&A, I'll take just a few moments to address one of the most, often asked questions that our team has received since our release, and that's our production profile. As we reached our sales values on divested assets in excess of our targets, there are certain assets we haven't sold and, therefore, we have rolled into the Devon go-forward look. Also, the production estimates we previously issued showed a full year of the divested assets while we have already closed several and anticipate closing the remaining assets soon. The largest component of retained assets previously in the other category are select Midland assets, which have a relatively shallow decline rate and are high margin. And to be perfectly clear, we see both U.S. and Canadian production stabilizing in the fourth quarter of 2016, and our projected activity levels at year end 2016, we project top line production for our retained assets to stabilize by mid-year 2017, led by growth in the U.S. oil. A key contributor to mitigating gas and NGL declines in the first half of 2017 will be the Hobson Road development in the STACK that we anticipate bringing on in early 2017, and we expect to return to top line growth in the second half of 2017. Of course, these projections are predicated on an expectation that we see strengthening in commodity prices, which will allow us to add the 3 or 4 additional rigs in the fourth quarter of 2016 we disclosed in our 2Q earnings materials. So based on that level of activity at year-end, you could expect an annual spend of somewhere around $1.6 billion. I hope this helps. And of course, if you have more detailed modeling questions, Scott, Chris or I are happy to visit with you after the call.

And so we are still doing appraisal work, determine how many wells per section in an individual zone and how many of these zones and our vertical sands, also, can be developed in any one geographic location. But the numbers you start seeing start boggling the mind sometimes, I'd say, with how many wells you could have on in individual section. We're hesitant to put the numbers out there until we finish more appraisal work, but there could be just a tremendous amount of resource we're developing on each section out there, and that's what's necessitated this super pad concept to figure out. It's great to have the resource, but how are you actually going to develop that resource, and that's what's put that into place.

And then as we go from a 5,000-foot lateral up to a 10,000-foot lateral, that's about $1 million to $1.5 million incremental on top of that.

And again, we have a position there that is really like we want to do in all of our plays. It's an best or one of the best plays in onshore North America. And if you look at the historical well results that we've delivered out there, we have a large proportion of the best wells that have been drilled in the play. So we certainly have locked our position. Right now, we're just in a position where given that capital constraints that we had earlier in the year, ourselves and our partner, that we decreased drilling activity significantly. And along with that and the completion activity, we thought we are going to resume completion activity here in Q3. It's been pushed back. It looks like about 1 quarter now. So that's, I guess, a very short-term challenge. But frankly, it's going to help us a little bit in 2017 as some of those volumes pushed out of '16 and into '17, so I don't think it's a significant event towards the long-term strategy of the Eagle Ford. We still see some high rate or high return-type opportunities in Eagle Ford. We are maturing our way through the best part of the inventory right now. But we also are seeing some upside from the diamond pattern that we described in the operations report. I was just really a staggered laterals in the lower Eagle Ford along with the upside in the upper Eagle Ford. And so we still think there's some upside that exists to the resource out there, albeit it doesn't have the -- and we knew it at the time of the acquisition.

One of the pilots that we got some early data on was what we call the skipper pilot, and that was in an 8-well per section or almost an 8-well per section. And there, we're highly encouraged that 8 wells will work in the right commodity price environment. And it probably will work as technology continues to improve and we can improve our frac or completion designs and maintain a more complex near-wellbore frac. So the 4 that we initially commented on when we did the acquisition is liked. And we think we're at least at 6 and not heading north of that right now. And so that information, the pilots are coming in. We'll have about another 3 pilots showing us some information in Q3, some of them are in early, in the first quarter of '17, but we're starting to get comfortable with the areas that we're going to go into at full development on.

But one is the -- I think you heard me make some comments there about the predictability of our results in STACK. And so while it's not going to be uniform across the play, it is extremely predictable. And again, there is a note about the debate regarding our acreage position and whether or not it falls in the overpressured window. And I think you may have been -- I think the industry may have been led to believe that there's a north-south line to the east of that, it's under pressure and to the west of that, it's overpressured. That's not the case. As we -- all of us that worked a subsurface data understanding and if you look at an isobar map, you can clearly see that the far northeast is normal pressure, but it quickly goes into about 0.5 psi per foot and gradually moves into about 0.7, 0.75 psi per foot to the southwest. So just wanted to clear up. And in our mind there's no debate about whether or not we're in the overpressured window or not."

So you aren't going to necessarily get the same well results across the entire play, but the variability of what you would expect in a given part of the play, is very low, given the phase of maturity that we're in, in the play overall. You know Dave, just to elaborate what Dave mentioned is the -- as you characterize the reservoir there's a lot of variation in the reservoir thickness by zone. There's a lot of difference in the fluid content as you move from northeast to southwest. The bar pressure changes, as I just mentioned, from east to west. So there's a lot of variation in that. The actual total depth to get the wells down varies from the east to the west dramatically. But as Dave mentioned, the results that we're seeing as an industry are pretty darn tight. And the only place that we haven't seen a predictable result has really been in the far southwest when we were -- and we need a few more data points to understand the gas versus oil content there.

And at the same time, that information gave us a good matrix or a good feel for the performance change in that design but it also helped us understand the commercial -- the matrix associated with the commodity price environment. So we have backed off in the Delaware, from that 3,000 pounds per lateral foot. We think we can get the most commercial returns in the current business environment done at about 1,500 to 2,000. It kind of varies across the field, so that's the way we think about it. And then, if you move over into the Anadarko Basin, we're using a slick water job in our Woodford-type work, and we continue to increase our profit loads there. So we're up to about 2,000 pounds per lateral foot. And after drilling and completing over 800 wells, this last large pad that we brought on had the best results that we've ever had in the Cana-Woodford play. As we think about the STACK play right now, we're using a hybrid-type job, so we've got a little bit of a gel with the total fluid is more dominated with the slickwater. So we're continuing to experiment and modify with our completion designs. But we are increasing our sand loads there up to about 2,600 to 2,750 pounds per lateral foot and enjoying increasing success of there. So John, we're getting a lot of this information, and we're really all about trying to make the highest return per well, not necessarily just to pop large jobs. So a lot of data out there, we got a lot of data in our library, and we pump a lot of slickwater jobs, but in a few places like the Eagle Ford and in STACK right now are using a hybrid fluid."

And as you noticed some notes in our operating report, the majority of our work now, we have power grid system to all of our wells. We also have the majority of our fluid being transported by pipe. And so the infrastructure -- and you can really see that as our LOE per BOE cost has dramatically dropped from over $16 a barrel down to the 8-type number over that period of time. So the infrastructure buildout in the Delaware Basin especially, is there. There's no local takeaway issues associated with our work that we anticipate doing in the next couple of years. So really, the Delaware has now caught up to that infrastructure, and the returns are good. The cost to drilling complete wells is down. And certainly, the monthly recurring at least operating cost is down. And if you move over into the STACK play, the Cana-Woodford part of that is very well developed out. We got a great water system there. We're building out our concept for the Meramec play right now. That's in the design phase. We're working very closely with our midstream partner, EnLink, and they're helping us understand what the long-term takeaway opportunities might be. But again, we don't believe that's really a question in our current thought process for our current development until probably 2019. So we're working forward to that. When we'll have this, the appropriate solution identified, we'll be able to communicate that to you. And just a plug for the guys at the EnLink. I think we highlighted the, essentially, the flat production in the Barnett from Q1 to Q2 and with no capital, and it's pretty amazing some of the work that our team has done. That team consists of both Devon people and our EnLink team, so there's been great thoughtful work on line pressure reductions, optimizing plunger lifts and the artificial lift system we've got there. So really having that partnership with EnLink is starting to -- is really providing a lot of value across our asset base."

As we've gotten -- as we've brought power grid system into our business, we've been able to release probably about close to 300 rental generators just in the Delaware Basin alone. Really good thoughtful work there, and we have a supply chain group that is closely linked in with our operating team, and they're doing everything from working -- reducing compression costs through renegotiating some contracts, doing the same thing for chemicals.

The last several months have been very active for Devon. We've continued to deliver strong operating results from our top-tier North American resource plays, and we significantly outperformed Street expectations on our assets divestitures, which dramatically improved our financial strength. Overall, it was a great quarter of execution for Devon.
I will touch on 3 key messages today: efficiency gains, the portfolio transformation and the quality of our asset base.
First, we continue to achieve significant efficiency gains across Devon's entire portfolio. Productivity from our top 2 franchise assets, the STACK and Delaware Basin, was once again outstanding. We commenced production on approximately 20 wells from these prolific assets during the second quarter, with 30-day rates averaging nearly 1,500 BOE per day. Not only did these high-rate wells deliver excellent returns, they also exceeded our type curve expectations by a wide margin. Combined with positive base production performance across our entire portfolio, we were able to drive production above midpoint expectations for all products in the second quarter. Importantly, these productivity gains were attained with substantially lower costs. Drilling and completion costs at our U.S. resource plays have now declined by as much as 40% from peak rates, and we are now on pace to save nearly $1 billion of operating and G&A expenses in 2016.
The second key takeaway is that Devon's portfolio transformation is now complete. In December of last year, we announced a bold move to materially add to our position in the STACK play with the Felix acquisition as well as the Rockies, along with our intent to monetize noncore assets across our portfolio. Since that announcement, we've successfully integrated the Felix assets into our portfolio, and their prolific new well results from this asset continue to support our view that the STACK play is the best emerging development play in North America. 
We have also done a tremendous job executing on our noncore asset divestiture program. We have reached agreement to sell $3.2 billion of assets, well above the top end of our $2 billion to $3 billion guidance range, and these accretive transactions have significantly strengthened our investment-grade balance sheet. Majority of proceeds will be used for debt reduction. While there has been tremendous volatility in energy markets over the past year, I have unwavering conviction that these strategic actions were the correct long-term decisions for Devon.
And finally, I want to leave you with some thoughts about the quality and depth of Devon's go-forward asset base, which we believe is unmatched in the industry. With the recent high grading of our portfolio, we sharpened our focused on Devon's top resource plays, all concentrated in North America's best basins. Led by our world-class STACK and Delaware Basin assets, we have exposure to more than 1 million net acres and thousands of low-risk opportunities that can deliver sustainable long-term growth for Devon. Importantly, we are taking significant steps in 2016 to accelerate future development in the STACK and Delaware Basin. In the STACK, we are participating in more than 10 spacing pilots to optimize our 2017 development plans in the overpressured oil window. In the Delaware Basin, our total reservoir access concept, otherwise known as TRAC, has future development plans in place to efficiently develop up to 9 intervals of stack pay in a given area from super pads. Looking beyond the massive opportunity set in STACK and Delaware Basin, we also have attractive investment opportunities in the Eagle Ford, Rockies and Barnett Shale. And more importantly, these high-quality assets possess the ability to generate substantial amounts of free cash flow.
Outside of our formidable U.S. resource plays, our top-tier heavy oil asset in Canada provides tremendous optionality. These capital-efficient assets can produce large amounts of cash flow, and also possess significant growth potential with greater than 1 billion barrels of undeveloped resource in the economic core of the Alberta oil sands. Overall, Devon's go-forward asset base is well balanced between scalable growth assets and top-tier cash flow generating assets.
Given the quality of our go-forward asset portfolio, we have no shortage of attractive investment opportunities across our asset base. And with the success of our asset divestiture program, our strong financial position allows us to accelerate investment in these best-in-class resource plays. As we previously announced in June, we are increasing our upstream capital investment by approximately $200 million to a range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion in 2016. This incremental capital investment will be deployed entirely in the STACK and Delaware Basin beginning in the third quarter. By year-end, we expect to add as many as 7 operated rigs between these 2 areas. The annualized upstream capital spend associated with this activity at year-end is approximately $1.6 billion. While it is still a bit too early to provide any formal targets for 2017, I can tell you that this level of investment is sufficient to generate growth in oil production and stabilize Devon's top line production profile by mid-year 2017.
So in summary, I'm pleased with the way Devon is positioned to navigate the current environment and prosper in the future. We have a great collection of assets and experienced team that has a track record of delivering excellent results and have the financial capacity to efficiently convert our resource-rich opportunity set into production and cash flow.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Howard."

And before we head to Q&A, I'll take just a few moments to address one of the most, often asked questions that our team has received since our release, and that's our production profile. As we reached our sales values on divested assets in excess of our targets, there are certain assets we haven't sold and, therefore, we have rolled into the Devon go-forward look. Also, the production estimates we previously issued showed a full year of the divested assets while we have already closed several and anticipate closing the remaining assets soon. The largest component of retained assets previously in the other category are select Midland assets, which have a relatively shallow decline rate and are high margin. And to be perfectly clear, we see both U.S. and Canadian production stabilizing in the fourth quarter of 2016, and our projected activity levels at year end 2016, we project top line production for our retained assets to stabilize by mid-year 2017, led by growth in the U.S. oil. A key contributor to mitigating gas and NGL declines in the first half of 2017 will be the Hobson Road development in the STACK that we anticipate bringing on in early 2017, and we expect to return to top line growth in the second half of 2017. Of course, these projections are predicated on an expectation that we see strengthening in commodity prices, which will allow us to add the 3 or 4 additional rigs in the fourth quarter of 2016 we disclosed in our 2Q earnings materials. So based on that level of activity at year-end, you could expect an annual spend of somewhere around $1.6 billion. I hope this helps. And of course, if you have more detailed modeling questions, Scott, Chris or I are happy to visit with you after the call.

It's a little bit tougher to put those together as you move north in Lea and Eddy County in our footprint, but in the southern portion of this where this new super pad or TRAC concept would be utilized in 2017. It's a little easier to do that. And so I think what we're trying to describe here is a concept that when you start thinking about having all of the stacked pays that we have, both here and in the STACK asset in Oklahoma, there's going to be a more creative and efficient way to develop our service facilities. And so we're walking into this with this concept. It provides us a lot of flexibility as we grow. It also allows us to have flexibility as the business environment changes. But for the most part, we're going to -- through the permitting process to achieve a -- or to get approval for a really more of a fill development concept and then past that, we will be left to get individual APDs by well as we choose to develop that. So you're right about our footprint. It is a little bit less contiguous in the north end of our position but in the south end of Lea and Eddy, it should be very well suited for this type of a concept."

We said we have up to 9 prospective zones between the Delaware Sands, the Bone Spring, Leonard and the Wolfcamp. And so we are still doing appraisal work, determining how many wells per section in an individual zone and how many of these zones in a vertical sense, also, can be developed in any one geographic location. But the numbers you start seeing start boggling the mind sometimes, I'd say, with how many wells you could have on in individual section. We're hesitant to put the numbers out there until we finish more appraisal work, but there could be just a tremendous amount of resource that we're developing on each section out there, and that's what's necessitated this super pad concept to figure out. It's great to have the resource, but then how are you actually going to develop that resource, and that's what's put that into place.

We're finding that we can drill the wells for about $5.5 million per well with the 2-string design on the eastern half of the field. We go into that, I have to add a third string as we go past the kind of a dividing line that separates the east from the west, add that third string, it adds about $1 million. And then as we go from a 5,000-foot lateral up to a 10,000-foot lateral, that's about $1 million to $1.5 million incremental on top of that. So that's -- it might give you a range in the cost as we work across that field. We continue to see positive results in our well performance from the oily section in the northeast to the -- a little bit of the gassier, more volatile as you move into the central portion of the field.

And we still believe the P10 to P90 range in the 90-day IP is about 2.4, which is extremely tight for a fairly young play.

I don't think it's probably appropriate for us to comment on hypothetical situations there. But the Eagle Ford, we've had some tremendous results. And again, we have a position there that is really like we want to do in all of our plays. It's in the best of one of the best plays in onshore North America. And if you look at the historical well results that we've delivered out there, we have a large proportion of the best wells that have been drilled in the play. So we certainly have liked our position. Right now, we're just in a position where given that capital constraints that we had earlier in the year, ourselves and our partner, that we decreased drilling activity significantly. And along with that and the completion activity, we thought we are going to resume completion activity here in Q3. It's been pushed back. It looks like about 1 quarter now. So that's, I guess, a very short-term challenge. But frankly, it's going to help us a little bit in 2017 as some of those volumes pushed out of '16 and into '17, so I don't think it's a significant event towards the long-term strategy of the Eagle Ford. We still see some high rate or high return-type opportunities in the Eagle Ford. We are maturing our way through the best part of the inventory right now. But we also are seeing some upside from the diamond pattern that we described in the operations report, which is really a staggered laterals in the lower Eagle Ford along with the upside in the upper Eagle Ford. And so we still think there's some upside that exists to the resource out there, albeit it doesn't have the -- and we knew it at the time of the acquisition. It just didn't have the running room that we see now in the Delaware and in the STACK play. So we still like it very much, and we just have to see how things develop beyond that."

So while you've seen our results on the Born Free which gave us confidence that we have the ability to prosecute the zones on top of each other with no problem.

We're getting some information in right now on the pump house, which is a 7 wells per section and we'll build a -- give you a little bit more feel for that. One of the pilots that we got some early data on was what we call the skipper pilot, and that was in an 8-well per section or almost an 8-well per section. And there, we're highly encouraged that 8 wells will work in the right commodity price environment. And it probably will work as technology continues to improve and we can improve our frac or completion designs and maintain a more complex near-wellbore frac. So the 4 that we initially commented on when we did the acquisition is liked. And we think we're at least at 6 and not heading north of that right now. And so that information, the pilots are coming in. We'll have about another 3 pilots showing us some information in Q3, some of them are in early, in the first quarter of '17, but we're starting to get comfortable with the areas that we're going to go into at full development on. And again, we'll use this TRAC concept in the STACK development as well. And we think will have the ability to prosecute up to roughly 27 wells in a section if -- as all these zones continue to work.

I'll remind us of the experience that we had in, I believe it was mid-14 when we started increasing the sand loads in our Delaware completions, and we really ran up to from about 600 pounds per lateral foot in early 2014 up to about 3,000 pounds per lateral foot through 2015. And at the same time, that information gave us a good matrix or a good feel for the performance change in that design but it also helped us understand the commercial -- the matrix associated with the commodity price environment. So we have backed off in the Delaware from that 3,000 pounds per lateral foot. We think we can get the most commercial returns in the current business environment done at about 1,500 to 2,000. It kind of varies across the field, so that's the way we think about it. And then, if you move over into the Anadarko Basin, we're using a slick water job in our Woodford-type work, and we continue to increase our proppant loads there. So we're up to about 2,000 pounds per lateral foot. And after drilling and completing over 800 wells, this last large pad that we brought on had the best results that we've ever had in the Cana-Woodford play. As we think about the STACK play right now, we're using a hybrid-type job, so we've got a little bit of a gel with the total fluid is more dominated with the slickwater. So we're continuing to experiment and modify with our completion designs. But we are increasing our sand loads there up to about 2,600 to 2,750 pounds per lateral foot and enjoying increasing success of there. So, John, we're getting a lot of this information, and we're really all about trying to make the highest return per well, not necessarily just to pop large jobs. So getting a lot of data out there, we got a lot of data in our library, and we pump a lot of slickwater jobs, but in a few places like the Eagle Ford and in STACK right now we are using a hybrid fluid."

And as you noticed some notes in our operating report, the majority of our work now, we have power grid system to all of our wells. We also have the majority of our fluid being transported by pipe. And so the infrastructure -- and you can really see that as our LOE per BOE cost has dramatically dropped from over $16 a barrel down to the 8-type number over that period of time. So the infrastructure buildout in the Delaware Basin, especially, is there. There's no local takeaway issues associated with our work that we anticipate doing in the next couple of years. So really, the Delaware has now caught up to that infrastructure, and the returns are good. The cost to drill and complete wells is down. And certainly, the monthly recurring lease operating cost is down. And if you move over into the STACK play, the Cana-Woodford part of that is very well developed out. We got a great water system there. We're building out our concept for the Meramec play right now. That's in the design phase. We're working very closely with our midstream partner, EnLink, and they're helping us understand what the long-term takeaway opportunities might be. But again, we don't believe that's really a question in our current thought process for our current development until probably 2019. So we're working forward to that. When we'll have this, the appropriate solution identified, we'll be able to communicate that to you. And just a plug for the guys at the EnLink. I think we highlighted the, essentially, the flat production in the Barnett from Q1 to Q2 and with no capital, and it's pretty amazing some of the work that our team has done. That team consists of both Devon people and our EnLink team, so there's been great thoughtful work on line pressure reductions, optimizing plunger lifts and the artificial lift system we've got there. So really having that partnership with EnLink is starting to -- is really providing a lot of value across our asset base."

All of our field -- the men and women in the field locations are doing a good job participating with us. So as we have built out our water handling capacity across all of our fields, we have more of our water going through pipe. We own more SWD capacity than we've had in the past. As we've gotten -- as we've brought power grid system into our business, we've been able to release probably about close to 300 rental generators just in the Delaware Basin alone. Really good thoughtful work there, and we have a supply chain group that is closely linked in with our operating team, and they're doing everything from working -- reducing compression costs through renegotiating some contracts, doing the same thing for chemicals. We're working on the water that we do have to transport and handle. We'll work those costs down. So we've got a great focused effort going on with our supply chain, all of our field people. And again, it's something that is really passionate in the company right now. Where we go from there, I mean you can start looking at some of the cost, and they start to flatten out just in terms of the price per unit, but we're still working on this, and we believe a lot of the wins still left to get are just through attention to detail and through designing changes and through managing our business even better than we have in the past."

The last several months have been very active for Devon. We've continued to deliver strong operating results from our top-tier North American resource plays, and we significantly outperformed Street expectations on our assets divestitures, which dramatically improved our financial strength. Overall, it was a great quarter of execution for Devon.
I will touch on 3 key messages today: efficiency gains, the portfolio transformation and the quality of our asset base.
First, we continue to achieve significant efficiency gains across Devon's entire portfolio. Productivity from our top 2 franchise assets, the STACK and Delaware Basin, was once again outstanding. We commenced production on approximately 20 wells from these prolific assets during the second quarter, with 30-day rates averaging nearly 1,500 BOE per day. Not only did these high-rate wells deliver excellent returns, they also exceeded our type curve expectations by a wide margin. Combined with positive base production performance across our entire portfolio, we were able to drive production above midpoint expectations for all products in the second quarter. Importantly, these productivity gains were attained with substantially lower costs. Drilling and completion costs at our U.S. resource plays have now declined by as much as 40% from peak rates, and we are now on pace to save nearly $1 billion of operating and G&A expenses in 2016.
The second key takeaway is that Devon's portfolio transformation is now complete. In December of last year, we announced a bold move to materially add to our position in the STACK play with the Felix acquisition as well as the Rockies, along with our intent to monetize noncore assets across our portfolio. Since that announcement, we've successfully integrated the Felix assets into our portfolio, and their prolific new well results from this asset continue to support our view that the STACK play is the best emerging development play in North America. 
We have also done a tremendous job executing on our noncore asset divestiture program. We have reached agreement to sell $3.2 billion of assets, well above the top end of our $2 billion to $3 billion guidance range, and these accretive transactions have significantly strengthened our investment-grade balance sheet. Majority of proceeds will be used for debt reduction. While there has been tremendous volatility in energy markets over the past year, I have unwavering conviction that these strategic actions were the correct long-term decisions for Devon.
And finally, I want to leave you with some thoughts about the quality and depth of Devon's go-forward asset base, which we believe is unmatched in the industry. With the recent high grading of our portfolio, we sharpened our focused on Devon's top resource plays, all concentrated in North America's best basins. Led by our world-class STACK and Delaware Basin assets, we have exposure to more than 1 million net acres and thousands of low-risk opportunities that can deliver sustainable long-term growth for Devon. Importantly, we are taking significant steps in 2016 to accelerate future development in the STACK and Delaware Basin. In the STACK, we are participating in more than 10 spacing pilots to optimize our 2017 development plans in the overpressured oil window. In the Delaware Basin, our total reservoir access concept, otherwise known as TRAC, has future development plans in place to efficiently develop up to 9 intervals of stack pay in a given area from super pads. Looking beyond the massive opportunity set in STACK and Delaware Basin, we also have attractive investment opportunities in the Eagle Ford, Rockies and Barnett Shale. And more importantly, these high-quality assets possess the ability to generate substantial amounts of free cash flow.
Outside of our formidable U.S. resource plays, our top-tier heavy oil asset in Canada provides tremendous optionality. These capital-efficient assets can produce large amounts of cash flow, and also possess significant growth potential with greater than 1 billion barrels of undeveloped resource in the economic core of the Alberta oil sands. Overall, Devon's go-forward asset base is well balanced between scalable growth assets and top-tier cash flow generating assets.
Given the quality of our go-forward asset portfolio, we have no shortage of attractive investment opportunities across our asset base. And with the success of our asset divestiture program, our strong financial position allows us to accelerate investment in these best-in-class resource plays. As we previously announced in June, we are increasing our upstream capital investment by approximately $200 million to a range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion in 2016. This incremental capital investment will be deployed entirely in the STACK and Delaware Basin beginning in the third quarter. By year-end, we expect to add as many as 7 operated rigs between these 2 areas. The annualized upstream capital spend associated with this activity at year-end is approximately $1.6 billion. While it is still a bit too early to provide any formal targets for 2017, I can tell you that this level of investment is sufficient to generate growth in oil production and stabilize Devon's top line production profile by mid-year 2017.
So in summary, I'm pleased with the way Devon is positioned to navigate the current environment and prosper in the future. We have a great collection of assets and experienced team that has a track record of delivering excellent results and have the financial capacity to efficiently convert our resource-rich opportunity set into production and cash flow.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Howard."

And before we head to Q&A, I'll take just a few moments to address one of the most, often asked questions that our team has received since our release, and that's our production profile. As we reached our sales values on divested assets in excess of our targets, there are certain assets we haven't sold and, therefore, we have rolled into the Devon go-forward look. Also, the production estimates we previously issued showed a full year of the divested assets while we have already closed several and anticipate closing the remaining assets soon. The largest component of retained assets previously in the other category are select Midland assets, which have a relatively shallow decline rate and are high margin. And to be perfectly clear, we see both U.S. and Canadian production stabilizing in the fourth quarter of 2016, and our projected activity levels at year end 2016, we project top line production for our retained assets to stabilize by mid-year 2017, led by growth in the U.S. oil. A key contributor to mitigating gas and NGL declines in the first half of 2017 will be the Hobson Road development in the STACK that we anticipate bringing on in early 2017, and we expect to return to top line growth in the second half of 2017. Of course, these projections are predicated on an expectation that we see strengthening in commodity prices, which will allow us to add the 3 or 4 additional rigs in the fourth quarter of 2016 we disclosed in our 2Q earnings materials. So based on that level of activity at year-end, you could expect an annual spend of somewhere around $1.6 billion. I hope this helps.

But the numbers you start seeing start boggling the mind sometimes, I'd say, with how many wells you could have on in individual section. We're hesitant to put the numbers out there until we finish more appraisal work, but there could be just a tremendous amount of resource that we're developing on each section out there, and that's what's necessitated this super pad concept to figure out.

We're finding that we can drill the wells for about $5.5 million per well with the 2-string design on the eastern half of the field. We go into that, I have to add a third string as we go past the kind of a dividing line that separates the east from the west, add that third string, it adds about $1 million. And then as we go from a 5,000-foot lateral up to a 10,000-foot lateral, that's about $1 million to $1.5 million incremental on top of that. So that's -- it might give you a range in the cost as we work across that field. We continue to see positive results in our well performance from the oily section in the northeast to the -- a little bit of the gassier, more volatile as you move into the central portion of the field. But overall, Doug, when you put all of the attributes together, we still believe that we're in the heart of the high-return portion of the field.

And one of the things I wanted to point out on the STACK play, in general, that while there's a lot of variables that go into the subsurface description of this from depth, from pressure to changing fluid compositions to changing thickness by zone, a lot of variables are going into that, but I've got to tell you that the predictability of the results is very narrow. And we still believe the P10 to P90 range in the 90-day IP is about 2.4, which is extremely tight for a fairly young play.

I don't think it's probably appropriate for us to comment on hypothetical situations there. But the Eagle Ford, we've had some tremendous results. And again, we have a position there that is really like we want to do in all of our plays. It's in the best of one of the best plays in onshore North America. And if you look at the historical well results that we've delivered out there, we have a large proportion of the best wells that have been drilled in the play. So we certainly have liked our position. Right now, we're just in a position where given that capital constraints that we had earlier in the year, ourselves and our partner, that we decreased drilling activity significantly. And along with that and the completion activity, we thought we are going to resume completion activity here in Q3. It's been pushed back. It looks like about 1 quarter now. So that's, I guess, a very short-term challenge. But frankly, it's going to help us a little bit in 2017 as some of those volumes pushed out of '16 and into '17, so I don't think it's a significant event towards the long-term strategy of the Eagle Ford. We still see some high rate or high return-type opportunities in the Eagle Ford. We are maturing our way through the best part of the inventory right now. But we also are seeing some upside from the diamond pattern that we described in the operations report, which is really a staggered laterals in the lower Eagle Ford along with the upside in the upper Eagle Ford. And so we still think there's some upside that exists to the resource out there, albeit it doesn't have the -- and we knew it at the time of the acquisition. It just didn't have the running room that we see now in the Delaware and in the STACK play. So we still like it very much, and we just have to see how things develop beyond that."

So while you've seen our results on the Born Free which gave us confidence that we have the ability to prosecute the zones on top of each other with no problem.

We're getting some information in right now on the pump house, which is a 7 wells per section and we'll build a -- give you a little bit more feel for that. One of the pilots that we got some early data on was what we call the skipper pilot, and that was in an 8-well per section or almost an 8-well per section. And there, we're highly encouraged that 8 wells will work in the right commodity price environment. And it probably will work as technology continues to improve and we can improve our frac or completion designs and maintain a more complex near-wellbore frac. So the 4 that we initially commented on when we did the acquisition is liked. And we think we're at least at 6 and not heading north of that right now. And so that information, the pilots are coming in. We'll have about another 3 pilots showing us some information in Q3, some of them are in early, in the first quarter of '17, but we're starting to get comfortable with the areas that we're going to go into at full development on. And again, we'll use this TRAC concept in the STACK development as well. And we think will have the ability to prosecute up to roughly 27 wells in a section if -- as all these zones continue to work.

And as you noticed some notes in our operating report, the majority of our work now, we have power grid system to all of our wells. We also have the majority of our fluid being transported by pipe. And so the infrastructure -- and you can really see that as our LOE per BOE cost has dramatically dropped from over $16 a barrel down to the 8-type number over that period of time. So the infrastructure buildout in the Delaware Basin, especially, is there. There's no local takeaway issues associated with our work that we anticipate doing in the next couple of years. So really, the Delaware has now caught up to that infrastructure, and the returns are good. The cost to drill and complete wells is down. And certainly, the monthly recurring lease operating cost is down. And if you move over into the STACK play, the Cana-Woodford part of that is very well developed out. We got a great water system there. We're building out our concept for the Meramec play right now. That's in the design phase. We're working very closely with our midstream partner, EnLink, and they're helping us understand what the long-term takeaway opportunities might be. But again, we don't believe that's really a question in our current thought process for our current development until probably 2019. So we're working forward to that. When we'll have this, the appropriate solution identified, we'll be able to communicate that to you. And just a plug for the guys at the EnLink. I think we highlighted the, essentially, the flat production in the Barnett from Q1 to Q2 and with no capital, and it's pretty amazing some of the work that our team has done. That team consists of both Devon people and our EnLink team, so there's been great thoughtful work on line pressure reductions, optimizing plunger lifts and the artificial lift system we've got there. So really having that partnership with EnLink is starting to -- is really providing a lot of value across our asset base."

All of our field -- the men and women in the field locations are doing a good job participating with us. So as we have built out our water handling capacity across all of our fields, we have more of our water going through pipe. We own more SWD capacity than we've had in the past. As we've gotten -- as we've brought power grid system into our business, we've been able to release probably about close to 300 rental generators just in the Delaware Basin alone. Really good thoughtful work there, and we have a supply chain group that is closely linked in with our operating team, and they're doing everything from working -- reducing compression costs through renegotiating some contracts, doing the same thing for chemicals. We're working on the water that we do have to transport and handle. We'll work those costs down. So we've got a great focused effort going on with our supply chain, all of our field people. And again, it's something that is really passionate in the company right now. Where we go from there, I mean you can start looking at some of the cost, and they start to flatten out just in terms of the price per unit, but we're still working on this, and we believe a lot of the wins still left to get are just through attention to detail and through designing changes and through managing our business even better than we have in the past."

Devon delivered another outstanding performance in the third quarter, both operationally and financially. Our development programs delivered the best quarterly drill-bit results in Devon's 45-year history, with new",1132,"Thank you, Scott, and welcome, everyone. Devon delivered another outstanding performance in the third quarter, both operationally and financially. Our development programs delivered the best quarterly drill-bit results in Devon's 45-year history, with new wells reaching peak 30-day rates of nearly 2,000 BOE per day. These prolific drilling results were centered in our world-class STACK play where production increased by nearly 40% year-over-year. Furthermore, the value of Devon's production continues to be enhanced by substantial cost savings achieved during the quarter. We are now on pace to reduce operating and G&A costs by $1 billion for the full year, which provides an uplift to our margins of nearly $5 per BOE produced. 
In addition to our strong operating performance, another important accomplishment for Devon was the recent completion of our $3.2 billion asset divestiture program. These accretive transactions significantly strengthen our investment-grade position, and as a result, our net debt has now declined by 45% since the beginning of the year. To further enhance our financial position going forward, we've also been much more active building out our hedging position with the recent increase in commodity prices. 
With a more focused asset base and improved balance sheet, the next step in our strategic plan is to accelerate investment in our world-class onshore resource plays. By the end of next month, we plan to have 10 operated rigs running, focused within our top 2 franchise assets, the STACK and Delaware Basin. 
Looking ahead to 2017, we are still working toward finalizing the details of our operating and capital plans. However, I can tell you that at $55 WTI pricing, our upstream cash flow in 2017 including EnLink distributions is expected to expand by more than 100% year-over-year to around $2.5 billion. Under this scenario, we would steadily ramp up drilling activity over the next several quarters to as many as 15 to 20 operated rigs in the U.S. by year-end 2017. This program would represent upstream capital spending of around $2 billion, allowing us to invest within available cash flow. 
On a retained asset basis, this focused investment and higher-margin projects is expected to drive double-digit oil growth in the U.S. in 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, which marks the low point in Devon's production profile. As a result of this growth in oil volumes, top line production in 2017 will range from low to mid-single-digit growth compared to Q4 2016. This range is dependent upon our level of ethane rejection during the year. Importantly, this capital plan is designed to create operational momentum at much stronger growth rates heading into 2018. At a $60 WTI price point in 2018, our upstream cash flow has a potential to reach $3.5 billion, a greater than 200% increase from today's levels. Under this scenario in 2018, we would continue to aggressively ramp up our drilling programs within the U.S. with the majority of this capital directed toward the STACK and Delaware Basin. This low-risk drilling activity is expected to drive production growth of greater than 30% from our STACK and Delaware Basin assets in 2018. This strong growth would further transition Devon's product mix toward higher-margin light oil production in the U.S. 
Now I want to be very clear. While we're excited about the outstanding growth prospects that reside within our portfolio, our capital allocation we focused on value and rates of return, not the pursuit of top line production growth. And if commodity price volatility continues, our capital programs have significant flexibility with no long cycle project commitments and negligible leasehold expiration issues. This flexibility allows us to be nimble and tailor activity to invest directionally within cash flow. 
Another strategic imperative for Devon in the upcoming year is to further delineate and better characterize the growing resource base associated with our U.S. resource plays. Between the STACK and Delaware Basin alone, we have exposure to more than 1 million net acres and thousands of development-ready drilling locations that are highly economic at today's prices. To advance our understanding of the ultimate recovery and resource potential within these 2 world-class plays, we have an important appraisal work underway. In the STACK, this catalyst-rich activity is concentrated on the Meramec infill spacing pilots and further derisking on the Woodford oil window. 
In the Delaware Basin, the Leonard Shale opportunities, that continues to expand and we are now falling back on our first stack lateral test that will help shape our view on how to best develop the three prospective landing zones in this oil-rich shale. 
2017 will also be a breakout year for our Delaware Basin Wolfcamp program as we begin to actively develop this emerging play. The Wolfcamp will have a material impact to Devon's resource potential in the Delaware and we are excited about progressing our understanding of the 9,000-plus potential locations we have identified in this play. 
The bottom line is that Devon's asset portfolio has never been in better shape than it is today and I believe that the quality and depth of our opportunity set is unmatched in the industry, and we possess thousands of on drilled locations that are extremely well positioned on the North American cost curve. This high rate of return inventory will continue to expand as we derisk tremendous resource upside associated with our STACK and Delaware Basin assets. With this resource expansion, it could necessitate additional high grading of our portfolio, monetizing less competitive assets and accelerating the development of our highest rate of return inventory. 
So in summary, before we move to Q&A, I want to leave you with a few key messages from today's call. First, our improved financial positioning now allows us to aggressively accelerate drilling activity across our best-in-class resource plays while continuing to focus on the value and rate of return of each investment. These accelerated drilling plans will drive attractive cash flow growth in 2017 and 2018 compared to today's level and continue to transition Devon's product mix toward higher-margin, light oil production in the U.S. 
In conjunction with our shift to higher-margin production, do not lose sight of our peer group leading leverage to rising commodity prices. For every $1 increase in realized price on a per BOE basis, Devon generates more than $200 million of incremental cash flow annually. 
Looking beyond prices, Devon is also catalyst-rich over the next several quarters as we further delineate the massive resource upside associated with the STACK and Delaware Basin positions. 
And finally, with the continued growth in the quality and depth of our resource base, we expect to have an overabundance of opportunities. If this is the case, we are very well into further high-grade our portfolio and deploy additional investment toward the best projects in our portfolio. With that, I'll turn the call back to Scott."

So the the 10 at the year-end 2016 is essentially set and we are executing that.

The ramp-up to the 15 to 20 rigs really won't add production in 2017, but that's why we're so excited about 2018 as we do ramp up to that level. That's what's going to provide the even higher growth levels as we move into 2018 led by more than 30% growth in the STACK and the Delaware. Now the variability around that is really more, at this point, I'd say more commodity price driven, although, frankly, we do have -- we are committed roughly to live within cash flow. If there's a little bit of variability around that, we're willing to exceed cash flow by a minor amount, perhaps, if necessary, supplement with incremental small-scale asset sales. We also -- as you know, we've been hedging significantly more, so that's helped underpin and provide more comfort to the cash flows that we'll have in 2017, but the opportunities are there. We're confident we have the opportunities and there. So I'd say that delta is a really more commodity price driven than opportunity-driven."

We are driven by getting good returns for every dollar in our capital program, but we feel that we have the opportunities. We can further drive up activity in both of those areas, plus we have other areas that we are not funding right now as much as could be if we had higher cash flow levels. They already have returned well above the cost of capital, but they just don't compete as well with the Delaware Basin and the STACK. And the Rockies, we are starting to fund now with one rig. We can add activity there with strong returns. And even the Barnett, and we laid out some numbers in the operations report, how we're driving down the cost there.

The incremental capital going to 15 to 20 rigs which really kind of rough numbers increases the capital budget, they would be 10 rigs if we stayed flat there for the year, probably around $1.6 billion versus going to 20, it'd be around $2 billion. That incremental dollar is really driving 2018 volumes, which is why we're really excited just because of the timing of how long it takes to bring these wells on production.

I can tell you, we want to get a greater sense of the inventory, particularly in the STACK and the Delaware Basin where we are doing these spacing tests and the STACK play, both between the Meramec. You see also there is now Woodford oil for potential developing underneath the STACK. We want to get a sense of that and how many zones in the Meramec are going to work, we've laid out that we're testing up to 8wells per section in the primary and 6 in the secondary in the Meramec. We're talking about our Woodford zone there. And then in the Wolfcamp, we talked about the Leonard and testing how many zones in the Leonard may work as well as the fact that the Wolfcamp have 9,000 on risk locations there and we moved around 500 or so into risk locations. That's going to continue to grow. That's going to take -- we're starting to get a better feel for that probably the mid next year. The other -- so that's one factor in it, and then the other big factor is really long-term commodity prices because you can see the leverage to the cash flow that we have from the operations report. The levers we have to higher cash flow at higher commodity prices, which is the highest leverage in the industry. And so where do we think long-term commodity prices are going to level out has a big impact on what cash flow we're going to have, which has a big impact on how many other opportunities that we can fund and other areas that already have potential returns well above the cost of capital. They're just not as big as the Delaware and the STACK. Now we want to get a bit better hand over both of those variables probably mid-2017 in the areas before we make any strategic calls."

So we're utilizing a lot of that information. We do participate in some nonoperated activity in there. So we're getting a good feel of the potential in the Wolfcamp. I think some of the things that we're still anxious to understand through some of our pilot work that we'll engage in will be the vertical connectivity between that very thick Wolfcamp column. We know that a lot of the 2,000 wells drilled and we drilled some of them in the Mexico side as well we just haven't really prosecuted that in our development plan, but we know that from the XY through the upper through the lower portion of the Wolfcamp, it's all productive. And so it would really be a matter of the development style that we choose to engage in. I think one of the elements that we're incorporating into our thoughts as we go into 2017 is bringing in an aggressive approach from the Leonard A, B and C internals. We've got a STACK piloting engaged right now to help us understand the vertical connectivity. We spent most of our time in the B zone. Industry spent most of their activity in the C. So we know each of the 3 intervals are productive. We're seeing some encouraging results. We're not commenting on that because the day is pretty young right now.

Also about midway between the Northeast of our position and the far southwest, there's some subsurface intricacies that make us run a third casing string. So as you move up into the old Ridge area, there's a very important data point there, that we wanted to highlight simply because the oil cut is 60%. We really haven't valued that in our thoughts about the Meramec. But as you can see out there, we think there could be substantial NAV add if you move that high oil cut across the upper portion of our Meramec play. So this really sets us up for that stacked development from the 5 intervals in the Meramec and the Woodford. Also unique about Ricky's Ridge, it was a 10,000-foot Woodford test. We incorporated 70 stages in that frac design and pumped about 2,600 pounds per foot of sand. So it was a pretty aggressive attempt to see what we could do there. We're very happy with the results.

We think that, that could be mid- to high-single digits especially in the simulation area. And I'll tell you a few other things that we're doing to mitigate those cost increases on the capital side. As you said, we talked about proactive securing equipment and crews to competitive prices, and we're locking in rates and terms where it makes sense, given our outlook right now. so for example, on the rig side, we've locked in 2 long-term agreements for these rigs at current market rates. And then Tony talking about the LOE said that we were unbundling the water transport and water disposal, but we're doing unbundling on the capital side too in the stimulation area. And we've recently started this where we're contracting separately for pressure pumping, sand chemicals and diesel, taking out the markup of the bundling. And while it's new and we don't have a lot of data yet, what we're realizing what we see right now is about 10% saving from that unbundling. So we're probably -- we'll look to do maybe more of that but we're very encouraged with those results."

Pete, I would tell you, I'm really excited about the work we do. And we talked a little bit about the passion for the technical work that our operating teams do. But on the drilling side of the business, we just stood up a Delaware rig and have now drilled 3 wells from spud to TD. Those used to take 17 days to complete. All 3 of these are averaging about 10 days now. That's really an approach to an optimized designs that we've had the luxury of trying to a lot more subsurface data than we've had in the past. It's also reflective of really the granular detail towards the execution of our business. And Pete, I think we talked to you about the well center there. So we're getting a lot of efficiencies both on the drill side of the business but also on the completion side of the business. And all that passion for data acquisition and integrating that into 3-dimensional earth models and picking the right landing zone and designing more optimized or better frac designs, all that's paying off. And we're also putting a lot of potential into the execution portion of that completion space. We monitor all of the operations on the frac. We monitor all of the data on the flowback of the wells in great detail. We have also recently incorporated the drill out -- coil tubing drilled out data in our WellCon center. So we think that is another potential savings there. So while Sue has mentioned that the industry is going to have some tension on cost, we think from a technical work that we're doing, we got the ability to offset that in '17 and very excited about additional enhancements that will be available to us for more of that type of work in the second half of '17 and '18."

In Q1 of this year, we're down to 22 wells brought on in the quarter. Second quarter is only 5. Third quarter is only 5. So we've seen the rate drop off there, but it has now stabilized and we have 4 frac crews in the field that are lowering our inventory down. That's being done for a couple of purposes, but the primary purpose is to get information on the standard lateral approach to the development which is incorporating the upper Eagle Ford. And that information we're looking forward to having in '17 which will shape what I think will be an accelerated pace of activity in the second half of '17, which will have the potential for material rate impact going into '18. Looking forward, we are continuing to improve our completion designs. Historically, we have pumped pretty much -- roughly 2,000-pound per lateral foot type of job. We've moved that to more of a hybrid type fluid and we're increasing the proppant load up to close to 3,000 pounds per lateral foot at this point, so a substantial change to the completions. The wells are just now starting to flow back on a few of those new completions. We're not ready to talk about that, but we're highly encouraged that some of the well rates that you've seen as reported in the past, we're going to materially beat as we go forward.

And so we did take a pause in our activity as commodity prices ramped down and our focus has gone to STACK and Delaware. We've continued to work less the subsurface portion of that. We have an extensive 3D coverage across that entire basin. So we have what I think will be unparalleled knowledge about the subsurface there. After the acquisition, we doubled our position there and it's all Tier 1 opportunity connected, and we've got about 3 rig lines ready to go. It's a matter of managing the portfolio and staying within our cash flows. So we think it's a great -- an asset. You've seen some transactions happen in the powder, which further confirm what we think the ultimate value in the powder position will be. So while it won't ever have the scale and materially that we'll see in the STACK or Delaware Basin, it's got outstanding returns, and we're looking forward to showing you additional subsurface results."

And so there are up to about 14 nonproductive intervals in that Delaware Basin column, Bob. And so when you look at the number of unrisked locations that we've highlighted of 20,000, there's got to be more compelling development play going forward to accelerate present value. So that's the concept that we are looking forward to. The way we're designing the track process is highly flexible between what we need to get done in the Delaware which has some additional challenges with the federal permitting, but the concept between -- the concept of track will be applied both in the Delaware and STACK on both of those STACK developments. So it's hard to tell you exactly how many wells per pad, but I could see us putting may be up to 30 wells in a given section. We'll utilize very efficient drilling pads coupled with more of a centralized tank battery. So we'll see quite a few advantages.

Devon delivered another outstanding performance in the third quarter, both operationally and financially. Our development programs delivered the best quarterly drill-bit results in Devon's 45-year history, with new",1132,"Thank you, Scott, and welcome, everyone. Devon delivered another outstanding performance in the third quarter, both operationally and financially. Our development programs delivered the best quarterly drill-bit results in Devon's 45-year history, with new wells reaching peak 30-day rates of nearly 2,000 BOE per day. These prolific drilling results were centered in our world-class STACK play where production increased by nearly 40% year-over-year. Furthermore, the value of Devon's production continues to be enhanced by substantial cost savings achieved during the quarter. We are now on pace to reduce operating and G&A costs by $1 billion for the full year, which provides an uplift to our margins of nearly $5 per BOE produced. 
In addition to our strong operating performance, another important accomplishment for Devon was the recent completion of our $3.2 billion asset divestiture program. These accretive transactions significantly strengthen our investment-grade position. And as a result, our net debt has now declined by 45% since the beginning of the year. To further enhance our financial position going forward, we've also been much more active building out our hedging position with the recent increase in commodity prices. 
With a more focused asset base and improved balance sheet, the next step in our strategic plan is to accelerate investment in our world-class onshore resource plays. By the end of next month, we plan to have 10 operated rigs running, focused within our top 2 franchise assets, the STACK and Delaware Basin. 
Looking ahead to 2017, we are still working toward finalizing the details of our operating and capital plans. However, I can tell you that at $55 WTI pricing, our upstream cash flow in 2017 including EnLink distributions is projected to expand by more than 100% year-over-year to around $2.5 billion. Under this scenario, we would steadily ramp up drilling activity over the next several quarters to as many as 15 to 20 operated rigs in the U.S. by year-end 2017. This program would represent upstream capital spending of around $2 billion, allowing us to invest within available cash flow. 
On a retained asset basis, this focused investment and higher-margin projects is expected to drive double-digit oil growth in the U.S. in 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, which marks the low point in Devon's production profile. As a result of this growth in oil volumes, top line production in 2017 will range from low to mid-single-digit growth compared to Q4 2016. This range is dependent upon our level of ethane rejection during the year. Importantly, this capital plan is designed to create operational momentum at much stronger growth rates heading into 2018. At a $60 WTI price point in 2018, our upstream cash flow has a potential to reach $3.5 billion, a greater than 200% increase from today's levels. Under this scenario in 2018, we would continue to aggressively ramp up our drilling programs within the U.S. with the majority of this capital directed toward the STACK and Delaware Basin. This low-risk drilling activity is expected to drive production growth of greater than 30% from our STACK and Delaware Basin assets in 2018. This strong growth would further transition Devon's product mix toward higher-margin light oil production in the U.S. 
Now I want to be very clear. While we're excited about the outstanding growth prospects that reside within our portfolio, our capital allocation will be focused on value and rates of return, not the pursuit of top line production growth. And if commodity price volatility continues, our capital programs have significant flexibility with no long cycle project commitments and negligible leasehold expiration issues. This flexibility allows us to be nimble and tailor activity to invest directionally within cash flow. 
Another strategic imperative for Devon in the upcoming year is to further delineate and better characterize the growing resource base associated with our U.S. resource plays. Between the STACK and Delaware Basin alone, we have exposure to more than 1 million net acres and thousands of development-ready drilling locations that are highly economic at today's prices. To advance our understanding of the ultimate recovery and resource potential within these 2 world-class plays, we have an important appraisal work underway. In the STACK, this catalyst-rich activity is concentrated on the Meramec infill spacing pilots and further derisking of the Woodford oil window. 
In the Delaware Basin, the Leonard Shale opportunities, that continues to expand and we are now falling back on our first stack lateral test that will help shape our view on how to best develop the three prospective landing zones in this oil-rich shale. 
2017 will also be a breakout year for our Delaware Basin Wolfcamp program as we begin to actively develop this emerging play. The Wolfcamp will have a material impact to Devon's resource potential in the Delaware and we are excited about progressing our understanding of the 9,000-plus potential locations we have identified in this play. 
The bottom line is that Devon's asset portfolio has never been in better shape than it is today and I believe that the quality and depth of our opportunity set is unmatched in the industry. We possess thousands of undrilled locations that are extremely well positioned on the North American cost curve. This high rate of return inventory will continue to expand as we derisk the tremendous resource upside associated with our STACK and Delaware Basin assets. With this resource expansion, it could necessitate additional high grading of our portfolio, monetizing less competitive assets and accelerating the development of our highest rate of return inventory. 
So in summary, before we move to Q&A, I want to leave you with a few key messages from today's call. First, our improved financial positioning now allows us to aggressively accelerate drilling activity across our best-in-class resource plays, while continuing to focus on the value and rate of return of each investment. These accelerated drilling plans will drive attractive cash flow growth in 2017 and 2018 compared to today's level and continue to transition Devon's product mix toward higher-margin, light oil production in the U.S. 
In conjunction with our shift to higher-margin production, do not lose sight of our peer group leading leverage to rising commodity prices. For every $1 increase in realized price on a per BOE basis, Devon generates more than $200 million of incremental cash flow annually. 
Looking beyond prices, Devon is also catalyst-rich over the next several quarters as we further delineate the massive resource upside associated with the STACK and Delaware Basin positions. 
And finally, with the continued growth in the quality and depth of our resource base, we expect to have an overabundance of opportunities. If this is the case, we are very willing to further high-grade our portfolio and deploy additional investment toward the best projects in our portfolio. With that, I'll turn the call back to Scott."

So that the 10 at the year-end 2016 is essentially set and we are executing that. I think it's important to understand there's really the 10 rigs plus the completion activity that we are conducting is really driving our 2017 volumes. And so that's why we're are very excited about the -- and confident on the volumes that we've talked about in the operations report. The ramp-up to the 15 to 20 rigs really won't add production in 2017, but that's why we're so excited about 2018 as we do ramp up to that level. That's what's going to provide the even higher growth levels as we move into 2018 led by more than 30% growth in the STACK and the Delaware. Now the variability around that is really more, at this point, I'd say more commodity price driven, although, frankly, we do have -- we are committed roughly to live within cash flow. If there's a little bit of variability around that, we're willing to exceed cash flow by a minor amount, perhaps, if necessary, supplement with incremental small-scale asset sales. We also -- as you know, we've been hedging significantly more, so that's helped underpin and provide more comfort to the cash flows that we'll have in 2017, but the opportunities are there. We're confident we have the opportunities there. So I'd say that delta is really more commodity price driven than opportunity-driven."

They are already have returned well above the cost of capital, but they just don't compete as well with the Delaware Basin and the STACK. And the Rockies, we are starting to fund now with one rig. We can add activity there with strong returns. And even the Barnett, and we laid out some numbers in the operations report, how we're driving down the cost there. And we think we have a program that we can do both on the horizontal refracs from additional drilling locations but right now we are well above the cost of capital there.  Its just not as good as the Delaware Basin and STACK, so we are focusing our capital there because they're the highest returns. So we do not have a shortage of opportunities. And so I think we would -- if prices are even higher, we look at funding some of those opportunities as well."

I don't want to labor and take too much time here, but I do want to be clear what I'm asking because one of your competitors is talking about  a midcycle sort of $55 level. I realize that's totally subjective, but their point is in the higher oil price environment, the industry got itself into a bit of a mess by growing too quickly and they would look upon that as a windfall and would not joke around their rig count with a view to longer-term sustainable growth. What I'm hearing from you is that you would respond to high oil price with higher activity levels. I guess my question is, is that what the industry wants to see? Is high growth just going to keep this oil price? Probably we got right now or is it an argument that says, what was the growth or level and return any perceived ""windfall"" to shareholders? I guess that's what I really want to ask."

We didn't pay enough attention to the fundamental economics, and so I don't think it's so much the activity at in and of itself is the fact that this activity level was really going towards projects that didn't provide the returns that they should. And so I can tell you here at Devon, we are very, very focused on returns and we're very, very focused on the reservoir and making sure that each project that we do is going to provide good returns. So I don't necessarily think it as a problem as long as you can -- on an individual company level, as long as you can be confident you can provide good returns. I think what really happens at $90 oil, all these projects we're funding -- been funded were not providing good returns. We're overcapitalizing some of these fields, frankly, and that's what the big issue was."

I did say in my opening remarks there that the capital in 207 we anticipate being around $2 billion of E&P spend, but it is also important to understand that really, the volumes in '17 are being primarily driven by the completion work that we currently have ongoing and specifically the Eagle Ford but also other areas. And then in addition to that, the 10 rigs that we're going to have working by the end of this year. The incremental capital going to 15 to 20 rigs which really kind of rough numbers increases the capital budget, there would be 10 rigs if we stayed flat there for the year, probably around $1.6 billion versus going to 20, it'd be around $2 billion. That incremental dollar is really driving 2018 volumes, which is why we're really excited just because of the timing of how long it takes to bring these wells on production. So it's not really a matter of $2 billion that's needed to drive those 2017 volumes. We could do that at a lower level.

I can tell you, we want to get a greater sense of the inventory, particularly in the STACK and the Delaware Basin where we are doing these spacing tests and the STACK play, both between the Meramec. You see also there is now Woodford oil potential that'sdeveloping underneath the STACK. Want to get a sense of that and how many zones in the Meramec are going to work, we've laid out that we're testing up to 8 wells per section in the primary and 6 in the secondary in the Meramec. We're talking about our Woodford zone there. And then in the Wolfcamp, we talked about the Leonard and testing how many zones in the Leonard may work as well as the fact that the Wolfcamp is -- we have 9,000 on risk locations there, with 500 or so into risk locations. That's going to continue to grow. That's going to take toll -- start getting a better feel for that probably the mid next year. The other -- so that's one factor in it, and then the other big factor in it is really long-term commodity prices because you can see the leverage to the cash flow that we have from the operations report. The levers we have to higher cash flow at higher commodity prices, which is the highest leverage in the industry. And so where do we think long-term commodity prices are going to level out has a big impact on what cash flow we're going to have, which has a big impact on how many other opportunities that we can fund and other areas that already have potential returns well above the cost of capital. They're just not as big as the Delaware and the STACK. Now we want to get a bit better handle for both of those variables probably mid-2017 into areas before we make any strategic calls."

And I'd have to say that the industry has done an outstanding job of derisking the play. It's moved from the Texas side of the basin up to the state line and now north of that state line. So we're utilizing a lot of that information. We do participate in some non-operated activity in there. So we're getting a good feel of the potential in the Wolfcamp. I think some of the things that we're still anxious to understand through some of our pilot work that we'll engage in will be the vertical connectivity between that very thick Wolfcamp column. We know that while the 2,000 wells drilled and we drilled some of them in the Mexico side as well we just haven't really prosecuted that in our development plan, but we know that from the XY through the upper through the lower portion of the Wolfcamp, it's all productive. And so it would really be a matter of the development style that we choose to engage in. In fact one of the elements that we're incorporating into our thoughts as we go into 2017 is bringing in an aggressive approach from the Leonard A, B and C intervals. We've got a STACK piloting and engaged right now to help us understand the vertical connectivity. We spent most of our time in the B zone. Industry has spent most of their activity in the C. So we know each of the 3 intervals are productive. We're seeing some encouraging results. We're not commenting on that because the data is pretty young right now. We'll come back out and clear up the results of that soon. But we'll incorporate the 3 intervals in the Leonard with typical work that we do in the Bone Spring in the 2 -- in the southern portion of the 2 Mexico counties and have a pretty aggressive approach into the Wolfcamp in both the rattlesnake and Aveda areas will be the first 2 areas that we engage in Wolfcamp."

Also about midway between the Northeast of our position and the far southwest, there's some subsurface intricacies that make us run a third casing string. So as you move up into the Old Ricky's Ridge area, its a very important data point there, that we wanted to highlight simply because the oil cut is 60%. We really hadn't valued that in our thoughts about the Meramec. But as you can see out there, we think there could be substantial NAV add if you move that high oil cut across the upper portion of our Meramec play. So this really sets us up for that stacked development from the 5 intervals in the Meramec and the Woodford. Also unique about Ricky's Ridge, it was a 10,000-foot Woodford test. We incorporated 70 stages in that frac design and pumped about 2,600 pounds per foot of sand. So it was a pretty aggressive attempt to see what we could do there. We're very happy with the results.

We think that, that could be mid- to high-single digits especially in the simulation area. And I'll tell you a few other things that we're doing to mitigate those cost increases on the capital side. As you said, we talked about proactively securing equipment and crews to competitive prices, and we're locking in rates and terms where it makes sense, given our outlook right now. So for example, on the rig side, we've locked-in 2 long-term agreements for these rigs at current market rates. And then Tony talking about the LOE said that we were unbundling the water transport and water disposal, well we are doing unbundling on the capital side too in the stimulation area. And we've recently started this where we're contracting separately for pressure pumping, sand chemicals and diesel, taking out the markup of the bundling. And while it's new and we don't have a lot of data yet, what we're realizing what we see right now is about 10% saving from that unbundling. So we're probably -- we'll look to do maybe more of that but we're very encouraged with those results."

Pete, I would tell you, I'm really excited about the work we do. And we talked a little bit about the passion for the technical work that our operating teams do. But on the drilling side of the business, we just stood up a Delaware rig and have now drilled 3 wells from spud to TD. Those used to take 17 days to complete. All 3 of these are averaging about 10 days now. That's really an approach to an optimized designs that we've had the luxury of trying to a lot more subsurface data than we've had in the past. It's also reflective of really the granular detail towards the execution of our business. And Pete, I think we talked to you about the WellCon center there. So we're getting a lot of efficiencies both on the drill side of the business but also on the completion side of the business. And all that passion for data acquisition and integrating that into 3-dimensional earth models and picking the right landing zone and designing more optimized or better frac designs, all that's paying off. And we're also putting a lot of attention into the execution portion of that completion space. We monitor all of the operations on the frac. We monitor all of the data on the flowback of the wells in great detail. We have also recently incorporated the drill out -- coiled tubing drill out data in our WellCon center. So we think that's another potential savings there. So while Sue has mentioned that the industry is going to have some tension on cost, we think from a technical work that we're doing, we got the ability to offset that in '17 and very excited about additional enhancements that will be available to us for more of that type of work in the second half of '17 and '18."

In Q1 of this year, we're down to 22 wells brought on in the quarter. Second quarter is only 5. Third quarter is only 5. So we've seen the rate drop off there, but it has now stabilized and we have 4 frac crews in the field that are lowering our DUC inventory down. That's being done for a couple of purposes, but the primary purpose is to get information on the staggered lateral approach to the development end which is incorporating the upper Eagle Ford. And that information we're looking forward to having in '17 which will shape, what I think will be, an accelerated pace of activity in the second half of '17, which will have the potential for a material rate impact going into '18. We are looking forward, we are continuing to improve our completion designs. Historically, we have pumped pretty much -- roughly 2,000-pound per lateral foot type of job. We've moved that to more of a hybrid type fluid and we're increasing the proppant load up to close to 3,000 pounds per lateral foot at this point, so a substantial change to the completions. The wells are just now starting to flow back on a few of those new completions. We're not ready to talk about that, but we're highly encouraged that some of the well rates that you've seen as reported in the past, we're going to materially beat as we go forward.

And so there are up to about 14 nonproductive intervals in that Delaware Basin column, Bob. And so when you look at the number of unrisked locations that we've highlighted of 20,000, there's got to be more compelling development play going forward to accelerate present value. So that's the concept that we are looking forward to. The way we're designing the track process is highly flexible between what we need to get done in the Delaware which has some additional challenges with the federal permitting, but the concept between -- the concept of track will be applied both in the Delaware and STACK on both of those STACK developments. So it's hard to tell you exactly how many wells per pad, but I could see us putting may be up to 30 wells in a given section. We'll utilize very efficient drilling pads coupled with a more of a centralized tank battery. So we'll see quite a few advantages. We tried to highlight the advantages in our operating reports, so you can take a look at that."

Devon delivered another outstanding performance in the third quarter, both operationally and financially. Our development programs delivered the best quarterly drill-bit results in Devon's 45-year history, with new",1132,"Thank you, Scott, and welcome, everyone. Devon delivered another outstanding performance in the third quarter, both operationally and financially. Our development programs delivered the best quarterly drill-bit results in Devon's 45-year history, with new wells reaching peak 30-day rates of nearly 2,000 BOE per day. These prolific drilling results were centered in our world-class STACK play where production increased by nearly 40% year-over-year. Furthermore, the value of Devon's production continues to be enhanced by substantial cost savings achieved during the quarter. We are now on pace to reduce operating and G&A costs by $1 billion for the full year, which provides an uplift to our margins of nearly $5 per BOE produced. 
In addition to our strong operating performance, another important accomplishment for Devon was the recent completion of our $3.2 billion asset divestiture program. These accretive transactions significantly strengthen our investment-grade position. And as a result, our net debt has now declined by 45% since the beginning of the year. To further enhance our financial position going forward, we've also been much more active building out our hedging position with the recent increase in commodity prices. 
With a more focused asset base and improved balance sheet, the next step in our strategic plan is to accelerate investment in our world-class onshore resource plays. By the end of next month, we plan to have 10 operated rigs running, focused within our top 2 franchise assets, the STACK and Delaware Basin. 
Looking ahead to 2017, we are still working toward finalizing the details of our operating and capital plans. However, I can tell you that at $55 WTI pricing, our upstream cash flow in 2017 including EnLink distributions is projected to expand by more than 100% year-over-year to around $2.5 billion. Under this scenario, we would steadily ramp up drilling activity over the next several quarters to as many as 15 to 20 operated rigs in the U.S. by year-end 2017. This program would represent upstream capital spending of around $2 billion, allowing us to invest within available cash flow. 
On a retained asset basis, this focused investment in higher-margin projects is expected to drive double-digit oil growth in the U.S. in 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, which marks the low point in Devon's production profile. As a result of this growth in oil volumes, top line production in 2017 will range from low to mid-single-digit growth compared to Q4 2016. This range is dependent upon our level of ethane rejection during the year. Importantly, this capital plan is designed to create operational momentum at much stronger growth rates heading into 2018. At a $60 WTI price point in 2018, our upstream cash flow has a potential to reach $3.5 billion, a greater than 200% increase from today's levels. Under this scenario in 2018, we would continue to aggressively ramp up our drilling programs within the U.S. with the majority of this capital directed toward the STACK and Delaware Basin. This low-risk drilling activity is expected to drive production growth of greater than 30% from our STACK and Delaware Basin assets in 2018. This strong growth would further transition Devon's product mix toward higher-margin light oil production in the U.S. 
Now I want to be very clear. While we're excited about the outstanding growth prospects that reside within our portfolio, our capital allocation will be focused on value and rates of return, not the pursuit of top line production growth. And if commodity price volatility continues, our capital programs have significant flexibility with no long cycle project commitments and negligible leasehold expiration issues. This flexibility allows us to be nimble and tailor activity to invest directionally within cash flow. 
Another strategic imperative for Devon in the upcoming year is to further delineate and better characterize the growing resource base associated with our U.S. resource plays. Between the STACK and Delaware Basin alone, we have exposure to more than 1 million net acres and thousands of development-ready drilling locations that are highly economic at today's prices. To advance our understanding of the ultimate recovery and resource potential within these 2 world-class plays, we have an important appraisal work underway. In the STACK, this catalyst-rich activity is concentrated on the Meramec infill spacing pilots and further derisking of the Woodford oil window. 
In the Delaware Basin, the Leonard Shale opportunities set continues to expand and we are now falling back on our first stack lateral test that will help shape our view on how to best develop the three prospective landing zones in this oil-rich shale. 
2017 will also be a breakout year for our Delaware Basin Wolfcamp program as we begin to actively develop this emerging play. The Wolfcamp will have a material impact to Devon's resource potential in the Delaware and we are excited about progressing our understanding of the 9,000-plus potential locations we have identified in this play. 
The bottom line is that Devon's asset portfolio has never been in better shape than it is today and I believe that the quality and depth of our opportunity set is unmatched in the industry. We possess thousands of undrilled locations that are extremely well positioned on the North American cost curve. This high rate of return inventory will continue to expand as we derisk the tremendous resource upside associated with our STACK and Delaware Basin assets. With this resource expansion, it could necessitate additional high grading of our portfolio, monetizing less competitive assets and accelerating the development of our highest rate of return inventory. 
So in summary, before we move to Q&A, I want to leave you with a few key messages from today's call. First, our improved financial positioning now allows us to aggressively accelerate drilling activity across our best-in-class resource plays, while continuing to focus on the value and rate of return of each investment. These accelerated drilling plans will drive attractive cash flow growth in 2017 and 2018 compared to today's level and continue to transition Devon's product mix toward higher-margin, light oil production in the U.S. 
In conjunction with our shift to higher-margin production, do not lose sight of our peer group leading leverage to rising commodity prices. For every $1 increase in realized price on a per BOE basis, Devon generates more than $200 million of incremental cash flow annually. 
Looking beyond prices, Devon is also catalyst-rich over the next several quarters as we further delineate the massive resource upside associated with the STACK and Delaware Basin positions. 
And finally, with the continued growth in the quality and depth of our resource base, we expect to have an overabundance of opportunities. If this is the case, we are very willing to further high-grade our portfolio and deploy additional investment toward the best projects in our portfolio. With that, I'll turn the call back to Scott."

So  the 10 at the year-end 2016 is essentially set and we are executing that.

And so that's why we're are very excited about the -- and confident on the volumes that we've talked about in the operations report. The ramp-up to the 15 to 20 rigs really won't add production in 2017, but that's why we're so excited about 2018 as we do ramp up to that level. That's what's going to provide the even higher growth levels as we move into 2018 led by more than 30% growth in the STACK and the Delaware. Now the variability around that is really more, at this point, I'd say more commodity price driven, although, frankly, we do have -- we are committed roughly to live within cash flow. If there's a little bit of variability around that, we're willing to exceed cash flow by a minor amount, perhaps, if necessary, supplement with incremental small-scale asset sales. We also -- as you know, we've been hedging significantly more, so that's helped underpin and provide more comfort to the cash flows that we'll have in 2017, but the opportunities are there. We're confident we have the opportunities there. So I'd say that delta is really more commodity price driven than opportunity-driven."

We can add activity there with strong returns. And even the Barnett, and we laid out some numbers in the operations report, how we're driving down the cost there.

What I'm hearing from you is that you would respond to high oil price with higher activity levels. I guess my question is, is that what the industry wants to see? Is high growth just going to keep this oil price and the problem we got right now or is it an argument that says, what was the growth level and return any perceived ""windfall"" to shareholders? I guess that's really what I'm asking."

We didn't pay enough attention to the fundamental economics, and so I don't think it's so much the activity level in and of itself -- it's the fact that this activity level was really going towards projects that didn't provide the returns that they should. And so I can tell you here at Devon, we are very, very focused on returns and we're very, very focused on the reservoir and making sure that each project that we do is going to provide good returns. So I don't necessarily think it as a problem as long as you can -- on an individual company level, as long as you can be confident you can provide good returns. I think what really happens at $90 oil, all these projects we're funding -- being funded were not providing good returns. We're overcapitalizing some of these fields, frankly, and that's what the big issue was."

We've continued to build out our infrastructure and have more water in pipe now. We have a better power grid system and especially in the Delaware Basin. All that's tending to drive cost down.

I did say in my opening remarks there that the capital in 207 we anticipate being around $2 billion of E&P spend, but it is also important to understand that really, the volumes in '17 are being primarily driven by the completion work that we currently have ongoing and specifically at Eagle Ford but also other areas. And then in addition to that, the 10 rigs that we're going to have working by the end of this year. The incremental capital going to 15 to 20 rigs which really kind of rough numbers increases the capital budget, there would be 10 rigs if we stayed flat there for the year, probably around $1.6 billion versus going to 20, it'd be around $2 billion. That incremental dollar is really driving 2018 volumes, which is why we're really excited just because of the timing of how long it takes to bring these wells on production. So it's not really a matter of $2 billion that's needed to drive those 2017 volumes. We could do that at a lower level.

Well, there are a lot of variables that go into this equation. I can tell you, we want to get a greater sense of the inventory, particularly in the STACK and the Delaware Basin where we are doing these spacing tests and the STACK play, both between the Meramec. You see also there is now Woodford oil potential that's developing underneath the STACK. Want to get a sense for that and how many zones in the Meramec are going to work, we've laid out that we're testing up to 8 wells per section in the primary and 6 in the secondary in the Meramec. Now we're talking about a Woodford zone there. And then in the Wolfcamp, we talked about the Leonard and testing how many zones in the Leonard may work as well as the fact that the Wolfcamp is -- we have 9,000 on risk locations there and we've mode about 500 or so into risk locations. That's going to continue to grow. That's going to take toll -- start getting a better feel for that probably the mid next year. The other -- so that's one factor in it, and then the other big factor in it is really long-term commodity prices because you can see the leverage to the cash flow that we have from the operations report. The levers we have to higher cash flow at higher commodity prices, which is the highest leverage in the industry. And so where do we think long-term commodity prices are going to level out has a big impact on what cash flow we're going to have, which has a big impact on how many other opportunities that we can fund in other areas that already have potential returns well above the cost of capital. They're just not as big as the Delaware and the STACK. But we want to get a bit better handle from both of those variables probably mid-2017 into at the earliest before we make any strategic calls."

And I'd have to say that the industry has done an outstanding job of derisking the play. It's moved from the Texas side of the basin up to the state line and now north of that state line. So we're utilizing a lot of that information. We do participate in some non-operated activity in there. So we're getting a good feel of the potential in the Wolfcamp. I think some of the things that we're still anxious to understand through some of our pilot work that we'll engage in will be the vertical connectivity between that very thick Wolfcamp column. We know that out of the 2,000 wells drilled and we've drilled some of them in the Mexico side as well -- we just haven't really prosecuted that in our development plan -- but we know that from the XY [ph] through the upper -- through the lower portion of the Wolfcamp, it's all productive. And so it would really be a matter of the development style that we choose to engage in. I think one of the elements that we're incorporating into our thoughts as we go into 2017 is bringing in an aggressive approach from the Leonard A, B and C intervals. We've got a STACK piloting and engaged right now to help us understand the vertical connectivity. We spent most of our time in the B zone. Industry has spent most of their activity in the C. So we know each of the 3 intervals are productive. We're seeing some encouraging results. We're not commenting on that because the data is pretty young right now. We'll come back out and clear up the results of that soon. But we'll incorporate the 3 intervals in the Leonard with typical work that we do in the Bone Spring in the 2 -- in the southern portion of the 2 New Mexico counties and have a pretty aggressive approach into the Wolfcamp in both the Rattlesnake and Mi Vida areas.

The depth does run from the shallow being in the East to the Northeast to the Southwest as you described. Also about midway between the Northeast of our position and the far southwest, there's some subsurface intricacies that make us run a third casing string. So as you move up into the Old Ricky's Ridge area, it's a very important data point there that we wanted to highlight simply because the oil cut is 60%. We really hadn't valued that in our thoughts about the Meramec. But as you can see out there, we think there could be substantial NAV add if you move that high oil cut across the upper portion of our Meramec play. So this really sets us up for that stacked development from the 5 intervals in the Meramec and the Woodford. Also unique about Ricky's Ridge, it was a 10,000-foot Woodford test. We incorporated 70 stages in that frac design and pumped about 2,600 pounds per foot of sand. So it was a pretty aggressive attempt to see what we could do there. We're very happy with the results. You can see some of the 90-day IP is solid but the more important thing is the production profile is flat and much more optimistic than our initial expectations.

We think that, that could be mid- to high-single digits especially in the stimulation area. And I'll tell you a few other things that we're doing to mitigate those cost increases on the capital side. We did, as you said, we talked about proactively securing equipment and crews at competitive prices, and we're locking in rates and terms where it makes sense, given our outlook right now. So for example, on the rig side, we've locked-in 2 long-term agreements for these rigs at current market rates. And then Tony talking about the LOE said that we were unbundling the water transport and water disposal -- well we are doing unbundling on the capital side too, in the stimulation area. And we've recently started this where we're contracting separately for pressure pumping, sand chemicals and diesel, taking out the markup of the bundling. And while it's new and we don't have a lot of data yet, what we're realizing what we see right now is about 10% saving from that unbundling. So we're probably -- we'll look to do maybe more of that but we're very encouraged with those results."

Pete, I would tell you, I'm really excited about the work we do. And we talked a little bit about the passion for the technical work that our operating teams do. But on the drilling side of the business, we just stood up a Delaware rig and have now drilled 3 wells from spud to TD. Those used to take 17 days to complete. All 3 of these are averaging about 10 days now. That's really an approach to an optimized designs that we've had the luxury of tying to a lot more subsurface data that we've had in the past. It's also reflective of the really the granular detail towards the execution of our business. And Pete, I think we talked to you about the WellCon center there. So we're getting a lot of efficiencies both on the drill side of the business but also on the completion side of the business. And all that passion for data acquisition and integrating that into 3-dimensional earth models and picking the right landing zone and designing more optimized or better frac designs, all that's paying off. And we're also putting a lot of attention into the execution portion of that completion space. We monitor all of the operations on the frac. We monitor all of the data on the flowback of the wells in great detail. We have also recently incorporated the drill out -- coiled tubing drill out data in our WellCon center. So we think that's another potential savings there. So while Sue has mentioned that the industry is going to have some tension on cost, we think from a technical work that we're doing, we got the ability to offset that in '17 and very excited about additional enhancements that will be available to us for more of that type of work in the second half of '17 and '18."

In Q1 of this year, we're down to 22 wells brought on in the quarter. Second quarter is only 5. Third quarter is only 5. So we've seen the rate drop off there, but it has now stabilized and we have 4 frac crews in the field that are lowering our DUC inventory down. That's being done for a couple of purposes, but the primary purpose is to get information on the staggered lateral approach to the development end which is incorporating the upper Eagle Ford. And that information we're looking forward to having in '17 which will shape, what I think will be, an accelerated pace of activity in the second half of '17, which will have the potential for a material rate impact going into '18. We are looking forward, we are continuing to improve our completion designs. Historically, we have pumped pretty much -- roughly 2,000-pound per lateral foot type of job. We've moved that to more of a hybrid type fluid and we're increasing the proppant load up to close to 3,000 pounds per lateral foot at this point, so a substantial change to the completions. The wells are just now starting to flow back on a few of those new completions. We're not ready to talk about that, but we're highly encouraged that some of the well rates that you've seen as reported in the past, we're going to materially beat as we go forward.

So it's hard to tell you exactly how many wells per pad, but I could see us putting may be up to 30 wells in a given section. We'll utilize very efficient drilling pads coupled with a more of a centralized tank battery. So we'll see quite a few advantages. We tried to highlight the advantages in our operating reports, so you can take a look at that."

Devon delivered another outstanding performance in the third quarter, both operationally and financially. Our development programs delivered the best quarterly drill-bit results in Devon's 45-year history, with new",1132,"Thank you, Scott, and welcome, everyone. Devon delivered another outstanding performance in the third quarter, both operationally and financially. Our development programs delivered the best quarterly drill-bit results in Devon's 45-year history, with new wells reaching peak 30-day rates of nearly 2,000 BOE per day. These prolific drilling results were centered in our world-class STACK play where production increased by nearly 40% year-over-year. Furthermore, the value of Devon's production continues to be enhanced by substantial cost savings achieved during the quarter. We are now on pace to reduce operating and G&A costs by $1 billion for the full year, which provides an uplift to our margins of nearly $5 per BOE produced. 
In addition to our strong operating performance, another important accomplishment for Devon was the recent completion of our $3.2 billion asset divestiture program. These accretive transactions significantly strengthen our investment-grade position. And as a result, our net debt has now declined by 45% since the beginning of the year. To further enhance our financial position going forward, we've also been much more active building out our hedging position with the recent increase in commodity prices. 
With a more focused asset base and improved balance sheet, the next step in our strategic plan is to accelerate investment in our world-class onshore resource plays. By the end of next month, we plan to have 10 operated rigs running, focused within our top 2 franchise assets, the STACK and Delaware Basin. 
Looking ahead to 2017, we are still working toward finalizing the details of our operating and capital plans. However, I can tell you that at $55 WTI pricing, our upstream cash flow in 2017 including EnLink distributions is projected to expand by more than 100% year-over-year to around $2.5 billion. Under this scenario, we would steadily ramp up drilling activity over the next several quarters to as many as 15 to 20 operated rigs in the U.S. by year-end 2017. This program would represent upstream capital spending of around $2 billion, allowing us to invest within available cash flow. 
On a retained asset basis, this focused investment in higher-margin projects is expected to drive double-digit oil growth in the U.S. in 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, which marks the low point in Devon's production profile. As a result of this growth in oil volumes, top line production in 2017 will range from low to mid-single-digit growth compared to Q4 2016. This range is dependent upon our level of ethane rejection during the year. Importantly, this capital plan is designed to create operational momentum at much stronger growth rates heading into 2018. At a $60 WTI price point in 2018, our upstream cash flow has a potential to reach $3.5 billion, a greater than 200% increase from today's levels. Under this scenario in 2018, we would continue to aggressively ramp up our drilling programs within the U.S. with the majority of this capital directed toward the STACK and Delaware Basin. This low-risk drilling activity is expected to drive production growth of greater than 30% from our STACK and Delaware Basin assets in 2018. This strong growth would further transition Devon's product mix toward higher-margin light oil production in the U.S. 
Now I want to be very clear. While we're excited about the outstanding growth prospects that reside within our portfolio, our capital allocation will be focused on value and rates of return, not the pursuit of top line production growth. And if commodity price volatility continues, our capital programs have significant flexibility with no long cycle project commitments and negligible leasehold expiration issues. This flexibility allows us to be nimble and tailor activity to invest directionally within cash flow. 
Another strategic imperative for Devon in the upcoming year is to further delineate and better characterize the growing resource base associated with our U.S. resource plays. Between the STACK and Delaware Basin alone, we have exposure to more than 1 million net acres and thousands of development-ready drilling locations that are highly economic at today's prices. To advance our understanding of the ultimate recovery and resource potential within these 2 world-class plays, we have an important appraisal work underway. In the STACK, this catalyst-rich activity is concentrated on the Meramec infill spacing pilots and further derisking of the Woodford oil window. 
In the Delaware Basin, the Leonard Shale opportunities set continues to expand and we are now falling back on our first stack lateral test that will help shape our view on how to best develop the three prospective landing zones in this oil-rich shale. 
2017 will also be a breakout year for our Delaware Basin Wolfcamp program as we begin to actively develop this emerging play. The Wolfcamp will have a material impact to Devon's resource potential in the Delaware and we are excited about progressing our understanding of the 9,000-plus potential locations we have identified in this play. 
The bottom line is that Devon's asset portfolio has never been in better shape than it is today and I believe that the quality and depth of our opportunity set is unmatched in the industry. We possess thousands of undrilled locations that are extremely well positioned on the North American cost curve. This high rate of return inventory will continue to expand as we derisk the tremendous resource upside associated with our STACK and Delaware Basin assets. With this resource expansion, it could necessitate additional high grading of our portfolio, monetizing less competitive assets and accelerating the development of our highest rate of return inventory. 
So in summary, before we move to Q&A, I want to leave you with a few key messages from today's call. First, our improved financial positioning now allows us to aggressively accelerate drilling activity across our best-in-class resource plays, while continuing to focus on the value and rate of return of each investment. These accelerated drilling plans will drive attractive cash flow growth in 2017 and 2018 compared to today's level and continue to transition Devon's product mix toward higher-margin, light oil production in the U.S. 
In conjunction with our shift to higher-margin production, do not lose sight of our peer group leading leverage to rising commodity prices. For every $1 increase in realized price on a per BOE basis, Devon generates more than $200 million of incremental cash flow annually. 
Looking beyond prices, Devon is also catalyst-rich over the next several quarters as we further delineate the massive resource upside associated with the STACK and Delaware Basin positions. 
And finally, with the continued growth in the quality and depth of our resource base, we expect to have an overabundance of opportunities. If this is the case, we are very willing to further high-grade our portfolio and deploy additional investment toward the best projects in our portfolio. 
With that, I'll turn the call back to Scott."

So the 10 at the year-end 2016 is essentially set and we are executing that. I think it's important to understand there's really the 10 rigs plus the completion activity that we are conducting is really driving our 2017 volumes. And so that's why we're very excited about the -- and confident on the volumes that we've talked about in the operations report. The ramp-up to the 15 to 20 rigs really won't add production in 2017, but that's why we're so excited about 2018 as we do ramp up to that level. That's what's going to provide the even higher growth levels as we move into 2018 led by more than 30% growth in the STACK and the Delaware. Now the variability around that is really more, at this point, I'd say more commodity price driven, although, frankly, we do have -- we are committed roughly to live within cash flow. If there's a little bit of variability around that, we're willing to exceed cash flow by a minor amount, perhaps, if necessary, supplement with incremental small-scale asset sales. We also -- as you know, we've been hedging significantly more, so that's helped underpin and provide more comfort to the cash flows that we'll have in 2017, but the opportunities are there. We're confident we have the opportunities there. So I'd say that delta is really more commodity price driven than opportunity-driven."

We can further drive up activity in both of those areas, plus we have other areas that we are not funding right now as much could be if we had higher cash flow levels. They already have returned well above the cost of capital, but they just don't compete as well with the Delaware Basin and the STACK. And the Rockies, we are starting to fund now with one rig. We can add activity there with strong returns. And even the Barnett, and we laid out some numbers in the operations report, how we're driving down the cost there.

And so I can tell you here at Devon, we are very, very focused on returns and we're very, very focused on the reservoir and making sure that each project that we do is going to provide good returns. So I don't necessarily think it as a problem as long as you can -- on an individual company level, as long as you can be confident you can provide good returns. I think what really happens at $90 oil, all these projects we're funding -- being funded were not providing good returns. We're overcapitalizing some of these fields, frankly, and that's what the big issue was."

But for the most part, our drilling activity up until about mid-year of '17, will be concentrated in the Meramec.

If you look at the magnitude of our OBO spending, in the STACK play, it is quite subtenants substantial. I think we talked to you guys before about the level of participation that we have, not just in operated wells, but we have a 430,000 acres in the play.

And some of those areas, we've unbundled or decoupled different components of our operations, as an example, separating the saltwater disposal from the water hauling vendors that's offered improvements there. We've continued to build out our infrastructure and have more water in pipe now. We have a better power grid system and especially in the Delaware Basin. All that's tending to drive cost down.

I did say in my opening remarks there that the capital in 207 we anticipate being around $2 billion of E&P spend, but it is also important to understand that really, the volumes in '17 are being primarily driven by the completion work that we currently have ongoing and specifically at Eagle Ford but also other areas. And then in addition to that, the 10 rigs that we're going to have working by the end of this year. The incremental capital going to 15 to 20 rigs which really kind of rough numbers increases the capital budget, there would be 10 rigs if we stayed flat there for the year, probably around $1.6 billion versus going to 20, it'd be around $2 billion. That incremental dollar is really driving 2018 volumes, which is why we're really excited just because of the timing of how long it takes to bring these wells on production. So it's not really a matter of $2 billion that's needed to drive those 2017 volumes. We could do that at a lower level.

Well, there are a lot of variables that go into this equation. I can tell you, we want to get a greater sense of the inventory, particularly in the STACK and the Delaware Basin where we are doing these spacing tests and the STACK play, both between the Meramec. You see also there is now Woodford oil potential that's developing underneath the STACK. Want to get a sense for that and how many zones in the Meramec are going to work, we've laid out that we're testing up to 8 wells per section in the primary and 6 in the secondary in the Meramec. Now we're talking about a Woodford zone there. And then in the Wolfcamp, we talked about the Leonard and testing how many zones in the Leonard may work as well as the fact that the Wolfcamp is -- we have 9,000 on risk locations there and we've mode about 500 or so into risk locations. That's going to continue to grow. That's going to take toll -- start getting a better feel for that probably the mid next year. The other -- so that's one factor in it, and then the other big factor in it is really long-term commodity prices because you can see the leverage to the cash flow that we have from the operations report. The levers we have to higher cash flow at higher commodity prices, which is the highest leverage in the industry. And so where do we think long-term commodity prices are going to level out has a big impact on what cash flow we're going to have, which has a big impact on how many other opportunities that we can fund in other areas that already have potential returns well above the cost of capital. They're just not as big as the Delaware and the STACK. But we want to get a bit better handle from both of those variables probably mid-2017 into at the earliest before we make any strategic calls."

And I'd have to say that the industry has done an outstanding job of derisking the play. It's moved from the Texas side of the basin up to the state line and now north of that state line. So we're utilizing a lot of that information. We do participate in some non-operated activity in there. So we're getting a good feel of the potential in the Wolfcamp. I think some of the things that we're still anxious to understand through some of our pilot work that we'll engage in will be the vertical connectivity between that very thick Wolfcamp column. We know that out of the 2,000 wells drilled and we've drilled some of them in the Mexico side as well -- we just haven't really prosecuted that in our development plan -- but we know that from the XY [ph] through the upper -- through the lower portion of the Wolfcamp, it's all productive. And so it would really be a matter of the development style that we choose to engage in. I think one of the elements that we're incorporating into our thoughts as we go into 2017 is bringing in an aggressive approach from the Leonard A, B and C intervals. We've got a STACK piloting and engaged right now to help us understand the vertical connectivity. We spent most of our time in the B zone. Industry has spent most of their activity in the C. So we know each of the 3 intervals are productive. We're seeing some encouraging results. We're not commenting on that because the data is pretty young right now. We'll come back out and clear up the results of that soon. But we'll incorporate the 3 intervals in the Leonard with typical work that we do in the Bone Spring in the 2 -- in the southern portion of the 2 New Mexico counties and have a pretty aggressive approach into the Wolfcamp in both the Rattlesnake and Mi Vida areas. Will be the first 2 areas that we engage in Wolfcamp."

The depth does run from the shallow being in the East to the Northeast to the Southwest as you described. Also about midway between the Northeast of our position and the far southwest, there's some subsurface intricacies that make us run a third casing string. So as you move up into the Old Ricky's Ridge area, it's a very important data point there that we wanted to highlight simply because the oil cut is 60%. We really hadn't valued that in our thoughts about the Meramec. But as you can see out there, we think there could be substantial NAV add if you move that high oil cut across the upper portion of our Meramec play. So this really sets us up for that stacked development from the 5 intervals in the Meramec and the Woodford. Also unique about Ricky's Ridge, it was a 10,000-foot Woodford test. We incorporated 70 stages in that frac design and pumped about 2,600 pounds per foot of sand. So it was a pretty aggressive attempt to see what we could do there. We're very happy with the results. You can see some of the 90-day IP is solid but the more important thing is the production profile is flat and much more optimistic than our initial expectations.

I'd like to say, we do think that as commodity prices improve and activity increases we're looking to -- we will get that inflationary pressure next year. We think that, that could be mid- to high-single digits especially in the stimulation area. And I'll tell you a few other things that we're doing to mitigate those cost increases on the capital side. We did, as you said, we talked about proactively securing equipment and crews at competitive prices, and we're locking in rates and terms where it makes sense, given our outlook right now. So for example, on the rig side, we've locked-in 2 long-term agreements for these rigs at current market rates. And then Tony talking about the LOE said that we were unbundling the water transport and water disposal -- well we are doing unbundling on the capital side too, in the stimulation area. And we've recently started this where we're contracting separately for pressure pumping, sand chemicals and diesel, taking out the markup of the bundling. And while it's new and we don't have a lot of data yet, what we're realizing what we see right now is about 10% saving from that unbundling. So we're probably -- we'll look to do maybe more of that but we're very encouraged with those results."

Pete, I would tell you, I'm really excited about the work we do. And we talked a little bit about the passion for the technical work that our operating teams do. But on the drilling side of the business, we just stood up a Delaware rig and have now drilled 3 wells from spud to TD. Those used to take 17 days to complete. All 3 of these are averaging about 10 days now. That's really an approach to an optimized designs that we've had the luxury of tying to a lot more subsurface data that we've had in the past. It's also reflective of the really the granular detail towards the execution of our business. And Pete, I think we talked to you about the WellCon center there. So we're getting a lot of efficiencies both on the drill side of the business but also on the completion side of the business. And all that passion for data acquisition and integrating that into 3-dimensional earth models and picking the right landing zone and designing more optimized or better frac designs, all that's paying off. And we're also putting a lot of attention into the execution portion of that completion space. We monitor all of the operations on the frac. We monitor all of the data on the flowback of the wells in great detail. We have also recently incorporated the drill out -- coiled tubing drill out data in our WellCon center. So we think that's another potential savings there. So while Sue has mentioned that the industry is going to have some tension on cost, we think from a technical work that we're doing, we got the ability to offset that in '17 and very excited about additional enhancements that will be available to us for more of that type of work in the second half of '17 and '18."

In Q1 of this year, we're down to 22 wells brought on in the quarter. Second quarter is only 5. Third quarter is only 5. So we've seen the rate drop off there, but it has now stabilized and we have 4 frac crews in the field that are lowering our DUC inventory down. That's being done for a couple of purposes, but the primary purpose is to get information on the staggered lateral approach to the development end which is incorporating the upper Eagle Ford. And that information we're looking forward to having in '17 which will shape, what I think will be, an accelerated pace of activity in the second half of '17, which will have the potential for a material rate impact going into '18. We are looking forward, we are continuing to improve our completion designs. Historically, we have pumped pretty much -- roughly 2,000-pound per lateral foot type of job. We've moved that to more of a hybrid type fluid and we're increasing the proppant load up to close to 3,000 pounds per lateral foot at this point, so a substantial change to the completions. The wells are just now starting to flow back on a few of those new completions.
