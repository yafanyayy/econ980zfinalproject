Fourth quarter of 2015 adjusted earnings of $0.46 per diluted share, excluding impairment charges of $237 million, exceeded our guidance range of $0.15 to $0.20 per diluted share. Fourth quarter results included a LIFO credit of $218 million",1112,"Thanks, John. Fourth quarter of 2015 adjusted earnings of $0.46 per diluted share, excluding impairment charges of $237 million, exceeded our guidance range of $0.15 to $0.20 per diluted share. Fourth quarter results included a LIFO credit of $218 million, somewhat higher than the $181 million LIFO credit projected in our guidance. The larger-than-expected LIFO credit increased our earnings for the quarter by approximately $0.07 per diluted share. The biggest factor driving our fourth quarter outperformance was stronger-than-forecast results for the month of December at our steel mills, particularly the sheet mills and our downstream product segments. Nucor continues to benefit from effective execution of our channel-to-market strategy and our ongoing investments to expand our offerings of value-added products. At the same time, all of our Nucor teams continue their unrelenting focus on maintaining our position as the low-cost producer across our extremely diverse product portfolio. 
During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded 2 noncash impairment charges totaling $237 million. A $153 million charge reduced the value of our equity method investment and deferred the Nucor steelmaking joint venture in Italy. In addition, an $84 million charge was taken to write-off the entire amount of certain assets, primarily engineering planes and equipment, related to a potential blast furnace project at our St. James Parish, Louisiana site. Due to technology advances and other factors, we no longer expect to use those plans if we proceed with the blast furnace project. Including these impairment charges, Nucor's consolidated net loss for the quarter was $62 million or $0.19 per diluted share. Our Duferdofin-Nucor impairment charge reflects the ongoing financial performance and deterioration in near-term projections for this business. The 50% ownership in Duferdofin-Nucor was acquired in July 2008 for approximately $667 million. Although market conditions in Europe remain extremely weak, we are very pleased with the dedication and hard work of our approximately 700 teammates at Duferdofin-Nucor. They have achieved very significant improvements in costs and product mix. As one example, conversion cuts at our shop have reached world-class levels. Duferdofin-Nucor is also successfully expanding its portfolio to include value-added and more import-resistant products such as engineered bar blooms and bullets as well as special profiles. Across the entire organization, our Duferdofin-Nucor teammates have embraced and taken ownership of a culture focused on safety, environmental stewardship and production efficiency. All of these initiatives are focused on achieving consistent profitability for the joint venture in the near future. 
A quick comment about our fourth quarter of 2015 tax rate as it can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests and the impairment charges. Excluding profits belonging to our business partners and the 2 noncash charges, the effective tax rate was approximately 31% for the fourth quarter. Nucor continues to generate very robust operating cash flow in extremely challenging steel market conditions. With our highly variable and low-cost structure, we benefit from significant reductions in working capital during downturns. 2015 cash provided by operations was approximately $2.2 billion, a dramatic increase from 2014's operating cash flow of about $1.3 billion. It also represents our strongest cash flow performance since 2008's record level of $2.5 billion. Over this prolonged steel industry downturn that began in 2009, Nucor's annual operating cash flow generation has averaged approximately $1.3 billion. That compares with average annual operating cash flow of $500 million to the previous cyclical downturn from 2001 to 2003. 2015 capital expenditures were $365 million. For 2016, we estimate capital spending of approximately $500 million. Depreciation and amortization for 2016 is expected to total about $700 million. Most of our recent larger-scale organic growth projects have been completed or are nearing completion. Nucor's financial strength allows us to invest in capital projects and strategic acquisitions during severe industry downturns, when the long-term returns are most attractive. Through the downturn that began in 2009 and continued with a vengeance in 2015, Nucor has invested more than $6 billion to grow our long-term earnings power. That includes capital expenditures of approximately $4.4 billion and acquisitions totaling about $1.9 billion. Rather than fighting for survival, the Nucor team is executing our strategic plan for driving profitable growth and delivering attractive returns to our shareholders. Nucor's disciplined and balanced approach the capital allocation also allows us to reward shareholders with attractive cash returns on their investment. Over the 10-year period ending in 2015, Nucor has returned a total of approximately $6.8 billion of their capital to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. With the dividend increase announced in December and effective with next year's quarterly payment, Nucor has increased its base dividend for 43 consecutive years, every year since it first began paying dividends in 1973. Reflecting our success in growing long-term earnings power, the base dividend has increased fivefold over the past 10 years. In December, we began repurchasing shares of our common stock under the $900 million program approved by our board in September. Our repurchases totaled about 1.7 million shares at an average cost of just under $40 per share. Nucor's financial position remains strong. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 36% at the close of the fourth quarter. Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $2 billion, which compares with total debt outstanding of $4.4 billion. Our next significant debt maturity is not until December 2017. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until August of 2018. Nucor is the only North-American-headquartered steel producer to hold an investment-grade credit rating. Market conditions for our steel mills segment remained extremely challenging as a result of global overcapacity and import levels that remain extremely high levels. However, we anticipate some improvement in the steel mills segment in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 due to lower average cost of inventory that begin the first quarter, a small decline in imports and more balanced inventory levels as service center customers. The performance of our downstream steel products segment will be lower due to typical winter seasonality. We expect downstream products for the full year of 2016 to achieve notably improved performance compared to 2015. Performance in the raw materials segment should increase slightly over the fourth quarter level as Nucor Steel Louisiana resumed production earlier this week, following its extended fourth quarter maintenance outage. Margins are expected to improve modestly in our scrap recycling business. We are confident that Nucor's significant competitive advantages and highly adaptable business model will allow our team to continue to execute our proven strategies for delivering profitable long-term growth and attractive returns to Nucor shareholders. 
We appreciate your interest in our company. John?"
184945,321713133,922741,"Nucor Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Nucor Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim. I am proud of the results achieved by our teammates in one of the toughest steel markets in decades. Because of their work, Nucor is growing stronger and actually thriving compared to our peers. First, I will comment on the overall industry",1248,"Thanks, Jim. I am proud of the results achieved by our teammates in one of the toughest steel markets in decades. Because of their work, Nucor is growing stronger and actually thriving compared to our peers. 
First, I will comment on the overall industry issues we face today. It is not an exaggeration to say that the global steel industry is in a crisis. The crisis is the direct result of foreign governments, particularly China, blatantly subsidizing their steel industries. In further violation of international trade rules, this glut of global steel production has led to the dumping of steel products into the U.S. market. Despite the highest level of domestic steel consumption since 2006, the American steel industry capacity utilization in 2015 was around 70% and, pricing for most steel products essentially collapsed. 
Nucor's culture has always been defined by our willingness to tackle challenges head on and focus our energy on what is within our control. To that end, Nucor continues to be proactive and aggressive in pursuing trade cases whenever and wherever it is appropriate. When foreign producers and governments break mutually agreed-upon trade laws, there must be meaningful consequences. Nucor has joined other U.S. steel producers in filing trade cases for hot-rolled, cold-rolled, and corrosion-resistant flat-rolled products. We are pleased that the International Trade Commission made preliminary determinations of injury in all 3 cases. 
Regarding the preliminary duties announced by the Commerce Department, we are satisfied with the duties applied to products from China in the corrosion-resistant and cold-rolled cases, but we are extremely disappointed in the other determinations and believe that the facts support higher duties. However, we are confident that the government will be more aggressive in its final determinations after further analysis is done. 
Another important trade issue in 2016 is China's bid to gain recognition as a market economy under its protocol of Ascension to the World Trade Organization agreed to in 2001. Over the past 15 years, China has failed to implement the reforms necessary to become a market economy. China remains a government-run, nonmarket economy today. Therefore, the U.S. has no reason to change its treatment of China as a nonmarket economy. 
Great challenges provide great opportunities for great companies that are ready to seize them. At Nucor, we are more than just ready. We are doing it. We are on the offensive and growing stronger. Our multipronged growth strategy is simple and flexible. That strategy is supported by Nucor's 5 drivers to profitable growth, which highlight where we are focusing our energies to build long-term earnings power and provide our shareholders with attractive returns on their valuable capital. 
Here they are: One, strengthen our position as a low-cost producer. Two, achieve market leadership positions in every product line in our portfolio. Three, move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher-quality, more import-resistant products. Four, expand our downstream channels to market to increase our steel mills' baseload volume, especially in weak markets. And five, achieve commercial excellence to complement our traditional operational strength. 
Our performance in 2015 provides numerous examples of how we are growing stronger in this downturn and positioning Nucor to deliver higher highs and profitability during the inevitable cyclical upturn. Despite the challenges, the illegally traded imports and less-than-robust capacity utilization rates, our bar mills delivered solid profitability in 2015. The keys to their success are powerful and sustainable. Market leadership positions, strong channels to the market and an unrelenting focus to drive costs lower. Our fabricated construction products group achieved very strong year-over-year profit growth in 2015 and actually approached the record profitability reached in 2007. That is very impressive when you consider the fact that U.S. nonresidential construction activity for 2015, as measured by square footage, represents less than 60% of 2007's peak activity. In addition to their strong market leadership positions, Nucor's fabricated construction products enhanced the through-the-cycle profitability and flexibility of our steelmaking businesses. Our structural steel business also delivered attractive earnings growth in 2015 while working against strong headwinds from high import levels and low mill capacity utilization. Impressive results were delivered by all of our structural steel teams, our Nucor unit model mill, our Berkeley County, South Carolina mill and our piling distribution business, Skyline Steel. Nucor's ongoing success in the structural steel business continues to be powered by our market leadership position, strong channels to the market and new product introductions that continue to move as up the value chain. Our Nucor Yamato structural mill is continuing to expand its value-added product portfolio. In 2015, Nucor-Yamato began shipping its wider sheet piling sections. These new products are already enjoying strong marketplace success. We see significant opportunities for profitable growth in this market, which currently is largely supplied by imports. Further, during the second half of 2016, Nucor Yamato will begin commissioning its $75-million Quench and Self-Tempering project. This investment will position Nucor as the sole North American producer of high-strength, low-alloy beams. Our Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet mill achieved very solid fourth quarter and full year 2015 profitability in what can best be described as horrific flat-rolled market conditions. The Berkeley team continues to capitalize on their investments in vacuum degassing and the wide-light capabilities provided by caster and hot mill equipment upgrades. New products from the wide-light modernization are allowing us to gain new business in a wide range of end-use markets, including metal buildings, rail cars, water heaters, automotive, heavy equipment and motor lamination. On particular note, Nucor's automotive business continues to grow with work awarded by a diversified and high-quality portfolio of automotive OEM customers. 
Highlighting Nucor's overall commitment to profitable growth in the automotive market and our strategic focus on commercial excellence, we opened a Detroit sales office earlier this year. Our shipment rate to the automotive market from our sheet and SBQ bar mills increased by about 20% in 2015 versus 2014 to approximately 1.4 million tons. We believe the time could not be better for a financially strong and technologically advanced steel supplier, such as Nucor, to make a more significant contribution to the automotive industry. 
In November, we acquired the Dallas coal-finished bar facilities located in Ohio and Georgia, adding combined annual production capability of 75,000 tons. This acquisition strengthens Nucor's market share leadership position in this very attractive, value-added business, an important channel to the market. I warmly welcome to the Nucor family all of our newest teammates in the Orrville, Ohio at and Carlosville, Georgia. Our list of 5 drivers to profitable growth begins with the objective to strengthen our position as a low-cost producer. Nucor's DRI production capability, with its excellent conversion core structure, has significantly strengthened our position as a low-cost steelmaker. It gives us the flexibility to optimize Nucor's overall iron units mix, and most importantly, cost. Consistent with our announcement earlier this month, our DRI plant in Louisiana has resumed operations and is producing high-quality DRI. Recent changes in raw material pricing led to this decision. These are challenging times in the steel business. But for a company such as Nucor, one that is in a unique position of strength, these are also times of great opportunities. 
Here's what I see throughout Nucor: the right people, working with the typical high energy level and sense of urgency to seize these opportunities for profitable growth, ensuring that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us. 
Thank you for your interest in Nucor. We would now be happy to answer your questions."

Higher-value products that are harder to import. We continue to develop a stronger channel to the market. That provides a nice barrier for us, gives us some protection from the imports. So we're taking this from a 2-front battle. One, we're continuing to fight the imports. The illegal, unfairly traded imports. We'll be real clear about that. We don't have a problem with imports.

As you know, that we've increased sales in automotive on an ordering -- excuse me, on delivery basis by about 20% over last year. Today, we're at about 1.4 million ton a year market penetration. We fully expect to be able to get up to 2 million tons over the next couple of years, and that's going to be in both sheet products and in our SBQs. As we continue with sheet, we move up the value chain and to the advanced high-strength steels. Particularly, when you think about what we've done on our Berkeley facility with the wide-light project, that's given us the ability to continue to move these higher in the strength sheet steel products while maintaining the light gains that they need in the automotive applications. So we feel very good about our sheet penetration into automotive. I'll also point out that our SBQ we continue to develop more and more products. And bear in mind, Tony, that our team does a great job selling to the automotive market and our products present great opportunities for the automotive customers. So let's be honest. Now the automotive industry is taking a look at the entire steel industry today, and they look at Nucor and our balance sheet, and they see a long-term, sustainable supplier. When you think about how they order steel, they order steel today, takes a long time to get qualified. It takes years to go through that entire process, and then the steel that they're ordering today, can show up on the platform that's [indiscernible] rolled out for 2 to 3 years from today. So they want to make absolutely certain that when they effort going through the entire qualification period, that they when they roll that product out, that new platform out in 2 to 3 years, they want to make sure and certain that the steel supplier is going to be there and able to supply the steel that they need, keep their factories running."

So we need to continue to work in developing even more sophisticated grades that have a higher strength while still maintaining flexibility or improve flexibility for the design for the coming out in the future. So there's always more to do. But I want to be clear about this point. Today, at least on Nucor's mini mill. We can produce virtually every type of steel that's in the automotive. One of the question that I'm always asked is about exposed automotive quality. And I answered this question several times, but I'll say it one more time. Today, we have the ability produce exposed automotive. It's actually out there on course going through a qualification period. So we're very comfortable with the products that we can supply and the quality that we can supply. Now, as a mentioned earlier, it's a very long qualification period.

We look to maintain a prudent payout ratio between the supplemental and our base.

And when we look at it, we see an increase of $20 to $30 a ton on scrap and a $10 increase in pig iron. And that might be relatively stable, but when you buy 15 million tons of scrap and 5 million tons of pig iron, that's a big change. And we felt that as we talked through with our team, who's out there all the time, working the marketplace, we felt that that we could attribute, at least half of that to the fact that we were taken DRI offline. And since we finish the maintenance outage at the end of last month, we are at a point where we had to make a decision as to bring it back or not. And we're basically breakeven on a marginal contribution basis. And so we were kind of up in the air as to what to do. We thought it was a good opportunity to leave it off. We've always believed that bringing it online had a significant impact for us on our cost of scrap and pig iron. So we said, ""Hey, here's an opportunity to take a look and see, in fact, what happens."" So we left it off. We saw a bump go up, and that's about $25 to $30 a ton across the spectrum on scrap and about $10 on pig iron. And again, that's a huge impact for us. So we brought it back online because of that, and I came away from the whole thing and the team came away from the whole thing more convinced than ever that although you might not see an immediate profitability in the DRI plant itself, when you look at the overall impact to our company, on iron units, which represents 60% of our costs, the overall impact to our company is significantly better, running that DRI plant and not running the DRI plant, even if it does not profitable in its own right."

But on a year-over-year basis, they're still down, running down probably 25% to 30%. The second part of your question, I think -- let me take a shot at looking at it this way. Our DJJ business model is a very diverse business model. We sometimes get caught up in thinking that it's only a recycling business with scrap yards, but we have 5 or 6 different business elements in our DJJ business, and the recycling group alone as a part of that only represents about 15% of the DJJ revenue flow. So the DJJ business model performance -- financial performance does not extensively rely on the recycling group. For the recycling group to see improvements, really, all you need -- it's not as much flow-based as much as you need stability to pricing. In other words, for most of 2015, we were seeing significant drops in the market price for scrap, and that's kind of like catching a falling knife. You can never really catch up with it. Once prices is stabilized or shows any sign of increase, then that is what drives margins and profitability at the recycling group more than just volumes. Does that help?"

Fourth quarter results included a LIFO credit of $218 million",1119,"Thanks, John. Fourth quarter of 2015 adjusted earnings of $0.46 per diluted share, excluding impairment charges of $237 million, exceeded our guidance range of $0.15 to $0.20 per diluted share. Fourth quarter results included a LIFO credit of $218 million, somewhat higher than the $181 million LIFO credit projected in our guidance. The larger-than-expected LIFO credit increased our earnings for the quarter by approximately $0.07 per diluted share. The biggest factor driving our fourth quarter outperformance was stronger-than-forecast results for the month of December at our steel mills, particularly the sheet mills and our downstream product segments. Nucor continues to benefit from effective execution of our channel-to-market strategy and our ongoing investments to expand our offerings of value-added products. At the same time, all of our Nucor teams continue their unrelenting focus on maintaining our position as the low-cost producer across our extremely diverse product portfolio. 
During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded 2 noncash impairment charges totaling $237 million. A $153 million charge reduced the value of our equity method investment and deferred the Nucor's steelmaking joint venture in Italy. In addition, an $84 million charge was taken to write off the entire amount of certain assets, primarily engineering planes and equipment, related to a potential blast furnace project at our St. James Parish, Louisiana site. Due to technology advances and other factors, we no longer expect to use those plans if we proceed with the blast furnace project. Including these impairment charges, Nucor's consolidated net loss for the quarter was $62 million or $0.19 per diluted share. Our Duferdofin-Nucor impairment charge reflects the ongoing financial performance and deterioration in near-term projections for this business. The 50% ownership in Duferdofin-Nucor was acquired in July 2008 for approximately $667 million. Although market conditions in Europe remain extremely weak, we are very pleased with the dedication and hard work of our approximately 700 teammates at Duferdofin-Nucor. They have achieved very significant improvements in costs and product mix. As one example, conversion costs at our San Zeno melt shop have reached world-class levels. Duferdofin-Nucor is also successfully expanding its portfolio to include value-added and more import-resistant products such as engineered bar blooms and billets as well as special profiles. Across the entire organization, our Duferdofin-Nucor teammates have embraced and taken ownership of a culture focused on safety, environmental stewardship and production efficiency. All of these initiatives are focused on achieving consistent profitability for the joint venture in the near future. 
A quick comment about our fourth quarter of 2015 tax rate as it can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests and the impairment charges. Excluding profits belonging to our business partners and the 2 noncash charges, the effective tax rate was approximately 31% for the fourth quarter. Nucor continues to generate very robust operating cash flow in extremely challenging steel market conditions. With our highly variable and low-cost structure, we benefit from significant reductions in working capital during downturns. 2015 cash provided by operations was approximately $2.2 billion, a dramatic increase from 2014's operating cash flow of about $1.3 billion. It also represents our strongest cash flow performance since 2008's record level of $2.5 billion. Over this prolonged steel industry downturn that began in 2009, Nucor's annual operating cash flow generation has averaged approximately $1.3 billion. That compares with average annual operating cash flow of $500 million to the previous cyclical downturn from 2001 to 2003. 2015 capital expenditures were $365 million. For 2016, we estimate capital spending of approximately $500 million. Depreciation and amortization for 2016 is expected to total about $700 million. Most of our recent larger-scale organic growth projects have been completed or are nearing completion. Nucor's financial strength allows us to invest in capital projects and strategic acquisitions during severe industry downturns, when the long-term returns are most attractive. Through the downturn that began in 2009 and continued with a vengeance in 2015, Nucor has invested more than $6 billion to grow our long-term earnings power. That includes capital expenditures of approximately $4.4 billion and acquisitions totaling about $1.9 billion. Rather than fighting for survival, the Nucor team is executing our strategic plan for driving profitable growth and delivering attractive returns to our shareholders. Nucor's disciplined and balanced approach the capital allocation also allows us to reward shareholders with attractive cash returns on their investment. Over the 10-year period ending in 2015, Nucor has returned a total of approximately $6.8 billion of their capital to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. With the dividend increase announced in December and effective with next year's quarterly payment, Nucor has increased its base dividend for 43 consecutive years, every year since it first began paying dividends in 1973. Reflecting our success in growing long-term earnings power, the base dividend has increased fivefold over the past 10 years. In December, we began repurchasing shares of our common stock under the $900 million program approved by our board in September. Our repurchases totaled about 1.7 million shares at an average cost of just under $40 per share. Nucor's financial position remains strong. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 36% at the close of the fourth quarter. Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $2 billion, which compares with total debt outstanding of $4.4 billion. Our next significant debt maturity is not until December 2017. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until August of 2018. Nucor is the only North American-headquartered steel producer to hold an investment-grade credit rating. Market conditions for our steel mills segment remain extremely challenging as a result of global overcapacity and import levels that remain at extremely high levels. However, we anticipate some improvement in the steel mills segment in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 due to a lower average cost of inventory to begin the first quarter, a small decline in imports and more balanced inventory levels as service center customers. The performance of our downstream steel products segment will be lower due to typical winter seasonality. We expect downstream products for the full year of 2016 to achieve notably improved performance compared to 2015. Performance in the raw materials segment should increase slightly over the fourth quarter level as Nucor Steel Louisiana resumed production earlier this week, following its extended fourth quarter maintenance outage. Margins are expected to improve modestly in our scrap recycling business. We are confident that Nucor's significant competitive advantages and highly adaptable business model will allow our team to continue to execute our proven strategies for delivering profitable long-term growth and attractive returns to Nucor shareholders. 
We appreciate your interest in our company. John?"

I am proud of the results achieved by our teammates in one of the toughest steel markets in decades. Because of their work, Nucor is growing stronger and actually thriving compared to our peers. First, I will comment on the overall industry",1245,"Thanks, Jim. I am proud of the results achieved by our teammates in one of the toughest steel markets in decades. Because of their work, Nucor is growing stronger and actually thriving compared to our peers. 
First, I will comment on the overall industry issues we face today. It is not an exaggeration to say that the global steel industry is in a crisis. The crisis is the direct result of foreign governments, particularly China, blatantly subsidizing their steel industries. In further violation of international trade rules, this glut of global steel production has led to the dumping of steel products into the U.S. market. Despite the highest level of domestic steel consumption since 2006, the American steel industry capacity utilization in 2015 was around 70% and pricing for most steel products essentially collapsed. 
Nucor's culture has always been defined by our willingness to tackle challenges head on and focus our energy on what is within our control. To that end, Nucor continues to be proactive and aggressive in pursuing trade cases whenever and wherever it is appropriate. When foreign producers and governments break mutually agreed-upon trade laws, there must be meaningful consequences. Nucor has joined other U.S. steel producers in filing trade cases for hot-rolled, cold-rolled and corrosion-resistant flat-rolled products. We are pleased that the International Trade Commission made preliminary determinations of injury in all 3 cases. 
Regarding the preliminary duties announced by the Commerce Department, we are satisfied with the duties applied to products from China in the corrosion-resistant and cold-rolled cases, but we are extremely disappointed in the other determinations and believe that the facts support higher duties. However, we are confident that the government will be more aggressive in its final determinations after further analysis is done. 
Another important trade issue in 2016 is China's bid to gain recognition as a market economy under its protocol of accession to the World Trade Organization agreed to in 2001. Over the past 15 years, China has failed to implement the reforms necessary to become a market economy. China remains a government-run, nonmarket economy today. Therefore, the U.S. has no reason to change its treatment of China as a nonmarket economy. 
Great challenges provide great opportunities for great companies that are ready to seize them. At Nucor, we are more than just ready. We are doing it. We are on the offensive and growing stronger. Our multipronged growth strategy is simple and flexible. That strategy is supported by Nucor's 5 drivers to profitable growth, which highlight where we are focusing our energies to build long-term earnings power and provide our shareholders with attractive returns on their valuable capital. 
Here they are: one, strengthen our position as a low-cost producer. Two, achieve market leadership positions in every product line in our portfolio. Three, move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher-quality, more import-resistant products. Four, expand our downstream channels to market to increase our steel mills' baseload volume, especially in weak markets. And five, achieve commercial excellence to complement our traditional operational strength. 
Our performance in 2015 provides numerous examples of how we are growing stronger in this downturn and positioning Nucor to deliver higher highs in profitability during the inevitable cyclical upturn. Despite the challenges, the illegally traded imports and less-than-robust capacity utilization rates, our bar mills delivered solid profitability in 2015. The keys to their success are powerful and sustainable: market leadership positions, strong channels to the market and an unrelenting focus to drive costs lower. Our fabricated construction products group achieved very strong year-over-year profit growth in 2015 and actually approached the record profitability reached in 2007. That is very impressive when you consider the fact that U.S. nonresidential construction activity for 2015, as measured by square footage, represents less than 60% of 2007's peak activity. In addition to their strong market leadership positions, Nucor's fabricated construction products enhanced the through-the-cycle profitability and flexibility of our steelmaking businesses. Our structural steel business also delivered attractive earnings growth in 2015 while working against strong headwinds from high import levels and low mill capacity utilization. Impressive results were delivered by all of our structural steel teams, our Nucor unit model mill, our Berkeley County, South Carolina mill and our piling distribution business, Skyline Steel. Nucor's ongoing success in the structural steel business continues to be powered by our market leadership position, strong channels to the market and new product introductions that continue to move as up the value chain. Our Nucor-Yamato structural mill is continuing to expand its value-added product portfolio. In 2015, Nucor-Yamato began shipping its wider sheet piling sections. These new products are already enjoying strong marketplace success. We see significant opportunities for profitable growth in this market, which currently is largely supplied by imports. Further, during the second half of 2016, Nucor-Yamato will begin commissioning its $75 million Quench and Self-Tempering project. This investment will position Nucor as the sole North American producer of high-strength, low-alloy beams. Our Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet mill achieved very solid fourth quarter and full year 2015 profitability in what can best be described as horrific flat-rolled market conditions. The Berkeley team continues to capitalize on their investments in vacuum degassing and the wide-light capabilities provided by caster and hot mill equipment upgrades. New products from the wide-light modernization are allowing us to gain new business in a wide range of end-use markets including metal buildings, rail cars, water heaters, automotive, heavy equipment and motor lamination. Of particular note, Nucor's automotive business continues to grow with work awarded by a diversified and high-quality portfolio of automotive OEM customers. 
Highlighting Nucor's overall commitment to profitable growth in the automotive market and our strategic focus on commercial excellence, we opened a Detroit sales office earlier this year. Our shipment rate to the automotive market from our sheet and SBQ bar mills increased by about 20% in 2015 versus 2014 to approximately 1.4 million tons. We believe the time could not be better for a financially strong and technologically advanced steel supplier, such as Nucor, to make a more significant contribution to the automotive industry. 
In November, we acquired the Dallas cold finish bar facilities located in Ohio and Georgia, adding combined annual production capability of 75,000 tons. This acquisition strengthens Nucor's market leadership position in this very attractive, value-added business, an important channel to the market. I warmly welcome to the Nucor family all of our newest teammates in Orrville, Ohio and Cartersville, Georgia. Our list of 5 drivers to profitable growth begins with the objective to strengthen our position as a low-cost producer. Nucor's DRI production capability, with its excellent conversion core structure, has significantly strengthened our position as a low-cost steelmaker. It gives us the flexibility to optimize Nucor's overall iron units mix, and most importantly, cost. Consistent with our announcement earlier this month, our DRI plant in Louisiana has resumed operations and is producing high-quality DRI. Recent changes in raw material pricing led to this decision. These are challenging times in the steel business. But for a company such as Nucor, one that is in a unique position of strength, these are also times of great opportunities. 
Here's what I see throughout Nucor: the right people, working with that typical high energy level and sense of urgency to seize these opportunities for profitable growth, ensuring that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us. 
Thank you for your interest in Nucor. We would now be happy to answer your questions."

That's probably where we have -- we feel that we have the greatest opportunity. As you know, that we've increased sales in automotive on an ordering -- excuse me, on a delivery basis by about 20% over last year. Today, we're at about 1.4 million ton a year market penetration. We fully expect to be able to get up to 2 million tons over the next couple of years, and that's going to be in both sheet products and in our SBQs. As we continue with sheet, we'll move up the value chain into the advanced high-strength steels. Particularly, when you think about what we've done on our Berkeley facility with the wide-light project, that's given us the ability to continue to move these higher in the strength sheet steel products while maintaining the light gains that they need in the automotive applications. So we feel very good about our sheet penetration into automotive. I'll also point out that our SBQ, we continue to develop more and more products. And bear in mind, Tony, that our team does a great job selling to the automotive market and our products present great opportunities for the automotive customers. So let's be honest. Now the automotive industry is taking a look at the entire steel industry today, and they look at Nucor and our balance sheet and they see a long-term, sustainable supplier. When you think about how they order steel, they order steel today, takes a long time to get qualified, takes years to go through that entire process, and then the steel that they're ordering today can show up on a platform that's not even going to roll out for 2 to 3 years from today. So they want to make absolutely certain that when the effort has through the entire qualification period, that when they roll that product out, that new platform out in 2 to 3 years, they want to make sure and certain that their steel supplier is going to be there and able to supply the steel that they need, keep their factories running."

The most qualified people that are out there are going to look for companies, to work for companies that they know are going to be around for the long term. And all I'll say is that when you look at our balance sheet, and when these potential candidates take a look at our company, one of the things they bring up to us all the time is that, ""Look, we want to get with a company that we know is going to be there for the long term. I want to finish my career with the company."" Not only do they -- are they impressed with our balance sheet, but once they come down and spend some time with us, they like our culture, they like working for the concept of working for the Nucor family. And so yes, we have a great potential to attract the best people out there. And having opened this office in Detroit, I'm telling you what, that was a great move, and we opened it, I guess, it was 2 months ago, we had a grand opening. I'll tell you, Tony, we had over 200 customers come by and talk to us. And the one thing that we heard consistently through that 2- or 3-hour period was there's a major concern about sustainability of some of our competitors in this industry, and they're anxious to do more business with Nucor as a result of that. Now we're going to move on and give someone else a chance to ask questions. Thank you, Tony."

Probably the biggest issue we have in front of us today is getting through the qualification period. It's an issue of timing. When you talk about what products that we need to develop to be able to get a deeper penetration into it, I would tell you that today, we're producing just about all the products we need to get our full penetration into automotive on making advanced high-strength steels. We have great quality steel going to the automotive industry, so where were we need to be in terms of products today. Now having said that, what's good today is not good enough tomorrow. So we need to continue to work on developing even more sophisticated grades that have higher strength while still maintaining flexibility or improved flexibility for the designs that are coming out in the future. So there's always more to do. But I want to be clear about this point. Today, at least on Nucor's mini mill, we can produce virtually every type of steel that's used in automotive. One of the questions that I'm always asked is about exposed automotive quality. And I answered this question several times, but I'll say it one more time. Today, we have the ability to produce exposed automotive. It is actually out there on cars, going through a qualification period. And so we're very comfortable with the products that we can supply and the quality that we can supply. Now as I mentioned earlier, there's a very long qualification period. And then after the qualification period, you have to wait for the platform to be introduced that your steel is being specified on. So there's a period of time it's going to take to grow to this 2 million or better tons a year level with automotive, but it's strictly a question of working our way through that time period now."

We believe strongly that there are many opportunities to continue to invest in the profitable, sustainable growth of our company, both internally, organic and externally through M&A activity. Now -- so that's the first objective. That will always be our first objective. Second objective in capital allocation that we always look at is to make sure that we return our shareholders' valuable capital to them in an appropriate way. We look at our dividend as being a very appropriate way to do that. We think it's a good dividend. We think it's a well-balanced dividend. We look to maintain a prudent payout ratio between the supplemental and our base. And we look forward to the days like we had in 2005 and '06 when we had such a good cash flow coming in that we can increase the supplemental dividend and return it -- return more of the capital to our shareholders.

That might be relatively stable, but when you buy 15 million tons of scrap and 5 million tons of pig iron, that's a big change. And we felt that as we talk through with our DJ Joseph team, who's out there all the time, working in the marketplace, we felt that we could attribute at least half of that to the fact that we would have taken the DRI plants offline. And since we -- when we finished the maintenance outage at the end of last month, we are at a point where we had to make a decision as to bring it back or not. And we were basically breakeven on a marginal contribution basis. And so we were kind of up in the air as to what to do. We thought it was a good opportunity to leave it off. We've always believed that bringing it online had a significant impact to us on our cost of scrap and pig iron. So we said, ""Hey, here's an opportunity to take a look and see, in fact, what happens."" So we left it off. We saw a bump go up, and it's about $25 to $30 a ton across the spectrum on scrap and about $10 on pig iron. Well, again, that's a huge impact for us. So we brought it back online because of that, and I came away from the whole thing and the team came away from the whole thing more convinced than ever that although you might not see immediate profitability in the DRI plant itself, when you look at the overall impact to our company, on iron units, which represents 60% of our costs, the overall impact to our company is significantly better, running that DRI plant and not running the DRI plant, even if it is not profitable in its own right."

But on a year-over-year basis, they're still down, running down probably 25% to 30%. The second part of your question, I think -- let me take a shot at looking at it this way. Our DJJ business model is a very diverse business model. We sometimes get caught up in thinking that it's only a recycling business with scrap yards. But we have 5 or 6 different business elements in our DJJ business and the recycling group alone, as a part of that, only represents about 15% of the DJJ revenue flow. So the DJJ business model performance, financial performance, does not extensively rely on the recycling group. For the recycling group to see improvements, really, all you need -- it's not as much flow based as much as you need stability in the pricing. In other words, for most of 2015, we were seeing significant drops in the market price for scrap, and that's kind of like catching a falling knife. You could never really catch up with it. Once price is stabilized or shows any sign of increase, then that is what drives margins and profitability at the recycling group more than just volumes. Does that help?"

Fourth quarter results included a LIFO credit of $218 million",1119,"Thanks, John. Fourth quarter of 2015 adjusted earnings of $0.46 per diluted share, excluding impairment charges of $237 million, exceeded our guidance range of $0.15 to $0.20 per diluted share. Fourth quarter results included a LIFO credit of $218 million, somewhat higher than the $181 million LIFO credit projected in our guidance. The larger-than-expected LIFO credit increased our earnings for the quarter by approximately $0.07 per diluted share. The biggest factor driving our fourth quarter outperformance was stronger-than-forecast results for the month of December at our steel mills, particularly the sheet mills and our downstream product segments. Nucor continues to benefit from effective execution of our channel-to-market strategy and our ongoing investments to expand our offerings of value-added products. At the same time, all of our Nucor teams continue their unrelenting focus on maintaining our position as the low-cost producer across our extremely diverse product portfolio. 
During the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded 2 noncash impairment charges totaling $237 million. A $153 million charge reduced the value of our equity method investment and deferred the Nucor's steelmaking joint venture in Italy. In addition, an $84 million charge was taken to write off the entire amount of certain assets, primarily engineering plans and equipment, related to a potential blast furnace project at our St. James Parish, Louisiana site. Due to technology advances and other factors, we no longer expect to use those plans if we proceed with the blast furnace project. Including these impairment charges, Nucor's consolidated net loss for the quarter was $62 million or $0.19 per diluted share. Our Duferdofin-Nucor impairment charge reflects the ongoing financial performance and deterioration in near-term projections for this business. The 50% ownership in Duferdofin-Nucor was acquired in July 2008 for approximately $667 million. Although market conditions in Europe remain extremely weak, we are very pleased with the dedication and hard work of our approximately 700 teammates at Duferdofin-Nucor. They have achieved very significant improvements in costs and product mix. As one example, conversion costs at our San Zeno melt shop have reached world-class levels. Duferdofin-Nucor is also successfully expanding its portfolio to include value-added and more import-resistant products such as engineered bar blooms and billets as well as special profiles. Across the entire organization, our Duferdofin-Nucor teammates have embraced and taken ownership of a culture focused on safety, environmental stewardship and production efficiency. All of these initiatives are focused on achieving consistent profitability for the joint venture in the near future. 
A quick comment about our fourth quarter of 2015 tax rate as it can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests and the impairment charges. Excluding profits belonging to our business partners and the 2 noncash charges, the effective tax rate was approximately 31% for the fourth quarter. Nucor continues to generate very robust operating cash flow in extremely challenging steel market conditions. With our highly variable and low-cost structure, we benefit from significant reductions in working capital during downturns. 2015 cash provided by operations was approximately $2.2 billion, a dramatic increase from 2014's operating cash flow of about $1.3 billion. It also represents our strongest cash flow performance since 2008's record level of $2.5 billion. Over this prolonged steel industry downturn that began in 2009, Nucor's annual operating cash flow generation has averaged approximately $1.3 billion. That compares with average annual operating cash flow of $500 million to the previous cyclical downturn from 2001 to 2003. 2015 capital expenditures were $365 million. For 2016, we estimate capital spending of approximately $500 million. Depreciation and amortization for 2016 is expected to total about $700 million. Most of our recent larger-scale organic growth projects have been completed or are nearing completion. Nucor's financial strength allows us to invest in capital projects and strategic acquisitions during severe industry downturns, when the long-term returns are most attractive. Through the downturn that began in 2009 and continued with a vengeance in 2015, Nucor has invested more than $6 billion to grow our long-term earnings power. That includes capital expenditures of approximately $4.4 billion and acquisitions totaling about $1.9 billion. Rather than fighting for survival, the Nucor team is executing our strategic plan for driving profitable growth and delivering attractive returns to our shareholders. Nucor's disciplined and balanced approach the capital allocation also allows us to reward shareholders with attractive cash returns on their investment. Over the 10-year period ending in 2015, Nucor has returned a total of approximately $6.8 billion of their capital to our shareholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. With the dividend increase announced in December and effective with next year's quarterly payment, Nucor has increased its base dividend for 43 consecutive years, every year since it first began paying dividends in 1973. Reflecting our success in growing long-term earnings power, the base dividend has increased fivefold over the past 10 years. In December, we began repurchasing shares of our common stock under the $900 million program approved by our board in September. Our repurchases totaled about 1.7 million shares at an average cost of just under $40 per share. Nucor's financial position remains strong. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 36% at the close of the fourth quarter. Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $2 billion, which compares with total debt outstanding of $4.4 billion. Our next significant debt maturity is not until December 2017. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until August of 2018. Nucor is the only North American-headquartered steel producer to hold an investment-grade credit rating. Market conditions for our steel mills segment remain extremely challenging as a result of global overcapacity and import levels that remain at extremely high levels. However, we anticipate some improvement in the steel mills segment in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 due to a lower average cost of inventory to begin the first quarter, a small decline in imports and more balanced inventory levels as service center customers. The performance of our downstream steel products segment will be lower due to typical winter seasonality. We expect downstream products for the full year of 2016 to achieve notably improved performance compared to 2015. Performance in the raw materials segment should increase slightly over the fourth quarter level as Nucor Steel Louisiana resumed production earlier this week, following its extended fourth quarter maintenance outage. Margins are expected to improve modestly in our scrap recycling business. We are confident that Nucor's significant competitive advantages and highly adaptable business model will allow our team to continue to execute our proven strategies for delivering profitable long-term growth and attractive returns to Nucor shareholders. 
We appreciate your interest in our company. John?"
184945,321713133,923264,"Nucor Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Nucor Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim. I am proud of the results achieved by our teammates in one of the toughest steel markets in decades. Because of their work, Nucor is growing stronger and actually thriving compared to our peers. First, I will comment on the overall industry",1245,"Thanks, Jim. I am proud of the results achieved by our teammates in one of the toughest steel markets in decades. Because of their work, Nucor is growing stronger and actually thriving compared to our peers. 
First, I will comment on the overall industry issues we face today. It is not an exaggeration to say that the global steel industry is in a crisis. The crisis is the direct result of foreign governments, particularly China, blatantly subsidizing their steel industries. In further violation of international trade rules, this glut of global steel production has led to the dumping of steel products into the U.S. market. Despite the highest level of domestic steel consumption since 2006, the American steel industry capacity utilization in 2015 was around 70% and pricing for most steel products essentially collapsed. 
Nucor's culture has always been defined by our willingness to tackle challenges head on and focus our energy on what is within our control. To that end, Nucor continues to be proactive and aggressive in pursuing trade cases whenever and wherever it is appropriate. When foreign producers and governments break mutually agreed-upon trade laws, there must be meaningful consequences. Nucor has joined other U.S. steel producers in filing trade cases for hot-rolled, cold-rolled and corrosion-resistant flat-rolled products. We are pleased that the International Trade Commission made preliminary determinations of injury in all 3 cases. 
Regarding the preliminary duties announced by the Commerce Department, we are satisfied with the duties applied to products from China in the corrosion-resistant and cold-rolled cases, but we are extremely disappointed in the other determinations and believe that the facts support higher duties. However, we are confident that the government will be more aggressive in its final determinations after further analysis is done. 
Another important trade issue in 2016 is China's bid to gain recognition as a market economy under its protocol of accession to the World Trade Organization agreed to in 2001. Over the past 15 years, China has failed to implement the reforms necessary to become a market economy. China remains a government-run, nonmarket economy today. Therefore, the U.S. has no reason to change its treatment of China as a nonmarket economy. 
Great challenges provide great opportunities for great companies that are ready to seize them. At Nucor, we are more than just ready. We are doing it. We are on the offensive and growing stronger. Our multipronged growth strategy is simple and flexible. That strategy is supported by Nucor's 5 drivers to profitable growth, which highlight where we are focusing our energies to build long-term earnings power and provide our shareholders with attractive returns on their valuable capital. 
Here they are: one, strengthen our position as a low-cost producer. Two, achieve market leadership positions in every product line in our portfolio. Three, move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher-quality, more import-resistant products. Four, expand our downstream channels to market to increase our steel mills' baseload volume, especially in weak markets. And five, achieve commercial excellence to complement our traditional operational strength. 
Our performance in 2015 provides numerous examples of how we are growing stronger in this downturn and positioning Nucor to deliver higher highs in profitability during the inevitable cyclical upturn. Despite the challenges, the illegally traded imports and less-than-robust capacity utilization rates, our bar mills delivered solid profitability in 2015. The keys to their success are powerful and sustainable: market leadership positions, strong channels to the market and an unrelenting focus to drive costs lower. Our fabricated construction products group achieved very strong year-over-year profit growth in 2015 and actually approached the record profitability reached in 2007. That is very impressive when you consider the fact that U.S. nonresidential construction activity for 2015, as measured by square footage, represents less than 60% of 2007's peak activity. In addition to their strong market leadership positions, Nucor's fabricated construction products enhanced the through-the-cycle profitability and flexibility of our steelmaking businesses. Our structural steel business also delivered attractive earnings growth in 2015 while working against strong headwinds from high import levels and low mill capacity utilization. Impressive results were delivered by all of our structural steel teams, our Nucor unit model mill, our Berkeley County, South Carolina mill and our piling distribution business, Skyline Steel. Nucor's ongoing success in the structural steel business continues to be powered by our market leadership position, strong channels to the market and new product introductions that continue to move as up the value chain. Our Nucor-Yamato structural mill is continuing to expand its value-added product portfolio. In 2015, Nucor-Yamato began shipping its wider sheet piling sections. These new products are already enjoying strong marketplace success. We see significant opportunities for profitable growth in this market, which currently is largely supplied by imports. Further, during the second half of 2016, Nucor-Yamato will begin commissioning its $75 million Quench and Self-Tempering project. This investment will position Nucor as the sole North American producer of high-strength, low-alloy beams. Our Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet mill achieved very solid fourth quarter and full year 2015 profitability in what can best be described as horrific flat-rolled market conditions. The Berkeley team continues to capitalize on their investments in vacuum degassing and the wide-light capabilities provided by caster and hot mill equipment upgrades. New products from the wide-light modernization are allowing us to gain new business in a wide range of end-use markets including metal buildings, rail cars, water heaters, automotive, heavy equipment and motor lamination. Of particular note, Nucor's automotive business continues to grow with work awarded by a diversified and high-quality portfolio of automotive OEM customers. 
Highlighting Nucor's overall commitment to profitable growth in the automotive market and our strategic focus on commercial excellence, we opened a Detroit sales office earlier this year. Our shipment rate to the automotive market from our sheet and SBQ bar mills increased by about 20% in 2015 versus 2014 to approximately 1.4 million tons. We believe the time could not be better for a financially strong and technologically advanced steel supplier, such as Nucor, to make a more significant contribution to the automotive industry. 
In November, we acquired the Dallas cold finish bar facilities located in Ohio and Georgia, adding combined annual production capability of 75,000 tons. This acquisition strengthens Nucor's market leadership position in this very attractive, value-added business, an important channel to the market. I warmly welcome to the Nucor family all of our newest teammates in Orrville, Ohio and Cartersville, Georgia. Our list of 5 drivers to profitable growth begins with the objective to strengthen our position as a low-cost producer. Nucor's DRI production capability, with its excellent conversion core structure, has significantly strengthened our position as a low-cost steelmaker. It gives us the flexibility to optimize Nucor's overall iron units mix, and most importantly, cost. Consistent with our announcement earlier this month, our DRI plant in Louisiana has resumed operations and is producing high-quality DRI. Recent changes in raw material pricing led to this decision. These are challenging times in the steel business. But for a company such as Nucor, one that is in a unique position of strength, these are also times of great opportunities. 
Here's what I see throughout Nucor: the right people, working with that typical high energy level and sense of urgency to seize these opportunities for profitable growth, ensuring that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us.

Higher-value products that are harder to import. We continue to develop a stronger channel to the market. That provides a nice barrier for us, gives us some protection from the imports. So we're taking this from a 2-front battle. One, we're continuing to fight the imports, the illegal, unfairly traded imports. Let me be a little clear about that. We do not have a problem with imports. We have a problem with illegal, unfairly traded imports.

That's probably where we have -- we feel that we have the greatest opportunity. As you know, that we've increased sales in automotive on an ordering -- excuse me, on a delivery basis by about 20% over last year. Today, we're at about 1.4 million ton a year market penetration. We fully expect to be able to get up to 2 million tons over the next couple of years, and that's going to be in both sheet products and in our SBQs. As we continue with sheet, we'll move up the value chain into the advanced high-strength steels. Particularly, when you think about what we've done on our Berkeley facility with the wide-light project, that's given us the ability to continue to move these higher in the strength sheet steel products while maintaining the light gains that they need in the automotive applications. So we feel very good about our sheet penetration into automotive. I'll also point out that on our SBQ, we continue to develop more and more products. And bear in mind, Tony, that our team does a great job selling to the automotive market and our products present great opportunities for the automotive customers. So let's be honest. Now the automotive industry is taking a look at the entire steel industry today, and they look at Nucor and our balance sheet and they see a long-term, sustainable supplier. When you think about how they order steel, they order steel today, takes a long time to get qualified, takes years to go through that entire process, and then the steel that they're ordering today can show up on a platform that's not even going to roll out for 2 to 3 years from today. So they want to make absolutely certain that when the effort has through the entire qualification period, that when they roll that product out, that new platform out in 2 to 3 years, they want to make sure and certain that their steel supplier is going to be there and able to supply the steel that they need, keep their factories running."

I want to finish my career with the company."" Not only do they -- are they impressed with our balance sheet, but once they come down and spend some time with us, they like our culture, they like working for the concept of working for the Nucor family. And so yes, we have a great potential to attract the best people out there.

Probably the biggest issue we have in front of us today is getting through the qualification period. It's an issue of timing. When you talk about what products that we need to develop to be able to get a deeper penetration into it, I would tell you that today, we're producing just about all the products we need to get our full penetration into automotive on making advanced high-strength steels. We have great quality steel going to the automotive industry, so we're where we need to be in terms of products today. Now having said that, what's good today is not good enough tomorrow. So we need to continue to work on developing even more sophisticated grades that have higher strength while still maintaining flexibility or improved flexibility for the designs that are coming out in the future. So there's always more to do. But I want to be clear about this point. Today, at least on Nucor's mini mill, we can produce virtually every type of steel that's used in automotive. One of the questions that I'm always asked is about exposed automotive quality. And I answered this question several times, but I'll say it one more time. Today, we have the ability to produce exposed automotive. It is actually out there on cars, going through a qualification period. And so we're very comfortable with the products that we can supply and the quality that we can supply. Now as I mentioned earlier, there's a very long qualification period. And then after the qualification period, you have to wait for the platform to be introduced that your steel is being specified on. So there's a period of time it's going to take to grow to this 2 million or better tons a year level with automotive, but it's strictly a question of working our way through that time period now."

And let me make sure that I highlight the first one, and the first one is to invest in profitable growth of our company. That is always our first focus. And I want to be clear, Timna. We believe strongly that there are many opportunities to continue to invest in the profitable, sustainable growth of our company, both internally, organic and externally through M&A activity. Now -- so that's the first objective. That will always be our first objective. Second objective in capital allocation that we always look at is to make sure that we return our shareholders' valuable capital to them in an appropriate way. We look at our dividend as being a very appropriate way to do that. We think it's a good dividend. We think it's a well-balanced dividend. We look to maintain a prudent payout ratio between the supplemental and our base. And we look forward to the days like we had in 2005 and '06 when we had such a good cash flow coming in that we can increase the supplemental dividend and return it -- return more of the capital to our shareholders. So that's our second objective. And our third objective, as you mentioned, when we can't meet either of the 2 first ones, is to look at stock as a potential buyback. And so those are the 3 areas that we look at. And I'll point out that there's a lot of questions about the cash and our cash position today. When you look at 2015, we generated a lot of cash in 2015. If I have it correct, I think it's the second highest that we've had since, what, about 2005?"

And we felt that as we talk through with our DJ Joseph team, who's out there all the time, working in the marketplace, we felt that we could attribute at least half of that to the fact that we would have taken the DRI plants offline. And since we -- when we finished the maintenance outage at the end of last month, we are at a point where we had to make a decision as to bring it back or not. And we were basically breakeven on a marginal contribution basis. And so we were kind of up in the air as to what to do. We thought it was a good opportunity to leave it off. We've always believed that bringing it online had a significant impact to us on our cost of scrap and pig iron. So we said, ""Hey, here's an opportunity to take a look and see, in fact, what happens."" So we left it off. We saw a bump go up, and it's about $25 to $30 a ton across the spectrum on scrap and about $10 on pig iron. Well, again, that's a huge impact for us. So we brought it back online because of that, and I came away from the whole thing and the team came away from the whole thing more convinced than ever that although you might not see immediate profitability in the DRI plant itself, when you look at the overall impact to our company, on iron units, which represents 60% of our costs, the overall impact to our company is significantly better, running that DRI plant and not running the DRI plant, even if it is not profitable in its own right."

But on a year-over-year basis, they're still down, running down probably 25% to 30%. The second part of your question, I think -- let me take a shot at looking at it this way. Our DJJ business model is a very diverse business model. We sometimes get caught up in thinking that it's only a recycling business with scrap yards. But we have 5 or 6 different business elements in our DJJ business and the recycling group alone, as a part of that, only represents about 15% of the DJJ revenue flow. So the DJJ business model performance, financial performance, does not extensively rely on the recycling group. For the recycling group to see improvements, really, all you need -- it's not as much flow base as much as you need stability in the pricing. In other words, for most of 2015, we were seeing significant drops in the market price for scrap, and that's kind of like catching a falling knife. You could never really catch up with it. Once price is stabilized or shows any sign of increase, then that is what drives margins and profitability at the recycling group more than just volumes. Does that help?"

In addition to imports coming down a little bit, the service center inventories are down a little bit. So bottom line is, yes, we do see our utilization rates increasing as we go into the first quarter. And also remember that we're moving into a period where we've kind of come out of -- the fourth quarter is usually the weakest quarter in terms of the steel business. So we're kind of coming out of that quarter. First quarter, second quarter, we see -- we typically see an improvement in utilization rates, and we think that we'll continue to see that. You mentioned the slowdown in imports. You mentioned the reduction of the PE inventories in our service centers, but I would also mention to you that there's been quite a few shutdowns from some of our competitors. We believe we'll see some improved utilization as a result of that also. And also, with pricing, we're seeing a small bounce in pricing. When you see a bounce in pricing, typically, that kind of gets things going away again. Customers, when pricing is going down, are kind of waiting till they hit the bottom. As you know, we've increased pricing in several of our products, and those price increases have been holding. So we feel pretty confident that we stopped the slide and we're moving back up.

Again, I've said this several times that at Nucor, all of our strategies are pointed towards long-term sustainable profitable growth. And at the end of the day, we still believe very, very strongly that out -- I'm not sure whether it's going to be 5 years, 7 years or 10 years, but we believe that as a result of the manufacturing decreasing in the United States and several other things, we'll be glad we have that DRI plant. Just remember one other thing. We're very heavy into pig iron. That's very important to us. And right now, we get about 70%, 80% of our pig iron out of Russia. The rest of it is coming out of Brazil. Those are not the most stable places in the world geopolitically. HBI, which is another potential product that we could use as a scrap substitute, comes out of Venezuela. That's also not a very stable geopolitical area. So when you look at all of these facts and you look at our goal of being flexible, okay, long term, having flexibility and balance across our portfolio, in a cyclical business, whether scrap pricing is cyclical, iron ore pricing is cyclical, pig iron pricing is cyclical, steel pricing is cyclical, when you look at that, I believe that the key to long-term, stable returns to our investors, the best way to accomplish that is to have a nice balanced portfolio and a flexible portfolio that allows us to move things around as we need to, to optimize the costs, provide the lowest cost of product, inputs and the most -- optimize our margins coming out of our mills. So long-winded answer to your question, but no, our strategy hasn't changed. We believe it's the right strategy, and we're going to continue with it."

First quarter 2016 earnings of $0.22 per diluted share was within our guidance range of $0.20 to $0.25 per diluted share. First quarter results included a LIFO charge of $27.5 million or about $0.02 per share higher than projected in our gui",990,"Thanks, John. First quarter 2016 earnings of $0.22 per diluted share was within our guidance range of $0.20 to $0.25 per diluted share. First quarter results included a LIFO charge of $27.5 million or about $0.02 per share higher than projected in our guidance. Excluding the impact of LIFO inventory accounting, the first quarter's performance represented an improvement over the fourth quarter of 2015 to adjusted net earnings of $0.45 per diluted share, which included a LIFO credit of $0.41 per share. 
Market conditions remain challenging during the first quarter, but are now improving. Reflecting the impact of the 2014 to 2015 import surge, average steel mill prices and metal margins declined in the first quarter from already weak fourth quarter levels. However, imports had begun to subside, and steel mill pricing and metal margins improved notably by the end of the quarter. As the market bottom, our team again capitalized on the opportunities provided by such core new strengths as our highly flexible production capabilities and our unrivaled product diversity. 
Here are 3 examples. First, Nucor's sheet mill group took advantage of competitors' supply curtailments and lower imports to increase first quarter of 2016 shipments 25% over year-ago first quarter shipments and 32% over fourth quarter of 2015 shipments. 
Second, Nucor's downstream steel products business achieved year-over-year growth in quarterly profitability as nonresidential construction activity continued on its path of gradual improvement. These profitable channels to market also significantly enhanced the performance of our steelmaking business. 
Third, Nucor's structural steel group increased its first quarter shipments volume 15% over the prior year quarter and 11% over the fourth quarter of 2015. Our teams at Nucor-Yamato, Nucor Steel Berkeley and Skyline Steel together drove this growth. As the market leader in structural steel, Nucor derives great value from being the low-cost producer and offering North America's broadest product portfolio of beams and piling. 
A quick comment about our first quarter 2016 tax rate as it can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. Excluding profits belonging to our business partners, the effective tax rate was 34.4% for the first quarter. Nucor's financial position remains strong. We are the only North American steel producer to hold an investment-grade credit rating. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 36% at the close of the first quarter. 
Cash and short-term investments totaled more than $2.3 billion, a $300 million increase from the end of 2015. This compares with total debt outstanding of $4.4 billion. Our next significant debt maturities are $600 million in notes due in December 2017 and $500 million in notes due in June of 2018. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The maturity for our revolving credit facility was recently extended to April of 2021. For 2016, we estimate capital spending of approximately $500 million. 
Depreciation and amortization for 2016 is expected to total about $700 million. Our capital spending budget for this year includes a number of attractive growth projects. You will note the objective of these projects is to expand our portfolio to higher value-added applications while maintaining our position as the market leader in more commodity products. Examples are: Nucor-Yamato's Quench and Self-Tempering project to become the sole North American producer of high-strength, low-alloy beams. Adding a heat treat facility at our Memphis SBQ mill to expand our participation in energy, automotive, heavy equipment and service center market, an upgraded finishing at our Auburn, New York bar mill; expanding Skyline Steel's structural pipe piling production capability; installing equipment at our Galton, Kentucky sheet mill; adding direct quenching capably to our Tuscaloosa, Alabama plate mill to expand its capabilities to include high-value to low-alloy grades of plate; and finally, expanding the port facility at Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet and beam mill. 
Nucor's capital allocation projects are clear, and they've been consistently and effectively practiced over 90 years. They guide our work as effective stewards of our shareholders' investment in our company. Our first priority is to invest for profitable, long-term growth through our multipronged strategy of optimizing existing operations, acquisitions and greenfield expansions. We often characterize this work as building higher highs in Nucor's cyclical peak earnings power. 
Our second priority is to provide our shareholders with cash dividends that are consistent with our success and delivering long-term earnings growth. Our third priority is to opportunistically repurchase our stock when our cash position is strong and our shares our attractively priced. Nucor's balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation is evidenced by a record of investing for long-term growth and rewarding shareholders with attractive cash returns. 
Over the 10-year period ending in 2015, Nucor invested $12.4 billion in growth projects while also returning a total of $6.8 billion of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We are also pleased to note that with the dividend paid in February, Nucor has increased its base dividend for 43 consecutive years. 
Earnings in the second quarter of 2016 are expected to improve significantly compared to the first quarter. Our steel mills segment will benefit from increased metal margins and volume, particularly at our sheet mills. The performance of our downstream steel products segment will benefit from typical seasonal factors as well as ongoing gradual improvement in nonresidential construction market. As we measure by square footage, we expect full year 2016 nonresidential construction market activity to increase by approximately 5% over 2015. 
For our raw materials segment, scrap recycling margins and volumes should improve. With recent increases in market pricing for iron units, our DRI production facilities will continue to be important assets, helping us optimize raw material costs at our Steelmaking Operations. We are confident that Nucor's significant competitive advantages and highly adaptable business model will allow our team to continue to execute our proven strategies for delivering profitable, long-term growth and attractive returns to Nucor shareholders. 
We appreciate your interest in our company. John?"

Nucor's strategy for profitable growth is simple, flexible and focused. Nucor capitalizes on its unrivaled position of strength to gain profitable market share in our core businesses of steel and steel products. We are doing this by taking care of our customers with our unrelenting focus on providing products and services that our competitors simply can't match. Delivering an unmatched value proposition to our customers and getting paid for that value is how we will earn attractive returns on the valuable capital our shareholders have entrusted to the Nucor team. Anchoring the strategy and its execution is Nucor's business model. Its strength and adaptability is powered by these building blocks that include: our culture, our robust balance sheet and cash flow generation through the cycle, our low and highly variable cost structure, our flexible and reliable production capabilities, our product diversity and vertical integration and our leadership positions in most of the markets we serve. Put together, these competitive strengths provide Nucor with a powerful platform for creating value for our customers. Our teammates have done, and continued to do excellent work implementing our multipronged strategy for profitable growth. They are doing it by executing on what we call Nucor's 5 drivers to profitable growth. Through the industry downturn that began in 2009 and continued into 2016, Nucor has invested more than $6 billion in these 5 drivers that increase our capacity to create and deliver value to our customers. 
Here are the 5 drivers to delivering value to our customers and profitable growth to our shareholders. One, strengthening our position as a low-cost producer. Two, move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher-quality, higher-margin products. Three, expand our downstream channels to market that increase our steel mills' baseload volume. This is especially important in weak markets. Four, achieve the market leadership position in every product offering in our portfolio. Five, achieve commercial excellence to complement our traditional operational strength. Our 5 drivers to profitable growth are producing results in challenging business conditions. Even better, Nucor is primed and ready for the inevitable steel industry up cycle. Since the last cyclical peak in 2008, we have added more cylinders to our engine for generating profits and cash flow. Nucor remains on the offensive and continues to grow stronger. 
I will now update you on some first quarter of 2016 highlights and executing our growth strategy. Nucor-Yamato's new, wider sheet piling sections are being extremely well received by our customers, with first quarter of 2016 volume well ahead of our expectations. Our teams at Nucor-Yamato and at Skyline Steel are working together to aggressively go after this market, which is currently largely supplied by imports. We have now commercialized 2 of the 4 wider sheet piling product groups, and the other 2 groups will enter commercial production later this year. Our goal over the next several years is to grow our wider piling sections annual volume to 100,000 tons with these value-added products generating both incremental volume and margins. Our SBQ bar mill group continues to grow its product offerings, while maintaining profitability in adverse market conditions. At our Memphis mill, installation of heat-treating equipment is nearing completion, and start-up is set for the current quarter. This will expand our capabilities to include Quench and tempering as well as a [indiscernible] of bars from 2.5 inches up to 11 inches in diameter. Also, our South Carolina bar mill is expanding its wire rod size range at its new rolling mill. This is allowing us to penetrate new markets, including tire bead and cold heading applications. 
Our Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet mill achieved very solid first quarter profitability in extremely tough flat-rolled market conditions. The Berkeley team is capitalizing on its recent upgrades to its Castor and hot mill. Berkeley's new wide-light products continued to enjoy strong marketplace success with 2016 shipments of these high value-added offerings targeted to be 240,000 tons. 
Being a low-cost steelmaker able to compete globally definitely requires effective managing of the cost of our iron units. Nucor's raw material investments are providing significant value to us in the rising scrap pricing environment that has unfolded in 2016. No other steelmaker has the breadth and integration of our raw materials platform, scrap processing, domestic scrap brokerage, international scrap and pig iron brokerage and DRI production assets. Our raw materials and steel mill teammates have worked in complete alignment, allowing Nucor to take advantage of the lowest-cost opportunities to meet our scrap and scrap substitute requirements. 
For example, our David J. Joseph, or DJJ, scrap yards have successfully increased the flow of domestic scrap into the overall market and into our mills. Our DJJ domestic brokerage team has taken advantage of the lowest-cost opportunities in the domestic scrap market. Our DJJ international brokerage team has also purchased and supplied attractively priced scrap and pig iron from overseas. Equally important is the fact that our DRI plants in Trinidad and Louisiana have been performing consistently at high productivity and quality levels through 2016. 
I will now close my thoughts on what remains the biggest issue facing Nucor and all steel producers, global steelmaking overcapacity resulting from trade distorting practices of some governments. China is the prime example. But it's also important to understand that it is by no means the only country guilty of illegal trade practices. From outright government ownership to a vast array of illegal subsidies, many foreign steel companies are shielded from the realities of the market and the discipline of a level playing field that determines winners based on real economic advantage. In blatant violation of international trade rules, this glut of global steel production has led to the dumping of steel products into the U.S. market. 
Nucor embraces free and fair competition. With our culture that thrives on continual improvement and technological innovation, we always win in such an environment. For that reason, our team will continue to be proactive and aggressive in pursuing effective and timely enforcement of our nation's trade laws. We owe nothing less than that to our customers, teammates and shareholders. Nucor is encouraged by growing recognition of this crisis and the initial work done by our government to address this crisis. Having said that, there's a tremendous amount of work still to be done. Several important upcoming developments have our attention over the next several months. Final determinations are expected this summer in the 3 pending flat-rolled trade cases. We have confidence that our government will examine all of the evidence and remedy the full measure of the illegal trade that is occurring. 
Earlier this month, the Commerce Department reversed itself and found that Turkey is dumping rebar into the U.S. market. We are seeking expedited implementation of this remedy. Nucor and 2 other domestic plate producers recently filed petitions against the illegally traded imports of cut-to-length plate from 12 countries. We look forward to our government's careful study of the evidence. Last year, the annual volume of imports from the 12 countries targeted by this case was double the amount imported in 2013. 
Another important trade issue in 2016 is China's expected bid to gain recognition as a market economy under the terms of its agreement to join the World Trade Organization in 2001. Over the past 15 years, China has failed to implement the reforms necessary to become a market economy. China remains a government-run, nonmarket economy today. Therefore, the U.S. has no reason to change its treatment of China as a nonmarket economy. 
Challenges clearly remain for the global steel industry. But for a company such as Nucor, one that is in a unique position of strength, these are also times of great opportunities. That is why, at Nucor, we remain optimistic, determined and focused. I want to again thank my teammates for working with their typical high energy level and sense of urgency to seize these opportunities for profitable growth. Thank you for what you do for Nucor every day. And most importantly, thank you for doing it safely. I firmly believe Nucor's best years are still ahead of us. Thank you all for your interest in Nucor. We would now be happy to take your questions."

And we expect that, that market to improve significantly as we go into the second quarter.

First priority, as always, is the investment for long-term, sustainable, profitable growth, looking at optimizing our existing operations where we always get our biggest bang for our buck; acquisitions, where they make the most sense and were not overpriced. And if they, in fact, fit within our 5 tenets of profitable growth and greenfield expansions also a possibility. And of course, in a world filled with overcapacity, I have to add to that and say, we would only do that in cases where we found very specific niche markets or niche geographical locations where we're not represented well. Second priority is to provide our shareholders with dividends consistent with our success and delivering long-term results. And third priority would be to opportunistically repurchase our shares when the price is good to do so. And the repurchasing program we mentioned earlier, we had a strike price that we thought was the right number, and we bought when we were under that strike price, and we stopped when it went over. Now clearly, when you look at where our stock is today, we would have probably been a little bit more aggressive in the buyback. It was impossible to know that at that time.

I'm not going to address any potential JVs or anything like that, but I would speak to our interest in automotive and our continuous -- continuing interest in moving up the value chain in automotive. Automotive has been great for us over the last 3 to 5 years. We continue to grow our presence there. Our products are being extremely well received by the automotive producers both the domestic and the new domestics, frankly here and in Mexico, so we will continue to take a more active role in automotive and will continue to move up the value chain. We have some interest in exposed. That is not a focal point for us. We think that where we have to, we can produce it, we'll produce it, but it's not an area that we will put the majority of our efforts. We focus on body and weight and then steels that go into those products -- into those areas. Now when the right opportunities come along, specialized galvanizing facilities, we'll take a good, hard look at them. And if we think that it continues to build upon our ability to grow in that market, we'll take them. I can tell you that, we are -- Nucor, as a whole, as well as our products are being well received in the automotive market. Think about the fact that companies in the past -- and I apologize because I'm repeating myself, but it's important to think about. When steel is specified for a product that's coming out to a platform, you specify the steel for a platform that's not even going to be [indiscernible] production for 2 to 3 years. You want to make sure that when you're ready to go into production, the steel that you specified for that one is still around. So the automotive companies are looking hard at -- making sure that they have reliable suppliers, sustainable suppliers, financially strong suppliers. You can just check the boxes on that one when you consider Nucor. So our company and our products are being very well received in the marketplace, and we anticipate continuing to grow automotive. If you look at just what we've done in Q1, our automotive line was about -- up about 20% compared to where we were in 2005 -- '15, excuse me. 2015, and we anticipate it to continue to grow."

And clearly, a lot of steel products come into nonresidential construction. I also want to make a comment about your question on the oil side. It's clear that we really, particularly Nucor, took being heavy in the hot band -- took a big hit when the oil market collapsed and the demand for steel into that market collapsed. That said, we really haven't seen any pickup in it. Now we recognize that until oil pricing goes back up into the $60, $70 range, you won't see the kind of drilling that took place in the past. If people say, ""Well, maybe, they'll be at drilling at about 50% of the level where it is today for a long period of time."" But even with drilling at 50% level of that today, we haven't seen the pickup in the steel demand into the [indiscernible] 50% of the market like we have in the past. So we anticipate seeing that pickup some time maybe in the middle of this year towards the end of the year as the steel and the inventory chain begins to be used out. And that statement can also be held for when you look at our service center inventory. When you look at across the board, almost all of our steel products, service center inventory levels are down. Apparent demand at the service center level was up slightly, so we see the shipments going up and inventories coming down. That's good news. So there's are some of the areas that I would share with you."

We again saw some negative results coming out of your DRI facilities. I was just wondering if you could just talk to -- is the wind kind of turning in your favor now with what we're seeing globally with iron ore prices and impact on DRI? But secondly, what is leading to sort of the near-term weak operating results there? And could you comment if operationally everything is now sort of on demand there?"
184945,330266466,961056,"Nucor Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Nucor Corporation","Executives","Well, let's start with the operational side because there really is good news to report there. Louisiana facility is running very well. The cost of that facility continue to come down. The cost of that facility in Louisiana today rival those in Trinidad,",375,"Well, let's start with the operational side because there really is good news to report there. Louisiana facility is running very well. The cost of that facility continue to come down. The cost of that facility in Louisiana today rival those in Trinidad, which, as you know, are world-class. Quality continues to be excellent coming out of Louisiana. And it continues to be great coming out of Trinidad also. In terms of whether or not the winds are changing, the answer to that is clearly yes. Not only we refer to the iron ore price increase, but take a look at what's happening to scrap. In the last 60 days, the price of scrap has gone up maybe $70, $80 a ton. And pig iron pricing, over the last 2 months, has gone up about $100 a ton. And when you look at those 2 factors and the impact that, that has on the profitability of -- specifically our DRI operations, definitely the wind is changing direction. And we anticipate much better results going forward. To your last point, I would make is that remember the economic impact -- of our raw material group, in general, particularly our DRI facilities, impacts our entire company, not just that one particular group. So when you look at the benefit that we see from that across the steel mills and our ability to optimize our scrap mix, there's a great economic impact across the company as well as it offsets some of the impact of our DRI facility and the raw material group. And we look at DRI, because of the way that the pricing goes with that, we deliver to our mills, you'll see a smaller improvement in Q2 with the majority of the improvement coming in Q3. Because basically, there's a 60- to 90-day lag in the increase in pricing that we see at our mills because we transfer DRI to our mills at the time at the price whether the pig iron was delivered to those operations. So there's about a 60- to 90-day lag in that. So you won't see this -- the changing winds have a major impact in Q2, but we will see some, but you'll see a major impact in Q3."

As you said, we have seen scrap demand increase over the last couple of months. And quite frankly, that is steel mill demand-driven, especially demand from our VAF mill customers like Nucor and others. And this demand increase has certainly pulled the price up, as John said, about 90 -- $70 over the last 60 to 90 days. But this, in turn, has increased the flow of unprocessed scrap into the yards. As you know very well, scrap is elastic commodity. So this price increase is starting to improve volumes. So we've seen a significant volume improvement into our scrap yards. So with the supply side improving, along with the global reach we have on pig iron, the great performance John just talked about our DRI plants in terms of the volumes and the capacity utilization there, we really think that raw material prices, scrap prices are going to flatten out here, in the second quarter, flatten out over the next 30 to 60 days. And -- so that's kind of what we think. I will also say that the big jump here -- I think there was a little catch-up going on. Most steel mills in the country were running at pretty low capacity utilizations in the fourth quarter. They had left their inventory stripped down a little bit. So what we've seen here in the first quarter is response to improved steel mill demand orders but also a little catching up and rebuilding of inventories. So as that levels out here in the second quarter, we're going to see scrap prices returning to kind of flat levels."

So it really depends -- that's why I'm a little hesitant to give a specific number because it really depends on the mix that we're running at any given time, how wide is the product, how light is the product, what is the grade of the product, how hard is a product, what's the strain ratio the product, all of those are factors. So what we typically do is talk in terms of -- if you want a single number, we talk in terms of what we melt in cash, which is in the neighborhood of 12 million to 13 million tons in our steel mills.

First quarter results included a LIFO charge of $27.5 million or about $0.02 per share higher than projected in our gu",994,"Thanks, John.
First quarter 2016 earnings of $0.22 per diluted share was within our guidance range of $0.20 to $0.25 per diluted share. First quarter results included a LIFO charge of $27.5 million or about $0.02 per share higher than projected in our guidance. Excluding the impact of the LIFO inventory accounting, the first quarter's performance represented an improvement over the fourth quarter of 2015's adjusted net earnings of $0.45 per diluted share, which included a LIFO credit of $0.41 per share.
Market conditions remain challenging during the first quarter, but are now improving. Reflecting the impact of the 2014 to 2015 import surge, average steel mill prices and metal margins declined in the first quarter from already-weak fourth quarter levels. However, imports had begun to subside, and steel mill pricing and metal margins improved notably by the end of the quarter. As the market bottomed, our team again capitalized on the opportunities provided by such core Nucor strengths as our highly flexible production capabilities and our unrivaled product diversity.
Here are 3 examples. First, Nucor's Sheet Mill Group took advantage of competitors' supply curtailments and lower imports to increase first quarter of 2016 shipments 25% over year-ago first quarter shipments and 32% over fourth quarter of 2015 shipments.
Second, Nucor's downstream steel products business achieved year-over-year growth in quarterly profitability as nonresidential construction activity continued on its path of gradual improvement. These profitable channels to market also significantly enhanced the performance of our steelmaking business.
Third, Nucor's structural steel group increased its first quarter shipments volume 15% over the prior year quarter and 11% over the fourth quarter of 2015. Our teams at Nucor-Yamato, Nucor Steel Berkeley and Skyline Steel together drove this growth. As the market leader in structural steel, Nucor derives great value from being the low-cost producer and offering North America's broadest product portfolio of beams and piling.
A quick comment about our first quarter 2016 tax rate as it can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. Excluding profits belonging to our business partners, the effective tax rate was 34.4% for the first quarter. Nucor's financial position remains strong. We are the only North American steel producer to hold an investment-grade credit rating. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 36% at the close of the first quarter.
Cash and short-term investments totaled more than $2.3 billion, a $300 million increase from the end of 2015. This compares with total debt outstanding of $4.4 billion. Our next significant debt maturities are $600 million in notes due in December 2017 and $500 million in notes due in June of 2018. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The maturity for our revolving credit facility was recently extended to April of 2021. For 2016, we estimate capital spending of approximately $500 million.
Depreciation and amortization for 2016 is expected to total about $700 million. Our capital spending budget for this year includes a number of attractive growth projects. You will note the objective of these projects is to expand our portfolio to higher value-added applications while maintaining our position as the market leader in more commodity products. Examples are: Nucor-Yamato's Quench and Self-Tempering project to become the sole North American producer of high-strength, low-alloy beams; adding a heat treat facility at our Memphis SBQ mill to expand our participation in energy, automotive, heavy equipment and service center markets; an upgraded finishing end at our Auburn, New York bar mill; expanding Skyline Steel's structural pipe piling production capability; installing [indiscernible] equipment at our Galton, Kentucky sheet mill; adding direct quenching capability to our Tuscaloosa, Alabama plate mill to expand its capabilities to include high-value, low-alloy grades of plate; and finally, expanding the port facility at our Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet and beam mill.
Nucor's capital allocation projects are clear, and they have been consistently and effectively practiced over 90 years. They guide our work as effective stewards of our shareholders' investment in our company. Our first priority is to invest for profitable, long-term growth through our multipronged strategy of optimizing the existing operations, acquisitions and greenfield expansions. We often characterize this work as building higher highs in Nucor's cyclical peak earnings power.
Our second priority is to provide our shareholders with cash dividends that are consistent with our success and delivering long-term earnings growth. Our third priority is to opportunistically repurchase our stock when our cash position is strong and our shares our attractively priced. Nucor's balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation is evidenced by a record of investing for long-term growth and rewarding shareholders with attractive cash returns.
Over the 10-year period ending in 2015, Nucor invested $12.4 billion in growth projects while also returning a total of $6.8 billion of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We are also pleased to note that with the dividend paid in February, Nucor has increased its base dividend for 43 consecutive years.
Earnings in the second quarter of 2016 are expected to improve significantly compared to the first quarter. Our steel mills segment will benefit from increased metal margins and volume, particularly at our sheet mills. The performance of our downstream steel products segment will benefit from typical seasonal factors as well as ongoing gradual improvement in nonresidential construction markets. As we measure by square footage, we expect full year 2016 nonresidential construction market activity to increase by approximately 5% over 2015.
For our raw materials segment, scrap recycling margins and volumes should improve. With the recent increases in market pricing for iron units, our DRI production facilities will continue to be important assets, helping us optimize raw material costs at our Steelmaking Operations. We are confident that Nucor's significant competitive advantages and highly adaptable business model will allow our team to continue to execute our proven strategies for delivering profitable, long-term growth and attractive returns to Nucor shareholders. We appreciate your interest in our company.

Nucor's strategy for profitable growth is simple, flexible and focused. Nucor capitalizes on its unrivaled position of strength to gain profitable market share in our core businesses of steel and steel products. We are doing this by taking care of our customers with our unrelenting focus on providing products and services that our competitors simply can't match. Delivering an unmatched value proposition to our customers and getting paid for that value is how we will earn attractive returns on the valuable capital our shareholders have entrusted to the Nucor team. Anchoring the strategy and its execution is Nucor's business model. Its strength and adaptability is powered by these building blocks that include: our culture, our robust balance sheet and cash flow generation through the cycle, our low and highly variable cost structure, our flexible and reliable production capabilities, our product diversity and vertical integration and our leadership positions in most of the markets we serve. Put together, these competitive strengths provide Nucor with a powerful platform for creating value for our customers. Our teammates have done and continue to do excellent work implementing our multipronged strategy for profitable growth. They are doing it by executing on what we call Nucor's 5 drivers to profitable growth. Through the industry downturn that began in 2009 and continued into 2016, Nucor has invested more than $6 billion in these 5 drivers that increase our capacity to create and deliver value to our customers.
Here are the 5 drivers to delivering value to our customers and profitable growth to our shareholders: one, strengthening our position as a low-cost producer; two, move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher-quality, higher-margin products; three, expand our downstream channels to market that increase our steel mills' baseload volume, this is especially important in weak markets; four, achieve the market leadership position in every product offering in our portfolio; five, achieve commercial excellence to complement our traditional operational strength. Our 5 drivers to profitable growth are producing results in challenging business conditions. Even better, Nucor is primed and ready for the inevitable steel industry up cycle. Since the last cyclical peak in 2008, we have added more cylinders to our engine for generating profits and cash flow. Nucor remains on the offensive and continues to grow stronger.
I will now update you on some first quarter of 2016 highlights and executing our growth strategy. Nucor-Yamato's new, wider sheet piling sections are being extremely well-received by our customers, with first quarter of 2016 volume well-ahead of our expectations. Our teams at Nucor-Yamato and at Skyline Steel are working together to aggressively go after this market, which is currently largely supplied by imports. We have now commercialized 2 of the 4 wider sheet piling product groups, and the other 2 groups will enter commercial production later this year. Our goal over the next several years is to grow our wider piling sections' annual volume to 100,000 tons, with these value-added products generating both incremental volume and margins. Our SBQ bar mill group continues to grow its product offerings while maintaining profitability in adverse market conditions. At our Memphis mill, installation of heat-treating equipment is nearing completion, and start-up is set for the current quarter. This will expand our capabilities to include Quench and Tempering as well as annealing of bars from 2.5 inches up to 11 inches in diameter. Also, our South Carolina bar mill is expanding its wire rod size range at its new rolling mill. This is allowing us to penetrate new markets, including tire bead and cold heading applications.
Our Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet mill achieved very solid first quarter profitability in extremely tough flat-rolled market conditions. The Berkeley team is capitalizing on its recent upgrades to its caster and hot mill. Berkeley's new wide-light products continued to enjoy strong marketplace success, with 2016 shipments of these high-value added offerings targeted to be 240,000 tons.
Being a low-cost steelmaker able to compete globally definitely requires effective managing of the cost of our iron units. Nucor's raw material investments are providing significant value to us in the rising scrap pricing environment that has unfolded in 2016. No other steelmaker has the breadth and integration of our raw materials platform, scrap processing, domestic scrap brokerage, international scrap and pig iron brokerage and DRI production assets. Our raw materials and steel mill teammates have worked in complete alignment, allowing Nucor to take advantage of the lowest cost opportunities to meet our scrap and scrap substitute requirements.
For example, our David J. Joseph, or DJJ, scrap yards have successfully increased the flow of domestic scrap into the overall market and into our mills. Our DJJ domestic brokerage team has taken advantage of the lowest-cost opportunities in the domestic scrap market. Our DJJ international brokerage team has also purchased and supplied attractively priced scrap and pig iron from overseas. Equally important is the fact that our DRI plants in Trinidad and Louisiana have been performing consistently at high productivity and quality levels through 2016.
I will now close my thoughts on what remains the biggest issue facing Nucor and all steel producers, global steelmaking overcapacity resulting from trade distorting practices of some governments. China is the prime example. But it's also important to understand that it is by no means the only country guilty of illegal trade practices. From outright government ownership to a vast array of illegal subsidies, many foreign steel companies are shielded from the realities of the market and the discipline of a level playing field that determines winners based on real economic advantage. In blatant violation of international trade rules, this glut of global steel production has led to the dumping of steel products into the U.S. market.
Nucor embraces free and fair competition. With our culture that thrives on continual improvement and technological innovation, we always win in such an environment. For that reason, our team will continue to be proactive and aggressive in pursuing effective and timely enforcement of our nation's trade laws. We owe nothing less than that to our customers, teammates and shareholders. Nucor is encouraged by growing recognition of this crisis and the initial work done by our government to address this crisis. Having said that, there's a tremendous amount of work still to be done. Several important upcoming developments have our attention over the next several months. Final determinations are expected this summer in the 3 pending flat-rolled trade cases. We have confidence that our government will examine all of the evidence and remedy the full measure of the illegal trade that is occurring.
Earlier this month, the Commerce Department reversed itself and found that Turkey is dumping rebar into the U.S. market. We are seeking expedited implementation of this remedy. Nucor and 2 other domestic plate producers recently filed petitions against illegally traded imports of cut-to-length plate from 12 countries. We look forward to our government's careful study of the evidence. Last year, the annual volume of imports from the 12 countries targeted by this case was double the amount imported in 2013.
Another important trade issue in 2016 is China's expected bid to gain recognition as a market economy under the terms of its agreement to join the World Trade Organization in 2001. Over the past 15 years, China has failed to implement the reforms necessary to become a market economy. China remains a government-run, nonmarket economy today. Therefore, the U.S. has no reason to change its treatment of China as a nonmarket economy.
Challenges clearly remain for the global steel industry. But for a company such as Nucor, one that is in a unique position of strength, these are also times of great opportunities. That is why at Nucor, we remain optimistic, determined and focused. I want to again thank my teammates for working with their typical high energy level and sense of urgency to seize these opportunities for profitable growth. Thank you for what you do to Nucor every day. And most importantly, thank you for doing it safely. I firmly believe Nucor's best years are still ahead of us.
Thank you all for your interest in Nucor. We would now be happy to take your questions."

First priority, as always, is the investment for long-term, sustainable, profitable growth, looking at optimizing our existing operations where we always get our biggest bang for our buck; acquisitions, where they make the most sense and where they're not overpriced; and if they, in fact, fit within our 5 tenets of profitable growth; and greenfield expansions, also a possibility. And of course, in a world filled with overcapacity, I have to add to that and say, we would only do that in cases where we found very specific niche markets or niche geographical locations where we're not represented well. The second priority is to provide our shareholders with dividends consistent with our success and delivering long-term results. And third priority would be to opportunistically repurchase our shares when the price is good to do so. In the repurchasing program we mentioned earlier, we had a strike price that we thought was the right number, and we bought when we were under that strike price, and we stopped when it went over. Now clearly, when you look at where our stock is today, we would have probably been a little bit more aggressive in the buyback. It was impossible to know that at that time.

I'm not going to address any potential JVs or anything like that, but I will speak to our interest in automotive and our continuous -- continuing interest in moving up the value chain in automotive. Automotive has been great for us over the last 3 to 5 years. We continue to grow our presence there. Our products are being extremely well-received by the automotive producers, both the domestic and the new domestics, so -- frankly, here and in Mexico. So we will continue to take a more active role in automotive. We will continue to move up the value chain. We have some interest unexposed that is not a focal point for us. We think that where we have to, we can produce it, we will produce it, but it's not an area that we will put the majority of our efforts. We focus on body and weight, advanced high-strain steels that go into those products -- into those areas. Now when the right opportunities come along, many specialized galvanizing facilities will take a good hard look at them. And if we think that it continues to build upon our ability to grow in that market, we'll take them. I can tell you that, we are -- Nucor, as a whole, as well as our products are being well-received in the automotive market. Think about the fact that companies in the past, and I apologize because if I'm repeating myself, but it's important to think about. When steel is specified for a product that's coming out to a platform, you specify the steel for a platform that's not even going to be [indiscernible] into production for 2 or 3 years. You want to make sure that when you're ready to go into production, the steel that you specified for that one is still around. So the automotive companies are looking hard at -- making sure that they have reliable suppliers, sustainable suppliers, financially strong suppliers. You can just check the boxes on that when you consider Nucor. So our company and our products are being very well-received in the marketplace, and we anticipate continuing to grow in automotive. If you look at just what we've done in Q1, our automotive line was about -- up about 20% compared to where we were in 2005 -- '15, excuse me. 2015, and we anticipate it to continue to grow."

Obviously, you mentioned automotive being strong. We mentioned the ones that were challenged, but I would suggest that, one, that we see to continually improve, albeit at a very slow level is nonresidential construction. And clearly, a lot of steel products go into nonresidential construction. I also want to make a comment about your question on the oil side. It's clear that we really, particularly Nucor, took being heavy in the hot band, took a big hit when the oil market collapsed and the demand for steel into that market collapsed. That said, we really haven't seen any pickup in it. Now we recognize that until oil pricing goes back up into the $60, $70 range, you won't see the kind of drilling that took place in the past. If people say, well, maybe, they'll be at -- drilling at about 50% of the level where it is today for a long period of time. But even with drilling at the 50% level it's at today, we haven't seen the pickup in the steel demand go into the feed that 50% of the market like we have in the past. So we anticipate seeing that pickup some time maybe in the middle of this year towards the end of the year as the steel in the inventory chain begins to be used up. And that statement can also be held for when you look at our service center inventories. When you look at across the board and almost all of our steel products, service center inventory levels are down. Apparent demand at the service center level was up slightly, so we see that shipment's going up and inventory's coming down. That's good news. So those are some of the areas that I would share with you."

Louisiana facility is going very well. The cost of that facility continue to come down. Frankly, the cost to set our facility in Louisiana today rival those in Trinidad, which, as you know, are world-class. Quality continues to be excellent coming out of Louisiana. And it continues to be great coming out of Trinidad also. In terms of whether or not the winds are changing, the answer to that is clearly yes. Not only did you refer to the iron ore price increase, but take a look at what's happening to the scrap. In the last 60 days, the price of scrap has gone up maybe to $70, $80 a ton. And pig iron pricing, over the last 2 months, has gone up about $100 a ton. And when you look at those 2 factors and the impact that, that has on profitability of our -- specifically our DRI operations, definitely the wind is changing direction. And we anticipate much better results going forward. To your last point, I would make is remember that the economic impact of the -- of our raw material group, in general, particularly our DRI facilities, impacts our entire company, not just that one particular group. So when you look at the benefit that we see from that across the steel mills and our ability to optimize our scrap mix, there's a great economic impact across the company as well as it offsets some of the impacts of our DRI facilities and the raw material group. When we look at DRI because of the way that the pricing goes with -- that we deliver to our mills, you'll see a smaller improvement in Q2, with the majority of the improvement coming in Q3. Because basically, there's a 60- to 90-day lag in the increase in pricing that we see at our mills because we transfer the DRI to our mills at the time and at the price, whether the pig iron is delivered to those operations. So there's about a 60- to 90-day lag in that. So you won't see this -- the changing winds have a major impact in Q2, but we will see some, but you'll see a major impact in Q3."

As you said, we have seen scrap demand increase over the last couple of months. And quite frankly, that is steel mill demand-driven, especially demand from our BAF mill customers like Nucor but others. And this demand increase has certainly pulled the price up, as John said, about $90 -- $70 over the last 60 to 90 days. But this, in turn, has increased the flow of unprocessed scrap into the yards. As you know very well, scrap is the elastic commodity. So this price increase is starting to improve volumes. So we've seen a significant volume improvement into our scrap yards. So with the supply side improving along with the global reach we have on pig iron, the great performance John just talked about, about our DRI plants in terms of the volumes and the capacity utilization there, we really think that raw material prices, scrap prices are going to flatten out here in the second quarter, flatten out over the next 30 to 60 days. And so that's kind of what we think. I will also say that the big jump here -- I think there was a little catch-up going on. Most steel mills in the country were running at pretty low capacity utilizations in the fourth quarter. They had left their inventory stripped down a little bit. So what we've seen here in the first quarter is response to improved steel mill demand orders but also a little catching up in rebuilding of inventories. So as that levels out here in the second quarter, we're going to see scrap prices returning to kind of flat levels."

And as we drift into the higher-quality products, particularly advanced high-strain steels, they are advanced high-strain. They're high strain. They're harder to run. They have to run at a slower rate, particularly when you look at what we've done in our Berkeley facility by going to the wider, lighter facility, that has an adverse impact on your overall capacity. So it really depends -- that's why I'm a little hesitant to give a specific number because it really depends on the mix that we're running at any given time, how wide is the product, how light is the product, what is the grade of the product, how hard is the product, what's the strain ratio of the product, all of those are factors. So what we typically do is we talk in terms of -- if you want a single number, we talk in terms of what we melt and cast, which is in the neighborhood of 12 billion to 13 billion tons in our steel mills. The actual product or the capacity of the product coming off of the roller mills, the roller lines, the hot mills, will be a function of what is the mix of the product that we're running on that mill at that given time."

First quarter results included a LIFO charge of $27.5 million or about $0.02 per share higher than projected in our gu",993,"Thanks, John.
First quarter 2016 earnings of $0.22 per diluted share was within our guidance range of $0.20 to $0.25 per diluted share. First quarter results included a LIFO charge of $27.5 million or about $0.02 per share higher than projected in our guidance. Excluding the impact of LIFO inventory accounting, the first quarter's performance represented an improvement over the fourth quarter of 2015's adjusted net earnings of $0.45 per diluted share, which included a LIFO credit of $0.41 per share.
Market conditions remain challenging during the first quarter, but are now improving. Reflecting the impact of the 2014 to 2015 import surge, average steel mill prices and metal margins declined in the first quarter from already-weak fourth quarter levels. However, imports had begun to subside, and steel mill pricing and metal margins improved notably by the end of the quarter. As the market bottomed, our team again capitalized on the opportunities provided by such core Nucor strengths as our highly flexible production capabilities and our unrivaled product diversity.
Here are 3 examples. First, Nucor's Sheet Mill Group took advantage of competitors' supply curtailments and lower imports to increase first quarter of 2016 shipments 25% over year-ago first quarter shipments and 32% over fourth quarter of 2015 shipments.
Second, Nucor's downstream steel products business achieved year-over-year growth in quarterly profitability as nonresidential construction activity continued on its path of gradual improvement. These profitable channels to market also significantly enhanced the performance of our steelmaking business.
Third, Nucor's structural steel group increased its first quarter shipments volume 15% over the prior year quarter and 11% over the fourth quarter of 2015. Our teams at Nucor-Yamato, Nucor Steel Berkeley and Skyline Steel together drove this growth. As the market leader in structural steel, Nucor derives great value from being the low-cost producer and offering North America's broadest product portfolio of beams and piling.
A quick comment about our first quarter 2016 tax rate as it can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. Excluding profits belonging to our business partners, the effective tax rate was 34.4% for the first quarter. Nucor's financial position remains strong. We are the only North American steel producer to hold an investment-grade credit rating. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 36% at the close of the first quarter.
Cash and short-term investments totaled more than $2.3 billion, a $300 million increase from the end of 2015. This compares with total debt outstanding of $4.4 billion. Our next significant debt maturities are $600 million in notes due in December 2017 and $500 million in notes due in June of 2018. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The maturity for our revolving credit facility was recently extended to April of 2021. For 2016, we estimate capital spending of approximately $500 million.
Depreciation and amortization for 2016 is expected to total about $700 million. Our capital spending budget for this year includes a number of attractive growth projects. You will note the objective of these projects is to expand our portfolio to higher value-added applications while maintaining our position as the market leader in more commodity products. Examples are: Nucor-Yamato's Quench and Self-Tempering project to become the sole North American producer of high-strength, low-alloy beams; adding a heat treat facility at our Memphis SBQ mill to expand our participation in energy, automotive, heavy equipment and service center markets; an upgraded finishing end at our Auburn, New York bar mill; expanding Skyline Steel's structural pipe piling production capability; installing [indiscernible] equipment at our Galton, Kentucky sheet mill; adding direct quenching capability to our Tuscaloosa, Alabama plate mill to expand its capabilities to include high-value, low-alloy grades of plate; and finally, expanding the port facility at our Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet and beam mill.
Nucor's capital allocation projects are clear, and they have been consistently and effectively practiced over 90 years. They guide our work as effective stewards of our shareholders' investment in our company. Our first priority is to invest for profitable, long-term growth through our multipronged strategy of optimizing the existing operations, acquisitions and greenfield expansions. We often characterize this work as building higher highs in Nucor's cyclical peak earnings power.
Our second priority is to provide our shareholders with cash dividends that are consistent with our success and delivering long-term earnings growth. 
Our third priority is to opportunistically repurchase our stock when our cash position is strong and our shares our attractively priced. Nucor's balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation is evidenced by a record of investing for long-term growth and rewarding shareholders with attractive cash returns.
Over the 10-year period ending in 2015, Nucor invested $12.4 billion in growth projects while also returning a total of $6.8 billion of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We are also pleased to note that with the dividend paid in February, Nucor has increased its base dividend for 43 consecutive years.
Earnings in the second quarter of 2016 are expected to improve significantly compared to the first quarter. Our steel mills segment will benefit from increased metal margins and volume, particularly at our sheet mills. The performance of our downstream steel products segment will benefit from typical seasonal factors as well as ongoing gradual improvement in nonresidential construction markets. As we measure by square footage, we expect full year 2016 nonresidential construction market activity to increase by approximately 5% over 2015.
For our raw materials segment, scrap recycling margins and volumes should improve. With the recent increases in market pricing for iron units, our DRI production facilities will continue to be important assets, helping us optimize raw material costs at our Steelmaking Operations. We are confident that Nucor's significant competitive advantages and highly adaptable business model will allow our team to continue to execute our proven strategies for delivering profitable, long-term growth and attractive returns to Nucor shareholders. We appreciate your interest in our company.

Nucor's strategy for profitable growth is simple, flexible and focused. Nucor capitalizes on its unrivaled position of strength to gain profitable market share in our core businesses of steel and steel products. We are doing this by taking care of our customers with our unrelenting focus on providing products and services that our competitors simply can't match. Delivering an unmatched value proposition to our customers and getting paid for that value is how we will earn attractive returns on the valuable capital our shareholders have entrusted to the Nucor team. Anchoring the strategy and its execution is Nucor's business model. Its strength and adaptability is powered by these building blocks that include: our culture, our robust balance sheet and cash flow generation through the cycle, our low and highly variable cost structure, our flexible and reliable production capabilities, our product diversity and vertical integration and our leadership positions in most of the markets we serve. Put together, these competitive strengths provide Nucor with a powerful platform for creating value for our customers. Our teammates have done and continue to do excellent work implementing our multipronged strategy for profitable growth. They are doing it by executing on what we call Nucor's 5 drivers to profitable growth. Through the industry downturn that began in 2009 and continued into 2016, Nucor has invested more than $6 billion in these 5 drivers that increase our capacity to create and deliver value to our customers.
Here are the 5 drivers to delivering value to our customers and profitable growth to our shareholders: one, strengthening our position as a low-cost producer; two, move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher-quality, higher-margin products; three, expand our downstream channels to market that increase our steel mills' baseload volume; this is especially important in weak markets; four, achieve the market leadership position in every product offering in our portfolio; five, achieve commercial excellence to complement our traditional operational strength. 
Our 5 drivers to profitable growth are producing results in challenging business conditions. Even better, Nucor is primed and ready for the inevitable steel industry up cycle. Since the last cyclical peak in 2008, we have added more cylinders to our engine for generating profits and cash flow. Nucor remains on the offensive and continues to grow stronger.
I will now update you on some first quarter of 2016 highlights and executing our growth strategy. Nucor-Yamato's new, wider sheet piling sections are being extremely well-received by our customers, with first quarter of 2016 volume well-ahead of our expectations. Our teams at Nucor-Yamato and at Skyline Steel are working together to aggressively go after this market, which is currently largely supplied by imports. We have now commercialized 2 of the 4 wider sheet piling product groups, and the other 2 groups will enter commercial production later this year. Our goal over the next several years is to grow our wider piling sections' annual volume to 100,000 tons, with these value-added products generating both incremental volume and margins. 
Our SBQ bar mill group continues to grow its product offerings while maintaining profitability in adverse market conditions. At our Memphis mill, installation of heat-treating equipment is nearing completion, and start-up is set for the current quarter. This will expand our capabilities to include Quench and Tempering as well as annealing of bars from 2.5 inches up to 11 inches in diameter. Also, our South Carolina bar mill is expanding its wire rod size range at its new rolling mill. This is allowing us to penetrate new markets, including tire bead and cold heading applications.
Our Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet mill achieved very solid first quarter profitability in extremely tough, flat-rolled market conditions. The Berkeley team is capitalizing on its recent upgrades to its caster and hot mill. Berkeley's new wide-light products continued to enjoy strong marketplace success, with 2016 shipments of these high-value added offerings targeted to be 240,000 tons.
Being a low-cost steelmaker able to compete globally definitely requires effective managing of the cost of our iron units. Nucor's raw material investments are providing significant value to us in the rising scrap pricing environment that has unfolded in 2016. No other steelmaker has the breadth and integration of our raw materials platform, scrap processing, domestic scrap brokerage, international scrap and pig iron brokerage and DRI production assets. Our raw materials and steel mill teammates have worked in complete alignment, allowing Nucor to take advantage of the lowest cost opportunities to meet our scrap and scrap substitute requirements.
For example, our David J. Joseph, or DJJ, scrap yards have successfully increased the flow of domestic scrap into the overall market and into our mills. Our DJJ domestic brokerage team has taken advantage of the lowest-cost opportunities in the domestic scrap market. Our DJJ international brokerage team has also purchased and supplied attractively priced scrap and pig iron from overseas. Equally important is the fact that our DRI plants in Trinidad and Louisiana have been performing consistently at high productivity and quality levels through 2016.
I will now close my thoughts on what remains the biggest issue facing Nucor and all steel producers: global steelmaking overcapacity resulting from trade-distorting practices of some governments. China is the prime example. But it's also important to understand that it is by no means the only country guilty of illegal trade practices. From outright government ownership to a vast array of illegal subsidies, many foreign steel companies are shielded from the realities of the market and the discipline of a level playing field that determines winners based on real economic advantage. In blatant violation of international trade rules, this glut of global steel production has led to the dumping of steel products into the U.S. market.
Nucor embraces free and fair competition. With our culture that thrives on continual improvement and technological innovation, we always win in such an environment. For that reason, our team will continue to be proactive and aggressive in pursuing effective and timely enforcement of our nation's trade laws. We owe nothing less than that to our customers, teammates and shareholders. 
Nucor is encouraged by growing recognition of this crisis and the initial work done by our government to address this crisis. Having said that, there's a tremendous amount of work still to be done. Several important upcoming developments have our attention over the next several months. Final determinations are expected this summer in the 3 pending flat-rolled trade cases. We have confidence that our government will examine all of the evidence and remedy the full measure of the illegal trade that is occurring.
Earlier this month, the Commerce Department reversed itself and found that Turkey is dumping rebar into the U.S. market. We are seeking expedited implementation of this remedy. Nucor and 2 other domestic plate producers recently filed petitions against illegally traded imports of cut-to-length plate from 12 countries. We look forward to our government's careful study of the evidence. Last year, the annual volume of imports from the 12 countries targeted by this case was double the amount imported in 2013.
Another important trade issue in 2016 is China's expected bid to gain recognition as a market economy under the terms of its agreement to join the World Trade Organization in 2001. Over the past 15 years, China has failed to implement the reforms necessary to become a market economy. China remains a government-run, nonmarket economy today. Therefore, the U.S. has no reason to change its treatment of China as a nonmarket economy.
Challenges clearly remain for the global steel industry. But for a company such as Nucor, one that is in a unique position of strength, these are also times of great opportunities. That is why at Nucor, we remain optimistic, determined and focused. 
I want to again thank my teammates for working with their typical high energy level and sense of urgency to seize these opportunities for profitable growth. Thank you for what you do to Nucor every day. And most importantly, thank you for doing it safely. I firmly believe Nucor's best years are still ahead of us.
Thank you all for your interest in Nucor. We would now be happy to take your questions."

First priority, as always, is the investment for long-term, sustainable, profitable growth, looking at optimizing our existing operations where we always get our biggest bang for our buck; acquisitions, where they make the most sense and where they're not overpriced; and if they, in fact, fit within our 5 tenets of profitable growth; and greenfield expansions, also a possibility. And, of course, in a world filled with overcapacity, I have to add to that and say, we would only do that in cases where we found very specific niche markets or niche geographical locations where we're not represented well. 
The second priority is to provide our shareholders with dividends consistent with our success and delivering long-term results. 
And third priority would be to opportunistically repurchase our shares when the price is good to do so. In the repurchasing program we mentioned earlier, we had a strike price that we thought was the right number, and we bought when we were under that strike price, and we stopped when it went over. Now clearly, when you look at where our stock is today, we would have probably been a little bit more aggressive in the buyback. It was impossible to know that at that time.

I'm not going to address any potential JVs or anything like that, but I will speak to our interest in automotive and our continuous -- continuing interest in moving up the value chain in automotive. 
Automotive has been great for us over the last 3 to 5 years. We continue to grow our presence there. Our products are being extremely well-received by the automotive producers, both the domestic and the new domestics, so -- frankly, here and in Mexico. So we will continue to take a more active role in automotive. We will continue to move up the value chain. We have some interest unexposed [ph] that is not a focal point for us. We think that where we have to, we can produce it; we will produce it. But it's not an area that we will put the majority of our efforts. We focus on body and weight, advanced high-strain steels that go into those products -- into those areas. Now when the right opportunities come along, many specialized galvanizing facilities will take a good hard look at them. And if we think that it continues to build upon our ability to grow in that market, we'll take them. I can tell you that, we are -- Nucor, as a whole, as well as our products are being well-received in the automotive market. Think about the fact that [indiscernible] in the past, and I apologize if I'm repeating myself, but it's important to think about. When steel is specified for a product that's coming out to a platform, you specify the steel for a platform that's not even going to be [indiscernible] into production for 2 or 3 years. You want to make sure that when you're ready to go into production, the steel that you specified for that one is still around. So the automotive companies are looking hard at -- making sure that they have reliable suppliers, sustainable suppliers, financially strong suppliers. You can just check the boxes on that when you consider Nucor. So our company and our products are being very well-received in the marketplace, and we anticipate continuing to grow in automotive. 
If you look at just what we've done in Q1, our automotive line was about -- up about 20% compared to where we were in 2005 -- '15, excuse me, 2015, and we anticipate it to continue to grow."

Obviously, you mentioned automotive being strong. We mentioned the ones that were challenged, but I would suggest that, one, that we see to continually improve, albeit at a very slow level is nonresidential construction. And clearly, a lot of steel products go into nonresidential construction. I also want to make a comment about your question on the oil side. It's clear that we really, particularly Nucor, took being heavy in the hot band, took a big hit when the oil market collapsed and the demand for steel into that market collapsed. That said, we really haven't seen any pickup in it. 
Now we recognize that until oil pricing goes back up into the $60, $70 range, you won't see the kind of drilling that took place in the past. If people say, well, maybe, they'll be at -- drilling at about 50% of the level where it is today for a long period of time. But even with drilling at the 50% level it's at today, we haven't seen the pickup in the steel demand go into the feed that 50% of the market like we have in the past. So we anticipate seeing that pickup some time maybe in the middle of this year towards the end of the year as the steel in the inventory chain begins to be used up. And that statement can also be held for when you look at our service center inventories. When you look at across the board and almost all of our steel products, service center inventory levels are down. Apparent demand at the service center level was up slightly, so we see that shipment's going up and inventory's coming down. That's good news. So those are some of the areas that I would share with you."

For China to go out and say, the only reason there's overcapacity in the world is because of the demand dropoff as a result of the economic turndown in -- it's a ridiculous statement.

But secondly, what is leading to sort of the near-term weak operating results there? And could you comment if operationally everything is now sort of on the mend there?"

Louisiana facility is going very well. The cost of that facility continue to come down. Frankly, the cost at our facility in Louisiana today rival those in Trinidad, which, as you know, are world-class. Quality continues to be excellent coming out of Louisiana. And it continues to be great coming out of Trinidad, also. 
In terms of whether or not the winds are changing, the answer to that is clearly yes. Not only you refer to the iron ore price increase, but take a look at what's happening to scrap. In the last 60 days, the price of scrap has gone up maybe $70, $80 a ton. And pig iron pricing over the last 2 months has gone up about $100 a ton. And when you look at those 2 factors and the impact that, that has on profitability of our -- specifically our DRI operations, definitely the wind is changing direction. And we anticipate much better results going forward. 
To your last point, I would make is remember that the economic impact of the -- of our raw material group, in general, particularly our DRI facilities, impacts our entire company, not just that one particular group. So when you look at the benefit that we see from that across the steel mills and our ability to optimize our scrap mix, there's a great economic impact across the company as well as it offsets some of the impact of our DRI facilities in the raw material group. When we look at DRI because of the way that the pricing goes with -- that we deliver to our mills, you'll see a smaller improvement in Q2, with the majority of the improvement coming in Q3. Because basically, there's a 60- to 90-day lag in the increase in pricing that we see at our mills because we transfer the DRI to our mills at the time and at the price, whether the pig iron is delivered to those operations. So there's about a 60- to 90-day lag in that. So you won't see this -- the changing winds have a major impact in Q2, but we will see some, but you'll see a major impact in Q3."

As you said, we have seen scrap demand increase over the last couple of months. And quite frankly, that is steel mill demand-driven, especially demand from our BAF mill customers like Nucor but others. And this demand increase has certainly pulled the price up, as John said, about $90 -- $70 over the last 60 to 90 days. But this, in turn, has increased the flow of unprocessed scrap into the yards. As you know very well, scrap is the elastic commodity. So this price increase is starting to improve volumes. 
So we've seen a significant volume improvement into our scrap yards. So with the supply side improving along with the global reach we have on pig iron, the great performance John just talked about, about our DRI plants in terms of the volumes and the capacity utilization there, we really think that raw material prices, scrap prices are going to flatten out here in the second quarter, flatten out over the next 30, 60 days. And so that's kind of what we think. I will also say that the big jump here -- I think there was a little catch-up going on. Most steel mills in the country were running at pretty low capacity utilizations in the fourth quarter. They had left their inventory strip down a little bit. So what we've seen here in the first quarter is response to improved steel mill demand orders but also a little catching up and rebuilding of inventories. So as that levels out here in the second quarter, we're going to see scrap prices returning to kind of flat levels."

And now when you look at the total amount that we can produce, it always gets a little bit flexible, Timna, because it really depends a lot on mix. You have to take a hard look at what we're running. And as we drift into the higher-quality products, particularly advanced high-strain steels, they are advanced high-strain. They're high strain. They're harder to run. They have to run at a slower rate. Particularly when you look at what we've done in our Berkeley facility by going to the wider, lighter facility, that has an adverse impact on your overall capacity. So it really depends -- that's why I'm a little hesitant to give a specific number because it really depends on the mix that we're running at any given time: how wide is the product; how light is the product; what is the grade of the product; how hard is the product; what's the strain ratio of the product? All of those are factors. 
So what we typically do is we talk in terms of -- if you want a single number, we talk in terms of what we melt and cast, which is in the neighborhood of 12 billion to 13 billion tons in our steel mills. The actual product or the capacity of the product coming off of the roller mills, the roller lines, the hot mills, will be a function of what is the mix of the product that we're running on that mill at that given time."

There's so many opportunities across the board to invest and to increase our -- to profitably grow our company. 
But you asked specifically about sheet. What would we be looking at in sheet? What we would look at is not more of the same. We'd look for opportunities, whether they are organic or through acquisitions to improve our position in some key markets to move up the value chain, to add maybe some further value-added capacity to our portfolio. But at the end of the day, wherever we end up investing it, what I can tell you is that we'll invest it very well and get the best return.

First quarter results included a LIFO charge of $27.5 million or about $0.02 per share higher than projected in our gu",993,"Thanks, John.
First quarter 2016 earnings of $0.22 per diluted share was within our guidance range of $0.20 to $0.25 per diluted share. First quarter results included a LIFO charge of $27.5 million or about $0.02 per share higher than projected in our guidance. Excluding the impact of LIFO inventory accounting, the first quarter's performance represented an improvement over the fourth quarter of 2015's adjusted net earnings of $0.45 per diluted share, which included a LIFO credit of $0.41 per share.
Market conditions remain challenging during the first quarter, but are now improving. Reflecting the impact of the 2014 to 2015 import surge, average steel mill prices and metal margins declined in the first quarter from already-weak fourth quarter levels. However, imports had begun to subside, and steel mill pricing and metal margins improved notably by the end of the quarter. As the market bottomed, our team again capitalized on the opportunities provided by such core Nucor strengths as our highly flexible production capabilities and our unrivaled product diversity.
Here are 3 examples. First, Nucor's Sheet Mill Group took advantage of competitors' supply curtailments and lower imports to increase first quarter of 2016 shipments 25% over year-ago first quarter shipments and 32% over fourth quarter of 2015 shipments.
Second, Nucor's downstream steel products business achieved year-over-year growth in quarterly profitability as nonresidential construction activity continued on its path of gradual improvement. These profitable channels to market also significantly enhanced the performance of our steelmaking business.
Third, Nucor's structural steel group increased its first quarter shipments volume 15% over the prior year quarter and 11% over the fourth quarter of 2015. Our teams at Nucor-Yamato, Nucor Steel Berkeley and Skyline Steel together drove this growth. As the market leader in structural steel, Nucor derives great value from being the low-cost producer and offering North America's broadest product portfolio of beams and piling.
A quick comment about our first quarter 2016 tax rate as it can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. Excluding profits belonging to our business partners, the effective tax rate was 34.4% for the first quarter. Nucor's financial position remains strong. We are the only North American steel producer to hold an investment-grade credit rating. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 36% at the close of the first quarter.
Cash and short-term investments totaled more than $2.3 billion, a $300 million increase from the end of 2015. This compares with total debt outstanding of $4.4 billion. Our next significant debt maturities are $600 million in notes due in December 2017 and $500 million in notes due in June of 2018. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The maturity for our revolving credit facility was recently extended to April of 2021. For 2016, we estimate capital spending of approximately $500 million.
Depreciation and amortization for 2016 is expected to total about $700 million. Our capital spending budget for this year includes a number of attractive growth projects. You will note the objective of these projects is to expand our portfolio to higher value-added applications while maintaining our position as the market leader in more commodity products. Examples are: Nucor-Yamato's Quench and Self-Tempering project to become the sole North American producer of high-strength, low-alloy beams; adding a heat treat facility at our Memphis SBQ mill to expand our participation in energy, automotive, heavy equipment and service center markets; an upgraded finishing end at our Auburn, New York bar mill; expanding Skyline Steel's structural pipe piling production capability; installing [indiscernible] equipment at our Galton, Kentucky sheet mill; adding direct quenching capability to our Tuscaloosa, Alabama plate mill to expand its capabilities to include high-value, low-alloy grades of plate; and finally, expanding the port facility at our Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet and beam mill.
Nucor's capital allocation projects are clear, and they have been consistently and effectively practiced over 90 years. They guide our work as effective stewards of our shareholders' investment in our company. Our first priority is to invest for profitable, long-term growth through our multipronged strategy of optimizing the existing operations, acquisitions and greenfield expansions. We often characterize this work as building higher highs in Nucor's cyclical peak earnings power.
Our second priority is to provide our shareholders with cash dividends that are consistent with our success and delivering long-term earnings growth. 
Our third priority is to opportunistically repurchase our stock when our cash position is strong and our shares our attractively priced. Nucor's balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation is evidenced by a record of investing for long-term growth and rewarding shareholders with attractive cash returns.
Over the 10-year period ending in 2015, Nucor invested $12.4 billion in growth projects while also returning a total of $6.8 billion of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We are also pleased to note that with the dividend paid in February, Nucor has increased its base dividend for 43 consecutive years.
Earnings in the second quarter of 2016 are expected to improve significantly compared to the first quarter. Our steel mills segment will benefit from increased metal margins and volume, particularly at our sheet mills. The performance of our downstream steel products segment will benefit from typical seasonal factors as well as ongoing gradual improvement in nonresidential construction markets. As we measure by square footage, we expect full year 2016 nonresidential construction market activity to increase by approximately 5% over 2015.
For our raw materials segment, scrap recycling margins and volumes should improve. With the recent increases in market pricing for iron units, our DRI production facilities will continue to be important assets, helping us optimize raw material costs at our Steelmaking Operations. We are confident that Nucor's significant competitive advantages and highly adaptable business model will allow our team to continue to execute our proven strategies for delivering profitable, long-term growth and attractive returns to Nucor shareholders. We appreciate your interest in our company.

Nucor's strategy for profitable growth is simple, flexible and focused. Nucor capitalizes on its unrivaled position of strength to gain profitable market share in our core businesses of steel and steel products. We are doing this by taking care of our customers with our unrelenting focus on providing products and services that our competitors simply can't match. Delivering an unmatched value proposition to our customers and getting paid for that value is how we will earn attractive returns on the valuable capital our shareholders have entrusted to the Nucor team. Anchoring the strategy and its execution is Nucor's business model. Its strength and adaptability is powered by these building blocks that include: our culture, our robust balance sheet and cash flow generation through the cycle, our low and highly variable cost structure, our flexible and reliable production capabilities, our product diversity and vertical integration and our leadership positions in most of the markets we serve. Put together, these competitive strengths provide Nucor with a powerful platform for creating value for our customers. Our teammates have done and continue to do excellent work implementing our multipronged strategy for profitable growth. They are doing it by executing on what we call Nucor's 5 drivers to profitable growth. Through the industry downturn that began in 2009 and continued into 2016, Nucor has invested more than $6 billion in these 5 drivers that increase our capacity to create and deliver value to our customers.
Here are the 5 drivers to delivering value to our customers and profitable growth to our shareholders: one, strengthening our position as a low-cost producer; two, move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher-quality, higher-margin products; three, expand our downstream channels to market that increase our steel mills' baseload volume; this is especially important in weak markets; four, achieve the market leadership position in every product offering in our portfolio; five, achieve commercial excellence to complement our traditional operational strength. 
Our 5 drivers to profitable growth are producing results in challenging business conditions. Even better, Nucor is primed and ready for the inevitable steel industry up cycle. Since the last cyclical peak in 2008, we have added more cylinders to our engine for generating profits and cash flow. Nucor remains on the offensive and continues to grow stronger.
I will now update you on some first quarter of 2016 highlights and executing our growth strategy. Nucor-Yamato's new, wider sheet piling sections are being extremely well-received by our customers, with first quarter of 2016 volume well-ahead of our expectations. Our teams at Nucor-Yamato and at Skyline Steel are working together to aggressively go after this market, which is currently largely supplied by imports. We have now commercialized 2 of the 4 wider sheet piling product groups, and the other 2 groups will enter commercial production later this year. Our goal over the next several years is to grow our wider piling sections' annual volume to 100,000 tons, with these value-added products generating both incremental volume and margins. 
Our SBQ bar mill group continues to grow its product offerings while maintaining profitability in adverse market conditions. At our Memphis mill, installation of heat-treating equipment is nearing completion, and start-up is set for the current quarter. This will expand our capabilities to include Quench and Tempering as well as annealing of bars from 2.5 inches up to 11 inches in diameter. Also, our South Carolina bar mill is expanding its wire rod size range at its new rolling mill. This is allowing us to penetrate new markets, including tire bead and cold heading applications.
Our Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet mill achieved very solid first quarter profitability in extremely tough, flat-rolled market conditions. The Berkeley team is capitalizing on its recent upgrades to its caster and hot mill. Berkeley's new wide-light products continued to enjoy strong marketplace success, with 2016 shipments of these high-value added offerings targeted to be 240,000 tons.
Being a low-cost steelmaker able to compete globally definitely requires effective managing of the cost of our iron units. Nucor's raw material investments are providing significant value to us in the rising scrap pricing environment that has unfolded in 2016. No other steelmaker has the breadth and integration of our raw materials platform, scrap processing, domestic scrap brokerage, international scrap and pig iron brokerage and DRI production assets. Our raw materials and steel mill teammates have worked in complete alignment, allowing Nucor to take advantage of the lowest cost opportunities to meet our scrap and scrap substitute requirements.
For example, our David J. Joseph, or DJJ, scrap yards have successfully increased the flow of domestic scrap into the overall market and into our mills. Our DJJ domestic brokerage team has taken advantage of the lowest-cost opportunities in the domestic scrap market. Our DJJ international brokerage team has also purchased and supplied attractively priced scrap and pig iron from overseas. Equally important is the fact that our DRI plants in Trinidad and Louisiana have been performing consistently at high productivity and quality levels through 2016.
I will now close my thoughts on what remains the biggest issue facing Nucor and all steel producers: global steelmaking overcapacity resulting from trade-distorting practices of some governments. China is the prime example. But it's also important to understand that it is by no means the only country guilty of illegal trade practices. From outright government ownership to a vast array of illegal subsidies, many foreign steel companies are shielded from the realities of the market and the discipline of a level playing field that determines winners based on real economic advantage. In blatant violation of international trade rules, this glut of global steel production has led to the dumping of steel products into the U.S. market.
Nucor embraces free and fair competition. With our culture that thrives on continual improvement and technological innovation, we always win in such an environment. For that reason, our team will continue to be proactive and aggressive in pursuing effective and timely enforcement of our nation's trade laws. We owe nothing less than that to our customers, teammates and shareholders. 
Nucor is encouraged by growing recognition of this crisis and the initial work done by our government to address this crisis. Having said that, there's a tremendous amount of work still to be done. Several important upcoming developments have our attention over the next several months. Final determinations are expected this summer in the 3 pending flat-rolled trade cases. We have confidence that our government will examine all of the evidence and remedy the full measure of the illegal trade that is occurring.
Earlier this month, the Commerce Department reversed itself and found that Turkey is dumping rebar into the U.S. market. We are seeking expedited implementation of this remedy. Nucor and 2 other domestic plate producers recently filed petitions against illegally traded imports of cut-to-length plate from 12 countries. We look forward to our government's careful study of the evidence. Last year, the annual volume of imports from the 12 countries targeted by this case was double the amount imported in 2013.
Another important trade issue in 2016 is China's expected bid to gain recognition as a market economy under the terms of its agreement to join the World Trade Organization in 2001. Over the past 15 years, China has failed to implement the reforms necessary to become a market economy. China remains a government-run, nonmarket economy today. Therefore, the U.S. has no reason to change its treatment of China as a nonmarket economy.
Challenges clearly remain for the global steel industry. But for a company such as Nucor, one that is in a unique position of strength, these are also times of great opportunities. That is why at Nucor, we remain optimistic, determined and focused. 
I want to again thank my teammates for working with their typical high energy level and sense of urgency to seize these opportunities for profitable growth. Thank you for what you do to Nucor every day. And most importantly, thank you for doing it safely. I firmly believe Nucor's best years are still ahead of us.
Thank you all for your interest in Nucor. We would now be happy to take your questions."

First priority, as always, is the investment for long-term, sustainable, profitable growth, looking at optimizing our existing operations where we always get our biggest bang for our buck; acquisitions, where they make the most sense and where they're not overpriced; and if they, in fact, fit within our 5 tenets of profitable growth; and greenfield expansions, also a possibility. And of course, in a world filled with overcapacity, I have to add to that and say, we would only do that in cases where we found very specific niche markets or niche geographical locations where we're not represented well. The second priority is to provide our shareholders with dividends consistent with our success and delivering long-term results. And third priority would be to opportunistically repurchase our shares when the price is good to do so. In the repurchasing program we mentioned earlier, we had a strike price that we thought was the right number, and we bought when we were under that strike price, and we stopped when it went over. Now clearly, when you look at where our stock is today, we would have probably been a little bit more aggressive in the buyback. It was impossible to know that at that time.

I'm not going to address any potential JVs or anything like that, but I will speak to our interest in automotive and our continuous -- continuing interest in moving up the value chain in automotive. Automotive has been great for us over the last 3 to 5 years. We continue to grow our presence there. Our products are being extremely well-received by the automotive producers, both the domestic and the new domestics, so -- frankly, here and in Mexico. So we will continue to take a more active role in automotive. We will continue to move up the value chain. We have some interest unexposed [ph] that is not a focal point for us. We think that where we have to, we can produce it; we will produce it. But it's not an area that we will put the majority of our efforts. We focus on body and weight, advanced high-strain steels that go into those products -- into those areas. Now when the right opportunities come along, many specialized galvanizing facilities will take a good hard look at them. And if we think that it continues to build upon our ability to grow in that market, we'll take them. I can tell you that, we are -- Nucor, as a whole as well as our products are being well-received in the automotive market. Think about the fact that [indiscernible] in the past, and I apologize if I'm repeating myself, but it's important to think about. When steel is specified for a product that's coming out to a platform, you specify the steel for a platform that's not even going to be [indiscernible] into production for 2 or 3 years. You want to make sure that when you're ready to go into production, the steel that you specified for that one is still around. So the automotive companies are looking hard at -- making sure that they have reliable suppliers, sustainable suppliers, financially strong suppliers. You can just check the boxes on that when you consider Nucor. So our company and our products are being very well-received in the marketplace, and we anticipate continuing to grow in automotive. If you look at just what we've done in Q1, our automotive line was about -- up about 20% compared to where we were in 2005 -- '15, excuse me, 2015, and we anticipate it to continue to grow."

Obviously, you mentioned automotive being strong. We mentioned the ones that were challenged, but I would suggest that, one, that we see to continually improve, albeit at a very slow level is nonresidential construction. And clearly, a lot of steel products go into nonresidential construction. I also want to make a comment about your question on the oil side. It's clear that we really, particularly Nucor, took being heavy in the hot band, took a big hit when the oil market collapsed and the demand for steel into that market collapsed. That said, we really haven't seen any pickup in it. Now we recognize that until oil pricing goes back up into the $60, $70 range, you won't see the kind of drilling that took place in the past. If people say, well, maybe, they'll be at -- drilling at about 50% of the level where it is today for a long period of time. But even with drilling at the 50% level it's at today, we haven't seen the pickup in the steel demand go into the feed that 50% of the market like we have in the past. So we anticipate seeing that pickup some time maybe in the middle of this year towards the end of the year as the steel in the inventory chain begins to be used up. And that statement can also be held for when you look at our service center inventories. When you look at across the board and almost all of our steel products, service center inventory levels are down. Apparent demand at the service center level was up slightly, so we see that shipment's going up and inventory's coming down. That's good news. So those are some of the areas that I would share with you."

I was just wondering if you could just talk to -- is the wind kind of turning in your favor now with what we're seeing globally with iron ore prices and the impact on DRI.

Louisiana facility is going very well. The cost of that facility continue to come down. Frankly, the cost at our facility in Louisiana today rival those in Trinidad, which, as you know, are world-class. Quality continues to be excellent coming out of Louisiana. And it continues to be great coming out of Trinidad, also. In terms of whether or not the winds are changing, the answer to that is clearly yes. Not only you refer to the iron ore price increase, but take a look at what's happening to scrap. In the last 60 days, the price of scrap has gone up maybe $70, $80 a ton. And pig iron pricing over the last 2 months has gone up about $100 a ton. And when you look at those 2 factors and the impact that, that has on profitability of our -- specifically our DRI operations, definitely the wind is changing direction. And we anticipate much better results going forward. To your last point, I would make is remember that the economic impact of the -- of our raw material group, in general, particularly our DRI facilities, impacts our entire company, not just that one particular group. So when you look at the benefit that we see from that across the steel mills and our ability to optimize our scrap mix, there's a great economic impact across the company as well as it offsets some of the impact of our DRI facilities in the raw material group. When we look at DRI because of the way that the pricing goes with -- that we deliver to our mills, you'll see a smaller improvement in Q2, with the majority of the improvement coming in Q3. Because basically, there's a 60- to 90-day lag in the increase in pricing that we see at our mills because we transfer the DRI to our mills at the time and at the price, whether the pig iron is delivered to those operations. So there's about a 60- to 90-day lag in that. So you won't see this -- the changing winds have a major impact in Q2, but we will see some, but you'll see a major impact in Q3."

As you said, we have seen scrap demand increase over the last couple of months. And quite frankly, that is steel mill demand-driven, especially demand from our BAF mill customers like Nucor but others. And this demand increase has certainly pulled the price up, as John said, about $90 -- $70 over the last 60 to 90 days. But this, in turn, has increased the flow of unprocessed scrap into the yards. As you know very well, scrap is the elastic commodity. So this price increase is starting to improve volumes. So we've seen a significant volume improvement into our scrap yards. So with the supply side improving along with the global reach we have on pig iron, the great performance John just talked about, about our DRI plants in terms of the volumes and the capacity utilization there, we really think that raw material prices, scrap prices are going to flatten out here in the second quarter, flatten out over the next 30, 60 days. And so that's kind of what we think. I will also say that the big jump here -- I think there was a little catch-up going on. Most steel mills in the country were running at pretty low capacity utilizations in the fourth quarter. They had left their inventory strip down a little bit. So what we've seen here in the first quarter is response to improved steel mill demand orders but also a little catching up and rebuilding of inventories. So as that levels out here in the second quarter, we're going to see scrap prices returning to kind of flat levels."

And now when you look at the total amount that we can produce, it always gets a little bit flexible, Timna, because it really depends a lot on mix. You have to take a hard look at what we're running. And as we drift into the higher-quality products, particularly advanced high-strain steels, they are advanced high-strain. They're high strain. They're harder to run. They have to run at a slower rate. Particularly when you look at what we've done in our Berkeley facility by going to the wider, lighter facility, that has an adverse impact on your overall capacity. So it really depends -- that's why I'm a little hesitant to give a specific number because it really depends on the mix that we're running at any given time: how wide is the product; how light is the product; what is the grade of the product; how hard is the product; what's the strain ratio of the product? All of those are factors. So what we typically do is we talk in terms of -- if you want a single number, we talk in terms of what we melt and cast, which is in the neighborhood of 12 billion to 13 billion tons in our steel mills. The actual product or the capacity of the product coming off of the roller mills, the roller lines, the hot mills, will be a function of what is the mix of the product that we're running on that mill at that given time."

First quarter results included a LIFO charge of $27.5 million or about $0.02 per share higher than projected in our gu",993,"Thanks, John.
First quarter 2016 earnings of $0.22 per diluted share was within our guidance range of $0.20 to $0.25 per diluted share. First quarter results included a LIFO charge of $27.5 million or about $0.02 per share higher than projected in our guidance. Excluding the impact of LIFO inventory accounting, the first quarter's performance represented an improvement over the fourth quarter of 2015's adjusted net earnings of $0.45 per diluted share, which included a LIFO credit of $0.41 per share.
Market conditions remain challenging during the first quarter, but are now improving. Reflecting the impact of the 2014 to 2015 import surge, average steel mill prices and metal margins declined in the first quarter from already-weak fourth quarter levels. However, imports had begun to subside, and steel mill pricing and metal margins improved notably by the end of the quarter. As the market bottomed, our team again capitalized on the opportunities provided by such core Nucor strengths as our highly flexible production capabilities and our unrivaled product diversity.
Here are 3 examples. First, Nucor's Sheet Mill Group took advantage of competitors' supply curtailments and lower imports to increase first quarter of 2016 shipments 25% over year-ago first quarter shipments and 32% over fourth quarter of 2015 shipments.
Second, Nucor's downstream steel products business achieved year-over-year growth in quarterly profitability as nonresidential construction activity continued on its path of gradual improvement. These profitable channels to market also significantly enhanced the performance of our steelmaking business.
Third, Nucor's structural steel group increased its first quarter shipments volume 15% over the prior year quarter and 11% over the fourth quarter of 2015. Our teams at Nucor-Yamato, Nucor Steel Berkeley and Skyline Steel together drove this growth. As the market leader in structural steel, Nucor derives great value from being the low-cost producer and offering North America's broadest product portfolio of beams and piling.
A quick comment about our first quarter 2016 tax rate as it can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. Excluding profits belonging to our business partners, the effective tax rate was 34.4% for the first quarter. Nucor's financial position remains strong. We are the only North American steel producer to hold an investment-grade credit rating. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 36% at the close of the first quarter.
Cash and short-term investments totaled more than $2.3 billion, a $300 million increase from the end of 2015. This compares with total debt outstanding of $4.4 billion. Our next significant debt maturities are $600 million in notes due in December 2017 and $500 million in notes due in June of 2018. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The maturity for our revolving credit facility was recently extended to April of 2021. For 2016, we estimate capital spending of approximately $500 million.
Depreciation and amortization for 2016 is expected to total about $700 million. Our capital spending budget for this year includes a number of attractive growth projects. You will note the objective of these projects is to expand our portfolio to higher value-added applications while maintaining our position as the market leader in more commodity products. Examples are: Nucor-Yamato's Quench and Self-Tempering project to become the sole North American producer of high-strength, low-alloy beams; adding a heat treat facility at our Memphis SBQ mill to expand our participation in energy, automotive, heavy equipment and service center markets; an upgraded finishing end at our Auburn, New York bar mill; expanding Skyline Steel's structural pipe piling production capability; installing [indiscernible] equipment at our Galton, Kentucky sheet mill; adding direct quenching capability to our Tuscaloosa, Alabama plate mill to expand its capabilities to include high-value, low-alloy grades of plate; and finally, expanding the port facility at our Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet and beam mill.
Nucor's capital allocation projects are clear, and they have been consistently and effectively practiced over 90 years. They guide our work as effective stewards of our shareholders' investment in our company. Our first priority is to invest for profitable, long-term growth through our multipronged strategy of optimizing the existing operations, acquisitions and greenfield expansions. We often characterize this work as building higher highs in Nucor's cyclical peak earnings power.
Our second priority is to provide our shareholders with cash dividends that are consistent with our success and delivering long-term earnings growth. 
Our third priority is to opportunistically repurchase our stock when our cash position is strong and our shares our attractively priced. Nucor's balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation is evidenced by a record of investing for long-term growth and rewarding shareholders with attractive cash returns.
Over the 10-year period ending in 2015, Nucor invested $12.4 billion in growth projects while also returning a total of $6.8 billion of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We are also pleased to note that with the dividend paid in February, Nucor has increased its base dividend for 43 consecutive years.
Earnings in the second quarter of 2016 are expected to improve significantly compared to the first quarter. Our steel mills segment will benefit from increased metal margins and volume, particularly at our sheet mills. The performance of our downstream steel products segment will benefit from typical seasonal factors as well as ongoing gradual improvement in nonresidential construction markets. As we measure by square footage, we expect full year 2016 nonresidential construction market activity to increase by approximately 5% over 2015.
For our raw materials segment, scrap recycling margins and volumes should improve. With the recent increases in market pricing for iron units, our DRI production facilities will continue to be important assets, helping us optimize raw material costs at our Steelmaking Operations. We are confident that Nucor's significant competitive advantages and highly adaptable business model will allow our team to continue to execute our proven strategies for delivering profitable, long-term growth and attractive returns to Nucor shareholders. We appreciate your interest in our company.

Nucor's strategy for profitable growth is simple, flexible and focused. Nucor capitalizes on its unrivaled position of strength to gain profitable market share in our core businesses of steel and steel products. We are doing this by taking care of our customers with our unrelenting focus on providing products and services that our competitors simply can't match. Delivering an unmatched value proposition to our customers and getting paid for that value is how we will earn attractive returns on the valuable capital our shareholders have entrusted to the Nucor team. Anchoring the strategy and its execution is Nucor's business model. Its strength and adaptability is powered by these building blocks that include: our culture, our robust balance sheet and cash flow generation through the cycle, our low and highly variable cost structure, our flexible and reliable production capabilities, our product diversity and vertical integration and our leadership positions in most of the markets we serve. Put together, these competitive strengths provide Nucor with a powerful platform for creating value for our customers. Our teammates have done and continue to do excellent work implementing our multipronged strategy for profitable growth. They are doing it by executing on what we call Nucor's 5 drivers to profitable growth. Through the industry downturn that began in 2009 and continued into 2016, Nucor has invested more than $6 billion in these 5 drivers that increase our capacity to create and deliver value to our customers.
Here are the 5 drivers to delivering value to our customers and profitable growth to our shareholders: one, strengthening our position as a low-cost producer; two, move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher-quality, higher-margin products; three, expand our downstream channels to market that increase our steel mills' baseload volume; this is especially important in weak markets; four, achieve the market leadership position in every product offering in our portfolio; five, achieve commercial excellence to complement our traditional operational strength. 
Our 5 drivers to profitable growth are producing results in challenging business conditions. Even better, Nucor is primed and ready for the inevitable steel industry up cycle. Since the last cyclical peak in 2008, we have added more cylinders to our engine for generating profits and cash flow. Nucor remains on the offensive and continues to grow stronger.
I will now update you on some first quarter of 2016 highlights and executing our growth strategy. Nucor-Yamato's new, wider sheet piling sections are being extremely well-received by our customers, with first quarter of 2016 volume well-ahead of our expectations. Our teams at Nucor-Yamato and at Skyline Steel are working together to aggressively go after this market, which is currently largely supplied by imports. We have now commercialized 2 of the 4 wider sheet piling product groups, and the other 2 groups will enter commercial production later this year. Our goal over the next several years is to grow our wider piling sections' annual volume to 100,000 tons, with these value-added products generating both incremental volume and margins. 
Our SBQ bar mill group continues to grow its product offerings while maintaining profitability in adverse market conditions. At our Memphis mill, installation of heat-treating equipment is nearing completion, and start-up is set for the current quarter. This will expand our capabilities to include Quench and Tempering as well as annealing of bars from 2.5 inches up to 11 inches in diameter. Also, our South Carolina bar mill is expanding its wire rod size range at its new rolling mill. This is allowing us to penetrate new markets, including tire bead and cold heading applications.
Our Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet mill achieved very solid first quarter profitability in extremely tough, flat-rolled market conditions. The Berkeley team is capitalizing on its recent upgrades to its caster and hot mill. Berkeley's new wide-light products continued to enjoy strong marketplace success, with 2016 shipments of these high-value added offerings targeted to be 240,000 tons.
Being a low-cost steelmaker able to compete globally definitely requires effective managing of the cost of our iron units. Nucor's raw material investments are providing significant value to us in the rising scrap pricing environment that has unfolded in 2016. No other steelmaker has the breadth and integration of our raw materials platform, scrap processing, domestic scrap brokerage, international scrap and pig iron brokerage and DRI production assets. Our raw materials and steel mill teammates have worked in complete alignment, allowing Nucor to take advantage of the lowest cost opportunities to meet our scrap and scrap substitute requirements.
For example, our David J. Joseph, or DJJ, scrap yards have successfully increased the flow of domestic scrap into the overall market and into our mills. Our DJJ domestic brokerage team has taken advantage of the lowest-cost opportunities in the domestic scrap market. Our DJJ international brokerage team has also purchased and supplied attractively priced scrap and pig iron from overseas. Equally important is the fact that our DRI plants in Trinidad and Louisiana have been performing consistently at high productivity and quality levels through 2016.
I will now close my thoughts on what remains the biggest issue facing Nucor and all steel producers: global steelmaking overcapacity resulting from trade-distorting practices of some governments. China is the prime example. But it's also important to understand that it is by no means the only country guilty of illegal trade practices. From outright government ownership to a vast array of illegal subsidies, many foreign steel companies are shielded from the realities of the market and the discipline of a level playing field that determines winners based on real economic advantage. In blatant violation of international trade rules, this glut of global steel production has led to the dumping of steel products into the U.S. market.
Nucor embraces free and fair competition. With our culture that thrives on continual improvement and technological innovation, we always win in such an environment. For that reason, our team will continue to be proactive and aggressive in pursuing effective and timely enforcement of our nation's trade laws. We owe nothing less than that to our customers, teammates and shareholders. 
Nucor is encouraged by growing recognition of this crisis and the initial work done by our government to address this crisis. Having said that, there's a tremendous amount of work still to be done. Several important upcoming developments have our attention over the next several months. Final determinations are expected this summer in the 3 pending flat-rolled trade cases. We have confidence that our government will examine all of the evidence and remedy the full measure of the illegal trade that is occurring.
Earlier this month, the Commerce Department reversed itself and found that Turkey is dumping rebar into the U.S. market. We are seeking expedited implementation of this remedy. Nucor and 2 other domestic plate producers recently filed petitions against illegally traded imports of cut-to-length plate from 12 countries. We look forward to our government's careful study of the evidence. Last year, the annual volume of imports from the 12 countries targeted by this case was double the amount imported in 2013.
Another important trade issue in 2016 is China's expected bid to gain recognition as a market economy under the terms of its agreement to join the World Trade Organization in 2001. Over the past 15 years, China has failed to implement the reforms necessary to become a market economy. China remains a government-run, nonmarket economy today. Therefore, the U.S. has no reason to change its treatment of China as a nonmarket economy.
Challenges clearly remain for the global steel industry. But for a company such as Nucor, one that is in a unique position of strength, these are also times of great opportunities. That is why at Nucor, we remain optimistic, determined and focused. 
I want to again thank my teammates for working with their typical high energy level and sense of urgency to seize these opportunities for profitable growth. Thank you for what you do to Nucor every day. And most importantly, thank you for doing it safely. I firmly believe Nucor's best years are still ahead of us.
Thank you all for your interest in Nucor. We would now be happy to take your questions."

First priority, as always, is the investment for long-term, sustainable, profitable growth, looking at optimizing our existing operations where we always get our biggest bang for our buck; acquisitions, where they make the most sense and where they're not overpriced; and if they, in fact, fit within our 5 tenets of profitable growth; and greenfield expansions, also a possibility. And of course, in a world filled with overcapacity, I have to add to that and say, we would only do that in cases where we found very specific niche markets or niche geographical locations where we're not represented well. The second priority is to provide our shareholders with dividends consistent with our success and delivering long-term results. And third priority would be to opportunistically repurchase our shares when the price is good to do so. In the repurchasing program we mentioned earlier, we had a strike price that we thought was the right number, and we bought when we were under that strike price, and we stopped when it went over.

I'm not going to address any potential JVs or anything like that, but I will speak to our interest in automotive and our continuous -- continuing interest in moving up the value chain in automotive. Automotive has been great for us over the last 3 to 5 years. We continue to grow our presence there. Our products are being extremely well-received by the automotive producers, both the domestic and the new domestics, so -- frankly, here and in Mexico. So we will continue to take a more active role in automotive. We will continue to move up the value chain. We have some interest unexposed [ph] that is not a focal point for us. We think that where we have to, we can produce it; we will produce it. But it's not an area that we will put the majority of our efforts. We focus on body and weight, advanced high-strain steels that go into those products -- into those areas. Now when the right opportunities come along, many specialized galvanizing facilities will take a good hard look at them. And if we think that it continues to build upon our ability to grow in that market, we'll take them. I can tell you that, we are -- Nucor, as a whole as well as our products are being well-received in the automotive market. Think about the fact that [indiscernible] in the past, and I apologize if I'm repeating myself, but it's important to think about. When steel is specified for a product that's coming out to a platform, you specify the steel for a platform that's not even going to be [indiscernible] into production for 2 or 3 years. You want to make sure that when you're ready to go into production, the steel that you specified for that one is still around. So the automotive companies are looking hard at -- making sure that they have reliable suppliers, sustainable suppliers, financially strong suppliers. You can just check the boxes on that when you consider Nucor. So our company and our products are being very well-received in the marketplace, and we anticipate continuing to grow in automotive. If you look at just what we've done in Q1, our automotive line was about -- up about 20% compared to where we were in 2005 -- '15, excuse me, 2015, and we anticipate it to continue to grow."

Obviously, you mentioned automotive being strong. We mentioned the ones that were challenged, but I would suggest that, one, that we see to continually improve, albeit at a very slow level is nonresidential construction. And clearly, a lot of steel products go into nonresidential construction. I also want to make a comment about your question on the oil side. It's clear that we really, particularly Nucor, took being heavy in the hot band, took a big hit when the oil market collapsed and the demand for steel into that market collapsed. That said, we really haven't seen any pickup in it. Now we recognize that until oil pricing goes back up into the $60, $70 range, you won't see the kind of drilling that took place in the past. If people say, well, maybe, they'll be at -- drilling at about 50% of the level where it is today for a long period of time. But even with drilling at the 50% level it's at today, we haven't seen the pickup in the steel demand go into the feed that 50% of the market like we have in the past. So we anticipate seeing that pickup some time maybe in the middle of this year towards the end of the year as the steel in the inventory chain begins to be used up. And that statement can also be held for when you look at our service center inventories. When you look at across the board and almost all of our steel products, service center inventory levels are down. Apparent demand at the service center level was up slightly, so we see that shipment's going up and inventory's coming down. That's good news. So those are some of the areas that I would share with you."

We again saw some negative results coming out of your DRI facilities. I was just wondering if you could just talk to -- is the wind kind of turning in your favor now with what we're seeing globally with iron ore prices and the impact on DRI. But secondly, what is leading to sort of the near-term weak operating results there? And could you comment if operationally everything is now sort of on the mend there?"

Louisiana facility is going very well. The cost of that facility continue to come down. Frankly, the cost at our facility in Louisiana today rival those in Trinidad, which, as you know, are world-class. Quality continues to be excellent coming out of Louisiana. And it continues to be great coming out of Trinidad, also. In terms of whether or not the winds are changing, the answer to that is clearly yes. Not only you refer to the iron ore price increase, but take a look at what's happening to scrap. In the last 60 days, the price of scrap has gone up maybe $70, $80 a ton. And pig iron pricing over the last 2 months has gone up about $100 a ton. And when you look at those 2 factors and the impact that, that has on profitability of our -- specifically our DRI operations, definitely the wind is changing direction. And we anticipate much better results going forward. To your last point, I would make is remember that the economic impact of the -- of our raw material group, in general, particularly our DRI facilities, impacts our entire company, not just that one particular group. So when you look at the benefit that we see from that across the steel mills and our ability to optimize our scrap mix, there's a great economic impact across the company as well as it offsets some of the impact of our DRI facilities in the raw material group. When we look at DRI because of the way that the pricing goes with -- that we deliver to our mills, you'll see a smaller improvement in Q2, with the majority of the improvement coming in Q3. Because basically, there's a 60- to 90-day lag in the increase in pricing that we see at our mills because we transfer the DRI to our mills at the time and at the price, whether the pig iron is delivered to those operations. So there's about a 60- to 90-day lag in that. So you won't see this -- the changing winds have a major impact in Q2, but we will see some, but you'll see a major impact in Q3."

As you said, we have seen scrap demand increase over the last couple of months. And quite frankly, that is steel mill demand-driven, especially demand from our BAF mill customers like Nucor but others. And this demand increase has certainly pulled the price up, as John said, about $90 -- $70 over the last 60 to 90 days. But this, in turn, has increased the flow of unprocessed scrap into the yards. As you know very well, scrap is the elastic commodity. So this price increase is starting to improve volumes. So we've seen a significant volume improvement into our scrap yards. So with the supply side improving along with the global reach we have on pig iron, the great performance John just talked about, about our DRI plants in terms of the volumes and the capacity utilization there, we really think that raw material prices, scrap prices are going to flatten out here in the second quarter, flatten out over the next 30, 60 days. And so that's kind of what we think. I will also say that the big jump here -- I think there was a little catch-up going on. Most steel mills in the country were running at pretty low capacity utilizations in the fourth quarter. They had left their inventory strip down a little bit. So what we've seen here in the first quarter is response to improved steel mill demand orders but also a little catching up and rebuilding of inventories. So as that levels out here in the second quarter, we're going to see scrap prices returning to kind of flat levels."

And now when you look at the total amount that we can produce, it always gets a little bit flexible, Timna, because it really depends a lot on mix. You have to take a hard look at what we're running. And as we drift into the higher-quality products, particularly advanced high-strain steels, they are advanced high-strain. They're high strain. They're harder to run. They have to run at a slower rate. Particularly when you look at what we've done in our Berkeley facility by going to the wider, lighter facility, that has an adverse impact on your overall capacity. So it really depends -- that's why I'm a little hesitant to give a specific number because it really depends on the mix that we're running at any given time: how wide is the product; how light is the product; what is the grade of the product; how hard is the product; what's the strain ratio of the product? All of those are factors. So what we typically do is we talk in terms of -- if you want a single number, we talk in terms of what we melt and cast, which is in the neighborhood of 12 million to 13 million tons in our steel mills. The actual product or the capacity of the product coming off of the roller mills, the roller lines, the hot mills, will be a function of what is the mix of the product that we're running on that mill at that given time."

But at the end of the day, wherever we end up investing it, what I can tell you is that we'll invest it very well and get the best return.

Second quarter of 2016 earnings of $0.73 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.70 per diluted share.

Second quarter of 2016 earnings of $0.73 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.70 per diluted share. This performance represents significant improvement over first quarter 2016 earnings of $0.22 per diluted share and year-ago segment quarter earnings of $0.39 per diluted share. 
Second quarter results included a LIFO charge of $19 million, which was in line with our guidance. This compared with the first quarter of 2016 charge of $28 million and a year-ago second quarter credit of $96 million. Our steel mills segment was a primary driver of our second quarter profit improvement with the largest gains at our sheet mills. Quarter-over-quarter profit growth was also achieved at our plate and bar mill. Nucor's Steelmaking Operations benefited from both volume growth and higher metal margins. Second quarter total steel mill shipments increased 5% over the first quarter of 2016. Our overall steel mill metal margin expanded by $16 per ton in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Our downstream products segment also delivered strong earnings growth in second quarter from the first quarter and 2015 second quarter levels. Nucor's steel products business benefits from our market leadership positions and our diversified product portfolio. The strength at Nucor's downstream products business model allows us to profitably leverage our modest improvement in nonresidential construction markets. 
Performance at our raw materials segment also improved in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. The David J. Joseph Company scrap brokerage and scrap processing business were solidly profitable in the second quarter. The improvements at DJJ's recycling business were threefold. First, scrap pricing improved. Second, utilization and volume flows increased to support our steel mills increased production. Third, our scrap processing team has done excellent work achieving efficiency improvements and cost reductions throughout their operations. 
Our direct reduced iron, or DRI, facilities achieved significant quarter-over-quarter improvement in their financial performance. At the same time, our raw materials teams continue to enhance Nucor's overall profitability by working with our steel mills to optimize the cost of their iron units. Maintaining Nucor's position as the low-cost producer across our raw materials, steelmaking and steel products businesses is an unrelenting focus for all of our teams. 
Our tax rate can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. Excluding profits belonging to our business partners, the effective tax rate was approximately 32.5% for the second quarter of 2016. 
Nucor's financial position remains strong. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 35% at the close of the second quarter. Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $2.3 billion, which compares with total debt outstanding of $4.4 billion. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until 2021. 
Nucor is the only North-American-headquartered steel producer to hold an investment-grade credit rating. Our capital allocation priorities are clear. They have been consistently and effectively practiced over Nucor's entire history. Our first priority is to invest for profitable, long-term growth that delivers attractive returns on our invested capital. Our second priority is to provide our shareholders with cash dividends that are consistent with our success in growing Nucor's earnings. Our third priority is to opportunistically repurchase our stock when our cash position is strong and attractively priced growth opportunities are limited. 
We expect further strong improvement in earnings in the third quarter of 2016. The steel mills segment will benefit from contract pricing resets in the third quarter at our sheet mills. Contracts currently represent about 60% of Nucor's sheet mill volume. The steel products segment continues to experience positive earnings momentum. Particularly strong profit growth is being realized at the rebar fabrication and metal buildings businesses. All of our steel products teams are doing excellent work in managing the challenge of this year's rising steel price environment. The raw materials segment's performance is expected to achieve profitability in the third quarter of 2016. Our DRI facilities will be profitable, benefiting from improved product pricing, lower iron ore costs and continued gains and and yield performance. Our Trinidad and Louisiana plants are now consistently performing at what we believe to be world-class conversion cost levels. Our David J. Joseph Company scrap position should also benefit from the more favorable scrap pricing environment that has been in place since the spring of this year. We are confident that Nucor's significant competitive advantages and highly adaptable business model will allow our team to continue to execute our proven strategies for delivering profitable long-term growth and attractive returns to Nucor's shareholders. 
We appreciate your interest in our company. John?"

Nucor's strategy for profitable growth is simple, flexible and focused. It is one that we've implemented for more than 5 decades. Nucor capitalizes on its unrivaled position of strength to gain profitable market share in our core businesses of steel and steel products. We are doing this by taking care of our customers. Delivering an unrivaled value proposition for our customers is how we earn attractive returns on our shareholders' valuable capital. Anchoring our strategy are Nucor's 5 drivers to profitable growth. They are: strengthen our position as a low-cost producer; achieve market leadership positions in every product line in our portfolio; continue to move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher-quality, higher-margin, more import-resistant products; expand and leverage our downstream channels to the market to increase our steel mills' baseload volume, especially in weak markets; and achieve commercial excellence to complement our traditional operational strength. Our strategy for profitable growth is working. It is paying off today with the potential for much larger returns in the future. 
I will now update you on highlights of our recent progress. Nucor's steel mill volume growth in 2016 highlights our success in gaining profitable market share. For the first 6 months of 2016, our steel mill production increased 13% over the year-ago period. That compared with the U.S. steel industry's decrease of approximately 1% over the same period. This profitable growth did not just happen. It is the result of our highly flexible and low-cost production capabilities, our unrivaled product breadth and diversity, our investments that have allowed us to move up the value chain, our execution of our channel-to-market strategy, and most importantly, the hard work done by my more than 23,000 Nucor teammates. 
The best news is that we are far from finished executing our strategy. There's a lot more to come. We are adding cylinders to Nucor's engine for generating higher highs and higher lows in earnings and cash flow. As always, our objective is delivering attractive returns on our shareholders' valuable capital. 
Demand is growing for our Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet mills new, wide-light products. After shipping approximately 160,000 tons of wide-light products in 2015, Berkeley is on track to ship about 270,000 tons in 2016. That's up from their earlier target of 240,000 tons for this year. This wide-light product capability is allowing us to produce more grades of advanced high-strength steels for the automotive market. We are also using wide-light products to gain share in a number of other targeted markets, ranging from appliance to motor lamination to welding wire. 
Our Nucor-Yamato joint venture is continuing to expand its value-added structural steel product portfolio. Last year, Nucor-Yamato began shipping its wider sheet piling sections. These wider sections are lighter and stronger, covering more area at a lower installed cost. Prior to our entry, this market had been largely served by imports. Nucor-Yamato is marketing these sections through our piling distribution business, Skyline Steel. Nucor-Yamato's NZ sheet piling sections are already enjoying strong marketplace success. During the first half of 2016, shipments on the new wide sheet piles have more than tripled to over 19,000 tons. 2 of the 4 wider sheet piling product groups have now been commercialized. The 2 other groups will enter production by the end of this year. Nucor-Yamato's goal over the next several years is to grow our wider sheet piling annual volume to 100,000 tons. Nucor-Yamato is nearing completion of another growth initiative, expanding its value-added structural steel product offerings. A $75 million project, adding Quench and Self-Tempering Technology, will position Nucor-Yamato, as the sole North American producer of high-strength, low-alloy beams. Initial trial production is scheduled to start in September. Trials across the entire range of high-strength, low-alloy beams are expected to be completed by the end of next year's first quarter. These beams allow the use of lighter foot weights, which reduces the weight and cost for the builder. That enhances the competitiveness of steel versus concrete and wood. Nucor-Yamato's target over the next several years is to grow its high-strength, low-alloy beam annual volume to 50,000 tons. 
During the second quarter, our Memphis SBQ bar mill completed installation of its heat-treating equipment and began running trials on new value-added products. This expands our capabilities to include Quench and Tempering as well as annealing of bars from 2.5 inches to 12 inches in diameter. I would like to thank our SBQ bar mill and downstream cold-finished bar teams for their excellent work, maintaining profitability in adverse market conditions, while also building for future growth with their numerous initiatives moving us up the value chain. 
During the second quarter, our Vulcraft/Verco joist and decking business announced plans to expand its geographical reach into Canada. Vulcraft Canada, our first Vulcraft facility in Canada, will be located near Hamilton, Ontario. It will manufacturing steel joists, joist girders and decking. We expect to start producing deck by the end of this year with joist production starting in the first quarter of next year. 
Effective implementation of Nucor's vertical integration and channel-to-market strategy is a key competitive strength and an attractive growth platform for our company. In June, Nucor formed a 50-50 joint venture with JFE Steel of Japan to build and operate a facility to produce galvanized sheet steel for the growing Mexican automotive market. The plant will be strategically located in Central Mexico. It's expected to have a cost of about $270 million. Operations are expected to begin in the second half of 2019. Annual capacity will be approximately 400,000 tons of galvanized sheet steel. It's important to note that Nucor and JFE will each supply an equal amount of substrate to be processed at the facility. We are excited to begin what we expect to be a long-term partnership with JFE Steel, a premier supplier of high-quality automotive steels. 
Yesterday, we announced an agreement to acquire Joy Global's steel plate mill in Longview, Texas, for approximately $29 million. Annual capacity of that facility is about 180,000 tons. The mill produces specialty plate products ranging from 1 to 12 inches thick and up to 138 inches wide. Complementing our existing plate mills' product capability, reaching up to 3 inches thick and 120 inches wide, the Texas mill will enable Nucor to capture a growing share of niche value-added plate markets. We are confident our plate commercial team will be able to leverage this expanded product portfolio to grow our overall plate business. All of these investment projects have the same very simple objective: creating attractive long-term value for our customers, our teammates and our shareholders. 
That discipline drives every capital allocation decision we make at Nucor. Our disciplined approach to being effective stewards of our shareholders' capital also requires that our team tackles significant challenges to our business. To that end, Nucor continues to be proactive and aggressive in pursuing trade cases when and where it is appropriate. When foreign producers and governments break mutually agreed-upon laws governing trade, there must be meaningful consequences. Utilizing trade remedies is not protectionism. Trade enforcement is absolutely critical to drive the change towards a market-based system. A market-based system is one where efficiency and innovation determine which producers win and which producers lose. We are encouraged by recent actions taken by the U.S. government that paved the way for the imposition of much-needed antidumping and countervailing revenues in some products against some countries breaking U.S. and international trade laws. But there remains much more work to be done. As always, Nucor is up to the challenge and will continue fighting hard for free and fair trade. 
I would like to close my remarks by expressing my thanks to our teams at our DRI plants in Trinidad and Louisiana for what they have achieved for Nucor. Your facilities today produce the highest-quality and lowest-cost DRI in the world. Your hard work and perseverance are absolutely critical to our company's success in continuing to move up the value chain. Thank you, and please keep it going. 
We would now be happy to answer your questions."

When our customers are telling us that when they look at the final landed price of the import offers, the difference is great enough to justify the risk. The other point that I would make is when you look at where we are in this -- where we are this year, customers buying imports today, placing the orders today, can't really expect the deliveries until sometime in mid -- somewhere -- it's either early fourth quarter or mid fourth quarter. And at that point, they've got to think about their year-end inventories. So I think there's a bit of a hesitation to do too much on ordering on the import side as a result of their concerns over their year-end inventories. And I also point out a little bit about -- there's some availability issues and the [indiscernible] that is available out there today, a lot of the results of the trade cases -- the successful prosecution of the trade cases, particularly in sheet and some other products. And also concern that our customers have over the other trade cases that are currently in process.

The increased demand from steel mills across the country raised prices. And with the price increases, flow followed into the scrap yards, which is the normal trend. At this point, with the currency exchange, the strength of the U.S. dollar, the weakness in Europe, in other words, there's a lot of scrap available in Europe, and the Chinese billets moving around the world, the trade flows there, I don't see a lot of upside pressure on scrap.

And I think we'll probably see some cold-rolled results pretty soon. Maybe there'll be another hole or 2 there. For these types of countries, already hearing that maybe some of the Taiwan offers are back in the market again, now that we've gone after them and they kind of escaped, at least the certain line of cases, how long does the industry have to wait before they can go after them again, if they do start to pick up in the future? And then kind of the same question on countries that made key products that weren't named in the initial cases because maybe there weren't big suppliers of the U.S. market, but now that some other guys can't sell into the U.S. market, they're stepping up. And you're hearing some talk about cold-rolled coming in from Vietnam and maybe a couple of the European countries, numbers are starting to tick up a little bit.

Certainly, if we've seen an uptick, and the uptick comes with product that is probably at dump levels, and we believe that there's a violation of our trade laws, then we certainly would go after them, okay? No doubt about that. The other point that I would like to make to the question is when you mentioned about other countries stepping into supply such as Vietnam or some new suppliers, bear in mind that they are impacted and unqualified in many of these applications and they need to go through an extensive qualification period. They're taking a wider risk when you look at -- and frankly, the pricing that's coming in is as high from those countries. So when we combine the higher price with the increased risk with the last places where it can be applied because of the qualifications, we don't see that as much of a threat. But however, to your point, if we do see an uptick in it and we do see it coming in at dump prices or we see it coming in from countries that are receiving large subsidies from the government or in any way violating our trade and international trade laws, then we are certainly free to take action. On your point about moving to the smaller suppliers, bear in mind, that there's [indiscernible] to the fact that we were able to be so successful against the big boys, the big suppliers, the ones who bring in large binds of steel at incredibly dump prices. When you take that out of the equation, we certainly don't have any problem competing with products coming in at fair prices from other countries as long as they adhere to the trade laws."

So any of you who are listening to this call today, we're excited to have you on board. Welcome. I want to tell you, I was at the facility yesterday frankly to welcome everyone into the company and to roam around and walk around the facility. That's a great -- it's a great facility. We've added it at a very good price, okay? A very fat price. And we work it out. We've got about $161 a ton for a plate mill. And that's pretty good price. Why are we doing it? Well, there's a lot of good reasons. Number one, and Chad, you can jump if I miss anything. But number one, just from a sizing perspective, it really fills a void that we had in our portfolio. We want to be able to offer customers a full range of plate products. And currently today, we go up to -- I'm thinking I'm going to get this right, correct me if I'm not -- 3 inches in thickness and 128 inches in width. And with the facility in Longview, we call it Nucor Longview, okay, we'll be able to go up to 12 inches and, I believe, it's 138 inches in width. And beyond that, because they utilize what's known as the bottom forward Ingrid process, okay, you get extremely clean steels that allow us to sell into many, many high-quality, higher-margin applications. Military applications, applications, airplanes, or think they make great brackets for our -- for some of the airplane applications. The [indiscernible] marketing went into well, heavy equipment market they go into. In addition to production, they have an incredible heat-treating and annealing operation.

And I'm going to tell you what, I spent -- I've visited a couple of weeks ago. There again yesterday. I'll want you to know the great equipment they have but more importantly than any of that, they've got a great workforce, the culture's fantastic.

And now I would say that it's fitting into our strategy exactly the way that we had anticipated fitting into it. It increases the flexibility of our raw material strategy. Remember that -- and I know you all probably know this, but remember that when you look at iron units, it represents about 60% of our total cost of production. That's a huge portion of our total cost of production. So the more flexible we are, the bigger the basket of choices we have to use -- when we select the lowest-cost mix to put into our furnaces, gives us a tremendous cost advantage, even to our competition. And we still feel very strongly this was a great long-term investment. I'll remind everyone once again that we did build Louisiana with the infrastructure and the support of second facility. And I'm convinced that, long term, okay, as we continue to see prime scrap become more difficult to obtain and degrade in terms of the quality of the prime scrap that's available for our furnaces, and as we continue to move further and further up into the higher-quality products, where we need more and more virgin or very pure iron units, I'll tell you what, we're going to very glad that we have this one.

This performance represents significant improvement over first quarter 2016 earnings of $0.22 per diluted share and yea",764,"Thanks, John.
Second quarter 2016 earnings of $0.73 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.70 per diluted share. This performance represents significant improvement over first quarter 2016 earnings of $0.22 per diluted share and year-ago second quarter earnings of $0.39 per diluted share.
Second quarter results included a LIFO charge of $19 million, which was in line with our guidance. This compared with the first quarter of 2016 charge of $28 million and a year-ago second quarter credit of $96 million. Our steel mills segment was a primary driver of our second quarter profit improvement with the largest gains at our sheet mills. Quarter-over-quarter profit growth was also achieved at our plate and bar mills. Nucor's Steelmaking Operations benefited from both volume growth and higher metal margins. Second quarter total steel mill shipments increased 5% over the first quarter of 2016. Our overall steel mill metal margin expanded by $16 per ton in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Our downstream products segment also delivered strong earnings growth in second quarter from the first quarter and 2015 second quarter levels. Nucor's steel products business benefits from our market leadership positions and our diversified product portfolio. The strength of Nucor's downstream products business model allows us to profitably leverage our modest improvement in nonresidential construction markets.
Performance at our raw materials segment also improved in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. David J. Joseph Company scrap brokerage and scrap processing business were solidly profitable in the second quarter. The improvements at DJJ's recycling business were threefold. First, scrap pricing improved. Second, utilization and volume flows increased to support our steel mills increased production. Third, our scrap processing team has done excellent work achieving efficiency improvements and cost reductions throughout their operations.
Our direct reduced iron, or DRI, facilities achieved significant quarter-over-quarter improvement in their financial performance. At the same time, our raw materials teams continue to enhance Nucor's overall profitability by working with our steel mills to optimize the cost of their iron units. Maintaining Nucor's position as the low-cost producer across our raw materials, steelmaking and steel products businesses is an unrelenting focus for all of our teams.
Our tax rate can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. Excluding profits belonging to our business partners, the effective tax rate was approximately 32.5% for the second quarter of 2016.
Nucor's financial position remains strong. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 35% at the close of the second quarter. Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $2.3 billion, which compares with total debt outstanding of $4.4 billion. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until 2021.
Nucor is the only North-American-headquartered steel producer to hold an investment-grade credit rating. Our capital allocation priorities are clear. They have been consistently and effectively practiced over Nucor's entire history. Our first priority is to invest for profitable, long-term growth that delivers attractive returns on our invested capital. Our second priority is to provide our shareholders with cash dividends that are consistent with our success in growing Nucor's earnings. Our third priority is to opportunistically repurchase our stock when our cash position is strong and attractively priced growth opportunities are limited.
We expect further strong improvement in earnings in the third quarter of 2016. The steel mills segment will benefit from contract pricing resets in the third quarter at our sheet mills. Contracts currently represent about 60% of Nucor's sheet mill volume. The steel products segment continues to experience positive earnings momentum. Particularly strong profit growth is being realized at the rebar fabrication and metal buildings businesses. All of our steel products teams are doing excellent work in managing the challenge of this year's rising steel price environment. The raw materials segment's performance is expected to achieve profitability in the third quarter of 2016. Our DRI facilities will be profitable, benefiting from improved product pricing, lower iron ore costs and continued gains and yield performance. Our Trinidad and Louisiana plants are now consistently performing at what we believe to be world-class conversion cost levels. Our David J. Joseph Company scrap position should also benefit from the more favorable scrap pricing environment that has been in place since the spring of this year. We are confident that Nucor's significant competitive advantages and highly adaptable business model will allow our team to continue to execute our proven strategies for delivering profitable long-term growth and attractive returns to Nucor's shareholders.

They are: strengthen our position as a low-cost producer; achieve market leadership positions in every product line in our portfolio; continue to move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher-quality, higher-margin, more import-resistant products; expand and leverage our downstream channels to the market to increase our steel mills' baseload volume, especially in weak markets; and achieve commercial excellence to complement our traditional operational strength. Our strategy for profitable growth is working. It is paying off today with the potential for much larger returns in the future. 
I will now update you on highlights of our recent progress. Nucor's steel mill volume growth in 2016 highlights our success in gaining profitable market share. For the first 6 months of 2016, our steel mill production increased 13% over the year-ago period. That compared with the U.S. steel industry's decrease of approximately 1% over the same period. This profitable growth did not just happen. It is the result of our highly flexible and low-cost production capabilities, our unrivaled product breadth and diversity, our investments that have allowed us to move up the value chain, our execution of our channel-to-market strategy, and most importantly, the hard work done by my more than 23,000 Nucor teammates. 
The best news is that we are far from finished executing our strategy. There's a lot more to come. We are adding cylinders to Nucor's engine for generating higher highs and higher lows in earnings and cash flow. As always, our objective is delivering attractive returns on our shareholders' valuable capital. 
Demand is growing for our Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet mills new, wide-light products. After shipping approximately 160,000 tons of wide-light products in 2015, Berkeley is on track to ship about 270,000 tons in 2016. That's up from their earlier target of 240,000 tons for this year. This wide-light product capability is allowing us to produce more grades of advanced high-strength steels for the automotive market. We are also using wide-light products to gain share in a number of other targeted markets, ranging from appliance to motor lamination to welding wire. 
Our Nucor-Yamato joint venture is continuing to expand its value-added structural steel product portfolio. Last year, Nucor-Yamato began shipping its wider sheet piling sections. These wider sections are lighter and stronger, covering more area at a lower installed cost. Prior to our entry, this market had been largely served by imports. Nucor-Yamato is marketing these sections through our piling distribution business, Skyline Steel. Nucor-Yamato's NZ sheet piling sections are already enjoying strong marketplace success. During the first half of 2016, shipments on the new wide sheet piles have more than tripled to over 19,000 tons; 2 of the 4 wider sheet piling product groups have now been commercialized. The 2 other groups will enter production by the end of this year. Nucor-Yamato's goal over the next several years is to grow our wider sheet piling annual volume to 100,000 tons. Nucor-Yamato is nearing completion of another growth initiative, expanding its value-added structural steel product offerings. A $75 million project, adding Quench and Self-Tempering Technology, will position Nucor-Yamato, as the sole North American producer of high-strength, low-alloy beams. Initial trial production is scheduled to start in September. Trials across the entire range of high-strength, low-alloy beams are expected to be completed by the end of next year's first quarter. These beams allow the use of lighter foot weights, which reduces the weight and cost for the builder. That enhances the competitiveness of steel versus concrete and wood. Nucor-Yamato's target over the next several years is to grow its high-strength, low-alloy beam annual volume to 50,000 tons. 
During the second quarter, our Memphis SBQ bar mill completed installation of its heat-treating equipment and began running trials on new value-added products. This expands our capabilities to include Quench and Tempering as well as annealing of bars from 2.5 inches to 12 inches in diameter. I would like to thank our SBQ bar mill and downstream cold-finished bar teams for their excellent work, maintaining profitability in adverse market conditions, while also building for future growth with their numerous initiatives moving us up the value chain. 
During the second quarter, our Vulcraft/Verco joist and decking business announced plans to expand its geographical reach into Canada. Vulcraft Canada, our first Vulcraft facility in Canada, will be located near Hamilton, Ontario. It will manufacturing steel joists, joist girders and decking. We expect to start producing deck by the end of this year with joist production starting in the first quarter of next year. 
Effective implementation of Nucor's vertical integration and channel-to-market strategy is a key competitive strength and an attractive growth platform for our company. In June, Nucor formed a 50-50 joint venture with JFE Steel of Japan to build and operate a facility to produce galvanized sheet steel for the growing Mexican automotive market. The plant will be strategically located in Central Mexico. It's expected to have a cost of about $270 million. Operations are expected to begin in the second half of 2019. Annual capacity will be approximately 400,000 tons of galvanized sheet steel. It's important to note that Nucor and JFE will each supply an equal amount of substrate to be processed at the facility. We are excited to begin what we expect to be a long-term partnership with JFE Steel, a premier supplier of high-quality automotive steels. 
Yesterday, we announced an agreement to acquire Joy Global's steel plate mill in Longview, Texas, for approximately $29 million. Annual capacity of that facility is about 180,000 tons. The mill produces specialty plate products ranging from 1 to 12 inches thick and up to 138 inches wide. Complementing our existing plate mills' product capability, reaching up to 3 inches thick and 120 inches wide, the Texas mill will enable Nucor to capture a growing share of niche value-added plate markets. We are confident our plate commercial team will be able to leverage this expanded product portfolio to grow our overall plate business. All of these investment projects have the same very simple objective: creating attractive long-term value for our customers, our teammates and our shareholders. 
That discipline drives every capital allocation decision we make at Nucor. Our disciplined approach to being effective stewards of our shareholders' capital also requires that our team tackles significant challenges to our business. To that end, Nucor continues to be proactive and aggressive in pursuing trade cases when and where it is appropriate. When foreign producers and governments break mutually agreed-upon laws governing trade, there must be meaningful consequences. Utilizing trade remedies is not protectionism. Trade enforcement is absolutely critical to drive the change towards a market-based system. A market-based system is one where efficiency and innovation determine which producers win and which producers lose. We are encouraged by recent actions taken by the U.S. government that pave the way for the imposition of much-needed antidumping and countervailing revenues in some products against some countries breaking U.S. and international trade laws. But there remains much more work to be done. As always, Nucor is up to the challenge and will continue fighting hard for free and fair trade. 
I would like to close my remarks by expressing my thanks to our teams at our DRI plants in Trinidad and Louisiana for what they have achieved for Nucor. Your facilities today produce the highest-quality and lowest-cost DRI in the world. Your hard work and perseverance are absolutely critical to our company's success in continuing to move up the value chain. Thank you. And please keep it going.
We would now be happy to answer your questions."

Well, our customers are telling us that when they look at the final landed price of the import offers, the difference is great enough to justify the risk. The other point that I would make is when you look at where we are in this -- where we are this year, customers buying imports today, placing the orders today, can't really expect the deliveries until sometime in mid -- somewhere -- either early fourth quarter or mid-fourth quarter. And at that point, they're starting to think about their year-end inventories. So I think there's a bit of a hesitation to do too much on the -- ordering on the import side as a result of their concerns over their year-end inventories. I'd also point out a little bit about the -- there's some availability issues and the buyings were less available that are out there today, a lot is the result of the trade cases, the successful prosecution of the trade cases that we've had, particularly in sheet and in some of our other products. And also a concern that our customers have over the other trade cases that are currently in process. So based on all of that information and from the feedback we're getting from our customers, we don't see that as a major concern at this time."

The increased demand from steel mills across the country raised prices. And with the price increases, flow followed into the scrap yards, which is the normal trend. At this point, with the currency exchange, the strength of the U.S. dollar, the weakness in Europe, in other words, there's a lot of scrap available in Europe. And the Chinese billets moving around the world, the trade flow is there. I don't see a lot of upside pressure on scrap. But similarly, the demand, the robust demand for domestic steel mills, I think, also keeps the demand side level. And that we've reached a pretty good point of supply and demand where we would view a lot of stability in the last half of the year on scrap pricing."

For these types of countries, already hearing that maybe some of the Taiwan offers are back in the market again, now that we've gone after them and they kind of escaped, at least the [indiscernible] of cases, how long does the industry have to wait before they can go after them, again, if they do start to pick up in the future? And then kind of the same question on countries that made key products that weren't named in the initial cases because maybe there weren't big suppliers of the U.S. market, but now that some other guys can't sell into the U.S. market, they're stepping up.

Certainly, if we've seen an uptick, and the uptick comes with product that is probably at dump levels, and we believe that there's a violation of our trade laws, then we certainly would go after them, okay? No doubt about that. The other point that I would like to make to the question is when you mentioned about other countries stepping into supply such as Vietnam or some new suppliers, bear in mind that they aren't tested, they are unqualified in many of these applications and they need to go through an extensive qualification period. And you're taking a larger risk when you look at -- and frankly, the pricing that's coming in is higher from those countries. So we combine the higher price with the increased risk, with the less [ph] places where it can be applied because of the qualifications, we don't see as much of a threat. But however, to your point, if we do see an uptick in it, and we do see it coming in at dump prices or we see it coming in from countries that are receiving large subsidies from the government or in any way violating our trade and international trade laws, then we are certainly free to take action. On your point about moving to the smaller suppliers, bear in mind, there's [indiscernible] to the fact that we were able to be so successful against the big boys, the big suppliers, the ones who bring in large binds of steel at incredibly dump prices. When you take that out of the equation, we certainly don't have any problem competing with products coming in at fair prices from other countries as long as they adhere to the trade laws."

The poster child example of that would be at our Berkeley mill with a wide-light product move -- moving into the advanced type strength steels that will produce a higher strength steel product there's a lot -- takes exit time in the LML, [ph] exit time in the back and degasser.

So at times, it will be domestic scrap. At times, it will be international scrap substitute. So we certainly believe it's an advantage. And we certainly use it to our best advantage."

We've had a very good price, okay? A very fat price. And if you work it out, it has also got $161 a ton for a plate mill. And that's pretty good price. Why are we doing it? Well, there's a lot of good reasons. Number one, and Chad, you can jump if I miss anything.

And with the facility in Longview, we call it Nucor Longview, okay? We'll be able to go up to 12 inches and, I believe, it's 138 inches in width. And beyond that, because they utilize what's known as the bottom forward Ingrid process, okay, you get extremely clean steels that allow us to sell into many, many high-quality, higher-margin applications.

And I'm going to tell you what, I spent -- I've visited a couple of weeks ago. And I was there again yesterday. First of all, I mentioned all the great equipment they have but more importantly than any of that, they've got a great workforce, their culture is fantastic. It's a great cultural fit with Nucor.

This was an auxiliary piece of equipment that gave us the issues, a gas heater. So we got -- we worked our way through the equipment issues. And now I would say that it's fitting into our strategy exactly the way that we had anticipated fitting into it. It increases the flexibility of our raw material strategy. Remember that -- and I know you all probably know this, but remember that when you look at iron units, it represents about 60% of our total cost of production. That's a huge portion of our total cost of production. So the more flexible we are, the bigger the basket of choices we have to use -- when we select the lowest-cost mix to put into our furnaces, gives us a tremendous cost advantage, to our competition. And we still feel very strong in a specific way, long-term investment. I'll remind everyone once again that we did build Louisiana with the infrastructure and the support of second facility. And I'm convinced that, long term, okay, as we continue to see prime scrap become more difficult to obtain and degrade in terms of the quality of the prime scrap that's available for our furnaces, and as we continue to move further and further up into the higher-quality products, where we need more and more virgin or very pure iron units, I'll tell you what, we're going to very glad that we have this one.

This performance represents significant improvement over first quarter 2016 earnings of $0.22 per diluted share and yea",763,"Thanks, John.
Second quarter 2016 earnings of $0.73 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.70 per diluted share. This performance represents significant improvement over first quarter 2016 earnings of $0.22 per diluted share and year-ago second quarter earnings of $0.39 per diluted share.
Second quarter results included a LIFO charge of $19 million, which was in line with our guidance. This compared with the first quarter of 2016 charge of $28 million and a year-ago second quarter credit of $96 million. Our steel mills segment was the primary driver of our second quarter profit improvement with the largest gains at our sheet mills. Quarter-over-quarter profit growth was also achieved at our plate and bar mills. Nucor's Steelmaking Operations benefited from both volume growth and higher metal margins. Second quarter total steel mill shipments increased 5% over the first quarter of 2016. Our overall steel mill metal margin expanded by $16 per ton in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Our downstream products segment also delivered strong earnings growth in second quarter from the first quarter and 2015 second quarter levels. Nucor's steel products business benefits from our market leadership positions and our diversified product portfolio. The strength of Nucor's downstream products business model allows us to profitably leverage a modest improvement in nonresidential construction markets.
Performance at our raw materials segment also improved in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. David J. Joseph Company scrap brokerage and scrap processing businesses were solidly profitable in the second quarter. The improvements at DJJ's recycling business were threefold. First, scrap pricing improved. Second, utilization and volume flows increased to support our steel mills’ increased production. Third, our scrap processing team has done excellent work achieving efficiency improvements and cost reductions throughout their operations.
Our direct reduced iron, or DRI, facilities achieved significant quarter-over-quarter improvement in their financial performance. At the same time, our raw materials teams continue to enhance Nucor's overall profitability by working with our steel mills to optimize the cost of their iron units. Maintaining Nucor's position as the low-cost producer across our raw materials, steelmaking and steel products businesses is an unrelenting focus for all of our teams.
Our tax rate can be confusing due to the impacted profits from noncontrolling interests. Excluding profits belonging to our business partners, the effective tax rate was approximately 32.5% for the second quarter of 2016.
Nucor's financial position remains strong. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 35% at the close of the second quarter. Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $2.3 billion, which compares with total debt outstanding of $4.4 billion. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until 2021.
Nucor is the only North-American-headquartered steel producer to hold an investment-grade credit rating. Our capital allocation priorities are clear. They have been consistently and effectively practiced over Nucor's entire history. Our first priority is to invest for profitable, long-term growth that delivers attractive returns on our invested capital. Our second priority is to provide our shareholders with cash dividends that are consistent with our success in growing Nucor's earnings. Our third priority is to opportunistically repurchase our stock when our cash position is strong and attractively priced growth opportunities are limited.
We expect further strong improvement in earnings in the third quarter of 2016. The steel mills segment will benefit from contract pricing resets in the third quarter at our sheet mills. Contracts currently represent about 60% of Nucor's sheet mill volume. The steel products segment continues to experience positive earnings momentum. Particularly strong profit growth is being realized at the rebar fabrication and metal buildings businesses. All of our steel products teams are doing excellent work in managing the challenge of this year's rising steel price environment. The raw materials segment's performance is expected to achieve profitability in the third quarter of 2016. Our DRI facilities will be profitable, benefiting from improved product pricing, lower iron ore costs and continued gains and yield performance. Our Trinidad and Louisiana plants are now consistently performing at what we believe to be world-class conversion cost levels. Our David J. Joseph Company scrap position should also benefit from the more favorable scrap pricing environment that has been in place since the spring of this year. We are confident that Nucor's significant competitive advantages and highly adaptable business model will allow our team to continue to execute our proven strategies for delivering profitable long-term growth and attractive returns to Nucor's shareholders. 
We appreciate your interest in our company. John?"

Nucor's strategy for profitable growth is simple, flexible and focused. It is one that we've implemented for more than 5 decades. Nucor capitalizes on its unrivaled position of strength to gain profitable market share in our core businesses of steel and steel products. We are doing this by taking care of our customers. Delivering an unrivaled value proposition for our customers is how we earn attractive returns on our shareholders' valuable capital. Anchoring our strategy are Nucor's 5 drivers to profitable growth. They are: strengthen our position as a low-cost producer; achieve market leadership positions in every product line in our portfolio; continue to move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher-quality, higher-margin, more import-resistant products; expand and leverage our downstream channels to the market to increase our steel mills' baseload volume, especially in weak markets; and achieve commercial excellence to complement our traditional operational strength. Our strategy for profitable growth is working. It is paying off today with the potential for much larger returns in the future. 
I will now update you on highlights of our recent progress. Nucor's steel mill volume growth in 2016 highlights our success in gaining profitable market share. For the first 6 months of 2016, our steel mill production increased 13% over the year-ago period. That compared with the U.S. steel industry's decrease of approximately 1% over the same period. This profitable growth did not just happen. It is the result of our highly flexible and low-cost production capabilities, our unrivaled product breadth and diversity, our investments that have allowed us to move up the value chain, our execution of our channel-to-market strategy, and most importantly, the hard work done by my more than 23,000 Nucor teammates. 
The best news is that we are far from finished executing our strategy. There's a lot more to come. We are adding cylinders to Nucor's engine for generating higher highs and higher lows in earnings and cash flow. As always, our objective is delivering attractive returns on our shareholders' valuable capital. 
Demand is growing for our Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet mill’s new, wide-light products. After shipping approximately 160,000 tons of wide-light products in 2015, Berkeley is on track to ship about 270,000 tons in 2016. That's up from their earlier target of 240,000 tons for this year. This wide-light product capability is allowing us to produce more grades of advanced high-strength steels for the automotive market. We are also using wide-light products to gain share in a number of other targeted markets, ranging from appliance to motor lamination to welding wire. 
Our Nucor-Yamato joint venture is continuing to expand its value-added structural steel product portfolio. Last year, Nucor-Yamato began shipping its wider sheet piling sections. These wider sections are lighter and stronger, covering more area at a lower installed cost. Prior to our entry, this market had been largely served by imports. Nucor-Yamato is marketing these sections through our piling distribution business, Skyline Steel. Nucor-Yamato's NZ sheet piling sections are already enjoying strong marketplace success. During the first half of 2016, shipments on the new wide sheet piles have more than tripled to over 19,000 tons; 2 of the 4 wider sheet piling product groups have now been commercialized. The 2 other groups will enter production by the end of this year. Nucor-Yamato's goal over the next several years is to grow our wider sheet piling annual volume to 100,000 tons. Nucor-Yamato is nearing completion of another growth initiative, expanding its value-added structural steel product offerings. A $75 million project, adding Quench and Self-Tempering Technology, will position Nucor-Yamato, as the sole North American producer of high-strength, low-alloy beams. Initial trial production is scheduled to start in September. Trials across the entire range of high-strength, low-alloy beams are expected to be completed by the end of next year's first quarter. These beams allow the use of lighter foot weights, which reduces the weight and cost for the builder. That enhances the competitiveness of steel versus concrete and wood. Nucor-Yamato's target over the next several years is to grow its high-strength, low-alloy beam annual volume to 50,000 tons. 
During the second quarter, our Memphis SBQ bar mill completed installation of its heat-treating equipment and began running trials on new value-added products. This expands our capabilities to include Quench and Tempering as well as annealing of bars from 2.5 inches to 12 inches in diameter. I would like to thank our SBQ bar mill and downstream cold-finished bar teams for their excellent work maintaining profitability in adverse market conditions while also building for future growth with their numerous initiatives moving us up the value chain. 
During the second quarter, our Vulcraft/Verco joist and decking business announced plans to expand its geographical reach into Canada. Vulcraft Canada, our first Vulcraft facility in Canada, will be located near Hamilton, Ontario. It will manufacture steel joists, joist girders and decking. We expect to start producing deck by the end of this year with joist production starting in the first quarter of next year. 
Effective implementation of Nucor's vertical integration and channel-to-market strategy is a key competitive strength and an attractive growth platform for our company. In June, Nucor formed a 50-50 joint venture with JFE Steel of Japan to build and operate a facility to produce galvanized sheet steel for the growing Mexican automotive market. The plant will be strategically located in Central Mexico. It's expected to have a cost of about $270 million. Operations are expected to begin in the second half of 2019. Annual capacity will be approximately 400,000 tons of galvanized sheet steel. It's important to note that Nucor and JFE will each supply an equal amount of substrate to be processed at the facility. We are excited to begin what we expect to be a long-term partnership with JFE Steel, a premier supplier of high-quality automotive steels. 
Yesterday, we announced an agreement to acquire Joy Global's steel plate mill in Longview, Texas, for approximately $29 million. Annual capacity of that facility is about 180,000 tons. The mill produces specialty plate products ranging from 1 to 12 inches thick and up to 138 inches wide. Complementing our existing plate mills' product capability, reaching up to 3 inches thick and 120 inches wide, the Texas mill will enable Nucor to capture a growing share of niche value-added plate markets. We are confident our plate commercial team will be able to leverage this expanded product portfolio to grow our overall plate business. All of these investment projects have the same very simple objective: creating attractive long-term value for our customers, our teammates and our shareholders. 
That discipline drives every capital allocation decision we make at Nucor. Our disciplined approach to being effective stewards of our shareholders' capital also requires that our team tackles significant challenges to our business. To that end, Nucor continues to be proactive and aggressive in pursuing trade cases when and where it is appropriate. When foreign producers and governments break mutually agreed-upon laws governing trade, there must be meaningful consequences. Utilizing trade remedies is not protectionism. Trade enforcement is absolutely critical to drive the change towards a market-based system. A market-based system is one where efficiency and innovation determine which producers win and which producers lose. We are encouraged by recent actions taken by the U.S. government that pave the way for the imposition of much-needed antidumping and countervailing revenues in some products against some countries breaking U.S. and international trade laws. But there remains much more work to be done. As always, Nucor is up to the challenge and will continue fighting hard for free and fair trade. 
I would like to close my remarks by expressing my thanks to our teams at our DRI plants in Trinidad and Louisiana for what they have achieved for Nucor. Your facilities today produce the highest-quality and lowest-cost DRI in the world. Your hard work and perseverance are absolutely critical to our company's success in continuing to move up the value chain. Thank you. And please keep it going.
We would now be happy to answer your questions."

What our customers are telling us that when they look at the final landed price of the import offers, the difference is great enough to justify the risk. The other point that I would make is when you look at where we are in this -- where we are this year, customers buying imports today, placing the orders today, can't really expect the deliveries until sometime in mid -- somewhere -- either early fourth quarter or mid-fourth quarter. And at that point, they're starting to think about their year-end inventories. So I think there's a bit of a hesitation to do too much on the -- ordering on the import side as a result of their concerns over their year-end inventories. I'd also point out a little bit about the -- there's some availability issues and the buyings were less available that are out there today, a lot is the result of the trade cases, the successful prosecution of the trade cases that we've had, particularly in sheet and in some of our other products. And also a concern that our customers have over the other trade cases that are currently in process. So based on all of that information and from the feedback we're getting from our customers, we don't see that as a major concern at this time."

The increased demand from steel mills across the country raised prices. And with the price increases, flow followed into the scrap yards, which is the normal trend. At this point, with the currency exchange, the strength of the U.S. dollar, the weakness in Europe, in other words, there's a lot of scrap available in Europe. And the Chinese billets moving around the world, the trade flows there, I don't see a lot of upside pressure on scrap. But similarly, the demand, the robust demand for domestic steel mills, I think, also keeps the demand side level. And that we've reached a pretty good point of supply and demand where we would view a lot of stability in the last half of the year on scrap pricing."

And I think we'll probably see some cold-rolled results pretty soon. Maybe there'll be another hole or 2 there. For these types of countries, already hearing that maybe some of the Taiwan offers are back in the market again, now that we've gone after them and they kind of escaped, at least this initial lineup of cases, how long does the industry have to wait before they can go after them, again, if they do start to tick up in the future? And then kind of the same question on countries that made key products that weren't named in the initial cases because maybe there weren't big suppliers of the U.S. market, but now that some other guys can't sell into the U.S. market, they're stepping up. And hearing just some talk about cold-rolled coming in from Vietnam and maybe a couple of the European countries, the numbers are starting to tick up a little bit.

Certainly, if we've see an uptick, and the uptick comes with product that is priced at dump levels, and we believe that there's a violation of our trade laws, then we certainly would go after them, okay? No doubt about that. The other point that I would want to make to the question is when you mentioned about other countries stepping into supply such as Vietnam or some new suppliers, bear in mind that they are untested, they are unqualified in many of these applications and they need to go through an extensive qualification period. And you're taking a larger risk when you look at -- and frankly, the pricing that's coming in is higher from those countries. So when you combine the higher price with the increased risk, with the less places where it can be applied because of the qualifications, we don't see it as much of a threat. But however, to your point, if we do see an uptick in it, and we do see it coming in at dump prices or we see it coming in from countries that are receiving large subsidies from the government or in any way violating our trade and international trade laws, then we are certainly free to take action. On your point about moving to the smaller suppliers, bear in mind, there's [indiscernible] to the fact that we were able to be so successful against the big boys, the big suppliers, the ones who bring in large volumes of steel at incredibly dump prices. When you take that out of the equation, we certainly don't have any problem competing with products coming in at fair prices from other countries as long as they adhere to the trade laws."

But are we missing something? Or is there another reason why the average sheet price is so much lower? Even looking at CRE numbers, I can't quite reconcile them.

And we expect to have -- to pick that up in the third quarter. So we're looking forward to that happening. On the question about structural, we had a nice jump in our structural percentage from quarter-over-quarter last quarter.

I would say we have some capacity available on hot-rolled as we look out past the next couple of weeks. One of the other things -- Chad mentioned the issue of mix not moving the same thing up on the side of hot-rolled. So as we continue to shift our mix higher and higher on the value-added, a lot of that product runs slower on our mills. And we can produce less number of tons. The poster child example of that would be at our Berkeley mill with a wide-light product move -- moving into the advanced high strength steels. To produce a high strength steel product there's a lot -- takes extra time in the LML, [ph] takes extra time in the vacuum tank degasser. And then of course, running at those very wide gauges, it takes extra time to run through the mill. So it's basically a question of mix, more than anything else."

So any of you who are listening to this call today, we're excited to have you on board. Welcome. I want to tell you, I was at that facility yesterday to -- frankly to welcome everyone into the company and drove around and walked around that facility. That's a great -- it's a great facility. We've had a very good price, okay? A very fair price. And if you work it out, it comes out to about $161 a ton for a plate mill. And that's pretty good price. Why are we doing it? Well, there's a lot of good reasons. Number one, and Chad, you can jump if I miss any here. But number one, just from a sizing perspective, it really feels a void that we've had in our portfolio. We want to be able to offer our customers a full range of plate products. And currently today, we go up to -- I think I'm thinking going to get this right, correct me if I'm not, 3 inches in thickness and 128 inches in width. And with the facility in Longview, we call it Nucor Longview, okay? We'll be able to go up to 12 inches and, I believe, it's 138 inches in width. And beyond that, because they utilize what's known as the bottom forward ingot process, okay, you get extremely clean steels that allow us to sell into many, many high-quality, higher-margin applications. Military applications, naval applications, airplanes, I think, they make great brackets for our -- for some of the airplane applications. [indiscernible] market they go into well, heavy equipment market they go into. And in addition to production, they have an incredible heat-treating and annealing operation. If I have it correct, I think it's 18 heat-treating facilities, they call them bottle -- up-bottom -- excuse me, bottom furnaces for heat treating. And I'm going to tell you what, I spent -- I've visited a couple of weeks ago. And I was there again yesterday. Best of all, I mentioned all the great equipment they have but more importantly than any of that, they've got a great workforce, their culture is fantastic. It's a great cultural fit with Nucor.

We've got a great commercial team out there selling plates. It wasn't a focus of Joy Global's, so they didn't have the same focus on selling it outside their internal needs. And we do. So we're going to be taking the commercial levels to the whole another level. And just one final point that I would make, and that's -- listen, it might be weak right now.

There tends to be some challenges on equipment. There were in this case. Actually, it had nothing to do with the technology. We still have a great deal of confidence in the technology. This was an auxiliary piece of equipment that gave us the issues, a gas heater. So we got -- we worked our way through the equipment issues. And now I would say that it's fitting into our strategy exactly the way that we had anticipated fitting into it. It increases the flexibility of our raw material strategy. Remember that -- and I know you all probably know this, but remember that when you look at iron units, it represents about 60% of our total cost of production. That's a huge portion of our total cost of production. So the more flexible we are, the bigger the basket of choices we have to use -- when we select the lowest-cost mix to put into our furnaces, gives us a tremendous cost advantage to our competition. And we still feel very strong this was a great long-term investment. I'll remind everyone once again that we did build Louisiana with the infrastructure and the support of second facility. And I'm convinced that, long term, okay, as we continue to see prime scrap become more difficult to obtain and to grade in terms of the quality of the prime scrap that's available for our furnaces, and as we continue to move further and further up into the higher-quality products, where we need more and more virgin or very pure iron units, I'll tell you what, we're going to very glad that we have this.

With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's senior management team: Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias; and our other executive vice presidents: Jim Darsey, Ladd Hall, Ray Napolitan, Joe Stratman, Dave Sumoski, and Chad Utermark.
The leadership team in Charlotte would like to thank everyone on our Nucor-Paris deal, David J. Joseph, Duferdofin, NuMit Steel Technologies and Skyline Steel teams for a job well done in the second quarter. Taking advantage of our unrivaled competitive position and our highly flexible business model, you are positioning Nucor to thrive today, and most importantly, in the years ahead. Thank you. 
CFO, Jim Frias, will now review Nucor's second quarter performance and financial position. Following those comments, I will update you on the execution of our strategy of long-term profitable growth. Jim?"

Second quarter 2016 earnings of $0.73 per diluted share exceeded our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.70 per diluted share. This performance represents significant improvement over first quarter 2016 earnings of $0.22 per diluted share and year-ago second quarter earnings of $0.39 per diluted share.
Second quarter results included a LIFO charge of $19 million, which was in line with our guidance. This compared with the first quarter of 2016 charge of $28 million and a year-ago second quarter credit of $96 million. Our steel mills segment was the primary driver of our second quarter profit improvement with the largest gains at our sheet mills. Quarter-over-quarter profit growth was also achieved at our plate and bar mills. Nucor's Steelmaking Operations benefited from both volume growth and higher metal margins. Second quarter total steel mill shipments increased 5% over the first quarter of 2016. Our overall steel mill metal margin expanded by $16 per ton in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Our downstream products segment also delivered strong earnings growth in second quarter from the first quarter and 2015 second quarter levels. Nucor's steel products business benefits from our market leadership positions and our diversified product portfolio. The strength of Nucor's downstream products business model allows us to profitably leverage a modest improvement in nonresidential construction markets.
Performance at our raw materials segment also improved in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. David J. Joseph Company scrap brokerage and scrap processing businesses were solidly profitable in the second quarter. The improvements at DJJ's recycling business were threefold. First, scrap pricing improved. Second, utilization and volume flows increased to support our steel mills’ increased production. Third, our scrap processing team has done excellent work achieving efficiency improvements and cost reductions throughout their operations.
Our direct reduced iron, or DRI, facilities achieved significant quarter-over-quarter improvement in their financial performance. At the same time, our raw materials teams continue to enhance Nucor's overall profitability by working with our steel mills to optimize the cost of their iron units. Maintaining Nucor's position as the low-cost producer across our raw materials, steelmaking and steel products businesses is an unrelenting focus for all of our teams.
Our tax rate can be confusing due to the impacted profits from noncontrolling interests. Excluding profits belonging to our business partners, the effective tax rate was approximately 32.5% for the second quarter of 2016.
Nucor's financial position remains strong. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 35% at the close of the second quarter. Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $2.3 billion, which compares with total debt outstanding of $4.4 billion. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until 2021.
Nucor is the only North-American-headquartered steel producer to hold an investment-grade credit rating. Our capital allocation priorities are clear. They have been consistently and effectively practiced over Nucor's entire history. Our first priority is to invest for profitable, long-term growth that delivers attractive returns on our invested capital. Our second priority is to provide our shareholders with cash dividends that are consistent with our success in growing Nucor's earnings. Our third priority is to opportunistically repurchase our stock when our cash position is strong and attractively priced growth opportunities are limited.
We expect further strong improvement in earnings in the third quarter of 2016. The steel mills segment will benefit from contract pricing resets in the third quarter at our sheet mills. Contracts currently represent about 60% of Nucor's sheet mill volume. The steel products segment continues to experience positive earnings momentum. Particularly strong profit growth is being realized at the rebar fabrication and metal buildings businesses. All of our steel products teams are doing excellent work in managing the challenge of this year's rising steel price environment. The raw materials segment's performance is expected to achieve profitability in the third quarter of 2016. Our DRI facilities will be profitable, benefiting from improved product pricing, lower iron ore costs and continued gains and yield performance. Our Trinidad and Louisiana plants are now consistently performing at what we believe to be world-class conversion cost levels. Our David J. Joseph Company scrap position should also benefit from the more favorable scrap pricing environment that has been in place since the spring of this year. We are confident that Nucor's significant competitive advantages and highly adaptable business model will allow our team to continue to execute our proven strategies for delivering profitable long-term growth and attractive returns to Nucor's shareholders. 
We appreciate your interest in our company. John?"

Nucor's strategy for profitable growth is simple, flexible and focused. It is one that we've implemented for more than 5 decades. Nucor capitalizes on its unrivaled position of strength to gain profitable market share in our core businesses of steel and steel products. We are doing this by taking care of our customers. Delivering an unrivaled value proposition for our customers is how we earn attractive returns on our shareholders' valuable capital. Anchoring our strategy are Nucor's 5 drivers to profitable growth. They are: strengthen our position as a low-cost producer; achieve market leadership positions in every product line in our portfolio; continue to move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher-quality, higher-margin, more import-resistant products; expand and leverage our downstream channels to the market to increase our steel mills' baseload volume, especially in weak markets; and achieve commercial excellence to complement our traditional operational strength. Our strategy for profitable growth is working. It is paying off today with the potential for much larger returns in the future. 
I will now update you on highlights of our recent progress. Nucor's steel mill volume growth in 2016 highlights our success in gaining profitable market share. For the first 6 months of 2016, our steel mill production increased 13% over the year-ago period. That compared with the U.S. steel industry's decrease of approximately 1% over the same period. This profitable growth did not just happen. It is the result of our highly flexible and low-cost production capabilities, our unrivaled product breadth and diversity, our investments that have allowed us to move up the value chain, our execution of our channel-to-market strategy, and most importantly, the hard work done by my more than 23,000 Nucor teammates. 
The best news is that we are far from finished executing our strategy. There's a lot more to come. We are adding cylinders to Nucor's engine for generating higher highs and higher lows in earnings and cash flow. As always, our objective is delivering attractive returns on our shareholders' valuable capital. 
Demand is growing for our Berkeley County, South Carolina sheet mill’s new, wide-light products. After shipping approximately 160,000 tons of wide-light products in 2015, Berkeley is on track to ship about 270,000 tons in 2016. That's up from their earlier target of 240,000 tons for this year. This wide-light product capability is allowing us to produce more grades of advanced high-strength steels for the automotive market. We are also using wide-light products to gain share in a number of other targeted markets, ranging from appliance to motor lamination to welding wire. 
Our Nucor-Yamato joint venture is continuing to expand its value-added structural steel product portfolio. Last year, Nucor-Yamato began shipping its wider sheet piling sections. These wider sections are lighter and stronger, covering more area at a lower installed cost. Prior to our entry, this market had been largely served by imports. Nucor-Yamato is marketing these sections through our piling distribution business, Skyline Steel. Nucor-Yamato's NZ sheet piling sections are already enjoying strong marketplace success. During the first half of 2016, shipments on the new wide sheet piles have more than tripled to over 19,000 tons; 2 of the 4 wider sheet piling product groups have now been commercialized. The 2 other groups will enter production by the end of this year. Nucor-Yamato's goal over the next several years is to grow our wider sheet piling annual volume to 100,000 tons. Nucor-Yamato is nearing completion of another growth initiative, expanding its value-added structural steel product offerings. A $75 million project, adding Quench and Self-Tempering Technology, will position Nucor-Yamato, as the sole North American producer of high-strength, low-alloy beams. Initial trial production is scheduled to start in September. Trials across the entire range of high-strength, low-alloy beams are expected to be completed by the end of next year's first quarter. These beams allow the use of lighter foot weights, which reduces the weight and cost for the builder. That enhances the competitiveness of steel versus concrete and wood. Nucor-Yamato's target over the next several years is to grow its high-strength, low-alloy beam annual volume to 50,000 tons. 
During the second quarter, our Memphis SBQ bar mill completed installation of its heat-treating equipment and began running trials on new value-added products. This expands our capabilities to include Quench and Tempering as well as annealing of bars from 2.5 inches to 12 inches in diameter. I would like to thank our SBQ bar mill and downstream cold-finished bar teams for their excellent work maintaining profitability in adverse market conditions while also building for future growth with their numerous initiatives moving us up the value chain. 
During the second quarter, our Vulcraft/Verco joist and decking business announced plans to expand its geographical reach into Canada. Vulcraft Canada, our first Vulcraft facility in Canada, will be located near Hamilton, Ontario. It will manufacture steel joists, joist girders and decking. We expect to start producing deck by the end of this year with joist production starting in the first quarter of next year. 
Effective implementation of Nucor's vertical integration and channel-to-market strategy is a key competitive strength and an attractive growth platform for our company. In June, Nucor formed a 50-50 joint venture with JFE Steel of Japan to build and operate a facility to produce galvanized sheet steel for the growing Mexican automotive market. The plant will be strategically located in Central Mexico. It's expected to have a cost of about $270 million. Operations are expected to begin in the second half of 2019. Annual capacity will be approximately 400,000 tons of galvanized sheet steel. It's important to note that Nucor and JFE will each supply an equal amount of substrate to be processed at the facility. We are excited to begin what we expect to be a long-term partnership with JFE Steel, a premier supplier of high-quality automotive steels. 
Yesterday, we announced an agreement to acquire Joy Global's steel plate mill in Longview, Texas, for approximately $29 million. Annual capacity of that facility is about 180,000 tons. The mill produces specialty plate products ranging from 1 to 12 inches thick and up to 138 inches wide. Complementing our existing plate mills' product capability, reaching up to 3 inches thick and 120 inches wide, the Texas mill will enable Nucor to capture a growing share of niche value-added plate markets. We are confident our plate commercial team will be able to leverage this expanded product portfolio to grow our overall plate business. All of these investment projects have the same very simple objective: creating attractive long-term value for our customers, our teammates and our shareholders. 
That discipline drives every capital allocation decision we make at Nucor. Our disciplined approach to being effective stewards of our shareholders' capital also requires that our team tackles significant challenges to our business. To that end, Nucor continues to be proactive and aggressive in pursuing trade cases when and where it is appropriate. When foreign producers and governments break mutually agreed-upon laws governing trade, there must be meaningful consequences. Utilizing trade remedies is not protectionism. Trade enforcement is absolutely critical to drive the change towards a market-based system. A market-based system is one where efficiency and innovation determine which producers win and which producers lose. We are encouraged by recent actions taken by the U.S. government that pave the way for the imposition of much-needed antidumping and countervailing revenues in some products against some countries breaking U.S. and international trade laws. But there remains much more work to be done. As always, Nucor is up to the challenge and will continue fighting hard for free and fair trade. 
I would like to close my remarks by expressing my thanks to our teams at our DRI plants in Trinidad and Louisiana for what they have achieved for Nucor. Your facilities today produce the highest-quality and lowest-cost DRI in the world. Your hard work and perseverance are absolutely critical to our company's success in continuing to move up the value chain. Thank you. And please keep it going.
We would now be happy to answer your questions."

What our customers are telling us that when they look at the final landed price of the import offers, the difference is great enough to justify the risk. The other point that I would make is when you look at where we are in this -- where we are this year, customers buying imports today, placing the orders today, can't really expect the deliveries until sometime in mid -- somewhere -- either early fourth quarter or mid-fourth quarter. And at that point, they're starting to think about their year-end inventories. So I think there's a bit of a hesitation to do too much on the -- ordering on the import side as a result of their concerns over their year-end inventories. I'd also point out a little bit about the -- there's some availability issues and the buyings were less available that are out there today, a lot is the result of the trade cases, the successful prosecution of the trade cases that we've had, particularly in sheet and in some of our other products. And also a concern that our customers have over the other trade cases that are currently in process. So based on all of that information and from the feedback we're getting from our customers, we don't see that as a major concern at this time."

The increased demand from steel mills across the country raised prices. And with the price increases, flow followed into the scrap yards, which is the normal trend. At this point, with the currency exchange, the strength of the U.S. dollar, the weakness in Europe, in other words, there's a lot of scrap available in Europe. And the Chinese billets moving around the world, the trade flows there, I don't see a lot of upside pressure on scrap. But similarly, the demand, the robust demand for domestic steel mills, I think, also keeps the demand side level. And that we've reached a pretty good point of supply and demand where we would view a lot of stability in the last half of the year on scrap pricing."

So one thing that kind of comes to mind is -- we saw results from coated, some of the results from cold-rolled and some of the countries are getting similar duties, not many, but Taiwan, for example, included. And I think we'll probably see some cold-rolled results pretty soon. Maybe there'll be another hole or 2 there. For these types of countries, already hearing that maybe some of the Taiwan offers are back in the market again, now that we've gone after them and they kind of escaped, at least this initial lineup of cases, how long does the industry have to wait before they can go after them, again, if they do start to tick up in the future? And then kind of the same question on countries that made key products that weren't named in the initial cases because maybe there weren't big suppliers of the U.S. market, but now that some other guys can't sell into the U.S. market, they're stepping up. And hearing just some talk about cold-rolled coming in from Vietnam and maybe a couple of the European countries, the numbers are starting to tick up a little bit.

Certainly, if we've see an uptick, and the uptick comes with product that is priced at dump levels, and we believe that there's a violation of our trade laws, then we certainly would go after them, okay? No doubt about that. The other point that I would want to make to the question is when you mentioned about other countries stepping into supply such as Vietnam or some new suppliers, bear in mind that they are untested, they are unqualified in many of these applications and they need to go through an extensive qualification period. And you're taking a larger risk when you look at -- and frankly, the pricing that's coming in is higher from those countries. So when you combine the higher price with the increased risk, with the less places where it can be applied because of the qualifications, we don't see it as much of a threat. But however, to your point, if we do see an uptick in it, and we do see it coming in at dump prices or we see it coming in from countries that are receiving large subsidies from the government or in any way violating our trade and international trade laws, then we are certainly free to take action. On your point about moving to the smaller suppliers, bear in mind, there's [indiscernible] to the fact that we were able to be so successful against the big boys, the big suppliers, the ones who bring in large volumes of steel at incredibly dump prices. When you take that out of the equation, we certainly don't have any problem competing with products coming in at fair prices from other countries as long as they adhere to the trade laws."

But one area that we are focused on, and you'll hear more from us is how we continue to increase on our hot-rolled, since you mentioned specifically what we would do with our hot-rolled. We continue to invest in bringing our hot-rolled to a higher-quality level. Some of the fair work that we're doing in galvanize today is investing to take it out of simply the pricing to the market and get it into high-quality downstream businesses. So general answer, we're interested in everything. We look hard at everything. You've heard us say that we have a very focused but flexible investment strategy, growth strategy. And we’ll look at whatever comes along. We don't have any strong preferences to any particular downstream business."

One of the other things -- Chad mentioned the issue of mix not moving the same thing up on the side of hot-rolled. So as we continue to shift our mix higher and higher on the value-added, a lot of that product runs slower on our mills. And we can produce less number of tons. The poster child example of that would be at our Berkeley mill with a wide-light product move -- moving into the advanced high strength steels. To produce a high strength steel product there's a lot -- takes extra time in the LML, [ph] takes extra time in the vacuum tank degasser. And then of course, running at those very wide gauges, it takes extra time to run through the mill. So it's basically a question of mix, more than anything else."

I want to tell you, I was at that facility yesterday to -- frankly to welcome everyone into the company and drove around and walked around that facility. That's a great -- it's a great facility. We've had a very good price, okay? A very fair price. And if you work it out, it comes out to about $161 a ton for a plate mill. And that's pretty good price. Why are we doing it? Well, there's a lot of good reasons. Number one, and Chad, you can jump if I miss any here. But number one, just from a sizing perspective, it really feels a void that we've had in our portfolio. We want to be able to offer our customers a full range of plate products. And currently today, we go up to -- I think I'm thinking going to get this right, correct me if I'm not, 3 inches in thickness and 128 inches in width. And with the facility in Longview, we call it Nucor Longview, okay? We'll be able to go up to 12 inches and, I believe, it's 138 inches in width. And beyond that, because they utilize what's known as the bottom forward ingot process, okay, you get extremely clean steels that allow us to sell into many, many high-quality, higher-margin applications. Military applications, naval applications, airplanes, I think, they make great brackets for our -- for some of the airplane applications. [indiscernible] market they go into well, heavy equipment market they go into. And in addition to production, they have an incredible heat-treating and annealing operation.

And I'm going to tell you what, I spent -- I've visited a couple of weeks ago. And I was there again yesterday. Best of all, I mentioned all the great equipment they have but more importantly than any of that, they've got a great workforce, their culture is fantastic. It's a great cultural fit with Nucor.

This was an auxiliary piece of equipment that gave us the issues, a gas heater. So we got -- we worked our way through the equipment issues. And now I would say that it's fitting into our strategy exactly the way that we had anticipated fitting into it. It increases the flexibility of our raw material strategy. Remember that -- and I know you all probably know this, but remember that when you look at iron units, it represents about 60% of our total cost of production. That's a huge portion of our total cost of production. So the more flexible we are, the bigger the basket of choices we have to use -- when we select the lowest-cost mix to put into our furnaces, gives us a tremendous cost advantage to our competition. And we still feel very strong this was a great long-term investment. I'll remind everyone once again that we did build Louisiana with the infrastructure and the support of second facility. And I'm convinced that, long term, okay, as we continue to see prime scrap become more difficult to obtain and to grade in terms of the quality of the prime scrap that's available for our furnaces, and as we continue to move further and further up into the higher-quality products, where we need more and more virgin or very pure iron units, I'll tell you what, we're going to very glad that we have this.

Thank you for joining us for our conference call. We appreciate your interest in Nucor. 
With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's senior management team, Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias, and our executive vice presidents: Jim Darsey, Ladd Hall, Ray Napolitan, Joe Stratman, Dave Sumoski and Chad Utermark. 
In addition to his leadership of our raw materials business, Joe Stratman has recently taken on additional responsibilities as Nucor's Chief Digital Officer. Joe's assignment is to lead the development and implementation of an enterprise-wide information system to collect, analyze and distribute commercial, financial and management data. The objectives are twofold: to drive continual improvement in our decision-making and to provide our customers with world-class business-to-business tools that increase the overall value proposition Nucor provides them. 
The leadership team in Charlotte would like to thank everyone on our Nucor, Harris Steel, David J. Joseph, Duferdofin, NuMit, Steel Technologies and Skyline Steel teams for working together to build a safer, stronger and more profitable Nucor. You are the reason our company is thriving in these challenging steel market conditions and will continue to thrive in the years ahead. Thank you. 
Our teammates at Duferdofin-Nucor, our long products steelmaking joint venture in Italy, provide a great example of how we respond to adverse market conditions. Leveraging significant improvements in cost and product mix, they have increased volume and market share in the very challenging and oversupplied European long product markets. As a result, the Duferdofin-Nucor team has achieved a positive EBITDA for the past 12 consecutive months and a positive operating profit for the last 4 months. They should feel very proud of their accomplishments as they continue their unrelenting drive for continual improvement and a brighter future. We are very grateful to have them as members of the Nucor team. 
We also want to extend a very warm welcome to the newest members of the Nucor family, our Nucor Steel Longview team at our recently acquired specialty plate mill in Texas. Nucor is very proud and very excited to have you on board. 
Our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias, will now review Nucor's third quarter performance and financial position. Following those comments, I will update you on the execution of our strategy for long-term, profitable growth. Jim?"

Third quarter of 2016 earnings of $0.84 per diluted share were just below our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.90 per diluted share. However, relative to our guidance, our third quarter results included a larger-than-expected LIFO charge that d",830,"Thanks, John. Third quarter of 2016 earnings of $0.84 per diluted share were just below our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.90 per diluted share. However, relative to our guidance, our third quarter results included a larger-than-expected LIFO charge that decreased our quarterly earnings by $0.08 per diluted share. Third quarter earnings were also reduced by approximately $0.04 per diluted share for the net impact of onetime items. These included expenses for settlement of legal issues as well as a net gain related to asset valuation adjustments. 
The improvement in earnings in the third quarter compared to second quarter was due to improved performance at our sheet mills and our direct reduced iron, or DRI, raw materials facilities. The sheet mills experienced improved margins under contract sales, which are priced on a lag basis. The DRI plants experienced improved transfer pricing of the DRI they sold during the quarter to our steel mills. 
Overall market conditions were very challenging during the third quarter. That was clearly evidenced by a decline in our steel mills segment's capacity utilization rate to 71% in the third quarter from 83% in the second quarter. Third quarter total steel mill tons shipped decreased by 12% from the second quarter 2016. 
Our tax rate can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. Excluding profits belonging to our business partners, the effective tax rate was approximately 32.8% for the third quarter and 32.9% for the first 9 months of 2016. 
Nucor's financial position remains strong. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 35% at the close of the third quarter. Cash and short-term investments total approximately $2.3 billion, which compares with total debt outstanding of $4.4 billion. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until April 2021. 
Nucor holds the highest credit ratings of any North American-headquartered steel producer. 
During third quarter, we restructured our natural gas supply agreements with Encana. Low-cost natural gas is critical to the long-term success of Nucor's raw materials strategy. The restructuring ensures that our Louisiana DRI plant has a secure and low-cost supply of natural gas for decades into the future. In turn, DRI gives Nucor the flexibility to optimize the mix and, most importantly, our metallic input costs. Iron units represent more than half of the total costs of our Steelmaking Operations. Just as important, a secure and low-cost supply of high-quality iron units, such as DRI, supports our growth strategy of moving up the value chain into more demanding steel applications. We expect constraints in the supply and cost of higher-quality scrap to grow in the years ahead. 
Here is a recap of the major elements of the restructuring. Nucor purchased 49% of Encana's leasehold interests covering approximately 54,000 acres in the South Piceance Basin. Nucor and Encana terminated 2 Carry and Earning drilling agreements entered into in 2010 and 2012. Nucor also sold to Encana its 50% equity interest in Hunter Ridge gas gathering and processing assets located in the North Piceance Basin. 
The benefits of the new structure are significant. I will outline the top 4. 
First, the leasehold interest provides Nucor full discretion on its participation in all future capital investment. Our decision to invest in any drilling is independent of other leasehold partners. 
Second, by canceling the Carry and Earning drilling agreements, Nucor has eliminated all future Carry cost premiums and contingent liabilities associated with these contracts. That improves Nucor's capital flexibility and should result in lower future drilling costs. .
Three, Nucor owns a tangible asset, the acreage interest, rather than contractual rights. 
Four, Nucor's acreage interest is expected to be able to meet the current gas usage for all of our steel mills and our DRI facility in Louisiana for decades into the future. 
The net result of these transactions is a lower-cost and more flexible hedge against higher natural gas costs for our Louisiana DRI facility and our core Steelmaking Operations. 
Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2016 are expected to decrease notably compared to the third quarter. The 2 most significant challenges are expected to be downward contract pricing resets at our sheet mills and the impact of lower iron units pricing at our raw materials segment. Beyond these near-term issues, we see a number of positive factors that should benefit the steel markets moving into 2017: steel service center inventories are low, residential construction is robust while nonresidential construction activity is expected to continue its slow but steady pace of improvement, trends in U.S. employment and consumer spending remain healthy, more vigorous enforcement of trade laws has begun to reduce the flow of illegally traded imports into the U.S. 
We are confident that Nucor's significant competitive advantages and highly flexible business model will allow our team to continue to execute on our proven strategies for delivering profitable, long-term growth and attractive returns to Nucor shareholders. Thank you for your interest in our company.

We can see the payoff even in the challenging markets of the current prolonged downturn. It is evident in our strong cash flow generation and our industry-leading returns on capital. Most importantly, it is positioning Nucor to deliver higher highs in profitability during the inevitable cyclical upturn. 
We are executing on our long-term growth strategy by leveraging Nucor's 5 drivers to profitable growth. The 5 drivers are: one, strengthen our position as a low-cost producer; two, achieve market leadership positions in every product line in our portfolio; three, move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher-quality, higher-margin products; four, expand and leverage our downstream channels to market to increase our steel mills' baseload volume, especially in weak markets; and five, achieve commercial excellence to complement our traditional operational strength. 
I will now update you on highlights of the recent progress implementing our strategy for profitable growth. 
In August, we completed the acquisition of Joy Global's steel plate mill in Longview, Texas, for approximately $29 million. Annual melting capacity
[Audio Gap]
is booking orders at levels exceeding our expectations. The mill has already doubled its production rate since completion of the acquisition. We are very excited about the opportunities for profitable, long-term growth Nucor Steel Longview offers our plate business. 
In September, we announced an agreement to acquire Independence Tube Corporation. Independence Tube is the second largest U.S. producer of hollow structural section, or HSS, steel tubing. Annual production is about 600,000 tons from 4 facilities in Illinois and Alabama. HSS steel tubing is predominantly used in nonresidential construction. The purchase price is $435 million or approximately 6x average EBITDA over the 2013 to 2015 period. 
Independence Tube is a natural fit with Nucor and our strategy for profitable growth. Our companies' cultures are very similar, sharing key values such as continual improvement, pay for performance and the way we value our team members. Two other very important criteria we apply in evaluating acquisition opportunities are being a low-cost producer and holding a market leadership position. And like Nucor, they operate efficient manufacturing facilities with a highly variable cost structure. Independence Tube will also be a value-added channel to market for Nucor's hot-rolled sheet steel. It's worth noting that the Independence Tube plants are located in close proximity to Nucor's sheet mills in Alabama, Indiana and Kentucky. 
Nucor is already North America's most comprehensive supplier of steel solutions to the construction and infrastructure markets. We hold leadership positions in beams, bar, plate, steel H-piling and pipe piling manufacturing and distribution as well as joists, decking, metal buildings and rebar fabrication. The addition of HSS steel tubing to our product portfolio will further differentiate Nucor from our steel competitors and our ability to take care of our customers. 
We are looking forward to welcoming the Independence Tube team to the Nucor family as our newest growth platform. Closing of this acquisition is expected around the end of October. 
A second major growth initiative was announced in September: plans to build a specialty cold-rolling complex at our Arkansas sheet steel mill. This facility will cost an estimated $230 million. It is expected to be operational in about 2 years. Annual capacity will be approximately 500,000 tons. This investment supports our strategy of moving up the value chain and growing our participation in the automotive market. The Arkansas Specialty Cold Mill Complex will expand our Sheet Mill Group's capabilities to include products that we are currently unable to manufacture. The flexible cold mill reduction mill will allow us to cold-reduce to both lighter gauge and much higher strength levels to meet our customers' lightweighting goals. The upgraded batch anneal shop will include the ultra-high-temperature capability required for production of motor lamination steels with electrical properties previously only obtainable by non-oriented and silicon steels. The Specialty Cold Mill Complex will also broaden the automotive capability of our galvanizing lines at our Alabama and South Carolina sheet mills. 
Our Nucor-Yamato structural steel mill team is on track with the expansion of their value-added product offerings. Shipments of the recently introduced wider-sheet piling sections have increased 2.5-fold through the first 9 months of 2016 compared to the year ago period. 2 of the 4 new sections have been commercialized with the remaining 2 sections to be commissioned by the end of the first quarter of 2017. 
Nucor-Yamato has also begun trial production of its new high-strength, low-alloy beams utilizing the recently installed quench and self-tempering technology. We expect to complete trials across the entire range of these ASTM-grade 8 9 13 [ph] structural sections during the first half of 2017. Nucor-Yamato will be the sole North American producer of high-strength, low-alloy beams. 
Nucor's SBQ bar mill group achieved significant new value-added product milestones in the third quarter. Our Memphis SBQ mill shipped its first annealed and Quench and Tempered bars, utilizing the heat-treating equipment installed earlier this year. With this new value-added capability, Memphis aims to grow its participation in a number of markets, including energy, agriculture and mining. Our Nebraska SBQ mill started up its new conveyor system that yields significant quality improvements. This will allow Nebraska to move up the value chain in coil applications for such markets as automotive fasteners and oil and gas. 
These are just some of the exciting initiatives being taken throughout Nucor to drive profitable growth. 
Let me conclude with some comments on the greatest challenge facing the steel industry, global steel overcapacity resulting from the trade-distorting practices of some governments. The message is simple. Significant progress is being made, but there is still a tremendous amount of work to be done. The recent affirmative final determinations in the 3 flat-rolled steel antidumping duty and countervailing duty cases were an important step forward. However, many other products require trade enforcement action, including pending cases addressing illegally traded imports of rebar and cut-to-length plate. At the same time, decisive action is needed to deal with efforts by foreign producers to circumvent duties by routing products through third-party countries. One notable example is China circumventing cold-rolled and coated flat-rolled steel duties by shipping product through Vietnam. 
Nucor embraces free and fair competition. With our culture's focus on continual improvement and technological innovation, Nucor thrives in the marketplace, where winners are determined by real economic advantage, not advantages derived from artificial or illegal means. For this reason, Nucor will continue to be proactive and aggressive in pursuing effective and timely enforcement of our nation's trade laws. We owe nothing less than that to our customers, our employees and our shareholders. Challenges clearly remain for the global steel industry. But for a company such as Nucor, one that is in a unique position of strength and has a proven ability to execute its strategy for profitable growth, these are also times of great opportunity. That is why I'm absolutely confident that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us. 
We would now be happy to answer your questions."

When we look at automotive, we see it's just about the same as last year. We don't see it significantly better. In terms of nonresidential construction, we really don't see it much more improved than last year. In fact, if you go through the cost of the year, particularly towards the middle of 2016, there was actually a decrease in the activity in nonresidential construction, but we don't see much of the pop from that side either. And although we have been very successful in our trade cases, particularly on sheet, we're really just beginning to impact of that. And frankly, we do see imports going down, but still they represent a very large portion of our total market share. We're continue -- that's why we continue to fight the battle, and we will continue to fight and be successful in the battle against illegal imports. So we're just beginning to see some of that impact. But let me address another point of the capacity utilization. Think of it as it applies here to Nucor. We've talked many times about our commitment to pursuing higher-value products, and we're going to continue to do that. We believe that having improved margins and profitability is more important than utilization. And as we've said in the past, as you move -- as you change your product mix to those higher-value, higher-quality products, that usually has an impact on your run rates in the mills. A great example would be either the project at our Berkeley facility or the wider piling sections at our Nucor-Yamato facility. Both of those have reduced the run rate significantly although much more profitable products. So we don't get so hung up on utilization. We've mentioned on the last call, and I'll mention it again, that we intend to, at the end of the year, to take a look at how our product mix has shifted over the last several years. It's been forever since we adjusted the denominator in this calculation. And we're going to take a hard look at how our product mix shift has impacted our..."

We can go market by market, but there's no strong market right now that we would point to say that we're going to see a big pop in pricing. I would make one comment, and Chad, you can build on this. When you look at the pricing levels on plate today, personally, I feel they're just not sustainable over the long term. But Chad, would you like to add anything to that?"

Thank you for joining us for our conference call. We appreciate your interest in Nucor. 
With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's senior management team, Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias, and our executive vice presidents: Jim Darsey, Ladd Hall, Ray Napolitan, Joe Stratman, Dave Sumoski and Chad Utermark. 
In addition to his leadership of our raw materials business, Joe Stratman has recently taken on additional responsibilities as Nucor's Chief Digital Officer. Joe's assignment is to lead the development and implementation of an enterprise-wide information system to collect, analyze and distribute commercial, financial and management data. The objectives are twofold: to drive continual improvement in our decision-making and to provide our customers with world-class business-to-business tools that increase the overall value proposition Nucor provides them. 
The leadership team in Charlotte would like to thank everyone on our Nucor, Harris Steel, David J. Joseph, Duferdofin, NuMit, Steel Technologies and Skyline Steel teams for working together to build a safer, stronger and more profitable Nucor. You are the reason our company is thriving in these challenging steel market conditions and will continue to thrive in the years ahead. Thank you. 
Our teammates at Duferdofin-Nucor, our long products steelmaking joint venture in Italy, provide a great example of how we respond to adverse market conditions. Leveraging significant improvements in cost and product mix, they have increased volume and market share in the very challenging and oversupplied European long product markets. As a result, the Duferdofin-Nucor team has achieved a positive EBITDA for the past 12 consecutive months and a positive operating profit for the last 4 months. They should feel very proud of their accomplishments as they continue their unrelenting drive for continual improvement and a brighter future. We are very grateful to have them as members of the Nucor team. 
We also want to extend a very warm welcome to the newest members of the Nucor family, our Nucor Steel Longview team at our recently acquired specialty plate mill in Texas. Nucor is very proud and very excited to have you on board. 
Our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias, will now review Nucor's third quarter performance and financial position. Following those comments, I will update you on the execution of our strategy for long-term, profitable growth. Jim?"

Third quarter of 2016 earnings of $0.84 per diluted share were just below our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.90 per diluted share. However, relative to our guidance, our third quarter results included a larger-than-expected LIFO charge that d",830,"Thanks, John. Third quarter of 2016 earnings of $0.84 per diluted share were just below our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.90 per diluted share. However, relative to our guidance, our third quarter results included a larger-than-expected LIFO charge that decreased our quarterly earnings by $0.08 per diluted share. Third quarter earnings were also reduced by approximately $0.04 per diluted share for the net impact of onetime items. These included expenses for settlement of legal issues as well as a net gain related to asset valuation adjustments. 
The improvement in earnings in the third quarter compared to second quarter was due to improved performance at our sheet mills and our direct reduced iron, or DRI, raw materials facilities. The sheet mills experienced improved margins under contract sales, which are priced on a lag basis. The DRI plants experienced improved transfer pricing of the DRI they sold during the quarter to our steel mills. 
Overall market conditions were very challenging during the third quarter. That was clearly evidenced by a decline in our steel mills segment's capacity utilization rate to 71% in the third quarter from 83% in the second quarter. Third quarter total steel mill tons shipped decreased by 12% from the second quarter 2016. 
Our tax rate can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. Excluding profits belonging to our business partners, the effective tax rate was approximately 32.8% for the third quarter and 32.9% for the first 9 months of 2016. 
Nucor's financial position remains strong. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 35% at the close of the third quarter. Cash and short-term investments total approximately $2.3 billion, which compares with total debt outstanding of $4.4 billion. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until April 2021. 
Nucor holds the highest credit ratings of any North American-headquartered steel producer. 
During third quarter, we restructured our natural gas supply agreements with Encana. Low-cost natural gas is critical to the long-term success of Nucor's raw materials strategy. The restructuring ensures that our Louisiana DRI plant has a secure and low-cost supply of natural gas for decades into the future. In turn, DRI gives Nucor the flexibility to optimize the mix and, most importantly, our metallic input costs. Iron units represent more than half of the total costs of our Steelmaking Operations. Just as important, a secure and low-cost supply of high-quality iron units, such as DRI, supports our growth strategy of moving up the value chain into more demanding steel applications. We expect constraints in the supply and cost of higher-quality scrap to grow in the years ahead. 
Here is a recap of the major elements of the restructuring. Nucor purchased 49% of Encana's leasehold interests covering approximately 54,000 acres in the South Piceance Basin. Nucor and Encana terminated 2 Carry and Earning drilling agreements entered into in 2010 and 2012. Nucor also sold to Encana its 50% equity interest in Hunter Ridge gas gathering and processing assets located in the North Piceance Basin. 
The benefits of the new structure are significant. I will outline the top 4. 
First, the leasehold interest provides Nucor full discretion on its participation in all future capital investment. Our decision to invest in any drilling is independent of other leasehold partners. 
Second, by canceling the Carry and Earning drilling agreements, Nucor has eliminated all future Carry cost premiums and contingent liabilities associated with these contracts. That improves Nucor's capital flexibility and should result in lower future drilling costs. .
Three, Nucor owns a tangible asset, the acreage interest, rather than contractual rights. 
Four, Nucor's acreage interest is expected to be able to meet the current gas usage for all of our steel mills and our DRI facility in Louisiana for decades into the future. 
The net result of these transactions is a lower-cost and more flexible hedge against higher natural gas costs for our Louisiana DRI facility and our core Steelmaking Operations. 
Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2016 are expected to decrease notably compared to the third quarter. The 2 most significant challenges are expected to be downward contract pricing resets at our sheet mills and the impact of lower iron units pricing at our raw materials segment. Beyond these near-term issues, we see a number of positive factors that should benefit the steel markets moving into 2017: steel service center inventories are low, residential construction is robust while nonresidential construction activity is expected to continue its slow but steady pace of improvement, trends in U.S. employment and consumer spending remain healthy, more vigorous enforcement of trade laws has begun to reduce the flow of illegally traded imports into the U.S. 
We are confident that Nucor's significant competitive advantages and highly flexible business model will allow our team to continue to execute on our proven strategies for delivering profitable, long-term growth and attractive returns to Nucor shareholders. Thank you for your interest in our company.

We can see the payoff even in the challenging markets of the current prolonged downturn. It is evident in our strong cash flow generation and our industry-leading returns on capital. Most importantly, it is positioning Nucor to deliver higher highs in profitability during the inevitable cyclical upturn. 
We are executing on our long-term growth strategy by leveraging Nucor's 5 drivers to profitable growth. The 5 drivers are: one, strengthen our position as a low-cost producer; two, achieve market leadership positions in every product line in our portfolio; three, move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher-quality, higher-margin products; four, expand and leverage our downstream channels to market to increase our steel mills' baseload volume, especially in weak markets; and five, achieve commercial excellence to complement our traditional operational strength. 
I will now update you on highlights of the recent progress implementing our strategy for profitable growth. 
In August, we completed the acquisition of Joy Global's steel plate mill in Longview, Texas, for approximately $29 million. Annual melting capacity
[Audio Gap]
is booking orders at levels exceeding our expectations. The mill has already doubled its production rate since completion of the acquisition. We are very excited about the opportunities for profitable, long-term growth Nucor Steel Longview offers our plate business. 
In September, we announced an agreement to acquire Independence Tube Corporation. Independence Tube is the second largest U.S. producer of hollow structural section, or HSS, steel tubing. Annual production is about 600,000 tons from 4 facilities in Illinois and Alabama. HSS steel tubing is predominantly used in nonresidential construction. The purchase price is $435 million or approximately 6x average EBITDA over the 2013 to 2015 period. 
Independence Tube is a natural fit with Nucor and our strategy for profitable growth. Our companies' cultures are very similar, sharing key values such as continual improvement, pay for performance and the way we value our team members. Two other very important criteria we apply in evaluating acquisition opportunities are being a low-cost producer and holding a market leadership position. And like Nucor, they operate efficient manufacturing facilities with a highly variable cost structure. Independence Tube will also be a value-added channel to market for Nucor's hot-rolled sheet steel. It's worth noting that the Independence Tube plants are located in close proximity to Nucor's sheet mills in Alabama, Indiana and Kentucky. 
Nucor is already North America's most comprehensive supplier of steel solutions to the construction and infrastructure markets. We hold leadership positions in beams, bar, plate, steel H-piling and pipe piling manufacturing and distribution as well as joists, decking, metal buildings and rebar fabrication. The addition of HSS steel tubing to our product portfolio will further differentiate Nucor from our steel competitors and our ability to take care of our customers. 
We are looking forward to welcoming the Independence Tube team to the Nucor family as our newest growth platform. Closing of this acquisition is expected around the end of October. 
A second major growth initiative was announced in September: plans to build a specialty cold-rolling complex at our Arkansas sheet steel mill. This facility will cost an estimated $230 million. It is expected to be operational in about 2 years. Annual capacity will be approximately 500,000 tons. This investment supports our strategy of moving up the value chain and growing our participation in the automotive market. The Arkansas Specialty Cold Mill Complex will expand our Sheet Mill Group's capabilities to include products that we are currently unable to manufacture. The flexible cold mill reduction mill will allow us to cold-reduce to both lighter gauge and much higher strength levels to meet our customers' lightweighting goals. The upgraded batch anneal shop will include the ultra-high-temperature capability required for production of motor lamination steels with electrical properties previously only obtainable by non-oriented and silicon steels. The Specialty Cold Mill Complex will also broaden the automotive capability of our galvanizing lines at our Alabama and South Carolina sheet mills. 
Our Nucor-Yamato structural steel mill team is on track with the expansion of their value-added product offerings. Shipments of the recently introduced wider-sheet piling sections have increased 2.5-fold through the first 9 months of 2016 compared to the year ago period. 2 of the 4 new sections have been commercialized with the remaining 2 sections to be commissioned by the end of the first quarter of 2017. 
Nucor-Yamato has also begun trial production of its new high-strength, low-alloy beams utilizing the recently installed Quench and Self-Tempering technology. We expect to complete trials across the entire range of these ASTM grade A913 structural sections during the first half of 2017. Nucor-Yamato will be the sole North American producer of high-strength, low-alloy beams. 
Nucor's SBQ bar mill group achieved significant new value-added product milestones in the third quarter. Our Memphis SBQ mill shipped its first annealed and quench and tempered bars utilizing the heat-treating equipment installed earlier this year. With this new value-added capability, Memphis aims to grow its participation in a number of markets, including energy, agriculture and mining. Our Nebraska SBQ mill started up its new coil conveyor system that yields significant quality improvements. This will allow Nebraska to move up the value chain in coil applications for such markets as automotive fasteners and oil and gas. 
These are just some of the exciting initiatives being taken throughout Nucor to drive profitable growth. 
Let me conclude with some comments on the greatest challenge facing the steel industry: global steel overcapacity resulting from the trade-distorting practices of some governments. The message is simple. Significant progress is being made, but there is still a tremendous amount of work to be done. The recent affirmative final determinations in the 3 flat-rolled steel antidumping duty and countervailing duty cases were an important step forward. However, many other products require trade enforcement action, including pending cases addressing illegally traded imports of rebar and cut-to-length plate. At the same time, decisive action is needed to deal with efforts by foreign producers to circumvent duties by routing products through third-party countries. One notable example is China circumventing cold-rolled and coated flat-rolled steel duties by shipping product through Vietnam. 
Nucor embraces free and fair competition. With our culture's focus on continual improvement and technological innovation, Nucor thrives in a marketplace where winners are determined by real economic advantage, not advantages derived from artificial or illegal means. 
For this reason, Nucor will continue to be proactive and aggressive in pursuing effective and timely enforcement of our nation's trade laws. We owe nothing less than that to our customers, our employees and our shareholders. 
Challenges clearly remain for the global steel industry. But for a company such as Nucor, one that is in a unique position of strength and has a proven ability to execute its strategy for profitable growth, these are also times of great opportunity. That is why I'm absolutely confident that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us. 
We would now be happy to answer your questions."

When we look at automotive, we see it just about the same as last year. We don't see it significantly better. In terms of nonresidential construction, we really don't see it much more improved than last year. In fact, if you go through the causes [ph] of the year, particularly towards the middle of 2016, there was actually a decrease in the activity on nonresidential construction. So we don't see much of a pop from that side either. And although we have been very successful in our trade cases, particularly on sheet, we're really just beginning to see the impact of that. And frankly, we do see imports going down, but still they represent a very large portion of our total market share. We continue -- that's why we continue to fight the battle, and we will continue to fight and be successful in the battle against illegal imports. So we're just beginning to see some of that impact. But let me address another point of the capacity utilization. Think of it as it applies here at Nucor. We've talked many times about our commitment to pursuing higher-value products, and we're going to continue to do that. We believe that having improved margins and profitability is more important than utilization. And as we've said in the past, as you move -- as you change your product mix to those higher-value, higher-quality products, that usually has an impact on your run rates in the mills. A great example would be either the wide project at our Berkeley facility or the wider piling sections at our Nucor-Yamato facility. Both of those have reduced the run rate significantly although they're much more profitable products. So we don't get so hung up on utilization. Now we've mentioned on the last call, and I'll mention it again, that we intend to, at the end of the year, take a look at how our product mix has shifted over the last several years. It's been forever since we adjusted the denominator in this calculation, and we're going to take a hard look at how our product mix shift has impacted our..."

And I will tell you, to me personally, I'm -- as you know, I come from New York. I was in New York a few weeks ago. The conditions on the highways and bridges in New York are deplorable. It's an embarrassment to the United States of America. And when you look at some the estimates that are out there today by different agencies that rate the bridges, rate the roads, so they're talking about a need of spending almost $3 trillion over the next 5 years just to get them up to a B or a B+ level. Think about that amount. That's tremendous. It's long overdue.

Thank you for joining us for our conference call. We appreciate your interest in Nucor. 
With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's senior management team, Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias, and our other Executive Vice Presidents: Jim Darsey, Ladd Hall, Ray Napolitan, Joe Stratman, Dave Sumoski and Chad Utermark. 
In addition to his leadership of our raw materials business, Joe Stratman has recently taken on additional responsibilities as Nucor's Chief Digital Officer. Joe's assignment is to lead the development and implementation of an enterprise-wide information system to collect, analyze and distribute commercial, financial and management data. The objectives are twofold: to drive continual improvement in our decision-making and to provide our customers with world-class business-to-business tools that increase the overall value proposition Nucor provides them. 
The leadership team in Charlotte would like to thank everyone on our Nucor, Harris Steel, David J. Joseph, Duferdofin, NuMit, Steel Technologies and Skyline Steel teams for working together to build a safer, stronger and more profitable Nucor. You are the reason our company is thriving in these challenging steel market conditions and will continue to thrive in the years ahead. Thank you. 
Our teammates at Duferdofin-Nucor, our long products steelmaking joint venture in Italy, provide a great example of how we respond to adverse market conditions. Leveraging significant improvements in cost and product mix, they have increased volume and market share in the very challenging and oversupplied European long product markets. As a result, the Duferdofin-Nucor team has achieved a positive EBITDA for the past 12 consecutive months and a positive operating profit for the last 4 months. They should feel very proud of their accomplishments as they continue their unrelenting drive for continual improvement and a brighter future. We are very grateful to have them as members of the Nucor team. 
We also want to extend a very warm welcome to the newest members of the Nucor family, our Nucor Steel Longview team at our recently acquired specialty plate mill in Texas. Nucor is very proud and very excited to have you on board. 
Our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias, will now review Nucor's third quarter performance and financial position. Following those comments, I will update you on the execution of our strategy for long-term, profitable growth. Jim?"

Third quarter of 2016 earnings of $0.84 per diluted share were just below our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.90 per diluted share. However, relative to our guidance, our third quarter results included a larger-than-expected LIFO charge that d",830,"Thanks, John. Third quarter of 2016 earnings of $0.84 per diluted share were just below our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.90 per diluted share. However, relative to our guidance, our third quarter results included a larger-than-expected LIFO charge that decreased our quarterly earnings by $0.08 per diluted share. Third quarter earnings were also reduced by approximately $0.04 per diluted share for the net impact of onetime items. These included expenses for settlement of legal issues as well as a net gain related to asset valuation adjustments. 
The improvement in earnings in the third quarter compared to second quarter was due to improved performance at our sheet mills and our direct reduced iron, or DRI, raw materials facilities. The sheet mills experienced improved margins under contract sales, which are priced on a lag basis. The DRI plants experienced improved transfer pricing of the DRI they sold during the quarter to our steel mills. 
Overall market conditions were very challenging during the third quarter. That was clearly evidenced by a decline in our steel mills segment's capacity utilization rate to 71% in the third quarter from 83% in the second quarter. Third quarter total steel mill tons shipped decreased by 12% from the second quarter 2016. 
Our tax rate can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. Excluding profits belonging to our business partners, the effective tax rate was approximately 32.8% for the third quarter and 32.9% for the first 9 months of 2016. 
Nucor's financial position remains strong. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 35% at the close of the third quarter. Cash and short-term investments total approximately $2.3 billion, which compares with total debt outstanding of $4.4 billion. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until April 2021. 
Nucor holds the highest credit ratings of any North American-headquartered steel producer. 
During third quarter, we restructured our natural gas supply agreements with Encana. Low-cost natural gas is critical to the long-term success of Nucor's raw materials strategy. The restructuring ensures that our Louisiana DRI plant has a secure and low-cost supply of natural gas for decades into the future. In turn, DRI gives Nucor the flexibility to optimize the mix and, most importantly, our metallic input costs. Iron units represent more than half of the total costs of our Steelmaking Operations. Just as important, a secure and low-cost supply of high-quality iron units, such as DRI, supports our growth strategy of moving up the value chain into more demanding steel applications. We expect constraints in the supply and cost of higher-quality scrap to grow in the years ahead. 
Here is a recap of the major elements of the restructuring. Nucor purchased 49% of Encana's leasehold interests covering approximately 54,000 acres in the South Piceance Basin. Nucor and Encana terminated 2 Carry and Earning drilling agreements entered into in 2010 and 2012. Nucor also sold to Encana its 50% equity interest in Hunter Ridge gas gathering and processing assets located in the North Piceance Basin. 
The benefits of the new structure are significant. I will outline the top 4. 
First, the leasehold interest provides Nucor full discretion on its participation in all future capital investment. Our decision to invest in any drilling is independent of other leasehold partners. 
Second, by canceling the Carry and Earning drilling agreements, Nucor has eliminated all future Carry cost premiums and contingent liabilities associated with these contracts. That improves Nucor's capital flexibility and should result in lower future drilling costs. .
Three, Nucor owns a tangible asset, the acreage interest, rather than contractual rights. 
Four, Nucor's acreage interest is expected to be able to meet the current gas usage for all of our steel mills and our DRI facility in Louisiana for decades into the future. 
The net result of these transactions is a lower-cost and more flexible hedge against higher natural gas costs for our Louisiana DRI facility and our core Steelmaking Operations. 
Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2016 are expected to decrease notably compared to the third quarter. The 2 most significant challenges are expected to be downward contract pricing resets at our sheet mills and the impact of lower iron units pricing at our raw materials segment. Beyond these near-term issues, we see a number of positive factors that should benefit the steel markets moving into 2017: steel service center inventories are low, residential construction is robust while nonresidential construction activity is expected to continue its slow but steady pace of improvement, trends in U.S. employment and consumer spending remain healthy, more vigorous enforcement of trade laws has begun to reduce the flow of illegally traded imports into the U.S. 
We are confident that Nucor's significant competitive advantages and highly flexible business model will allow our team to continue to execute on our proven strategies for delivering profitable, long-term growth and attractive returns to Nucor shareholders. Thank you for your interest in our company.

We can see the payoff even in the challenging markets of the current prolonged downturn. It is evident in our strong cash flow generation and our industry-leading returns on capital. Most importantly, it is positioning Nucor to deliver higher highs in profitability during the inevitable cyclical upturn. 
We are executing on our long-term growth strategy by leveraging Nucor's 5 drivers to profitable growth. The 5 drivers are: one, strengthen our position as a low-cost producer; two, achieve market leadership positions in every product line in our portfolio; three, move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher-quality, higher-margin products; four, expand and leverage our downstream channels to market to increase our steel mills' baseload volume, especially in weak markets; and five, achieve commercial excellence to complement our traditional operational strength. 
I will now update you on highlights of the recent progress implementing our strategy for profitable growth. 
In August, we completed the acquisition of Joy Global's steel plate mill in Longview, Texas, for approximately $29 million. Annual melting capacity
[Audio Gap]
is booking orders at levels exceeding our expectations. The mill has already doubled its production rate since completion of the acquisition. We are very excited about the opportunities for profitable, long-term growth Nucor Steel Longview offers our plate business. 
In September, we announced an agreement to acquire Independence Tube Corporation. Independence Tube is the second largest U.S. producer of hollow structural section, or HSS, steel tubing. Annual production is about 600,000 tons from 4 facilities in Illinois and Alabama. HSS steel tubing is predominantly used in nonresidential construction. The purchase price is $435 million or approximately 6x average EBITDA over the 2013 to 2015 period. 
Independence Tube is a natural fit with Nucor and our strategy for profitable growth. Our companies' cultures are very similar, sharing key values such as continual improvement, pay for performance and the way we value our team members. Two other very important criteria we apply in evaluating acquisition opportunities are being a low-cost producer and holding a market leadership position. And like Nucor, they operate efficient manufacturing facilities with a highly variable cost structure. Independence Tube will also be a value-added channel to market for Nucor's hot-rolled sheet steel. It's worth noting that the Independence Tube plants are located in close proximity to Nucor's sheet mills in Alabama, Indiana and Kentucky. 
Nucor is already North America's most comprehensive supplier of steel solutions to the construction and infrastructure markets. We hold leadership positions in beams, bar, plate, steel H-piling and pipe piling manufacturing and distribution as well as joists, decking, metal buildings and rebar fabrication. The addition of HSS steel tubing to our product portfolio will further differentiate Nucor from our steel competitors and our ability to take care of our customers. 
We are looking forward to welcoming the Independence Tube team to the Nucor family as our newest growth platform. Closing of this acquisition is expected around the end of October. 
A second major growth initiative was announced in September: plans to build a specialty cold-rolling complex at our Arkansas sheet steel mill. This facility will cost an estimated $230 million. It is expected to be operational in about 2 years. Annual capacity will be approximately 500,000 tons. This investment supports our strategy of moving up the value chain and growing our participation in the automotive market. The Arkansas Specialty Cold Mill Complex will expand our Sheet Mill Group's capabilities to include products that we are currently unable to manufacture. The flexible cold mill reduction mill will allow us to cold-reduce to both lighter gauge and much higher strength levels to meet our customers' lightweighting goals. The upgraded batch anneal shop will include the ultra-high-temperature capability required for production of motor lamination steels with electrical properties previously only obtainable by non-oriented and silicon steels. The Specialty Cold Mill Complex will also broaden the automotive capability of our galvanizing lines at our Alabama and South Carolina sheet mills. 
Our Nucor-Yamato structural steel mill team is on track with the expansion of their value-added product offerings. Shipments of the recently introduced wider-sheet piling sections have increased 2.5-fold through the first 9 months of 2016 compared to the year ago period. 2 of the 4 new sections have been commercialized with the remaining 2 sections to be commissioned by the end of the first quarter of 2017. 
Nucor-Yamato has also begun trial production of its new high-strength, low-alloy beams utilizing the recently installed Quench and Self-Tempering technology. We expect to complete trials across the entire range of these ASTM grade A913 structural sections during the first half of 2017. Nucor-Yamato will be the sole North American producer of high-strength, low-alloy beams. 
Nucor's SBQ bar mill group achieved significant new value-added product milestones in the third quarter. Our Memphis SBQ mill shipped its first annealed and quench and tempered bars utilizing the heat-treating equipment installed earlier this year. With this new value-added capability, Memphis aims to grow its participation in a number of markets, including energy, agriculture and mining. Our Nebraska SBQ mill started up its new coil conveyor system that yields significant quality improvements. This will allow Nebraska to move up the value chain in coil applications for such markets as automotive fasteners and oil and gas. 
These are just some of the exciting initiatives being taken throughout Nucor to drive profitable growth. 
Let me conclude with some comments on the greatest challenge facing the steel industry: global steel overcapacity resulting from the trade-distorting practices of some governments. The message is simple. Significant progress is being made, but there is still a tremendous amount of work to be done. The recent affirmative final determinations in the 3 flat-rolled steel antidumping duty and countervailing duty cases were an important step forward. However, many other products require trade enforcement action, including pending cases addressing illegally traded imports of rebar and cut-to-length plate. At the same time, decisive action is needed to deal with efforts by foreign producers to circumvent duties by routing products through third-party countries. One notable example is China circumventing cold-rolled and coated flat-rolled steel duties by shipping product through Vietnam. 
Nucor embraces free and fair competition. With our culture's focus on continual improvement and technological innovation, Nucor thrives in a marketplace where winners are determined by real economic advantage, not advantages derived by artificial or illegal means. 
For this reason, Nucor will continue to be proactive and aggressive in pursuing effective and timely enforcement of our nation's trade laws. We owe nothing less than that to our customers, our employees and our shareholders. 
Challenges clearly remain for the global steel industry. But for a company such as Nucor, one that is in a unique position of strength and has a proven ability to execute its strategy for profitable growth, these are also times of great opportunity. That is why I'm absolutely confident that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us. 
We would now be happy to answer your questions."

When we look at automotive, we see it just about the same as last year. We don't see it significantly better. In terms of nonresidential construction, we really don't see it much more improved than last year. In fact, if you go through the costs of the year, particularly towards the middle of 2016, there was actually a decrease in the activity on nonresidential construction. So we don't see much of a pop from that side either. And although we have been very successful in our trade cases, particularly on sheet, we're really just beginning to see the impact of that. And frankly, we do see imports going down, but still they represent a very large portion of our total market share. We continue -- that's why we continue to fight the battle, and we will continue to fight and be successful in the battle against illegal imports. So we're just beginning to see some of that impact. But let me address another point of the capacity utilization. Particularly as it applies here at Nucor. We've talked many times about our commitment to pursuing higher-value products, and we're going to continue to do that. We believe that having improved margins and profitability is more important than utilization. And as we've said in the past, as you move -- as you change your product mix to those higher-value, higher-quality products, that usually has an impact on your run rates in the mills. A great example would be either the wide project at our Berkeley facility or the wider piling sections at our Nucor-Yamato facility. Both of those have reduced the run rate significantly although they're much more profitable products. So we don't get so hung up on utilization. Now we've mentioned on the last call, and I'll mention it again, that we intend to, at the end of the year, take a look at how our product mix has shifted over the last several years.

So I would think it's going to probably be at least as strong as this year's net $500 million range."

We buy pig iron on a lagging quarter basis, and it influences our overall cost of DRI as well.

Thank you for joining us for our conference call. We appreciate your interest in Nucor. 
With me for today's call are the other members of Nucor's senior management team, Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias, and our other Executive Vice Presidents: Jim Darsey, Ladd Hall, Ray Napolitan, Joe Stratman, Dave Sumoski and Chad Utermark. 
In addition to his leadership of our raw materials business, Joe Stratman has recently taken on additional responsibilities as Nucor's Chief Digital Officer. Joe's assignment is to lead the development and implementation of an enterprise-wide information system to collect, analyze and distribute commercial, financial and management data. The objectives are twofold: to drive continual improvement in our decision-making and to provide our customers with world-class business-to-business tools that increase the overall value proposition Nucor provides them. 
The leadership team in Charlotte would like to thank everyone on our Nucor, Harris Steel, David J. Joseph, Duferdofin, NuMit, Steel Technologies and Skyline Steel teams for working together to build a safer, stronger and more profitable Nucor. You are the reason our company is thriving in these challenging steel market conditions and will continue to thrive in the years ahead. Thank you. 
Our teammates at Duferdofin-Nucor, our long products steelmaking joint venture in Italy, provide a great example of how we respond to adverse market conditions. Leveraging significant improvements in cost and product mix, they have increased volume and market share in the very challenging and oversupplied European long product markets. As a result, the Duferdofin-Nucor team has achieved a positive EBITDA for the past 12 consecutive months and a positive operating profit for the last 4 months. They should feel very proud of their accomplishments as they continue their unrelenting drive for continual improvement and a brighter future. We are very grateful to have them as members of the Nucor team. 
We also want to extend a very warm welcome to the newest members of the Nucor family, our Nucor Steel Longview team at our recently acquired specialty plate mill in Texas. Nucor is very proud and very excited to have you on board. 
Our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Frias, will now review Nucor's third quarter performance and financial position. Following those comments, I will update you on the execution of our strategy for long-term, profitable growth. Jim?"

Third quarter of 2016 earnings of $0.84 per diluted share were just below our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.90 per diluted share. However, relative to our guidance, our third quarter results included a larger-than-expected LIFO charge that d",830,"Thanks, John. Third quarter of 2016 earnings of $0.84 per diluted share were just below our guidance range of $0.85 to $0.90 per diluted share. However, relative to our guidance, our third quarter results included a larger-than-expected LIFO charge that decreased our quarterly earnings by $0.08 per diluted share. Third quarter earnings were also reduced by approximately $0.04 per diluted share for the net impact of onetime items. These included expenses for settlement of legal issues as well as a net gain related to asset valuation adjustments. 
The improvement in earnings in the third quarter compared to second quarter was due to improved performance at our sheet mills and our direct reduced iron, or DRI, raw materials facilities. The sheet mills experienced improved margins under contract sales, which are priced on a lag basis. The DRI plants experienced improved transfer pricing of the DRI they sold during the quarter to our steel mills. 
Overall market conditions were very challenging during the third quarter. That was clearly evidenced by a decline in our steel mills segment's capacity utilization rate to 71% in the third quarter from 83% in the second quarter. Third quarter total steel mill tons shipped decreased by 12% from the second quarter 2016. 
Our tax rate can be confusing due to the impact of profits from noncontrolling interests. Excluding profits belonging to our business partners, the effective tax rate was approximately 32.8% for the third quarter and 32.9% for the first 9 months of 2016. 
Nucor's financial position remains strong. Our gross debt-to-capital ratio was 35% at the close of the third quarter. Cash and short-term investments total approximately $2.3 billion, which compares with total debt outstanding of $4.4 billion. Nucor's strong liquidity position also includes our $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn. The facility does not mature until April 2021. 
Nucor holds the highest credit ratings of any North American-headquartered steel producer. 
During third quarter, we restructured our natural gas supply agreements with Encana. Low-cost natural gas is critical to the long-term success of Nucor's raw materials strategy. The restructuring ensures that our Louisiana DRI plant has a secure and low-cost supply of natural gas for decades into the future. In turn, DRI gives Nucor the flexibility to optimize the mix and, most importantly, our metallic input costs. Iron units represent more than half of the total costs of our Steelmaking Operations. Just as important, a secure and low-cost supply of high-quality iron units, such as DRI, supports our growth strategy of moving up the value chain into more demanding steel applications. We expect constraints in the supply and cost of higher-quality scrap to grow in the years ahead. 
Here is a recap of the major elements of the restructuring. Nucor purchased 49% of Encana's leasehold interests covering approximately 54,000 acres in the South Piceance Basin. Nucor and Encana terminated 2 Carry and Earning drilling agreements entered into in 2010 and 2012. Nucor also sold to Encana its 50% equity interest in Hunter Ridge gas gathering and processing assets located in the North Piceance Basin. 
The benefits of the new structure are significant. I will outline the top 4. 
First, the leasehold interest provides Nucor full discretion on its participation in all future capital investment. Our decision to invest in any drilling is independent of other leasehold partners. 
Second, by canceling the Carry and Earning drilling agreements, Nucor has eliminated all future Carry cost premiums and contingent liabilities associated with these contracts. That improves Nucor's capital flexibility and should result in lower future drilling costs. .
Three, Nucor owns a tangible asset, the acreage interest, rather than contractual rights. 
Four, Nucor's acreage interest is expected to be able to meet the current gas usage for all of our steel mills and our DRI facility in Louisiana for decades into the future. 
The net result of these transactions is a lower-cost and more flexible hedge against higher natural gas costs for our Louisiana DRI facility and our core Steelmaking Operations. 
Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2016 are expected to decrease notably compared to the third quarter. The 2 most significant challenges are expected to be downward contract pricing resets at our sheet mills and the impact of lower iron units pricing at our raw materials segment. Beyond these near-term issues, we see a number of positive factors that should benefit the steel markets moving into 2017: steel service center inventories are low, residential construction is robust while nonresidential construction activity is expected to continue its slow but steady pace of improvement, trends in U.S. employment and consumer spending remain healthy, more vigorous enforcement of trade laws has begun to reduce the flow of illegally traded imports into the U.S. 
We are confident that Nucor's significant competitive advantages and highly flexible business model will allow our team to continue to execute on our proven strategies for delivering profitable, long-term growth and attractive returns to Nucor shareholders. Thank you for your interest in our company.

We can see the payoff even in the challenging markets of the current prolonged downturn. It is evident in our strong cash flow generation and our industry-leading returns on capital. Most importantly, it is positioning Nucor to deliver higher highs in profitability during the inevitable cyclical upturn. 
We are executing on our long-term growth strategy by leveraging Nucor's 5 drivers to profitable growth. The 5 drivers are: one, strengthen our position as a low-cost producer; two, achieve market leadership positions in every product line in our portfolio; three, move up the value chain by expanding our capabilities to produce higher-quality, higher-margin products; four, expand and leverage our downstream channels to market to increase our steel mills' baseload volume, especially in weak markets; and five, achieve commercial excellence to complement our traditional operational strength. 
I will now update you on highlights of the recent progress implementing our strategy for profitable growth. 
In August, we completed the acquisition of Joy Global's steel plate mill in Longview, Texas, for approximately $29 million. Annual melting capacity
[Audio Gap]
is booking orders at levels exceeding our expectations. The mill has already doubled its production rate since completion of the acquisition. We are very excited about the opportunities for profitable, long-term growth Nucor Steel Longview offers our plate business. 
In September, we announced an agreement to acquire Independence Tube Corporation. Independence Tube is the second largest U.S. producer of hollow structural section, or HSS, steel tubing. Annual production is about 600,000 tons from 4 facilities in Illinois and Alabama. HSS steel tubing is predominantly used in nonresidential construction. The purchase price is $435 million or approximately 6x average EBITDA over the 2013 to 2015 period. 
Independence Tube is a natural fit with Nucor and our strategy for profitable growth. Our companies' cultures are very similar, sharing key values such as continual improvement, pay for performance and the way we value our team members. Two other very important criteria we apply in evaluating acquisition opportunities are being a low-cost producer and holding a market leadership position. And like Nucor, they operate efficient manufacturing facilities with a highly variable cost structure. Independence Tube will also be a value-added channel to market for Nucor's hot-rolled sheet steel. It's worth noting that the Independence Tube plants are located in close proximity to Nucor's sheet mills in Alabama, Indiana and Kentucky. 
Nucor is already North America's most comprehensive supplier of steel solutions to the construction and infrastructure markets. We hold leadership positions in beams, bar, plate, steel H-piling and pipe piling manufacturing and distribution as well as joists, decking, metal buildings and rebar fabrication. The addition of HSS steel tubing to our product portfolio will further differentiate Nucor from our steel competitors and our ability to take care of our customers. 
We are looking forward to welcoming the Independence Tube team to the Nucor family as our newest growth platform. Closing of this acquisition is expected around the end of October. 
A second major growth initiative was announced in September: plans to build a specialty cold-rolling complex at our Arkansas sheet steel mill. This facility will cost an estimated $230 million. It is expected to be operational in about 2 years. Annual capacity will be approximately 500,000 tons. This investment supports our strategy of moving up the value chain and growing our participation in the automotive market. The Arkansas Specialty Cold Mill Complex will expand our Sheet Mill Group's capabilities to include products that we are currently unable to manufacture. The flexible cold mill reduction mill will allow us to cold-reduce to both lighter gauge and much higher strength levels to meet our customers' lightweighting goals. The upgraded batch anneal shop will include the ultra-high-temperature capability required for production of motor lamination steels with electrical properties previously only obtainable by non-oriented and silicon steels. The Specialty Cold Mill Complex will also broaden the automotive capability of our galvanizing lines at our Alabama and South Carolina sheet mills. 
Our Nucor-Yamato structural steel mill team is on track with the expansion of their value-added product offerings. Shipments of the recently introduced wider-sheet piling sections have increased 2.5-fold through the first 9 months of 2016 compared to the year ago period. 2 of the 4 new sections have been commercialized with the remaining 2 sections to be commissioned by the end of the first quarter of 2017. 
Nucor-Yamato has also begun trial production of its new high-strength, low-alloy beams utilizing the recently installed Quench and Self-Tempering technology. We expect to complete trials across the entire range of these ASTM grade A913 structural sections during the first half of 2017. Nucor-Yamato will be the sole North American producer of high-strength, low-alloy beams. 
Nucor's SBQ bar mill group achieved significant new value-added product milestones in the third quarter. Our Memphis SBQ mill shipped its first annealed and quench and tempered bars utilizing the heat-treating equipment installed earlier this year. With this new value-added capability, Memphis aims to grow its participation in a number of markets, including energy, agriculture and mining. Our Nebraska SBQ mill started up its new coil conveyor system that yields significant quality improvements. This will allow Nebraska to move up the value chain in coil applications for such markets as automotive fasteners and oil and gas. 
These are just some of the exciting initiatives being taken throughout Nucor to drive profitable growth. 
Let me conclude with some comments on the greatest challenge facing the steel industry: global steel overcapacity resulting from the trade-distorting practices of some governments. The message is simple. Significant progress is being made, but there is still a tremendous amount of work to be done. The recent affirmative final determinations in the 3 flat-rolled steel antidumping duty and countervailing duty cases were an important step forward. However, many other products require trade enforcement action, including pending cases addressing illegally traded imports of rebar and cut-to-length plate. At the same time, decisive action is needed to deal with efforts by foreign producers to circumvent duties by routing products through third-party countries. One notable example is China circumventing cold-rolled and coated flat-rolled steel duties by shipping product through Vietnam. 
Nucor embraces free and fair competition. With our culture's focus on continual improvement and technological innovation, Nucor thrives in a marketplace where winners are determined by real economic advantage, not advantages derived by artificial or illegal means. 
For this reason, Nucor will continue to be proactive and aggressive in pursuing effective and timely enforcement of our nation's trade laws. We owe nothing less than that to our customers, our employees and our shareholders. 
Challenges clearly remain for the global steel industry. But for a company such as Nucor, one that is in a unique position of strength and has a proven ability to execute its strategy for profitable growth, these are also times of great opportunity. That is why I'm absolutely confident that Nucor's best years are still ahead of us. 
We would now be happy to answer your questions."

When we look at automotive, we see it just about the same as last year. We don't see it significantly better.

When we look at automotive, we see it just about the same as last year. We don't see it significantly better. In terms of nonresidential construction, we really don't see it much more improved than last year. In fact, if you go through the costs of the year, particularly towards the middle of 2016, there was actually a decrease in the activity on nonresidential construction. So we don't see much of a pop from that side either. And although we have been very successful in our trade cases, particularly on sheet, we're really just beginning to see the impact of that. And frankly, we do see imports going down, but still they represent a very large portion of our total market share. We continue -- that's why we continue to fight the battle, and we will continue to fight and be successful in the battle against illegal imports. So we're just beginning to see some of that impact. But let me address another point of the capacity utilization. Particularly as it applies here at Nucor. We've talked many times about our commitment to pursuing higher-value products, and we're going to continue to do that. We believe that having improved margins and profitability is more important than utilization. And as we've said in the past, as you move -- as you change your product mix to those higher-value, higher-quality products, that usually has an impact on your run rates in the mills. A great example would be either the wide project at our Berkeley facility or the wider piling sections at our Nucor-Yamato facility. Both of those have reduced the run rate significantly although they're much more profitable products. So we don't get so hung up on utilization. Now we've mentioned on the last call, and I'll mention it again, that we intend to, at the end of the year, take a look at how our product mix has shifted over the last several years. It's been forever since we adjusted the denominator in this calculation, and we're going to take a hard look at how our product mix shift has impacted our..."

But frankly, when you look at the results that came out of the last trade case, particularly as they relate to Turkey, there were commitments made at -- during those hearings where Turkey said that they would not increase their imports into the United States. And when you talk about classic hockey stick, these things went off the charts. And the fact that the way that the country acted with their imports into United States on rebar after the trade cases last time, we think, provide tremendous ammunition for us in this case, and we're anxious to prosecute it."

And the reason we bumped up the pace is because of the timing of how -- mainly how the timing of how DRI and pig iron affect us. We buy pig iron on a lagging quarter basis, and it influences our overall cost of DRI as well. And so those 2 commodities came in, deliveries in the third quarter, and it influenced our inventory overall position to a greater extent than we were expecting. So that's changed our outlook for where the balances will be at the end of the year."

I will also build on the second part of your question. Both candidates have spoken about the need for infrastructure in the United States. And I will tell you, to me personally, I'm -- as you know, I come from New York. I was in New York a few weeks ago. The conditions on the highways and bridges in New York are deplorable. It's an embarrassment to the United States of America. And when you look at some the estimates that are out there today by different agencies that rate the bridges, rate the roads, so they're talking about a need of spending almost $3 trillion over the next 5 years just to get them up to a B or a B+ level. Think about that amount. That's tremendous. It's long overdue. I hope both candidates or whichever candidate -- excuse me, with -- each of the candidates, whichever one gets in, lives up to their commitments, both on infrastructure and on maintaining the strong enforcement of our trade laws. And that goes not only for the presidency but for Congress also."
