As you will hear this morning, it was an excellent quarter for Omnicom. We recruited some of the best talents in our industry, continued to win significant new business and made a couple of important agency acquisitions. It was a terrific way to end the year. 
Our financial performance was also solid. We posted organic revenue growth of 4.8% in the fourth quarter, resulting in 5.3% growth for the full year. We also achieved our margin and net income targets for the quarter and the full year despite significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar and its impact on revenue and EBIT. 
FX reduced our revenue in the fourth quarter by $236 million or 5.6%. For the year, currency impacts reduced our revenue by just over $1 billion. 
As we enter 2016, FX will continue to be a headwind on our revenue and earnings, but hopefully, at a less significant rate. Shub will provide more details about the impact of FX later in the call. 
Turning now to organic growth by region. North America increased by 4.7%, reflecting very strong performances in our brand advertising and media businesses. This was offset by a public relations and specialty disciplines, both of which had difficult comps versus prior year. 
In the fourth quarter of 2014, PR was up 9.9% and specialty was up 8.9%. The U.K. was up 4.9% in the quarter and ended the year up 7.1%. Overall, growth in our Euro region was 3.5%. 
In the Euro markets, Germany was in the mid-single digits and Spain and Italy also outperformed, while France and The Netherlands continued to weigh on the performance in the region. 
Outside the Euro countries, Russia, Sweden and Turkey had above average results.
Moving to Asia-Pacific. Organic growth was 8.6%. We had solid growth across almost every market and double-digit growth in Australia, China, Indonesia, Korea, Thailand and Vietnam. 
Latin America was slightly positive for the quarter as strong performances in Mexico offset weaknesses in Brazil.
Looking at our bottom line, EPS for the quarter was $1.35, up 3.8% versus the prior year. For the year, EPS was up 4% to $4.41. Excluding the impact of currency, earnings per share would have been 8% higher for both the quarter and the year.
For 2015, we generated over $1.6 billion in free cash, an increase of 2% year-over-year and returned almost $1.2 billion to the shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  Finally, our balance sheet and liquidity remained very strong.  
Overall, I'm very pleased with our performance for the quarter and the full year. 
Looking forward, the consistency and diversity of our operations and results, combined with our very strong liquidity and balance sheet, will allow us to capitalize on opportunities when they arise.
Turning now to some of the events of last year. As widely reported, 2015 had a significant number of new year reviews. As I mentioned on previous calls, we were very selective in accepting only a handful of imitations to pursue new business and into few orders in order to stay focused on our existing clients. 
And as I'm sure you've seen, we ended the year winning most of Procter & Gamble's North America media planning and buying business, which was perhaps the most extensive and certainly the most closely watched review of 2015. This win is a reflection of the talented people and the capabilities we have within Omnicom's media group and Annalect, our open source data and analytics platform. You've heard me talk about the investments we've made in this area and they're paying off for our clients and our business. 
We now have data and analytic experts, or marketing sciences as we call them, embedded in many of our account teams. Clients increasingly recognize this alignment needs to better data and reform strategies that are more effective in today's fluid and personalized marketing environment.
Overall, we're very pleased with our results on these media reviews for the year as we came out a net winner. 
An independent third party, , recently reported that we ranked ahead of our main holding company competitors and that includes us passing on some of the pitches I mentioned earlier. Since year end, Sony concluded its global review, OMD adding some substantially to its Music business and entertainment business, while trading off some gaming businesses principally added to the U.K. 
Looking ahead, there are also a few midsized opportunities and risks that are more typical of a normal review year. Whether the pace of 2015 continues into 2016, it's too early to say, but we will not be surprised if the patterns continue.
At the same time, our media group is in the process of developing a third global brand in addition to our successful OMD and PHD brands. You can expect our media group to announce the official launch of this third media brand in the next few weeks. 
In the year ahead, they will be establishing network offices in key markets around the world, leveraging other in-country media assets. This will give us additional capacity to manage more client relationships as well as leverage the investments we've made in media capabilities across our businesses.
Turning to the topic of talent. We announced last quarter that Wendy Clark would become CEO of DDB North America. Wendy is highly respected in the marketing world and joined DDB from Coca-Cola where she was the President for Sparkling Brands and Strategic Marketing. We're excited to have her part of the DDB and Omnicom team. 
We also had a number of other important recruits in the quarter from leading marketers. These senior talent additions are accustomed to Omnicom's ability to attract top people from iconic brands. 
I mentioned at the beginning of the call that we have made 2 important acquisitions in the fourth quarter, one in Latin America and one in the U.K. In November, DDB Worldwide announced the acquisition of Grupo ABC, the largest independent advertising and marketing communications group in Brazil. Grupo ABC has 2,000 people in 30 locations, with best-in-class advertising brands as well as offerings and public relations, CRM, digital, promotion and event. The blue-chip client roster includes names like Procter & Gamble, J&J and Bush in. We have known the cofounders of Grupo ABC since we invested in DDB's operation in Brazil in 1997, so I'm especially pleased to officially welcome them back to the Omnicom family. 
Importantly, ABC had outstanding creative talent that will strengthen our capabilities not only in Brazil, but also around the world. And despite its current economic challenges, we're fully committed to the Brazilian market as one of the largest for our services. 
The ABC acquisition closed at the end of January and Omnicom's 2016 results will include 11 months of their operations. 
In December, BBDO Worldwide acquired a majority stake in Wednesday Agency Group. With over 100 people in London and New York, Wednesday is a leading creative agency focused on fashion and luxury lifestyle brands, a specialized niche in our business. The firm is known for its creative excellence and passion, which makes it a great fit for BBDO. 
Grupo ABC and Wednesday are perfect examples of agencies founded by leading industry talent with strong creative cultures that also strengthen our geographic and service capability. 
Another barometer that we use to measure our success in cultivating the best talent is the performance of our work for clients in award shows. Once again, our agencies and networks continued their tradition of being the most creatively awarded companies in the world. Let me mention just a few just to highlight them. Omnicom's Sweat Campaign Magazine's prestigious 2015 Agency of the Year awards. BBDO was awarded Agency Network of the Year; PHD, Media Network of the Year; and Adam and Eve, DDB picked up Agency of the Year. BBDO topped the Gunn Report for the 10th year in a row. At the campaign, Asia-Pacific Agency of the Year awards. TBWA and DDB won Creative Agencies of the Year in Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, Philippines and Indonesia. There are many others throughout our disciplines, and I want to congratulate all of our people and agencies for their outstanding work. 
Operationally, we continue to drive greater efficiencies throughout our business in 2015. We are constantly challenging our people to find ways to manage their cost agency by agency. And on a regional and global basis, we're leveraging our scale in areas, such as Information Technology, real estate, back office services and purchasing to deliver further cost improvements.
We believe that these and other initiatives will allow Omnicom to deliver a 30-basis-point margin improvement for the full year 2016 or 13.7% EBITA versus 13.4% for this past year. 
Before I hand the call over to Phil, I want to touch on the importance of innovation and collaboration in our business as we continue moving forward towards more interconnected activities. 
In January, I attended the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. I'm always amazed at the pace of technological change from a virtual reality, which has now reached the tipping point, to the Internet of things, which is resulting in automation and interconnection of homes, cars and personal devices. Many of these innovations were still in the concept stage just a few years ago and they're examples of technologies that will create new opportunities for marketers.
For Omnicom and our agencies, it is critical to continue in hire and develop talent and build capabilities to keep pace with these changes as well as to align our businesses and people in a manner that allows us to best service our clients.
Partnerships will also help to drive our success. Partnerships between our clients and agencies across our different types of agencies and partnerships with companies that complement our capabilities. From shopper marketing, to PR, to media to advertising to CRM, our agencies are increasingly working together seamlessly on behalf of our clients. They're also collaborating with tech companies, entertainment companies, fashion and design firms to create the innovative award-winning work that they are known for.
We believe we are the best-in-class in doing this and our 2015 performance demonstrated it. Omnicom continue to be an industry leader, strengthening our talent, embracing new technologies and collaborating to deliver outstanding creative work for our clients and our brands. I want to recognize and thank the 74,000 people at our agencies for their world-class integrated campaigns, outstanding new business wins and all the great work that made us to deliver these results. 
I will now turn it over to Phil for a closer look at the fourth quarter and the full year results. Phil?"

During 2015, our businesses continued to focus on meeting the needs of their clients and winning new business as well as enhancing efficiencies within their organizations to improve their operational profitability.
For the fourth quarter, our organic revenue growth of $200 million or 4.8% once again exceeded our expectations and capped the year where organic growth was 5.3%. 
The U.S. continued its strong performance to close out the year with Q4 organic growth of almost 4%, coming off a particularly difficult comp versus last year's Q4 where organic growth was 9%. 
Internationally, we again experienced solid growth in all of our regions, with strong country performance in the U.K. and Canada and across most of our major Asia-Pacific markets.
Continental Europe was positive, driven by Germany and Spain, while revenues in Netherlands and France declined. While we continue to have solid revenue growth overall, in the fourth quarter, exchange rates continued to create a considerable headwind on our international revenue as almost all foreign currencies again weakened versus the dollar in Q4. 
The negative FX impact of 5.6% in Q4 was somewhat lower as a percentage than the previous 3 quarters of 2015 as the declining currencies began in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Revenue for the quarter, after considering a small reduction in revenue from the impact of our dispositions net of acquisitions, was $4.15 billion, down 1% versus Q4 last year.  We'll go over our revenue growth in detail in a few minutes. 
Now we'll move to EBITDA and operating income. EBITDA for fourth quarter of 2015 decreased $5.4 million to $604 million versus $609 million in Q4 of last year. As we've discussed previously, the vast majority of our expenses are denominated in the same local currency as the revenue, which operationally serves as a natural hedge. However, in several of our higher margin markets including Australia, Canada and Brazil, FX had a relatively larger negative impact this quarter than in previous quarters this year.
However, through our ongoing initiatives to increase efficiencies throughout the organization, we've enhanced the flexibility in our cost structure. These efforts have allowed us to offset the FX headwinds on EBITA. As a result, the EBITA margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 14.5%, which was unchanged versus Q4 of last year. 
Operating income decreased by $3.9 million to $575.5 million for the quarter, which was also negatively impacted by FX. Operating margin of 13.9% was up slightly compared to 13.8% in Q4 of 2014.
Turning now to Page 2 of the presentation. Net interest expense for the quarter was $36.8 million, up $6.8 million versus the fourth quarter of 2014 and up $900,000 from the third quarter of this year. Versus Q4 of last year, the increase in net interest expense related to an increase in rates on our floating rate debt and determination in Q4 of the floating interest rate swaps on our 20 20 senior notes and a portion of the swaps on our 20 22 senior notes. This brought our ratio of fixed rate to floating rate debt from 50-50 to 60% fixed and 40% floating at year end. The gain that we realized on the termination of the swaps will be amortized over the life of the debt. The amortization of net gain in Q4 of 2015 was lower than the benefit recorded from the swaps in Q4 of 2014. Additionally, interest income on our cash balances held internationally decreased year-over-year by approximately $1.1 million due to negative FX. 
On a constant-currency basis, interest income was up slightly year-over-year.  And versus Q3 of 2015, the increase in net interest expense was the result of a decrease in the interest benefit from terminating our floating interest rate swaps in Q4, partially offset by an increase in interest income from our international treasury centers resulting from our higher-than-average cash balances in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter.
Our quarterly tax rate of 32.8% was in line with the full year tax rate of 2015 and consistent with our projections for the year.
Earnings from our affiliates of $2.2 million is down versus last year, which was related to a reduction in the contribution of certain international affiliates, primarily as a result of the negative impact of FX. 
On a constant-dollar basis, our earnings from affiliates was flat. The allocation of earnings for the minority shareholders in our less-than-fully-owned subsidiaries decreased nearly $11 million to $32.6 million. 
On negative FX was the primary reason for the decrease since a large number of our less-than-fully-owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S. The decrease was also due to the purchase at the end of the third quarter of one of our larger noncontrolling interests of one of our agencies in Latin America.
As a result, net income for the quarter was $332 million. That's up $2.1 million or a little less than 1% versus our Q4 results last year. 
Turning to Slide 3. The remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter, after allocation of $3.3 million of net income to participating securities, which for us was a dividend paying unvested restricted shares held by our employees, was 328.3 million, up slightly from last year. And our diluted share count for the quarter was 243.8 million, that's down 2.4% versus last year, which has been driven by our share buyback activity over the last 12 months. The resulting diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.35 per share, an increase of $0.05 or 3.8% versus Q4 of 2014.
On Slide 4 through 6, we've provided the summary PNO, EPS and other information for fiscal 2015. The brief highlights are as follows: our full year 2015 organic revenue growth was 5.3%, while the FX headwind decreased revenue by 6.6%. Net of the impact of this year's acquisitions and dispositions, which added $15 million, our total revenue was $15.1 billion, down 1.2% versus last year. And as was the case with our Q4 results, FX negatively impacted our full year EBITA and margins. EBITA decreased 1.1% to $2.03 billion and FX negatively impacted our margins by about 20 basis points for the year, with almost all of the impact coming in the second half of the year. As a result of our ongoing efficiency efforts, we were able to maintain our full year EBITA margin of 13.4%, consistent with last year.
Turning to taxes on Page 5, our effective tax rate for 2015 of 32.8% was in line with our expectations for the year. At this point, we expect our 2016 tax rate to be fairly consistent with the '15 rate. 
And on Page 6, you can see our 2015 diluted EPS was $4.41 per share, which was up $0.17 or 4% versus 2014's reported amount of $4.24 per share.
On Slide 7,  we turn the discussion of our revenue performance. First, as I mentioned, we saw a positive organic growth across all our regions this quarter. The fourth quarter's growth was driven by the performance of our traditional advertising and media disciplines, while our other disciplines had a mixed performance across the regions, which I will discuss later. 
FX continues to be a significant drag on our revenues. On a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter, once again, the U.S. dollar strengthened against every one of our major foreign currencies. This decrease to our revenue for the quarter by $236 million or 5.6%. 
While the decline in the value of the Euro accounted for over 1/3 of the overall FX production, we also saw a significant declines related to the Australian and Canadian dollars, the Brazilian real and the British pound as well as of the Russian ruble. As of the end of the fourth quarter, we've now seen 5 consecutive quarters of large negative movements in FX due to currencies weakening against the U.S. dollar. 
As we enter into 2016, based on our most recent projections and assuming currencies stay where they currently are, FX could negatively impact our revenues by approximately 3% during the first quarter of 2016 and 2% for the full year 2016.
Revenue from acquisitions net of dispositions slightly decreased revenue by $6 million. While we've added businesses, both domestically and internationally over the past year, we're continually evaluating our businesses and making strategic dispositions as deemed appropriate. 
And finally, organic growth was $200 million or 4.8% this quarter. We had another quarter with solid organic growth across all of our major regions, with the notable country exemptions being France and The Netherlands, which struggled in 2015, and Brazil, which continues to face an uncertain economic outlook.
Looking at our disciplines, our traditional media and advertising businesses led the way. The performance of the businesses in our CRM discipline was mixed, with our field marketing and events businesses having a challenging quarter. And although our specialty and public relations disciplines were down organically for the quarter, both of them faced a difficult comparatives to last year's Q4 performance when they each achieved organic growth in excess of 8%. Overall, our below line disciplines did not achieve as much of the year end client project spend that they did in Q4 of 2014.
On Slides 8 and 9, we present our quarterly regional mix of business. During the quarter, split of revenue was 59% from North America, 10% from the U.K., 17% for the rest of Europe, 11% for Asia-Pacific, with the remainder coming from our Latin America and our Africa and Middle East regions.
For the full year, the split was much the same as in the fourth quarter. 
In North America both the U.S. and Canada contributed to another solid performance, with organic revenue growth of 4.7% for the quarter and 5.4% for the full year.
Internationally, our U.K. agencies continued to perform well across our businesses. The rest of Europe was up 3.5% for the quarter and 3.7% for the year, led by Germany and Spain as well as Italy. France was still negative organically and The Netherlands continues to lag behind our other major markets in Europe. 
Asia-Pacific was up 8.6% in the quarter and 7.9% for the year, with the major markets again performing well, including China, South Korea, Thailand and Australia. With the exception being Hong Kong, which was up slightly in the quarter but down for the year.
In Latin America, our Brazilian agencies had a rather negative quarter in the face of uncertain economic conditions, but we had strong performance from our agencies elsewhere in the region, in particular, Mexico. This resulted in a slightly positive organic growth for the region in Q4, but the region as a whole was negative for the year. 
And finally, our Africa and Middle East region, although relatively small, was up 5% in the quarter, driven by a strong performance in South Africa and the region was up 6.8% for the year. 
Slide 10 shows our mix of business. For the quarter, they split 53% advertising services and 47% marketing services, with the full year split being similar. As for their performance, our advertising discipline was up 12.6% in the quarter and 9.3% for the year, driven by the outstanding performance of our media businesses across geographies. 
CRM was down 1.5% in Q4 and for the year, had positive growth of 1.9%. Our field marketing and events businesses had a challenging quarter. Most businesses in the category were up on a full year basis versus 2014 with the exceptions being field marketing and sales promotion, which were down for the year. 
PR was down 6.9% in the quarter and was our only discipline that was down a bit for the full year, was down by 1.4%. Fourth quarter decrease was due to difficult comp compare to Q4 of 2014 when the PR discipline posted growth of 8.5%. 
Specialty communications was down 5.9% in Q4, but up 2.2% for the year. The fourth quarter decrease was due to the difficult comp compared to Q4 of 2014 when the specialty discipline within the -- our full-service healthcare businesses posted growth of 9.4%. 
Overall, as I said previously, our below-the-line disciplines did not captures as much as year end client spend as they did in Q4 of 2014.
On Slide 11, we present our mix of business by industry sector. In comparing the full year revenue for 2015 to 2014, there was minimal change in the mix of our client revenue by industry.
Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 12. It 2015, we generated over $1.6 billion of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 13, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $497 million, up when compared to last year. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $129 million. Capital expenditures for the year were $203 million. Acquisitions, including earn out payments net of the proceeds received from the sale of investments totaled $150 million. And stock repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans, totaled $680 million. As a result, we outspent our free cash flow by just under $44 million for the year.
Turning to Slide 14. Focusing first on our capital structure, our total debt of about $4.6 billion is up about $20 million from this time last year. The increases, primarily due to the change in the fair value of our debts carrying value related to the in the money amount of our interest rate swaps at year-end 2015. 
Our net debt position at the end of the quarter improved to $1.95 billion compared to $2.16 billion at year end 2014. The decrease on our net debt of $209 million over the past 12 months is in period ends spot rates was driven partly by the positive contribution from operating capital of about $550 million, partially offset by the negative impact of FX translation on our cash balances over the last 12 months or approximately $265 million. And the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of $44 million as well as some other smaller items. 
As a result, our ratios were strong. Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.1x, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.9x, and our interest coverage ratio was 12.2x.
Turning to Slide 15. We continue to successfully manage and build the company through a combination of strategic acquisitions and well-focused internal development initiatives. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 21.5% and our return on equity increased to 41.3%.
And finally, on Slide 16, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders since 2004. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2004 through year end, which totaled $11.1 billion. And the bars show the cumulative return of cash or shareholders including both the dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $12 billion for a cumulative payout ratio of 108%. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we have included the number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. 
But at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you."

So when we take a look at organic growth based upon what we've seen, we think '16 can be very similar to what we've experienced in '15. And we've -- if we had to throw a number at it, we'd say 3% to 3.5% based on what we know now."

I think for us, we haven't seen a correlation between the discussions our agencies have been having with our clients with respect to what our clients' goals and strategies are in '16 and what their spend might be at correlation to what's going on in the financial markets. I think it seems John touched on more broadly as far as the global economic situation and some pockets of uncertainty. Those, we expect, will correlate a little more directly with what our clients ultimately decide to do from a spending perspective, less so what's going on specifically in the financial markets over the last month or so.

As far as the rest of our strategy, I think our perspective is going into '16 more of the same. To the extent we can find acquisitions that fits strategically, culturally and pricing makes sense, we're going to continue to look to do more acquisitions rather than less. We expect that activity will pick up. We closed the Grupo ABC deal in the first quarter of 2016, and we've got a pipeline that we continue to pursue.

And with digital being a very much -- an important component of what happens from a media perspective and also the utilization of data and analytics in making decisions because of all the channels that are out there.

It was really those capabilities and whether or not the service provider, in this case us, was the correct partner moving into this next period which is very, very -- it's interesting, it's exciting, it's changing very rapidly. And if you don't have the right capabilities, it's very difficult to catch up in a short period time. So that's what our clients, I believe, were looking at. I also believe that there probably some, especially on our wins to actually confirm that separately and independently in the press. So it's not -- it's a very strong feeling that I have. So I don't see pricing erosion and certainly not in 2015. My comments in my prepared remarks was such that we have not been informed or notified of any opportunities or risks other than a few minor accounts that are currently we review, and we're hopeful that we see a more normal year in '16 where there aren't as many large media accounts put up for consideration. But at this point, preparing for that would be foolish. We're much better off being prepared to face a similar type of level.

As you will hear this morning, it was an excellent quarter for Omnicom. We recruited some of the best talents in our industry, continued to win significant new business and made a couple of important agency acquisitions. It was a terrific way to end the year. 
Our financial performance was also solid. We posted organic revenue growth of 4.8% in the fourth quarter, resulting in 5.3% growth for the full year. We also achieved our margin and net income targets for the quarter and the full year despite significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar and its impact on revenue and EBIT. 
FX reduced our revenue in the fourth quarter by $236 million or 5.6%. For the year, currency impacts reduced our revenue by just over $1 billion. 
As we enter 2016, FX will continue to be a headwind on our revenue and earnings, but hopefully, at a less significant rate. Shub will provide more details about the impact of FX later in the call. 
Turning now to organic growth by region. North America increased by 4.7%, reflecting very strong performances in our brand advertising and media businesses. This was offset by a public relations and specialty disciplines, both of which had difficult comps versus prior year. 
In the fourth quarter of 2014, PR was up 9.9% and specialty was up 8.9%. The U.K. was up 4.9% in the quarter and ended the year up 7.1%. Overall, growth in our Euro region was 3.5%. 
In the Euro markets, Germany was in the mid-single digits and Spain and Italy also outperformed, while France and the Netherlands continued to weigh on the performance in the region. 
Outside the Euro countries, Russia, Sweden and Turkey had above average results.
Moving to Asia Pacific. Organic growth was 8.6%. We had solid growth across almost every market and double-digit growth in Australia, China, Indonesia, Korea, Thailand and Vietnam. 
Latin America was slightly positive for the quarter as strong performances in Mexico offset weaknesses in Brazil.
Looking at our bottom line, EPS for the quarter was $1.35, up 3.8% versus the prior year. For the year, EPS was up 4% to $4.41. Excluding the impact of currency, earnings per share would have been 8% higher for both the quarter and the year.
For 2015, we generated over $1.6 billion in free cash, an increase of 2% year-over-year and returned almost $1.2 billion to the shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Finally, our balance sheet and liquidity remained very strong.  
Overall, I'm very pleased with our performance for the quarter and the full year. 
Looking forward, the consistency and diversity of our operations and results, combined with our very strong liquidity and balance sheet, will allow us to capitalize on opportunities when they arise.
Turning now to some of the events of last year. As widely reported, 2015 had a significant number of media reviews. As I mentioned on previous calls, we were very selective in accepting only a handful of invitations to pursue new media business and declined a few others in order to stay focused on our existing clients. 
And as I'm sure you've seen, we ended the year winning most of Procter & Gamble's North America media planning and buying business, which was perhaps the most expensive and certainly the most closely-watched review of 2015. This win is a reflection of the talented people and the capabilities we have within Omnicom's media group and Annalect, our open source data and analytics platform. You've heard me talk about the investments we've made in this area and they're paying off for our clients and our business. 
We now have data and analytic experts, or marketing sciences as we call them, embedded in many of our account teams. Clients increasingly recognize this alignment leads to better data and reform strategies that are more effective in today's fluid and personalized marketing environment.
Overall, we're very pleased with our results on these media reviews for the year as we came out a net winner. 
An independent third party, Retna, recently reported that we ranked ahead of our main holding company competitors and that includes us passing on some of the pitches I mentioned earlier. Since year-end, Sony concluded its global review, OMD adding substantially to its Music business and entertainment business, by trading off some gaming businesses principally added to the U.K. 
Looking ahead, there are also a few midsized opportunities and risks that are more typical of a normal review year. Whether the pace of 2015 continues into 2016, it's too early to say, but we will not be surprised if the patterns continue.
At the same time, our media group is in the process of developing a third global brand in addition to our successful OMD and PHD brands. You can expect our media group to announce the official launch of this third media brand in the next few weeks. 
In the year ahead, they will be establishing network offices in key markets around the world, leveraging other in-country media assets. This will give us additional capacity to manage more client relationships as well as leverage the investments we've made in media capabilities across our businesses.
Turning to the topic of talent. We announced last quarter that Wendy Clark would become CEO of DDB North America. Wendy is highly respected in the marketing world and joined DDB from Coca-Cola, where she was the President for Sparkling Brands and Strategic Marketing. We're excited to have her part of the DDB and Omnicom team. 
We also had a number of other important recruits in the quarter from leading marketers. These senior talent additions are accustomed to Omnicom's ability to attract top people from iconic brands. 
I mentioned at the beginning of the call that we have made 2 important acquisitions in the fourth quarter, one in Latin America and one in the U.K. In November, DDB Worldwide announced the acquisition of Grupo ABC, the largest independent advertising and marketing communications group in Brazil. Grupo ABC has 2,000 people in 30 locations, with best-in-class advertising brands as well as offerings and public relations, CRM, digital, promotion and events. Their blue-chip client roster includes names like Procter & Gamble, J&J and Anheuser-Busch in that. We have known the cofounders of Grupo ABC since we invested in DDB's operation in Brazil in 1997, so I'm especially pleased to officially welcome them back to the Omnicom family. 
Importantly, ABC has outstanding creative talent that will strengthen our capabilities not only in Brazil, but also around the world. And despite its current economic challenges, we're fully committed to the Brazilian market as one of the largest for our services. 
The ABC acquisition closed at the end of January and Omnicom's 2016 results will include 11 months of their operations. 
In December, BBDO Worldwide acquired a majority stake in Wednesday Agency Group. With over 100 people in London and New York, Wednesday is the leading creative agency focused on fashion and luxury lifestyle brands, a specialized niche in our business. The firm is known for its creative excellence and passion, which makes it a great fit for BBDO. 
Grupo ABC and Wednesday are perfect examples of agencies founded by leading industry talent with strong creative cultures that also strengthen our geographic and service capability. 
Another barometer that we use to measure our success in cultivating the best talent is the performance of our work for clients in award shows. Once again, our agencies and networks continue their tradition of being the most creatively awarded companies in the world. Let me mention just a few just to highlight them. Omnicom's Sweat Campaign Magazine's prestigious 2015 Agency of the Year awards. BBDO was awarded Agency Network of the Year; PHD, Media Network of the Year; and Adam and Eve, DDB picked up Agency of the Year. BBDO topped the Gunn Report for the 10th year in a row. At the campaign, Asia Pacific Agency of the Year awards, TBWA and DDB won Creative Agencies of the Year in Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, Philippines and Indonesia. There are many others throughout our disciplines, and I want to congratulate all of our people and agencies for their outstanding work. 
Operationally, we continue to drive greater efficiencies throughout our business in 2015. We are constantly challenging our people to find ways to manage their costs agency by agency. And on a regional and global basis, we're leveraging our scale in areas, such as information technology, real estate, back office services and purchasing to deliver further cost improvements.
We believe that these and other initiatives will allow Omnicom to deliver a 30 basis point margin improvement for the full year of 2016 or 13.7% EBITA versus 13.4% for this past year. 
Before I hand the call over to Phil, I want to touch on the importance of innovation and collaboration in our business as we continue moving forward towards more interconnected activities. 
In January, I attended the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. I'm always amazed at the pace of technological change from virtual reality, which has now reached the tipping point, to the Internet of things, which is resulting in automation and interconnection of homes, cars and personal devices. Many of these innovations were still in the concept stage just a few years ago and are examples of technologies that will create new opportunities for marketers.
For Omnicom and our agencies, it is critical to continue and hire and develop talent and build capabilities to keep pace with these changes as well as to align our businesses and people in a manner that allows us to best service our clients.
Partnerships will also help drive our success. Partnerships between our clients and agencies across our different types of agencies and partnerships with companies that complement our capabilities. From shopper marketing, to PR, to media to advertising to CRM, our agencies are increasingly working together seamlessly on behalf of our clients. They're also collaborating with tech companies, entertainment companies, fashion and design firms to create the innovative award-winning work that they are known for.
We believe, we are the best in class in doing this and our 2015 performance demonstrated it. Omnicom continued to be an industry leader, strengthening our talent, embracing new technologies and collaborating to deliver outstanding creative work for our clients and their brands. I want to recognize and thank the 74,000 people at our agencies for their world-class integrated campaigns, outstanding new business wins and all the great work that made us to deliver these results. 
I will now turn it over to Phil for a closer look at the fourth quarter and the full year results. Phil?"

During 2015, our businesses continued to focus on meeting the needs of their clients and winning new business as well as enhancing efficiencies within their organizations to improve their operational profitability.
For the fourth quarter, our organic revenue growth of $200 million or 4.8% once again exceeded our expectations and capped the year, where organic growth was 5.3%. 
The U.S. continued its strong performance to close out the year with Q4 organic growth of almost 4%, coming off a particularly difficult comp versus last year's Q4 where our organic growth was 9%. 
Internationally, we again experienced solid growth in all of our regions, with strong country performance in the U.K. and Canada and across most of our major Asia Pacific markets.
Continental Europe was positive, driven by Germany and Spain, while revenues in Netherlands and France declined. While we continue to have solid organic revenue growth overall, in the fourth quarter, exchange rates continued to create a considerable headwind on our international revenue as almost all foreign currencies again weakened versus the dollar in Q4. 
The negative FX impact of 5.6% in Q4 was somewhat lower as a percentage than the previous 3 quarters of 2015 as the decline in currencies began in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Revenue for the quarter, after considering a small reduction in revenue from the impact of our dispositions net of acquisitions, was $4.15 billion, down 1% versus Q4 last year.  We'll go over our revenue growth in detail in a few minutes. 
Now we'll move to EBITA and operating income. EBITA for fourth quarter of 2015 decreased $5.4 million to $604 million versus $609 million in Q4 of last year. As we've discussed previously, the vast majority of our expenses are denominated in the same local currency as their revenue, which operationally serves as a natural hedge. However, in several of our higher-margin markets, including Australia, Canada and Brazil, FX had a relatively larger negative impact this quarter than in previous quarters this year.
However, through our ongoing initiatives to increase efficiencies throughout the organization, we've enhanced the flexibility in our cost structure. These efforts have allowed us to offset the FX headwinds on EBITA. As a result, the EBITA margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 14.5%, which was unchanged versus Q4 of last year. 
Operating income decreased by $3.9 million to $575.5 million for the quarter, which was also negatively impacted by FX. Operating margin of 13.9% was up slightly compared to 13.8% in Q4 of 2014.
Turning now to Page 2 of the presentation. Net interest expense for the quarter was $36.8 million, up $6.8 million versus the fourth quarter of 2014 and up $900,000 from the third quarter of this year. Versus Q4 of last year, the increase in net interest expense related to an increase in rates on our floating rate debt and the termination in Q4 of the floating interest rate swaps on our 2020 senior notes and a portion of the swaps on our 2022 senior notes. This brought our ratio of fixed rate to floating rate debt from 50-50 to 60% fixed and 40% floating at year-end. The gain that we realized on the termination of the swaps will be amortized over the life of the debt. The amortization of that gain in Q4 of 2015 was lower than the benefit recorded from the swaps in Q4 of 2014. Additionally, interest income on our cash balances held internationally, decreased year-over-year by approximately $1.1 million due to negative FX. 
On a constant-currency basis, interest income was up slightly year-over-year. And versus Q3 of 2015, the increase in net interest expense was the result of a decrease in the interest benefit from terminating our floating interest rate swaps in Q4, partially offset by an increase in interest income from our international treasury centers, resulting from our higher-than-average cash balances in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter.
Our quarterly tax rate of 32.8% was in line with the full year tax rate of 2015 and consistent with our projections for the year.
Earnings from our affiliates of $2.2 million is down versus last year, which was related to a reduction in the contribution of certain international affiliates, primarily as a result of the negative impact of FX. 
On a constant-dollar basis, our earnings from affiliates was flat. The allocation of earnings for the minority shareholders and our less-than-fully-owned subsidiaries decreased nearly $11 million to $32.6 million. 
Well, negative FX was the primary reason for the decrease since a large number of our less-than-fully-owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S. The decrease was also due to the purchase at the end of the third quarter of one of our larger noncontrolling interests of one of our agencies in Latin America.
As a result, net income for the quarter was $332 million. That's up $2.1 million or a little less than 1% versus our Q4 results last year. 
Turning to Slide 3, the remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter, after allocation of $3.3 million of net income to participating securities, which for us was a dividend paying unvested restricted shares held by our employees, was 328.3 million, up slightly from last year. And our diluted share count for the quarter was 243.8 million. That's down 2.4% versus last year, which has been driven by our share buyback activity over the last 12 months. The resulting diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.35 per share, an increase of $0.05 or 3.8% versus Q4 of 2014.
On Slides 4 through 6, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information for fiscal 2015. The brief highlights are as follows: our full year 2015 organic revenue growth was 5.3%, while the FX headwind decreased revenue by 6.6%. Net of the impact of this year's acquisitions and dispositions, which added $15 million, our total revenue was $15.1 billion, down 1.2% versus last year. And as was the case with our Q4 results, FX negatively impacted our full year EBITA and margins. EBITA decreased 1.1% to $2.03 billion and FX negatively impacted our margins by about 20 basis points for the year, with almost all of the impact coming in the second half of the year. As a result of our ongoing efficiency efforts, we were able to maintain our full year EBITA margin of 13.4%, consistent with last year.
Turning to taxes on Page 5, our effective tax rate for 2015 of 32.8% was in line with our expectations for the year. At this point, we expect our 2016 tax rate to be fairly consistent with the '15 rate. 
And on Page 6, you can see our 2015 diluted EPS was $4.41 per share, which is up $0.17 or 4% versus 2014's reported amount of $4.24 per share.
On Slide 7,  we turn to the discussion of our revenue performance. First, as I mentioned, we saw a positive organic growth across all our regions this quarter. The fourth quarter's growth was driven by the performance of our traditional advertising and media disciplines, while our other disciplines had a mixed performance across the regions, which I will discuss later. 
FX continues to be a significant drag on our revenues. On a year-over-year basis, in the fourth quarter, once again, the U.S. dollar strengthened against every one of our major foreign currencies. This decreased our revenue for the quarter by $236 million or 5.6%. 
While the decline in the value of the euro accounted for over 1/3 of the overall FX reduction, we also saw significant declines related to the Australian and Canadian dollars, the Brazilian real and the British pound as well as the Russian ruble. As of the end of the fourth quarter, we've now seen 5 consecutive quarters of large negative movements in FX due to currencies weakening against the U.S. dollar. 
As we enter into 2016, based on our most recent projections and assuming currencies stay where they currently are, FX could negatively impact our revenues by approximately 3% during the first quarter of 2016 and 2% for the full year 2016.
Revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, slightly decreased revenue by $6 million. While we've added businesses, both domestically and internationally over the past year, we're continually evaluating our businesses and making strategic dispositions as deemed appropriate. 
And finally, organic growth was $200 million or 4.8% this quarter. We had another quarter with solid organic growth across all of our major regions, with the notable country exemptions being France and the Netherlands, which struggled in 2015, and Brazil, which continues to face an uncertain economic outlook.
Looking at our disciplines, our traditional media and advertising businesses led the way. The performance of the businesses in our CRM discipline was mixed, with our field marketing and events businesses having a challenging quarter. And although our specialty and public relations disciplines were down organically for the quarter, both of them faced difficult comparatives to last year's Q4 performance, when they each achieved organic growth in excess of 8%. Overall, our below line discipline did not achieve as much of the year-end client project spend that they did in Q4 of 2014.
On Slides 8 and 9, we present our quarterly regional mix of business. During the quarter, split of revenue was 59% from North America, 10% from the U.K., 17% for the rest of Europe, 11% for Asia Pacific, with the remainder coming from our Latin America and our Africa and Middle East regions.
For the full year, the split was much the same as in the fourth quarter. 
In North America, both the U.S. and Canada contributed to another solid performance, with organic revenue growth of 4.7% for the quarter and 5.4% for the full year.
Internationally, our U.K. agencies continued to perform well across our businesses. The rest of Europe was up 3.5% for the quarter and 3.7% for the year, led by Germany and Spain as well as Italy. France was still negative organically and Netherlands continues to lag behind our other major markets in Europe. 
Asia Pacific was up 8.6% in the quarter and 7.9% for the year, with the major markets again performing well, including China, South Korea, Thailand and Australia. With the exception being Hong Kong, which was up slightly in the quarter but down for the year.
In Latin America, our Brazilian agencies had another negative quarter in the face of uncertain economic conditions, but we had strong performance from our agencies elsewhere in the region, in particular, Mexico. This resulted in a slightly positive organic growth for the region in Q4, but the region as a whole was negative for the year. 
And finally, our Africa, Middle East region, although relatively small, was up 5% in the quarter, driven by a strong performance in South Africa and the region was up 6.8% for the year. 
Slide 10 shows our mix of business. For the quarter, they split 53% advertising services and 47% marketing services, with the full year split being similar. As for their performance, our advertising discipline was up 12.6% in the quarter and 9.3% for the year, driven by the outstanding performance of our media businesses across geographies. 
CRM was down 1.5% in Q4 and for the year, had positive growth of 1.9%. Our field marketing and events businesses had a challenging quarter. Most businesses in the category were up on a full year basis versus 2014, with the exceptions being field marketing and sales promotion, which were down for the year. 
PR was down 6.9% in the quarter and was our only discipline that was down a bit for the full year, was down by 1.4%. Fourth quarter decrease was due to difficult comp compared to Q4 of 2014 when the PR discipline posted growth of 8.5%. 
Specialty communications was down 5.9% in Q4, but up 2.2% for the year. The fourth quarter decrease was due to a difficult comp compared to Q4 of 2014 when the specialty discipline driven by our full service health care businesses posted growth of 9.4%. 
Overall, as I said previously, our below-the-line disciplines did not capture as much year-end client spend as they did in Q4 of 2014.
On Slide 11, we present our mix of business by industry sector. In comparing the full year revenue for 2015 to 2014, there was minimal change in the mix of our client revenue by industry.
Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 12. In 2015, we generated over $1.6 billion of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 13, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $497 million, up when compared to last year. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $129 million. Capital expenditures for the year were $203 million. Acquisitions, including earnout payments net of the proceeds received from the sale of investments totaled $150 million. And stock repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plan, totaled $680 million. As a result, we outspent our free cash flow by just under $44 million for the year.
Turning to Slide 14. Focusing first on our capital structure, our total debt of about $4.6 billion is up about $20 million from this time last year. The increase is primarily due to the change in the fair value of our debt's carrying value related to the in-the-money amount of our interest rate swaps at year-end 2015. 
Our net debt position at the end of the quarter improved to $1.95 billion compared to $2.16 billion at year-end 2014. The decrease in our net debt of $209 million over the past 12 months using period-end spot rates was driven primarily by the positive contribution from operating capital of about $550 million, partially offset by the negative impact of FX translation on our cash balances over the last 12 months or approximately $265 million. And the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of $44 million as well as some other smaller items. 
As a result, our ratios were strong. Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.1x. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.9x, and our interest coverage ratio was 12.2x.
Turning to Slide 15. We continue to successfully manage and build the company through a combination of strategic acquisitions and well-focused internal development initiatives. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 21.5% and our return on equity increased to 41.3%.
And finally, on Slide 16, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders since 2004. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2004 through year-end, which totaled $11.1 billion. And the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $12 billion for a cumulative payout ratio of 108%. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we've included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. 
But at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you."

So -- and unlike most of the advertising and media assignments we have, they tend to be projects. They tend to be projects with existing clients who repeat at a certain amount of spending every single year, but it's not as precise and it's not as predictable. So this year, we were particularly happy with our health care companies and the growth that they achieved, but also the business that they've won were particularly critical in a very positive way. Some of our PR operations, some of -- we advanced a lot further than others, and we've been spending the last several months getting everybody up to par. So there's no easy answer.

I think for us, we haven't seen a correlation between the discussions our agencies have been having with their clients with respect to what our clients' goals and strategies are in '16 and what their spending might be at correlation to what's going on in the financial markets. I think it seems John touched on more broadly as far as the global economic situation and some pockets of uncertainty. Those, we expect, will correlate a little more directly with what our clients ultimately decide to do from a spending perspective, less so what's going on specifically in the financial markets over the last month or so. And I think time will tell whether the current volatility is a forecast of something that's going to impact the economy more broadly."

As far as the rest of our strategy, yes, I think our perspective is going into '16 more of the same. To the extent we can find acquisitions that fits strategically, culturally and pricing makes sense. We're going to continue to look to do more acquisitions rather than less. We expect that activity will pick up. We closed the Grupo ABC deal in the first quarter of 2016, and we've got a pipeline that we continue to pursue. To the extent deals happen, we'll have less free cash to use to buy back shares. To the extent the deals don't happen, we'll continue to deploy the cash through share buybacks as we have pretty consistently."

It was really those capabilities and whether or not the service provider, in this case us, was the correct partner moving into this next period which is very, very -- it's interesting, it's exciting, it's changing very rapidly. And if you don't have the right capabilities, it's very difficult to catch up in a short period time. So that's what our clients, I believe, we're looking at. I also believe that there are probably some, especially on our wins who actually confirm that separately and independently in the press. So it's not -- it's a very strong feeling that I have. So I don't see pricing erosion and certainly not 2015. My comments in my prepared remarks were such that we have not been informed or notified of any opportunities or risks other than a few minor accounts that are -- currently, we review, and we're hopeful that we see a more normal year in '16 where there aren't as many large media accounts put up for consideration. But at this point, preparing for that would be foolish. We're much better off being prepared to face a similar type of level.

Certainly, we're focused on real estate, technology, back-office administrative costs and a few other areas. I think John's right. They do take a while to get started, but the goal for us is to make sure that the efficiencies that we implement are sustainable and that's what we've been pursuing for the last while here. We're going to continue to pursue it in the future. And although we think, we're pretty efficient in all of our operations overall, we know we're going to continue to try and improve in the area of efficiency and effectiveness as it relates to the cost base. And that's certainly the plan. On the FX front, just to echo what John said, a typical year for us, we would expect, is plus or minus 1% or 2% in terms of FX impact. And if things continue in that zone, we're certainly comfortable with our current expectations. If things go back beyond that to where we were this year, although it depends on where the FX negatives occur, I think we reevaluated as the changes occur."

As you will hear this morning, it was an excellent quarter for Omnicom. We recruited some of the best talent in our industry, continued to win significant new business and made a couple of important agency acquisitions. It was a terrific way to end the year. 
Our financial performance was also solid. We posted organic revenue growth of 4.8% in the fourth quarter, resulting in 5.3% growth for the full year. We also achieved our margin and net income targets for the quarter and the full year despite significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar and its impact on revenue and EBIT. 
FX reduced our revenue in the fourth quarter by $236 million or 5.6%. For the year, currency impacts reduced our revenue by just over $1 billion. 
As we enter 2016, FX will continue to be a headwind on our revenue and earnings, but hopefully, at a less significant rate. Phil will provide more details about the impact of FX later in the call. 
Turning now to organic growth by region. North America increased by 4.7%, reflecting very strong performances in our brand advertising and media businesses. This was offset by our public relations and specialty disciplines, both of which had difficult comps versus prior year. 
In the fourth quarter of 2014, PR was up 9.9% and specialty was up 8.9%. The U.K. was up 4.9% in the quarter and ended the year up 7.1%. Overall, growth in our Euro region was 3.5%. 
In the Euro markets, Germany was in the mid-single digits and Spain and Italy also outperformed, while France and the Netherlands continued to weigh on the performance in the region. 
Outside the Euro countries, Russia, Sweden and Turkey had above average results.
Moving to Asia Pacific. Organic growth was 8.6%. We had solid growth across almost every market and double-digit growth in Australia, China, Indonesia, Korea, Thailand and Vietnam. 
Latin America was slightly positive for the quarter as strong performances in Mexico offset weaknesses in Brazil.
Looking at our bottom line, EPS for the quarter was $1.35, up 3.8% versus the prior year. For the year, EPS was up 4% to $4.41. Excluding the impact of currency, earnings per share would have been 8% higher for both the quarter and the year.
For 2015, we generated over $1.6 billion in free cash, an increase of 2% year-over-year and returned almost $1.2 billion to the shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Finally, our balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong.  
Overall, I'm very pleased with our performance for the quarter and the full year. 
Looking forward, the consistency and diversity of our operations and results, combined with our very strong liquidity and balance sheet, will allow us to capitalize on opportunities when they arise.
Turning now to some of the events of last year. As widely reported, 2015 had a significant number of media reviews. As I mentioned on previous calls, we were very selective in accepting only a handful of invitations to pursue new media business and declined a few others in order to stay focused on our existing clients. 
And as I'm sure you've seen, we ended the year winning most of Procter & Gamble's North America media planning and buying business, which was perhaps the most extensive and certainly the most closely-watched review of 2015. This win is a reflection of the talented people and the capabilities we have within Omnicom's media group and Annalect, our open source data and analytics platform. You've heard me talk about the investments we've made in this area and they're paying off for our clients and our business. 
We now have data and analytic experts, or marketing sciences as we call them, embedded in many of our account teams. Clients increasingly recognize this alignment leads to better data-informed strategies that are more effective in today's fluid and personalized marketing environment.
Overall, we're very pleased with our results on these media reviews for the year as we came out a net winner. 
An independent third party, Retna, recently reported that we ranked ahead of our main holding company competitors and that includes us passing on some of the pitches I mentioned earlier. Since year-end, Sony concluded its global review, OMD adding substantially to its music business and entertainment business, while trading off some gaming businesses principally out of the U.K. 
Looking ahead, there are also a few midsized opportunities and risks that are more typical of a normal review year. Whether the pace of 2015 continues into 2016, it's too early to say, but we will not be surprised if the patterns continue.
At the same time, our media group is in the process of developing a third global brand in addition to our successful OMD and PHD brands. You can expect our media group to announce the official launch of this third media brand in the next few weeks. 
In the year ahead, they will be establishing network offices in key markets around the world, leveraging other in-country media assets. This will give us additional capacity to manage more client relationships as well as leverage the investments we've made in media capabilities across our businesses.
Turning to the topic of talent. We announced last quarter that Wendy Clark would become CEO of DDB North America. Wendy is highly respected in the marketing world and joins DDB from Coca-Cola, where she was the President for Sparkling Brands and Strategic Marketing. We're excited to have her part of the DDB and Omnicom team. 
We also had a number of other important recruits in the quarter from leading marketers. These senior talent additions are a testament to Omnicom's ability to attract top people from iconic brands. 
I mentioned at the beginning of the call that we had made 2 important acquisitions in the fourth quarter, one in Latin America and one in the U.K. In November, DDB Worldwide announced the acquisition of Grupo ABC, the largest independent advertising and marketing communications group in Brazil. Grupo ABC has 2,000 people in 30 locations, with best-in-class advertising brands as well as offerings in public relations, CRM, digital, promotion and events. Their blue-chip client roster includes names like Procter & Gamble, J&J and Anheuser-Busch InBev. We have known the cofounders of Grupo ABC since we invested in DDB's operation in Brazil in 1997, so I'm especially pleased to officially welcome them back to the Omnicom family. 
Importantly, ABC has outstanding creative talent that will strengthen our capabilities not only in Brazil, but also around the world. And despite its current economic challenges, we're fully committed to the Brazilian market as one of the largest for our services. 
The ABC acquisition closed at the end of January and Omnicom's 2016 results will include 11 months of their operations. 
In December, BBDO Worldwide acquired a majority stake in Wednesday Agency Group. With over 100 people in London and New York, Wednesday is a leading creative agency focused on fashion and luxury lifestyle brands, a specialized niche in our business. The firm is known for its creative excellence and passion, which makes it a great fit for BBDO. 
Grupo ABC and Wednesday are perfect examples of agencies founded by leading industry talent with strong creative cultures that also strengthen our geographic and service capability. 
Another barometer that we use to measure our success in cultivating the best talent is the performance of our work for clients in award shows. Once again, our agencies and networks continue their tradition of being the most creatively awarded companies in the world. Let me mention just a few just to highlight them. Omnicom swept Campaign Magazine's prestigious 2015 Agency of the Year awards. BBDO was awarded Agency Network of the Year; PHD, Media Network of the Year; and Adam and Eve, DDB picked up Agency of the Year. BBDO topped the Gunn Report for the 10th year in a row. At the Campaign Asia-Pacific Agency of the Year awards, TBWA and DDB won Creative Agencies of the Year in Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, Philippines and Indonesia. There are many others throughout our disciplines, and I want to congratulate all of our people and agencies for their outstanding work. 
Operationally, we continue to drive greater efficiencies throughout our business in 2015. We are constantly challenging our people to find ways to manage their costs agency by agency. And on a regional and global basis, we're leveraging our scale in areas such as information technology, real estate, back office services and purchasing to deliver further cost improvements.
We believe that these and other initiatives will allow Omnicom to deliver a 30 basis point margin improvement for the full year 2016 or 13.7% EBITA versus 13.4% for this past year. 
Before I hand the call over to Phil, I want to touch on the importance of innovation and collaboration in our business as we continue moving forward towards more interconnected activities. 
In January, I attended the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. I'm always amazed at the pace of technological change from virtual reality, which has now reached the tipping point, to the Internet of Things, which is resulting in automation and interconnection of homes, cars and personal devices. Many of these innovations were still in the concept stage just a few years ago and are examples of technologies that will create new opportunities for marketers.
For Omnicom and our agencies, it is critical to continue and hire and develop talent and build capabilities to keep pace with these changes as well as to align our businesses and people in a manner that allows us to best service our clients.
Partnerships will also help drive our success. Partnerships between our clients and agencies across our different types of agencies and partnerships with companies that complement our capabilities. From shopper marketing, to PR, to media to advertising to CRM, our agencies are increasingly working together seamlessly on behalf of our clients. They're also collaborating with tech companies, entertainment companies, fashion and design firms to create the innovative award-winning work that they are known for.
We believe we are the best in class in doing this, and our 2015 performance demonstrated it. Omnicom continued to be an industry leader, strengthening our talent, embracing new technologies and collaborating to deliver outstanding creative work for our clients and their brands. I want to recognize and thank the 74,000 people at our agencies for their world-class integrated campaigns, outstanding new business wins and all the great work that enable us to deliver these results. 
I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the fourth quarter and the full year results. Phil?"

During 2015, our businesses continued to focus on meeting the needs of their clients and winning new business as well as enhancing efficiencies within their organizations to improve their operational profitability.
For the fourth quarter, our organic revenue growth of $200 million or 4.8% once again exceeded our expectations and capped a year where organic growth was 5.3%. 
The U.S. continued its strong performance to close out the year with Q4 organic growth of almost 4%, coming off a particularly difficult comp versus last year's Q4 where our organic growth was 9%. 
Internationally, we again experienced solid growth in all of our regions, with strong country performance in the U.K. and Canada and across most of our major Asia Pacific markets.
Continental Europe was positive, driven by Germany and Spain, while revenues in The Netherlands and France declined. While we continue to have solid organic revenue growth overall, in the fourth quarter, exchange rates continued to create a considerable headwind on our international revenue as almost all foreign currencies again weakened versus the dollar in Q4. 
The negative FX impact of 5.6% in Q4 was somewhat lower as a percentage than the previous 3 quarters of 2015 as the decline in currencies began in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Revenue for the quarter, after considering a small reduction in revenue from the impact of our dispositions net of acquisitions, was $4.15 billion, down 1% versus Q4 last year. We'll go over our revenue growth in detail in a few minutes. 
Now we'll move to EBITA and operating income. EBITA for fourth quarter of 2015 decreased $5.4 million to $604 million versus $609 million in Q4 of last year. As we've discussed previously, the vast majority of our expenses are denominated in the same local currency as their revenue, which operationally serves as a natural hedge. However, in several of our higher-margin markets, including Australia, Canada and Brazil, FX had a relatively larger negative impact this quarter than in previous quarters this year.
However, through our ongoing initiatives to increase efficiencies throughout the organization, we've enhanced the flexibility in our cost structure. These efforts have allowed us to offset the FX headwinds on EBITA. As a result, the EBITA margin for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 14.5%, which was unchanged versus Q4 of last year. 
Operating income decreased by $3.9 million to $575.5 million for the quarter, which was also negatively impacted by FX. Operating margin of 13.9% was up slightly compared to 13.8% in Q4 of 2014.
Turning now to Page 2 of the presentation. Net interest expense for the quarter was $36.8 million, up $6.8 million versus the fourth quarter of 2014 and up $900,000 from the third quarter of this year. Versus Q4 of last year, the increase in net interest expense related to an increase in rates on our floating rate debt and the termination in Q4 of the floating interest rate swaps on our 2020 senior notes and a portion of the swaps on our 2022 senior notes. This brought our ratio of fixed rate to floating rate debt from 50-50 to 60% fixed and 40% floating at year-end. The gain that we realized on the termination of the swaps will be amortized over the life of the debt. The amortization of that gain in Q4 of 2015 was lower than the benefit recorded from the swaps in Q4 of 2014. Additionally, interest income on our cash balances held internationally decreased year-over-year by approximately $1.1 million due to negative FX. 
On a constant-currency basis, interest income was up slightly year-over-year. And versus Q3 of 2015, the increase in net interest expense was the result of a decrease in the interest benefit from terminating our floating interest rate swaps in Q4, partially offset by an increase in interest income from our international treasury centers, resulting from our higher-than-average cash balances in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter.
Our quarterly tax rate of 32.8% was in line with the full year tax rate of 2015 and consistent with our projections for the year.
Earnings from our affiliates of $2.2 million is down versus last year, which was related to a reduction in the contribution of certain international affiliates, primarily as a result of the negative impact of FX. 
On a constant-dollar basis, our earnings from affiliates was flat. The allocation of earnings for the minority shareholders in our less-than-fully-owned subsidiaries decreased nearly $11 million to $32.6 million. 
While negative FX was the primary reason for the decrease, since a large number of our less-than-fully-owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S., the decrease was also due to the purchase at the end of the third quarter of one of our larger noncontrolling interests of one of our agencies in Latin America.
As a result, net income for the quarter was $332 million. That's up $2.1 million or a little less than 1% versus our Q4 results last year. 
Turning to Slide 3, the remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter, after allocation of $3.3 million of net income to participating securities, which for us for a dividend paying unvested restricted shares held by our employees was $328.3 million, up slightly from last year. And our diluted share count for the quarter was 243.8 million. That's down 2.4% versus last year, which has been driven by our share buyback activity over the last 12 months. The resulting diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.35 per share, an increase of $0.05 or 3.8% versus Q4 of 2014.
On Slides 4 through 6, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information for fiscal 2015. The brief highlights are as follows: our full year 2015 organic revenue growth was 5.3%, while the FX headwind decreased revenue by 6.6%. Net of the impact of this year's acquisitions and dispositions, which added $15 million, our total revenue was $15.1 billion, down 1.2% versus last year. And as was the case with our Q4 results, FX negatively impacted our full year EBITA and margins. EBITA decreased 1.1% to $2.03 billion and FX negatively impacted our margins by about 20 basis points for the year, with almost all of the impact coming in the second half of the year. As a result of our ongoing efficiency efforts, we were able to maintain our full year EBITA margin of 13.4%, consistent with last year.
Turning to taxes on Page 5, our effective tax rate for 2015 of 32.8% was in line with our expectations for the year. At this point, we expect our 2016 tax rate to be fairly consistent with the '15 rate. 
And on Page 6, you can see our 2015 diluted EPS was $4.41 per share, which is up $0.17 or 4% versus 2014's reported amount of $4.24 per share.
On Slide 7, we turn to the discussion of our revenue performance. First, as I mentioned, we saw positive organic growth across all our regions this quarter. The fourth quarter's growth was driven by the performance of our traditional advertising and media disciplines, while our other disciplines had a mixed performance across the regions, which I will discuss later. 
FX continues to be a significant drag on our revenues. On a year-over-year basis, in the fourth quarter, once again, the U.S. dollar strengthened against every one of our major foreign currencies. This decreased our revenue for the quarter by $236 million or 5.6%. 
While the decline in the value of the euro accounted for over 1/3 of the overall FX reduction, we also saw significant declines related to the Australian and Canadian dollars, the Brazilian real and the British pound as well as the Russian ruble. As of the end of the fourth quarter, we've now seen 5 consecutive quarters of large negative movements in FX due to currencies weakening against the U.S. dollar. 
As we enter into 2016, based on our most recent projections and assuming currencies stay where they currently are, FX could negatively impact our revenues by approximately 3% during the first quarter of 2016 and 2% for the full year 2016.
Revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, slightly decreased revenue by $6 million. While we've added businesses both domestically and internationally over the past year, we're continually evaluating our businesses and making strategic dispositions as deemed appropriate. 
And finally, organic growth was $200 million or 4.8% this quarter. We had another quarter with solid organic growth across all of our major regions, with the notable country exemptions being France and the Netherlands, which struggled in 2015, and Brazil, which continues to face an uncertain economic outlook.
Looking at our disciplines, our traditional media and advertising businesses led the way. The performance of the businesses in our CRM discipline was mixed, with our field marketing and events businesses having a challenging quarter. And although our specialty and public relations disciplines were down organically for the quarter, both of them faced difficult comparatives to last year's Q4 performance when they each achieved organic growth in excess of 8%. Overall, our below-the-line discipline did not achieve as much of the year-end client project spend that they did in Q4 of 2014.
On Slides 8 and 9, we present our quarterly regional mix of business. During the quarter, split of revenue was 59% from North America, 10% from the U.K., 17% for the rest of Europe, 11% for Asia Pacific, with the remainder coming from our Latin America and our Africa and Middle East regions.
For the full year, the split was much the same as in the fourth quarter. 
In North America, both the U.S. and Canada contributed to another solid performance, with organic revenue growth of 4.7% for the quarter and 5.4% for the full year.
Internationally, our U.K. agencies continued to perform well across our businesses. The rest of Europe was up 3.5% for the quarter and 3.7% for the year, led by Germany and Spain as well as Italy. France was still negative organically and Netherlands continues to lag behind our other major markets in Europe. 
Asia Pacific was up 8.6% in the quarter and 7.9% for the year, with the major markets again performing well, including China, South Korea, Thailand and Australia. With the exception being Hong Kong, which was up slightly in the quarter but down for the year.
In Latin America, our Brazilian agencies had another negative quarter in the face of uncertain economic conditions, but we had strong performance from our agencies elsewhere in the region, in particular, Mexico. This resulted in a slightly positive organic growth for the region in Q4, but the region as a whole was negative for the year. 
And finally, our Africa/Middle East region, although relatively small, was up 5% in the quarter driven by a strong performance in South Africa, and the region was up 6.8% for the year. 
Slide 10 shows our mix of business. For the quarter, they split 53% advertising services and 47% marketing services, with the full year split being similar. As for their performance, our advertising discipline was up 12.6% in the quarter and 9.3% for the year, driven by the outstanding performance of our media businesses across geographies. 
CRM was down 1.5% in Q4 and for the year had positive growth of 1.9%. Our field marketing and events businesses had a challenging quarter. Most businesses in the category were up on a full year basis versus 2014, with the exceptions being field marketing and sales promotion, which were down for the year. 
PR was down 6.9% in the quarter and was our only discipline that was down a bit for the full year. It was down by 1.4%. The fourth quarter decrease was due to a difficult comp compared to Q4 of 2014 when the PR discipline posted growth of 8.5%. 
Specialty communications was down 5.9% in Q4, but up 2.2% for the year. The fourth quarter decrease was due to a difficult comp compared to Q4 of 2014 when the specialty discipline driven by our full service health care businesses posted growth of 9.4%. 
Overall, as I said previously, our below-the-line disciplines did not capture as much year-end client spend as they did in Q4 of 2014.
On Slide 11, we present our mix of business by industry sector. In comparing the full year revenue for 2015 to 2014, there was minimal change in the mix of our client revenue by industry.
Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 12. In 2015, we generated over $1.6 billion of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 13, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $497 million, up when compared to last year. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $129 million. Capital expenditures for the year were $203 million. Acquisitions, including earnout payments net of the proceeds received from the sale of investments totaled $150 million. And stock repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans, totaled $680 million. As a result, we outspent our free cash flow by just under $44 million for the year.
Turning to Slide 14. Focusing first on our capital structure, our total debt of about $4.6 billion is up about $20 million from this time last year. The increase is primarily due to the change in the fair value of our debt's carrying value related to the in-the-money amount of our interest rate swaps at year-end 2015. 
Our net debt position at the end of the quarter improved to $1.95 billion compared to $2.16 billion at year-end 2014. The decrease in our net debt of $209 million over the past 12 months using period-end spot rates was driven primarily by the positive contribution from operating capital of about $550 million, partially offset by the negative impact of FX translation on our cash balances over the last 12 months of approximately $265 million. And the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of $44 million as well as some other smaller items. 
As a result, our ratios were strong. Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.1x. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.9x, and our interest coverage ratio was 12.2x.
Turning to Slide 15. We continue to successfully manage and build the company through a combination of strategic acquisitions and well-focused internal development initiatives. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 21.5% and our return on equity increased to 41.3%.
And finally, on Slide 16, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders since 2004. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2004 through year-end, which totaled $11.1 billion. And the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $12 billion for a cumulative payout ratio of 108%. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we've included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. 
But at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you."

So -- and unlike most of the advertising and media assignments we have, they tend to be projects. They tend to be projects with existing clients who repeat at a certain amount of spending every single year, but it's not as precise and it's not as predictable. So this year, we were particularly happy with our health care companies and the growth that they achieved, but also the business that they've won were particularly critical in a very positive way. Some of our PR operations, some of them have advanced a lot further than others, and we've been spending the last several months getting everybody up to par. So there's no easy answer.

So when we take a look at organic growth based upon what we've seen, we think '16 can be very similar to what we experienced in '15.

I think for us, we haven't seen a correlation between the discussions our agencies have been having with their clients with respect to what our clients' goals and strategies are in '16 and what their spending might be at correlation to what's going on in the financial markets. I think the themes John touched on more broadly as far as the global economic situation and some pockets of uncertainty. Those, we expect, will correlate a little more directly with what our clients ultimately decide to do from a spending perspective, less so what's going on specifically in the financial markets over the last month or so. And I think time will tell whether the current volatility is a forecast of something that's going to impact the economy more broadly."

As far as the rest of our strategy I think our perspective is: going into '16 more, of the same. To the extent we can find acquisitions that fit strategically, culturally and pricing makes sense, we're going to continue to look to do more acquisitions rather than less. We expect that activity will pick up. We closed the Grupo ABC deal in the first quarter of 2016, and we've got a pipeline that we continue to pursue. To the extent the deals happen, we'll have less free cash to use to buy back shares. To the extent the deals don't happen, we'll continue to deploy the cash through share buybacks as we have pretty consistently."

Julien. Our experience was that it's a new environment. And with digital being a very much -- an important component of what happens from a media perspective and also the utilization of data and analytics in making decisions because of all the channels that are out there. So I'd say on balance, on the -- in the reviews we participated in, pricing was not primary. It was really those capabilities and whether or not the service provider, in this case us, was the correct partner moving into this next period which is very, very -- it's interesting, it's exciting, it's changing very rapidly. And if you don't have the right capabilities, it's very difficult to catch up in a short period time. So that's what our clients, I believe, were looking at. I also believe that there are probably some, especially on our wins, who actually confirmed that separately and independently in the press. So it's not -- it's a very strong feeling that I have. So I don't see pricing erosion and certainly not 2015. My comments in my prepared remarks were such that we have not been informed or notified of any opportunities or risks other than a few minor accounts that are currently in review. And we're hopeful that we see a more normal year in '16 where there aren't as many large media accounts put up for consideration. But at this point, preparing for that would be foolish. We're much better off being prepared to face a similar type of level. So I -- until it's confirmed I'd ask the market not to read too much into my comment, but we certainly stand ready."

And although we think we're pretty efficient in all of our operations overall, we know we're going to continue to try and improve in the area of efficiency and effectiveness as it relates to the cost base. And that's certainly the plan. On the FX front, just to echo what John said, a typical year for us, we would expect, is plus or minus 1% or 2% in terms of FX impact. And if things continue in that zone, we're certainly comfortable with our current expectations. If things go back beyond that to where we were this year, although it depends on where the FX negatives occur, I think we'll reevaluate it as the changes occur."

Good morning. 2016 marks Omnicom's 30th anniversary and I'm pleased to report that we're off to a good start. First quarter organic growth was 3.8%. We also improved our margins by 30 basis points in the quarter and are on track to deliver a 30 basis point margin improvement for the full year 2016 or 13.7% EBITA versus 13.4% for this past year. The effective large currency swings in 2015 continued to negatively impact us in the first quarter, leading to a reduction in our revenue of $97 million or just under 3%. 
At this point, we expect the impact of foreign exchange rates to moderate to more neutral levels in the second half of 2016. Phil will cover the impact of currencies on our business in more detail later in the call.
As I look at the broader economy and geopolitical environment, there is still quite a bit of hesitation in the marketplace. The capital market swings we saw in the first quarter, the uncharted actions of central banks around the world and the tragic events in Brussels, Paris and other cities, which is creating uncertainty for consumers and corporations and a cautious approach in spending. 
Given this environment, our operational results were very good for the quarter. Looking at organic growth by region, North America was up by 4.5%, driven by performance in media and advertising. U.K. growth was up 2.2%. Media as well as specialty health care performed well in the quarter, however, the U.K. faced difficult comps versus the first quarter of 2015.
Like you, we are tracking the potential outcome of the EU referendum in June. But it's too early for us to speculate on what the direct or indirect impact [indiscernible] would be on our operations in the U.K. or the rest of Europe.
In Continental Europe, our organic growth was 3%. In the euro currency markets, Germany continued to perform well with single-digit growth. France also had growth in the quarter, while the southern countries of Portugal, Spain, all outperformed. 
Outside the euro markets, the Czech Republic and Turkey generated solid results.
Turning to Asia Pacific. It was up 5.1% in the quarter. China, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand led the way with double-digit increases. 
And finally, Latin America was down 7.8%. A significant decline in Brazil was offset in part by double-digit organic growth in Mexico. Brazil, given its size, had a disproportionate large effect on our Latin American results for the quarter.
The current political and economic uncertainty in Brazil makes it difficult to predict top line trends. However, all of our agencies are closely scrutinizing their operations to manage costs in this environment.
Despite the current situation, we remain committed to and bullish on the long-term prospects in Brazil. As I mentioned earlier, our margins in the quarter improved 30 basis points versus the prior year. The initiators we have undertaken in areas, such as information technology, real estate, back office services and strategic purchasing as well as our agencies continues focus on cost management were the drivers for this improvement.
Looking at our bottom line, despite the currency impacts on U.S. dollar, our net income was up 4.4% in the quarter and our average share count was down over 2.5% from the prior year.
The combined result was an increase in EPS of 8.4% to $0.90 a share for the quarter versus $0.83 per share for the same quarter a year ago. Our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity remained very strong. During the quarter, we generated $360 million in free cash flow and returned over $320 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In April, we announced the 10% increase of our quarterly dividend to $0.55 per share. We also raise $1.4 billion to the issuance of 10 year [ph] notes, which closed the first week of April.
The majority of the proceeds from the bond offering were used to repay $1 billion of debt that matured on April 15. On January 29, we closed the Grupo ABC acquisition. The first quarter includes 2 months of the Grupo ABC results. Following these events, our credit readings remain unchanged and at our target level, while our leverage and interest coverage ratios remain very strong.
Looking forward, we stay committed to our priorities for the use of free cash flow, paying dividends, pursuing acquisitions with the right fit and price and share repurchases.
Overall, I'm very pleased with our performance for the quarter. While still early at this point, we are on [indiscernible] to meet our internal targets for the full year. 
Before I cover some other changes occurring in our industry and business, I'd like to address a few board and governance changes we have recently made, which are disclosed in our proxy.
Our lead Director, Lynn Coleman [ph], has given additional authority and responsibilities, including taking a more active role in our shareholder engagement process, providing a direct channel of communication between our shareholders and the board. 
Additionally, we've taken concrete steps to refresh the board. Our new Director, David Grizzard [ph], joined the board and our Audit Committee in March. David is a former vice chair and juvenile managing partner of Ernst & Young and will be a valuable addition.
In addition to our long serving board members, Gary rubies and Errol will be stepping down before the annual meeting in May. I want to welcome Debbie and thank Gary and Arrow for their many years of dedicated service, leadership and commitment to Omnicom.
These changes and others will be taking place over the next several years will strengthen Omnicom's governance structure and improve communications with our shareholders. 
Let me now discuss what we see in the industry and how our strategy allow us to achieve consistent financial results.
In a changing and uncertain world, some things are constant. Our steady and strategic focus on our growth priorities have served the group well. We remain focused on attracting, retaining and developing our talent; expanding our global footprint and moving into new service areas; and leveraging our data and analytic capabilities; and delivering breakthrough creative ideas and solutions-based upon meaningful consumer insights across all marketing disciplines and communications.
These areas of focus combined with our world-class agency brands and deep client relationships are keeping our company ahead of the competition in the shifting marketing landscape. The first quarter of this year reflected our focus on talent and broadening our service offerings to meet the changing needs of our clients.
Clients want best-in-class agencies and specialty services. Our agencies and people need to be connected to achieve the end-to-end integration our clients demand. We call our approach of assembling the best talent from across our Omnicom network to serve the clients at this is what level connected. As the implies, connected variance is an organizing principle and business philosophy that says no matter where person sits in the Omnicom network, she or he can be connected and involved as part of 1 team to drive superior results on behalf of the client. 
Our efforts in this area are driven through both formal and informal practices that preserve the individuality of an end culture of our agency brands and deliver customized and integrated solutions to our clients. We believe our networks and agencies are already ahead of the competition on this front. However, to build our leadership position, in February, we announced the formation of specialized groups in health care and public relations.  
The health care organization, Omnicom Health Group, offers clients a single point of access to our network of over 3,000 dedicated communication and scientific specialists working in the largest, strongest individual health care specialty units in the business. 
The group is led by one of our seasoned executives, Edelweiss [ph], former CEO of CBM Group. Ed and his team will make it easier for pharmaceutical clients as well as direct-to-consumer health care brands to tap into our service offerings in this area. As part of the health care offering, we also recently announced a long-term TBWA/WorldHealth. TBWA/WorldHealth brings together the pharmaceutical brands and professional expertise of 2 of our health care agencies with the consumer brands and creative skill sets of TBWA. Together, the people in this group excel at delivering differentiated offerings to build our professional and direct-to-consumer brands.
Sharon Calahan [ph], another seasoned executive and former CEO of Professional Health Care Agency LLNS, will be CEO of TBWA/WorldHealth and will continue to serve as Chief Clients Officer for Omnicom Health Group. Robert Shapiro [ph], former CEO of Corbit, will serve as the President.
DPR organization, Omnicom Public Relations Group, encompasses 10 Public Relations agencies, including 3 of the top global PR agencies worldwide. Fleishman Hilliard, [indiscernible] and Barneveld. It's over 6,000 employees. Industry veteran, Karen [ph], formerly CEO of [indiscernible], will lead Omnicom Public Relations group. The benefits of forming this group are numerous. We will be better equipped to deploy and align our agencies and talent to capabilities and expertise that best fits our client's needs. We will be able to hire, train and develop top talent and provide greater career opportunities across each of these categories.
The alliance will provide knowhow and economies in areas, such as technology, better solutions, production and analytics as well as digital development. Lastly, we'll be able to make investments and pursue acquisitions that will benefit all agencies across the groups.
However, in making these changes, what we are not doing is combining or eliminating our individual agencies distinct cultures. As I mentioned earlier, it's part of our heritage to respect the individuality and culture of our agency brands and it sets us apart from the competition. So we will ensure that our people will benefit from being part of these new groups, while remaining connected to the individual culture of their agencies.
I'm pleased to report that after a short period of time, we are seeing the results from both of the new groups. Omnicom Health Group has already been invited to participate in a global creative review for all of the consumer health brands from one of our clients. And Omnicom PR is currently working on several new business opportunities, including a significant global pitch that is underway across multiple PR firm, network collaboration with other Omnicom agencies. Together and a strong independent brands, I'm confident that both Omnicom Public Relations Group and Omnicom Health Care Group will provide the best of the best in the business. 
From talent and ideas to innovation and creativity, for the benefit of our people and our clients. Another area where we are both broadening and deepening our service offering with the best talent and the latest technology is in media. Technology and data had radically changed the media business. Years ago, when media was unbundled from creative agencies, the focus on buying scale and efficiency and the score stayed front and center with global advertisers for many years. Today, while scale and efficient to remain important, targeting measurement and effectiveness have become essential in the fluid and personalized world where consumers are accessing a wide variety of content on different devices. The rise of digital data and analytics has given us the ability to more precisely understand how consumers are accessing media and how they are responding to messages. 
Given this new reality, it's not surprising that an increasing number of clients are becoming more focused on how data informed media can be effective at driving business results and less focused on the legacy media specific measurements. 
As an example, our data platform continues audience behavior information, and we're now going a step further by integrating cultural trends using information derived for more cultural intelligence system. This system allows us to understand shifts in cultures and gives insight into where the world is going. We can infuse the behavioral and cultural insights to provide our creative and media agencies with more informed that can tap into these trends. All of this is done 24 hours a day and in real-time.
As I mentioned on our last conference call, in the fourth quarter of 2015, Omnicom is awarded the media planning and buying business of Procter & Gamble North America. The win is a great example of how our media organization has integrated data and analytics and marketing science capabilities into its core service. 
Coming out of this, our media group has launched a new media agency alongside our leading and PHD brands. We've recently announced the formation of Science, which is being led by Scott Hagedorn [ph], formerly CEO of Annalect, with Catherine Burke, previously of OMD serving as COO. 
Arts and science has a unique position in the media space as a data-driven marketing agency. And it's been established from day 1 to share the same qualities as our Annalect data and analytics platform, which is now at the foundation of all of our media agencies.
That means parts and science will strive to be agile in process to use technology at scale and to employ open standards and to excel in an invisible media world. Given Scott's new role at heart and science, margin [ph] as Global CEO and Eric, as North American CEO, will succeed him in Annalect.
Now I'd like to turn to a topic that has always been a priority for Omnicom, creating a great environment for great people to work. A critical aspect of achieving our talent development goals is creating a diverse and inclusive workplace. That means diversity in background, race, gender, age and experience. Quite frankly, we need to look more like the businesses, people and consumers we do business with and it has been a priority at Omnicom to create a diverse, world-class workforce that reflects our global community.
Omnicom's commitment to diversity starts from the top. With our independent board members now including 4 women and 2 minority members. In 2009, Omnicom created the role of senior vice president and chief diversity officer. This role has since expanded throughout the company.
Our individual networks now employ their own directors of diversity or chief diversity officers and 12 professionals of dedicated full-time to overseeing and advancing diversity and inclusion efforts at every level of our organization. 
A few years ago, a leading group of women at Omnicom launched Omni women, a designed to increase the influence and number of women leaders throughout the company. Recently, Omniwomen hosted a historic panel with our network CEOs discussing the topic of women's immense leadership and its importance to doing business in the 21st century. The leadership of Omniwomen and I firmly believe that this is not a women issue but a business issue that needs commitment from the top. 
But the words are just words if actions don't follow, and I's am proud of the actions we are seeing from Omnicom.
The number of our networks have launched their own programs to increase the influence of women, including TBWA, Take The Lead 2020, DDB, cannabis agenda, [indiscernible] is seeking to double its senior women creatives over the next 12 months. In our U.S. media group, 50% of the people that are director level or above are working data and analytics are women. And women around 40% of the top-performing agencies in the DAS network. These are just a few of the many initiatives and data points the focus on Omnicom places on the topic of diversity and inclusion. 
We've made great strides in the area of diversity but as Lenny Cox, CEO of DDB North America, recently said and I agree that we need to remain on the discussion of gender and diversity and not allow it to become a conversation only when something wrong happens. Omnicom enters its 30th year as a talented and more diverse organization all around the world. We achieved our goals for organic revenue growth, margins and profitability in the first quarter and we're on track for a successful 2016.
I'll now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the first quarter results. Phil?"

As John said, during the first quarter of 2016, our business has continued to meet the financial and strategic objectives we've set for them. As well as adapt to the ever evolving needs of their clients. As a result of t",2610,"Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, during the first quarter of 2016, our business has continued to meet the financial and strategic objectives we've set for them. As well as adapt to the ever evolving needs of their clients. As a result of these efforts, our businesses have continued their strong operating performance. Our organic revenue growth of 3.8% in Q1 was a little bit better than our expectations. As has been the case for over a year, FX continues to create a negative headwind on our revenue. Although this past quarter, it was at a lower level than it's been in quite a while.
In Q1, the impact of FX reduced revenue by 2.8% or $97 million. Except for Japan, reported FX was negative again across everyone of our significant foreign markets. As a result, total revenue for the quarter was about $3.5 billion, an increase of just shy of 1% versus Q1 last year. I will discuss our revenue growth in detail in a few minutes. 
Moving down the P&L, the low revenue, our EBITA increased 3.8% to $420 million. The resulting EBITA margin was 12%, which was up 30 basis points over Q1 of last year. The margin improvement, which was in line with our expectations for the full year of 2016 is the result of our continuing efforts to leverage our scale, to increase operating efficiencies throughout the organization as we continue to pursue several initiatives in the areas of real estate, information technology, back-office services and strategic purchasing.
Operating income, or EBIT for the quarter, increased 3.8% to $392 million. With operating margin improving to 11.2%, in line with the increase in our EBITDA margin. Now turning to items below operating income.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $40.1 million, up $3.3 million from the fourth quarter of last year and up $5.9 million versus Q1 of 2015. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, the increase in net interest expense of $3.3 million resulted from the impact of the termination in January of the $1 billion of fixed to floating interest rate swaps we had on our 2022 notes as well as some additional interest expense on debt we assumed on the Grupo ABC transaction, which has since been refinanced.
By terminating the swaps, we locked in interest savings over the remaining life of the 2022 bonds, reducing the all-in effective rate to 2.7% from 3.5%. However, in Q1, it was less floating rate benefit from the swaps and this will also be the case for the balance of 2016 when compared to 2015. 
Additionally, interest income earned by our international operations in Q1 was lower compared to Q4 of 2015, driven by lower cash balances available to invest as a result of higher working capital needs, which were typical as we move through the first half of the year.
As compared to Q1 of last year, the increase in net interest expense of $5.9 million also related to the termination of the fixed to floating interest rate swaps on our 2022 notes as well as some additional interest expense on local debt we assumed in the ABC transaction, which has since been refinanced.
When analyzing the impact of the termination of the 2022 swaps on a year-over-year basis, the benefit reducing from the swaps in Q1 of '15 was larger than the benefit we received in Q4 of '15 because the underlying floating interest rate on the swaps increased during '15. As a result of closing out the swaps, we reduced some of exposure to the volatility of potential further increases in the underlying short-term interest rates. Partially offsetting the additional expense was an increase in interest income from cash invested in our international treasury centers, net of some negative FX translation impact on the quarter. 
Our quarterly tax rate of 32.8% is in line with our current tax rate projection for 2016. Our earnings from affiliates was slightly negative during the first quarter but up versus the prior year. We saw improvements on the quarter in the performance of some of our European and Asian affiliates, which were offset by sluggishness of certain affiliates in Latin America. 
The allocation of earnings to the minority interest shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased $2.8 million to $17.9 million from $20.7 million, primarily due to the purchase of minority interests in certain subsidiaries over the past year as well as FX because a significant portion of our less than fully owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S.
As a result, net income was $218 million, that's an increase of $9 million or 4.4% versus Q1 of last year. The remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after the allocation of $1.5 million of net income to participating securities was $216.9 million, an increase of 5.1% versus last year. 
You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was $241.1 million, which is down 2.5% versus last year as a result of share buybacks over the past 12 months. As a result, diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.90 per share, an increase of $0.07 or 8.4% versus Q1 of 2015. 
Turning to Slide 4, we shift the discussion to our revenue performance. For the quarter, FX decreased our revenue by $97 million or 2.8%. While the U.S. dollar has continued its strength year-over-year on a global basis, we've begun to see that moderate somewhat on a reported basis when compared to what we've seen over the last several quarters. 
The decrease in the U.K. pound has the largest translation impact on our reported revenue in Q1, accounting for approximately 20% of the FX-driven revenue reduction, while the euro and the Brazilian real were the next largest negatives. When combined with the U.K. pound, 3 currencies made up almost 1/2 of the FX-driven reduction in our first quarter revenue.
Looking ahead, freights stay were they are. Negative impact of FX on the reported revenue may continue to moderate, reducing revenue by about 1.5% during the second order and approximately 1% for the full year. 
That being said, its is exceedingly difficult to estimate what will happen to FX rates over the remaining 8-plus months of the year.
Revenue from acquisitions net of dispositions decreased revenues slightly in the quarter. At the end of January, DDB completed the acquisition of Grupo ABC in Brazil, so our current year revenue includes 2 months of their current year results and our acquisition revenue includes their revenue for the same prior period in 2015. 
As a reminder, the net decrease in the quarter reflects the continuing impact of the few acquisitions and dispositions that we completed during 2015. Going forward, we expect that revenue from our collective recent acquisitions will be a net positive next quarter and for the year.
And finally, organic growth was positive $131 million or 3.8% this quarter. It was another solid quarter of growth across all of our major markets with the exception of Brazil, the Netherlands and, to a lesser extent, Japan. The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included the continued strong performance across our media businesses and notable performances by several of our advertising brands across our geographies as well as our full-service health care businesses, which turned in solid performances in the quarter.
Euro Markets overall had positive organic growth. The Asia Pacific region continued to show solid performance across most markets, particularly China and India. And we also benefited from good performance in both Mexico and the UAE. 
On Slide 5, we present our regional mix of business. During the quarter, the split was 61% for North America, 10% for the U.K., 16% for the rest of Europe, 10% for Asia Pacific with the remainder being split between Latin America and Africa and the Middle East. In North America, while the U.S. and Canada turned in solid performances, we had organic revenue growth of 4.5%, again, primarily driven this quarter by the performance of our advertising and media discipline and our health care businesses.
Turning to Europe. The U.K. had another quarter of positive organic growth, up 2.2%. The rest of Europe was up 3%, led by our agencies in Germany and Spain as well as good performance in Italy. Additionally, France had positive organic growth for the first time in awhile, while Netherlands continued to struggle and Poland had a down quarter. Asia Pacific was up 5.1%, a solid performances from most of our major Asian markets, including China and India and Japan were down slightly. Africa and Middle East although of a small base was marginally positive. Our UAE businesses were strong performance offset by year-over-year reductions in the quarter and on the smaller markets in the region.
The 1 region that was down organically was Latin America. Our Brazilian agencies continued to face uncertainty in both the economic conditions and the political climate in the country. Revenues were down about 20% organically in the quarter. And while the quarter included the successful acquisition of Grupo ABC, the increase in revenue in the quarter from Grupo ABC was more than offset by the significant reduction in revenue resulting from both the negative impact of FX translation and the negative organic growth of our operating companies. As such, our reported revenues for Brazil were down in Q1 when compared to the prior year. 
In the region, the performance in Brazil overshadowed the strong performance by Mexico, which had double-digit organic growth in the quarter. Slide 6 shows our mix of business. For the quarter, the split was 52% for advertising services and 48% for marketing services. Based on their performance, our advertising discipline was up 7.9% for the quarter, driven by the strong performance of our media businesses and notable performances by several of our advertising brands across our geographies. While CRM was down 7/10 of a percent, results were mixed for us businesses and geographies. Our field marketing and point-of-sale businesses had a challenging quarter and our activation and events businesses were flat, while our research business has performed well. 
PR was down 9/10 of a percent. We expect this performance to improve in the second half of the year. Specialty communications is up 2.2%, driven by the solid performance for our full-service health care agencies that was partially offset by the other smaller businesses in this discipline. 
On Slide 7, we present our mix of business by industry sector. In comparing the Q1 revenue for 2016 to 2015, you can see that there are minor changes in the mix of our client revenue by industry but nothing worth special noting. 
Turning now to our cash flow performance. On Slide 8, you can see that in the first quarter we generated $346 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 9, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $122 million. As you know, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend. The increase is scheduled for our next dividend payment. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $15 million, down to our purchase and prior year periods of additional shares from our local partners. Capital expenditures were $41 million and acquisitions, including earnout payments and net of the proceeds received from the sale of investments totaled $103 million. And stock repurchases, net of the proceeds received from the stock issuances under our employee share plans, totaled $193 million.
All in, we outspent our free cash flow in the quarter by about $129 million.
Turning to Slide 10. Regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter, our total debt at March 31, 2016 of $4.65 billion is up about $70 million from this time last year. That's primarily due to the change in the fair value of our debt's carrying value as required to be reported on the balance sheet under U.S. GAAP. 
Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $2.9 billion, down principally as a result of the increase in our cash balances versus this time last year. As you may know, after March 31, we closed on our issuance of $1.4 billion of 10-year senior notes at an effective rate of about 4.05%. 
So our quarter-end debt levels do not reflect this new issuance. Most of the proceeds of this issuance were used to retire the $1 billion of the 2016 senior notes at the maturity dates on April 15. 
The 2016 notes had a coupon of 5.9% and a effective rate of 5.25%. So we even with the increased principal, the interest expense on new debt compared to the debt that recently matured will be $4 million to $5 million higher on an annualized basis. However, for the year, we expect interest expense to increase in excess of $20 million, primarily due to the changes that we previously mentioned to our fixed to floating interest rate swaps. As a result of these changes, we've adjusted the effective mix of our fixed to floating rate debt from approximately 50-50 a year ago to a 70% fixed, 30% floating mix today. By terminating some of these swaps, we reduced our exposure to further interest rate volatility and we locked interest savings over the remaining life of the 2022 bonds. 
However, in the short term, we will receive less floating rate benefit from the swaps in 2016 when compared to 2015. The increase in our cash and short-term investments of $218 million over the past 12 months was driven primarily as a result of positive changes in our operating capital of $310 million which were partially offset by the negative impact of FX translation of approximately $45 million on our cash balance over the last 12 months as well as the slight overspend of our free cash flow of $17 million. 
Net debt increased by $951 million compared to year-end. As a result of the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of approximately $130 million, adjustments for the carrying value of our debt of about $45 million and the typical uses of cash for working capital that historically occur in our first quarter of approximately $805 million. These increases in net debt were partially offset by the effective exchange rates uncashed during Q1 that increased our cash balance by about $80 million.
As for our ratios, our total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.1x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3x, essentially unchanged since this time last year. And due to the increase in our interest expense, our interest coverage ratio went down to 11.9x but it remains a very strong. 
Turning to Slide 11, we continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well-focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 19.3% and return on equity increased to 46.3%. 
And finally, on Slide 12, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders over the past 10-plus years. The line on the top of the chart shows our accumulative net income from 2006 to Q1 of 2016, which totaled $9.8 billion. The bar to show the cumulative the return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $10.9 billion for a cumulative payout ratio of 111%.

Good morning. 2016 marks Omnicom's 30th anniversary, and I'm pleased to report that we're off to a good start. First quarter organic growth was 3.8%. We also improved our margins by 30 basis points in the quarter and are on track to deliver a 30 basis point margin improvement for the full year 2016 or 13.7% EBITA versus 13.4% for this past year. 
The effect of large currency swings in 2015 continued to negatively impact us in the first quarter, leading to a reduction in revenue of $97 million or just under 3%. At this point, we expect the impact of foreign exchange rates to moderate to more neutral levels in the second half of 2016. Phil will cover the impact of currencies on our business in more detail later in the call.
As I look at the broader economy and geopolitical environment, there is still quite a bit of hesitation in the marketplace. The capital market swings we saw in the first quarter, the uncharted actions of central banks around the world and the tragic events in Brussels, Paris and other cities is creating uncertainty for consumers and corporations and a cautious approach to spending. 
Given this environment, our operational results were very good for the quarter. Looking at organic growth by region. North America was up by 4.5%, driven by performance in media and advertising. 
U.K. growth was up 2.2%. Media, as well as specialty health care, performed well in the quarter, however, the U.K. faced difficult comps versus the first quarter of 2015. Like you, we're tracking the potential outcome of the EU referendum in June, but it's too early for us to speculate on what the direct or indirect impact of Brexit would be on our operations in the U.K. or the rest of Europe.
In Continental Europe, our organic growth was 3%. In the euro currency markets, Germany continued to perform well with single-digit growth. France also had growth in the quarter while the southern countries of Portugal, Spain, Italy all outperformed. Outside the euro markets, the Czech Republic and Turkey generated solid results.
Turning to Asia Pacific, it was up 5.1% in the quarter. China, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand led the way with double-digit increases. 
And finally, Latin America was down 7.8%. A significant decline in Brazil was offset, in part, by double-digit organic growth in Mexico. Brazil, given its size, had a disproportionate large effect on our Latin American results for the quarter. The current political and economic uncertainty in Brazil makes it difficult to predict top line trends. However, all of our agencies are closely scrutinizing their operations to manage costs in this environment. Despite the current situation, we remain committed to and bullish on the long-term prospects in Brazil. 
As I mentioned earlier, our margins in the quarter improved 30 basis points versus the prior year. The initiators we have undertaken in areas such as information technology, real estate, back office services and strategic purchasing, as well as our agencies' continuous focus on cost management, were the drivers for this improvement.
Looking at our bottom line. Despite the currency impacts on U.S. dollar, our net income was up 4.4% in the quarter and our average share count was down over 2.5% from the prior year. The combined result was an increase in EPS of 8.4% to $0.90 a share for the quarter versus $0.83 per share for the same quarter a year ago. 
Our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity remained very strong. During the quarter, we generated $360 million in free cash flow and returned over $320 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In April, we announced a 10% increase of our quarterly dividend to $0.55 per share. We also raised $1.4 billion to the issuance of 10-year notes, which was closed first week of April. The majority of the proceeds from the bond offering were used to repay $1 billion worth of debt that matured on April 15. 
On January 29, we closed the Grupo ABC acquisition. The first quarter includes 2 months of the Grupo ABC results. Following these events, our credit readings remain unchanged and at our target level while our leverage and interest coverage ratios remain very strong. 
Looking forward, we stay committed to our priorities for the use of free cash flow: paying dividends, pursuing acquisitions with the right fit and price and share repurchases. Overall, I'm very pleased with our performance through the quarter. While it is still early at this point, we are on cost to meet our internal targets for the full year. 
Before I cover some other changes occurring in our industry and business, I'd like to address a few board and governance changes we have recently made, which are disclosed in our proxy. Our lead director, Len Coleman, has been given additional authority and responsibilities, including taking a more active role in our shareholder engagement process, providing a direct channel of communication between our shareholders and the board. 
Additionally, we've taken concrete steps to refresh the board. Our new director, Debbie Kissire, joined the board and our Audit Committee in March. Debbie is a former Vice Chair and Regional Managing Partner of Ernst & Young and will be a valuable addition. In addition to our long-serving board members, Gary Roubos and Errol Cook, will be stepping down before the Annual Meeting in May. I want to welcome Debbie and thank Gary and Errol for their many years of dedicated service, leadership and commitment to Omnicom. These changes and others will be taking place over the next several years will strengthen Omnicom's governance structure and improve communications with our shareholders. 
Let me now discuss what we see in the industry and how our strategies allow us to achieve consistent financial results. In a changing and uncertain world, some things are constant. Our steady and strategic focus on our growth priorities have served the group well. We remain focused on: attracting, retaining and developing top talent; expanding our global footprint and moving into new service areas; and leveraging our data and analytical capabilities; and delivering breakthrough creative ideas and solutions based upon meaningful consumer insights across all marketing disciplines and communications. These areas of focus, combined with our world-class agency brands and deep client relationships, are keeping our company ahead of the competition and the shifting marketing landscape. 
The first quarter of this year reflected our focus on talent and broadening our service offerings to meet the changing needs of our clients. Clients want best-in-class agencies and specialty services. Our agencies and people need to be connected to achieve the end-to-end integration our clients demand. We call our approach of assembling the best talent from across our Omnicom network to serve the clients at the C-suite level connected brilliance. As the name implies, connected brilliance is an organizing principle and business philosophy that says no matter where a person sits in the Omnicom network, she or he can be connected and involved as part of one team to drive superior results on behalf of a client. 
Our efforts in this area are driven through both formal and informal practices that preserve the individuality of -- and culture of our agency brands and deliver customized and integrated solutions to our clients. We believe our networks and agencies are already ahead of the competition on this front. 
However, to build our leadership position, in February, we announced the formation of specialized groups in health care and public relations. The health care organization, Omnicom Health Group, offers clients a single point of access to our network of over 3,000 dedicated communication and scientific specialists working in the largest, strongest individual health care specialty units in the business. The group is led by one of our seasoned executives, Ed Wise, former CEO of CDM Group. Ed and his team will make it easier for pharmaceutical clients, as well as direct-to-consumer health care brands, to tap into our service offerings in this area. 
As part of the health care offering, we also recently announced the launch of TBWA\WorldHealth. TBWA\WorldHealth brings together the pharmaceutical brands and professional expertise of 2 of our health care agencies with the consumer brands and creative skill sets of TBWA. Together, the people in this group excel at delivering differentiated offerings to both our professional and direct-to-consumer brands. Sharon Callahan, another seasoned executive and former CEO of professional health care agency, LLNS, will be CEO of TBWA\WorldHealth and will continue to serve as Chief Clients Officer for Omnicom Health Group. Robin Shapiro, former CEO of Corbett, will serve as the President.
The PR organization, Omnicom Public Relations Group, encompasses 10 public relations agencies, including 3 of the top global PR agencies worldwide: FleishmanHillard, Ketchum and Porter Novelli. It's over 6,000 employees. Industry veteran, Karen van Bergen, formerly CEO of Porter Novelli, will lead Omnicom Public Relations group. 
The benefits in forming this group are numerous. We will be better equipped to deploy and align our agencies and talent to capabilities and expertise that best fits our client needs. We will be able to hire, train and develop top talent and provide greater career opportunities across each of these categories. The alignments will also provide knowhow and economies in areas, such as technology, better solutions, production and analytics as well as digital development. Lastly, we will be able to make investments and pursue acquisitions that will benefit all agencies across the groups.
However, in making these changes, what we are not doing is combining or eliminating our individual agencies' distinct cultures. As I mentioned earlier, it's part of our heritage to respect the individuality and culture of our agency brands and it sets us apart from the competition. So we will ensure that our people will benefit from being part of these new groups while remaining connected to the individual culture of their agencies.
I'm pleased to report that after a short period of time, we are seeing the results from both of the new groups. Omnicom Health Care Group has already been invited to participate in a global creative review for all of the consumer health brands from one of our clients. And Omnicom PR is currently working on several new business opportunities, including a significant global pitch that is underway across multiple PR firms and collaboration with other Omnicom agencies. Together, and its strong independent brands, I'm confident that both Omnicom Public Relations Group and Omnicom Health Care Group will provide the best of the best in the business, from talents and ideas to innovation and creativity for the benefit of our people and our clients. 
Another area, where we are both broadening and deepening our service offering with the best talent and the latest technology, is in media. Technology and data had radically changed the media business. Years ago, when media was unbundled from creative agencies, the focus was on buying scale and efficiency, and this goal stayed front and center with global advertisers for many years. Today, while scale and efficiency remain important, targeting, measurement and effectiveness have become essential in the fluid and personalized world where consumers are accessing a wide variety of content on different devices. 
The rise of digital data and analytics has given us the ability to more precisely understand how consumers are accessing media and how they're responding to messages. Given this new reality, it's not surprising that an increasing number of clients are becoming more focused on how data inform media can be effective at driving business results and then less focused on legacy media specific measurements. 
As an example, our data platform contains audience behavior information, and we're now going a step further by integrating cultural trends, using information derived from our cultural intelligence system. This system allows us to understand shifts in cultures and give insight into where the world is going. We can then fuse the behavioral and cultural insights to provide our creative and media agencies with more informed briefs that can tap into these trends. All of this is done 24 hours a day and in real time.
As I mentioned on our last conference call, in the fourth quarter of 2015, Omnicom was awarded the media planning and buying business of Procter & Gamble North America. The win is a great example of how our media organization has integrated data and analytics and marketing science capabilities into its core service. 
Coming out of this, our media group has launched a new media agency, alongside our leading OMD and PHD brands. We've recently announced the formation of Hearts & Science, which is being led by Scott Hagedorn, formerly CEO of Annalect, with Kathleen Brookbanks, previously of OMD, serving as COO. Hearts & Science has a unique position in the media space as a data-driven marketing agency and has been established from day 1 to share the same qualities as our Annalect data and analytics platform, which is now at the foundation of all of our media agencies. That means Hearts & Science will strive to be agile in process to use technology at scale and to employ open standards and to excel in an addressable media world. Given Scott's new role at Hearts & Science, Slavi Samardzija, as Global CEO, and Erin Matts, as North American CEO, will succeed him at Annalect.
Now I'd like to turn to a topic that has always been a priority for Omnicom, creating a great environment for great people to work. A critical aspect of achieving our talent development goals is creating a diverse and inclusive workplace. That means diversity in backgrounds, race, gender, age and experience. Quite frankly, we need to look more like the businesses, people and consumers we do business with, and it has been a priority at Omnicom to create a diverse, world-class workforce that reflects our global community. Omnicom's commitment to diversity starts from the top. With our independent board members now including 4 women and 2 minority members. 
In 2009, Omnicom created the role of Senior Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer. This role has since expanded throughout the company. Our individual networks now employ their own directors of diversity or chief diversity officers and 12 professionals are dedicated full time to overseeing and advancing diversity and inclusion efforts at every level of our organization. 
A few years ago, a leading group of women at Omnicom launched Omniwomen, an effort designed to increase the influence and number of women leaders throughout the company. Recently, Omniwomen hosted a historic panel with our network CEOs, discussing the topic of women's leadership and its importance to doing business in the 21st century. The leadership of Omniwomen and I firmly believe that this is not a women issue but a business issue that needs commitment from the top. But words are just words if actions don't follow, and I'm proud of the actions we're seeing within Omnicom.
A number of our networks have launched their own programs to increase the influence of women, including: TBWA, Take The Lead 2020; DDB, Talent Has No Gender; BBDO is seeking to double its senior women creatives over the next 12 months. In our U.S. Media Group, 50% of the people that are director level or above and working data or analytics are women, and women run 40% of the top-performing agencies in the DAS network. These are just a few of the many initiatives and data points that illustrate the focus Omnicom places on the topic of diversity and inclusion. 
We've made great strides in the area of diversity. But as Wendy Clark, CEO of DDB North America, recently said, and I agree, we need to remain restless on the discussion of gender and diversity and not allow it to become a conversation only when something wrong happens. 
Omnicom enters its 30th year as a talented and more diverse organization all around the world. We achieved our goals for organic revenue growth, margins and profitability in the first quarter, and we're on track for a successful 2016.
I'll now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at first quarter results. Phil?"

As John said, during the first quarter of 2016, our business has continued to meet the financial and strategic objectives we've set for them as well as adapt to the ever evolving needs of their clients. As a result of th",2601,"Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, during the first quarter of 2016, our business has continued to meet the financial and strategic objectives we've set for them as well as adapt to the ever evolving needs of their clients. As a result of these efforts, our businesses have continued their strong operating performance. Our organic revenue growth of 3.8% in Q1 was a little bit better than our expectations. 
As has been the case for over a year, FX continues to create a negative headwind on our revenue, although this past quarter, it was at a lower level than it's been in quite a while. In Q1, the impact of FX reduced revenue by 2.8% or $97 million. Except for Japan, reported FX was negative again across every one of our significant foreign markets. As a result, total revenue for the quarter was about $3.5 billion, an increase of just shy of 1% versus Q1 last year. I'll discuss our revenue growth in detail in a few minutes. 
Moving down the P&L. Below revenue, our EBITA increased 3.8% to $420 million, and the resulting EBITA margin was 12%, which was up 30 basis points over Q1 of last year. The margin improvement, which was in line with our expectations for the full year of 2016, is the result of our continuing efforts to leverage our scale to increase operating efficiencies throughout the organization as we continue to pursue several initiatives in the areas of real estate, information technology, back-office services and strategic purchasing. Operating income, or EBIT, for the quarter increased 3.8% to $392 million with operating margin improving to 11.2%, in line with the increase in our EBITA margin. 
Now turning to items below operating income. Net interest expense for the quarter was $40.1 million, up $3.3 million from the fourth quarter of last year and up $5.9 million versus Q1 of 2015. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, the increase in net interest expense of $3.3 million resulted from the impact of the termination in January of the $1 billion of fixed to floating interest rate swaps we had on our 2022 notes as well as some additional interest expense on debt we assumed in the Grupo ABC transaction, which has since been refinanced. By terminating the swaps, we locked in interest savings over the remaining life of the 2022 bonds, reducing the all-in effective rate to 2.7% from 3.5%. However, in Q1, there was less floating rate benefit from the swaps, and this will also be the case for the balance of 2016 when compared to 2015. 
Additionally, interest income earned by our international operations in Q1 was lower compared to Q4 of 2015, driven by lower cash balances available to invest as a result of higher working capital needs, which were typical as we move through the first half of the year.
As compared to Q1 of last year, the increase in net interest expense of $5.9 million also related to the termination of the fixed to floating interest rate swaps on our 2022 notes as well as some additional interest expense on local debt we assumed in the ABC transaction, which has since been refinanced.
When analyzing the impact of the termination of the 2022 swaps on a year-over-year basis, the benefit we received from the swaps in Q1 of '15 was larger than the benefit we received in Q4 of '15 because the underlying floating interest rate on the swaps increased during '15. As a result of closing out the swaps, we reduced some of exposure to the volatility of potential further increases in the underlying short-term interest rates. Partially offsetting the additional expense was an increase in interest income from cash invested in our international treasury centers net of some negative FX translation impact in the quarter. 
Our quarterly tax rate of 32.8% is in line with our current tax rate projection for 2016. Our earnings from affiliates was slightly negative during the first quarter but up versus the prior year. We saw improvements in the quarter in the performance of some of our European and Asian affiliates, which was offset by sluggishness of certain affiliates in Latin America. 
The allocation of earnings to the minority interest shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased $2.8 million to $17.9 million from $20.7 million, primarily due to the purchase of minority interests in certain subsidiaries over the past year as well as FX, because a significant portion of our less than fully owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S. As a result, net income was $218 million. That's an increase of $9 million or 4.4% versus Q1 of last year. The remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after the allocation of $1.5 million of net income to participating securities was $216.9 million, an increase of 5.1% versus last year. 
You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was 241.1 million, which is down 2.5% versus last year as a result of share buybacks over the past 12 months. As a result, diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.90 per share, an increase of $0.07 or 8.4% versus Q1 of 2015. 
Turning to Slide 4. We shift the discussion to our revenue performance. For the quarter, FX decreased our revenue by $97 million or 2.8%. While the U.S. dollar has continued its strength year-over-year on a global basis, we've begun to see that moderate somewhat on a reported basis when compared to what we've seen over the last several quarters. 
The decrease in the U.K. pound had the largest translation impact on our reported revenue in Q1, accounting for approximately 20% of the FX-driven revenue reduction while the euro and the Brazilian reais were the next largest negatives. When combined with the U.K. pound, 3 currencies made up almost 1/2 of the FX-driven reduction in our first quarter revenue.
Looking ahead, freights stay were they are, negative impact of FX on a reported revenue may continue to moderate, reducing revenue by about 1.5% during the second quarter and approximately 1% for the full year. That being said, it is exceedingly difficult to estimate what will happen to FX rates over the remaining 8-plus months of the year.
Revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, decreased revenue slightly in the quarter. At the end of January, DDB completed the acquisition of Grupo ABC in Brazil, so our current year revenue includes 2 months of their current year results and our acquisition revenue includes their revenue for the same prior period in 2015. As a reminder, the net decrease in the quarter reflects the continuing impact of a few acquisitions and dispositions that we completed during 2015. Going forward, we expect that revenue from our collective recent acquisitions will be a net positive next quarter and for the year. And finally, organic growth was positive $131 million or 3.8% this quarter. 
It was another solid quarter of growth across all of our major markets with the exception of Brazil, the Netherlands and, to a lesser extent, Japan. Primary drivers of our growth this quarter included the continued strong performance across our media businesses and notable performances by several of our advertising brands across our geographies as well as our full-service health care businesses, which turned in solid performances in the quarter. Euro Markets overall had positive organic growth. The Asia Pacific region continued to show solid performance across most markets, particularly China and India, and we also benefited from good performance in both Mexico and the UAE. 
On Slide 5, we present our regional mix of business. During the quarter, the split was 61% for North America, 10% for the U.K., 16% for the rest of Europe, 10% for Asia Pacific with the remainder being split between Latin America and Africa and the Middle East. 
In North America, both the U.S. and Canada turned in solid performances. We had organic revenue growth of 4.5%, again, primarily driven this quarter by the performance of our advertising and media discipline and our health care businesses.
Turning to Europe. The U.K. had another quarter of positive organic growth, up 2.2%. The rest of Europe was up 3%, led by our agencies in Germany and Spain as well as good performance in Italy. Additionally, France had positive organic growth for the first time in awhile while the Netherlands continued to struggle and Poland had a down quarter. 
Asia Pacific was up 5.1% with solid performances from most of our major Asian markets, including China and India, with Japan down slightly. 
Africa and Middle East, although off a small base, was marginally positive. Our UAE businesses with strong performance offset by year-over-year reductions in the quarter and on the smaller markets in that region.
One region that was down organically was Latin America. Our Brazilian agencies continued to face uncertainty in both the economic conditions and the political climate in the country. Revenues were down about 20% organically in the quarter. And while the quarter included the successful acquisition of Grupo ABC, the increase in revenue in the quarter from Grupo ABC was more than offset by the significant reduction in revenue resulting from both the negative impact of FX translation and the negative organic growth of our operating companies. As such, our reported revenues for Brazil were down in Q1 when compared to the prior year. In the region, the performance in Brazil overshadowed the strong performance by Mexico, which had double-digit organic growth in the quarter. 
Slide 6 shows our mix of business. For the quarter, the split was 52% for advertising services and 48% for marketing services. As for their performance, our advertising discipline was up 7.9% in the quarter, driven by the strong performance of our media businesses and notable performances by several of our advertising brands across our geographies. While CRM was down 0.7%, results were mixed across businesses and geographies. Our field marketing and point-of-sale businesses had a challenging quarter, and our activation and events businesses were flat while our research business has performed well. PR was down 0.9%. We expect this performance to improve in the second half of the year. Specialty communications was up 2.2%, driven by the solid performance for our full-service health care agencies that was partially offset by the other smaller businesses in this discipline. 
On Slide 7, we present our mix of business by industry sector. In comparing the Q1 revenue for 2016 to 2015, you can see that there are minor changes in the mix of our client revenue by industry but nothing worth special notice.
Turning now to our cash flow performance. On Slide 8, you can see that in the first quarter we generated $346 million of free cash flow, including changes in working capital. 
As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 9, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $122 million. As you know, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend. The increase is scheduled for our next dividend payment. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $15 million, down due to our purchase in prior year periods of additional shares from our local partners. Capital expenditures were $41 million, and acquisitions, including earnout payments net of the proceeds received from the sale of investments, totaled $103 million. And stock repurchases, net of the proceeds received from the stock issuances under our employee share plans, totaled $193 million. All-in, we outspent our free cash flow in the quarter by about $129 million.
Turning to Slide 10. Regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter, our total debt at March 31, 2016, of $4.65 billion is up about $70 million from this time last year. That's primarily due to the change in the fair value of our debt's carrying value as required to be reported on the balance sheet under U.S. GAAP. Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $2.9 billion, down principally as a result of the increase in our cash balances versus this time last year. 
As you may know, after March 31, we closed on our issuance of $1.4 billion of 10-year senior notes at an effective rate of about 4.05%. So our quarter-end debt levels do not reflect this new issuance. Most of the proceeds of this issuance were used to retire the $1 billion of the 2016 senior notes at the maturity date on April 15. 2016 notes had a coupon of 5.9% and an effective rate of 5.25%. So even with the increased principal, the interest expense on new debt compared to the debt that recently matured will only be $4 million to $5 million higher on an annualized basis. 
However, for the year, we expect interest expense to increase in excess of $20 million primarily due to the changes that we previously mentioned to our fixed to floating interest rate swaps. As a result of these changes, we've adjusted the effective mix of our fixed to floating rate debt from approximately 50-50 a year ago to a 70% fixed, 30% floating mix today. By terminating some of these swaps, we reduced our exposure to further interest rate volatility and we locked in interest savings over the remaining life of the 2022 bonds. However, in the short term, we will receive less floating rate benefit from the swaps in 2016 when compared to 2015. 
The increase in our cash and short-term investments of $218 million over the past 12 months was driven primarily as a result of positive changes in our operating capital of $310 million, which were partially offset by the negative impact of FX translation of approximately $45 million on our cash balance over the last 12 months as well as the slight overspend of our free cash flow of $17 million. 
Net debt increased by $951 million compared to year-end as a result of the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of approximately $130 million, adjustments to the carrying value of our debt of about $45 million and the typical uses of cash for working capital that historically occur in our first quarter of approximately $805 million. These increases in net debt were partially offset by the effective exchange rates on cash during Q1 that increased our cash balance by about $80 million.
As for our ratios, our total debt to EBITDA was 2.1x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3x, essentially unchanged since this time last year. And due to the increase in our interest expense, our interest coverage ratio went down to 11.9x, but it remains very strong. 
Turning to Slide 11. We continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well-focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 19.3% and return on equity increased to 46.3%. 
And finally, on Slide 12, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders over the past 10-plus years. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2006 to Q1 of 2016, which totaled $9.8 billion, and the bar show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which, during the same period, totaled $10.9 billion or a cumulative payout ratio of 111%. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we've included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions."

We haven't taken that approach. We've been a little more patient.

We're not making any commitments beyond that other than we're committed to pursue the initiatives we begun to pursue. On and to the future, we're going to continue to try and be as efficient as we possibly can. But we're not obsessed with margin percentages. We're focused on delivering EBIT dollars."

Good morning. 2016 marks Omnicom's 30th anniversary, and I'm pleased to report that we're off to a good start. First quarter organic growth was 3.8%. We also improved our margins by 30 basis points in the quarter and are on track to deliver a 30 basis point margin improvement for the full year 2016 or 13.7% EBITA versus 13.4% for this past year. 
The effect of large currency swings in 2015 continued to negatively impact us in the first quarter, leading to a reduction in revenue of $97 million or just under 3%. At this point, we expect the impact of foreign exchange rates to moderate to more neutral levels in the second half of 2016. Phil will cover the impact of currencies on our business in more detail later in the call.
As I look at the broader economy and geopolitical environment, there is still quite a bit of hesitation in the marketplace. The capital market swings we saw in the first quarter, the uncharted actions of central banks around the world and the tragic events in Brussels, Paris and other cities is creating uncertainty for consumers and corporations and a cautious approach to spending. 
Given this environment, our operational results were very good for the quarter. Looking at organic growth by region. North America was up by 4.5%, driven by performance in media and advertising. 
U.K. growth was up 2.2%. Media, as well as specialty health care, performed well in the quarter, however, the U.K. faced difficult comps versus the first quarter of 2015. Like you, we are tracking the potential outcome of the EU referendum in June, but it's too early for us to speculate on what the direct or indirect impact of Brexit would be on our operations in the U.K. or the rest of Europe.
In Continental Europe, our organic growth was 3%. In the euro currency markets, Germany continued to perform well with single-digit growth. France also had growth in the quarter while the southern countries of Portugal, Spain, Italy all outperformed. Outside the euro markets, the Czech Republic and Turkey generated solid results.
Turning to Asia Pacific, it was up 5.1% in the quarter. China, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand led the way with double-digit increases. 
And finally, Latin America was down 7.8%. A significant decline in Brazil was offset, in part, by double-digit organic growth in Mexico. Brazil, given its size, had a disproportionate large effect on our Latin American results for the quarter. The current political and economic uncertainty in Brazil makes it difficult to predict top line trends. However, all of our agencies are closely scrutinizing their operations to manage costs in this environment. Despite the current situation, we remain committed to and bullish on the long-term prospects in Brazil. 
As I mentioned earlier, our margins in the quarter improved 30 basis points versus the prior year. The initiators we have undertaken in areas such as information technology, real estate, back office services and strategic purchasing, as well as our agencies' continuous focus on cost management, were the drivers for this improvement.
Looking at our bottom line. Despite the currency impacts on the U.S. dollar, our net income was up 4.4% in the quarter and our average share count was down over 2.5% from the prior year. The combined result was an increase in EPS of 8.4% to $0.90 a share for the quarter versus $0.83 per share for the same quarter a year ago. 
Our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity remained very strong. During the quarter, we generated $360 million in free cash flow and returned over $320 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In April, we announced a 10% increase of our quarterly dividend to $0.55 per share. We also raised $1.4 billion through the issuance of 10-year notes, which was closed the first week of April. The majority of the proceeds from the bond offering were used to repay $1 billion worth of debt that matured on April 15. 
On January 29, we closed the Grupo ABC acquisition. The first quarter includes 2 months of the Grupo ABC results. Following these events, our credit readings remain unchanged and at our target level while our leverage and interest coverage ratios remain very strong. 
Looking forward, we stay committed to our priorities for the use of free cash flow: paying dividends, pursuing acquisitions with the right fit and price and share repurchases. Overall, I'm very pleased with our performance through the quarter. While it is still early at this point, we are on cost to meet our internal targets for the full year. 
Before I cover some other changes occurring in our industry and business, I'd like to address a few board and governance changes we have recently made, which are disclosed in our proxy. Our lead director, Len Coleman, has been given additional authority and responsibilities, including taking a more active role in our shareholder engagement process, providing a direct channel of communication between our shareholders and the board. 
Additionally, we've taken concrete steps to refresh the board. Our new director, Debbie Kissire, joined the board and our Audit Committee in March. Debbie is a former Vice Chair and Regional Managing Partner of Ernst & Young and will be a valuable addition. In addition, 2 of our long-serving board members, Gary Roubos and Errol Cook, will be stepping down before the Annual Meeting in May. I want to welcome Debbie and thank Gary and Errol for their many years of dedicated service, leadership and commitment to Omnicom. These changes and others will be taking place over the next several years will strengthen Omnicom's governance structure and improve communications with our shareholders. 
Let me now discuss what we're seeing in the industry and how our strategies allow us to achieve consistent financial results. In a changing and uncertain world, some things are constant. Our steady and strategic focus on our growth priorities have served the group well. We remain focused on: attracting, retaining and developing top talent; expanding our global footprint and moving into new service areas; and leveraging our data and analytical capabilities; and delivering breakthrough creative ideas and solutions based upon meaningful consumer insights across all marketing disciplines and communications. These areas of focus, combined with our world-class agency brands and deep client relationships, are keeping our company ahead of the competition in the shifting marketing landscape. 
The first quarter of this year reflected our focus on talent and broadening our service offerings to meet the changing needs of our clients. Clients want best-in-class agencies and specialty services. Our agencies and people need to be connected to achieve the end-to-end integration of our clients demand. We call our approach of assembling the best talent from across our Omnicom network to serve the clients at the C-suite level connected brilliance. As the name implies, connected brilliance is an organizing principle and a business philosophy that says no matter where a person sits in the Omnicom network, she or he can be connected and involved as part of one team to drive superior results on behalf of a client. 
Our efforts in this area are driven through both formal and informal practices that preserve the individuality of -- and culture of our agency brands and deliver customized and integrated solutions to our clients. We believe our networks and agencies are already ahead of the competition on this front. 
However, to build our leadership position, in February, we announced the formation of specialized groups in health care and public relations. The health care organization, Omnicom Health Group, offers clients a single point of access to our network of over 3,000 dedicated communication and scientific specialists working in the largest, strongest individual health care specialty units in the business. The group is led by one of our seasoned executives, Ed Wise, former CEO of CDM Group. Ed and his team will make it easier for pharmaceutical clients, as well as direct-to-consumer health care brands, to tap into our service offerings in this area. 
As part of the health care offering, we also recently announced the launch of TBWA\WorldHealth. TBWA\WorldHealth brings together the pharmaceutical brands and professional expertise of 2 of our health care agencies with the consumer brands and creative skill sets of TBWA. Together, the people in this group excel at delivering differentiated offerings to both our professional and direct-to-consumer brands. Sharon Callahan, another seasoned executive and former CEO of professional health care agency, LLNS, will be CEO of TBWA\WorldHealth and will continue to serve as Chief Clients Officer for Omnicom Health Group. Robin Shapiro, former CEO of Corbett, will serve as the President.
The PR organization, Omnicom Public Relations Group, encompasses 10 public relations agencies, including 3 of the top global PR agencies worldwide, FleishmanHillard, Ketchum and Porter Novelli, with over 6,000 employees. Industry veteran, Karen van Bergen, formerly CEO of Porter Novelli, will lead Omnicom Public Relations group. 
The benefits in forming this group are numerous. We will be better equipped to deploy and align our agencies and talent to capabilities and expertise that best fits our client needs. We will be able to hire, train and develop top talent and provide greater career opportunities across each of these categories. The alignments will also provide knowhow and economies in areas such as technology, better solutions, production and analytics as well as digital development. Lastly, we will be able to make investments and pursue acquisitions that will benefit all agencies across the groups.
However, in making these changes, what we are not doing is combining or eliminating our individual agencies' distinct cultures. As I mentioned earlier, it's part of our heritage to respect the individuality and culture of our agency brands and it sets us apart from the competition. So we will ensure that our people will benefit from being part of these new groups while remaining connected to the individual culture of their agencies.
I'm pleased to report that after a short period of time, we are seeing the results from both of the new groups. Omnicom Health Care Group has already been invited to participate in a global creative review for all of the consumer health brands from one of our clients. And Omnicom PR is currently working on several new business opportunities, including a significant global pitch that is underway across multiple PR firms in collaboration with other Omnicom agencies. Together, and as strong independent brands, I'm confident that both Omnicom Public Relations Group and Omnicom Health Care Group will provide the best of the best in the business, from talents and ideas to innovation and creativity for the benefit of our people and our clients. 
Another area, where we are both broadening and deepening our service offering with the best talent and the latest technology, is in media. Technology and data have radically changed the media business. Years ago, when media was unbundled from creative agencies, the focus was on buying scale and efficiency, and this goal stayed front and center with global advertisers for many years. Today, while scale and efficiency remain important, targeting, measurement and effectiveness have become essential in the fluid and personalized world where consumers are accessing a wide variety of content on different devices. 
The rise of digital data and analytics has given us the ability to more precisely understand how consumers are accessing media and how they're responding to messages. Given this new reality, it is not surprising that an increasing number of clients are becoming more focused on how data informed media can be effective at driving business results and then less focused on legacy media specific measurements. 
As an example, our data platform contains audience behavior information, and we're now going a step further by integrating cultural trends, using information derived from our cultural intelligence system. This system allows us to understand shifts in cultures and give insight into where the world is going. We can then fuse the behavioral and cultural insights to provide our creative and media agencies with more informed briefs that can tap into these trends. All of this is done 24 hours a day and in real time.
As I mentioned on our last conference call, in the fourth quarter of 2015, Omnicom was awarded the media planning and buying business of Procter & Gamble North America. The win is a great example of how our media organization has integrated data and analytics and marketing science capabilities into its core service. 
Coming out of this, our media group has launched a new media agency, alongside our leading OMD and PHD brands. We've recently announced the formation of Hearts & Science, which is being led by Scott Hagedorn, formerly CEO of Annalect, with Kathleen Brookbanks, previously of OMD, serving as COO. Hearts & Science has a unique position in the media space as a data-driven marketing agency that has been established from day 1 to share the same qualities as our Annalect data and analytics platform, which is now at the foundation of all of our media agencies. That means Hearts & Science will strive to be agile in process to use technology at scale and to employ open standards and to excel in an investable media world. Given Scott's new role at Hearts & Science, Slavi Samardzija, as Global CEO, and Erin Matts, as North American CEO, will succeed him at Annalect.
Now I'd like to turn to a topic that has always been a priority for Omnicom, creating a great environment for great people to work. A critical aspect of achieving our talent development goals is creating a diverse and inclusive workplace. That means diversity in backgrounds, race, gender, age and experience. Quite frankly, we need to look more like the businesses, people and consumers we do business with, and it has been a priority at Omnicom to create a diverse, world-class workforce that reflects our global community. Omnicom's commitment to diversity starts from the top. With our independent board members now including 4 women and 2 minority members. 
In 2009, Omnicom created the role of Senior Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer. This role has since expanded throughout the company. Our individual networks now employ their own directors of diversity or chief diversity officers and 12 professionals are dedicated full time to overseeing and advancing diversity and inclusion efforts at every level of our organization. 
A few years ago, a leading group of women at Omnicom launched Omniwomen, an effort designed to increase the influence and number of women leaders throughout the company. Recently, Omniwomen hosted an historic panel with our network CEOs, discussing the topic of women's leadership and its importance to doing business in the 21st century. The leadership of Omniwomen -- and I firmly believe that this is not a women's issue but a business issue that needs commitment from the top. But words are just words if actions don't follow, and I'm proud of the actions we are seeing within Omnicom.
A number of our networks have launched their own programs to increase the influence of women, including: TBWA, Take The Lead 2020; DDB, Talent Has No Gender; BBDO is seeking to double its senior women creatives over the next 12 months. In our U.S. Media Group, 50% of the people that are director level or above and working data or analytics are women, and women run 40% of the top-performing agencies in the DAS network. These are just a few of the many initiatives and data points that illustrate the focus Omnicom places on the topic of diversity and inclusion. 
We have made great strides in the area of diversity. But as Wendy Clark, CEO of DDB North America, recently said, and I agree, we need to remain restless on the discussion of gender and diversity and not allow it to become a conversation only when something wrong happens. 
Omnicom enters its 30th year as a talented and more diverse organization all around the world. We achieved our goals for organic revenue growth, margins and profitability in the first quarter, and we are on track for a successful 2016.
I'll now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at first quarter results. Phil?"
96161,330920276,959528,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, during the first quarter of 2016, our businesses continued to meet the financial and strategic objectives we've set for them as well as adapt to the ever evolving needs of their clients. As a result of thes",2599,"Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, during the first quarter of 2016, our businesses continued to meet the financial and strategic objectives we've set for them as well as adapt to the ever evolving needs of their clients. As a result of these efforts, our businesses have continued their strong operating performance. Our organic revenue growth of 3.8% in Q1 was a little bit better than our expectations. 
As has been the case for over a year, FX continues to create a negative headwind on our revenue, although this past quarter, it was at a lower level than it's been in quite a while. In Q1, the impact of FX reduced revenue by 2.8% or $97 million. Except for Japan, reported FX was negative again across every one of our significant foreign markets. As a result, total revenue for the quarter was about $3.5 billion, an increase of just shy of 1% versus Q1 last year. I will discuss our revenue growth in detail in a few minutes. 
Moving down the P&L. Below revenue, our EBITA increased 3.8% to $420 million, and the resulting EBITA margin was 12%, which was up 30 basis points over Q1 of last year. The margin improvement, which was in line with our expectations for the full year of 2016, is the result of our continuing efforts to leverage our scale to increase operating efficiencies throughout the organization as we continue to pursue several initiatives in the areas of real estate, information technology, back-office services and strategic purchasing. Operating income, or EBIT, for the quarter increased 3.8% to $392 million with operating margin improving to 11.2%, in line with the increase in our EBITA margin. 
Now turning to items below operating income. Net interest expense for the quarter was $40.1 million, up $3.3 million from the fourth quarter of last year and up $5.9 million versus Q1 of 2015. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, the increase in net interest expense of $3.3 million resulted from the impact of the termination in January of the $1 billion of fixed to floating interest rate swaps we had on our 2022 notes as well as some additional interest expense on debt we assumed in the Grupo ABC transaction, which has since been refinanced. By terminating the swaps, we locked in interest savings over the remaining life of the 2022 bonds, reducing the all-in effective rate to 2.7% from 3.5%. However, in Q1, there was less floating rate benefit from the swaps, and this will also be the case for the balance of 2016 when compared to 2015. 
Additionally, interest income earned by our international operations in Q1 was lower compared to Q4 of 2015, driven by lower cash balances available to invest as a result of higher working capital needs, which are typical as we move through the first half of the year.
As compared to Q1 of last year, the increase in net interest expense of $5.9 million also related to the termination of the fixed to floating interest rate swaps on our 2022 notes as well as some additional interest expense on local debt we assumed in the ABC transaction, which has since been refinanced.
When analyzing the impact of the termination of the 2022 swaps on a year-over-year basis, the benefit we received from the swaps in Q1 of '15 was larger than the benefit we received in Q4 of '15 because the underlying floating interest rate on the swaps increased during '15. As a result of closing out the swaps, we reduced some of exposure to the volatility of potential further increases in the underlying short-term interest rates. Partially offsetting the additional expense was an increase in interest income from cash invested in our international treasury centers net of some negative FX translation impact in the quarter. 
Our quarterly tax rate of 32.8% is in line with our current tax rate projection for 2016. Our earnings from affiliates was slightly negative during the first quarter but up versus the prior year. We saw improvements in the quarter in the performance of some of our European and Asian affiliates, which was offset by sluggishness of certain affiliates in Latin America. 
The allocation of earnings to the minority interest shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased $2.8 million to $17.9 million from $20.7 million, primarily due to the purchase of minority interests in certain subsidiaries over the past year as well as FX, because a significant portion of our less than fully owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S. As a result, net income was $218 million. That's an increase of $9 million or 4.4% versus Q1 of last year. The remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after the allocation of $1.5 million of net income to participating securities was $216.9 million, an increase of 5.1% versus last year. 
You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was 241.1 million, which is down 2.5% versus last year as a result of share buybacks over the past 12 months. As a result, diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.90 per share, an increase of $0.07 or 8.4% versus Q1 of 2015. 
Turning to Slide 4. We shift the discussion to our revenue performance. For the quarter, FX decreased our revenue by $97 million or 2.8%. While the U.S. dollar has continued its strength year-over-year on a global basis, we've begun to see that moderate somewhat on a reported basis when compared to what we've seen over the last several quarters. 
The decrease in the U.K. pound had the largest translation impact on our reported revenue in Q1, accounting for approximately 20% of the FX-driven revenue reduction while the euro and the Brazilian reais were the next largest negatives. When combined with the U.K. pound, 3 currencies made up almost 1/2 of the FX-driven reduction in our first quarter revenue.
Looking ahead, if rates stay where they are, negative impact of FX on our reported revenue may continue to moderate, reducing revenue by about 1.5% during the second quarter and approximately 1% for the full year. That being said, it is exceedingly difficult to estimate what will happen to FX rates over the remaining 8-plus months of the year.
Revenue from acquisitions, net of dispositions, decreased revenue slightly in the quarter. At the end of January, DDB completed the acquisition of Grupo ABC in Brazil, so our current year revenue includes 2 months of their current year results and our acquisition revenue includes their revenue for the same prior period in 2015. As a reminder, the net decrease in the quarter reflects the continuing impact of a few acquisitions and dispositions that we completed during 2015. Going forward, we expect that revenue from our collective recent acquisitions will be a net positive next quarter and for the year. And finally, organic growth was positive $131 million or 3.8% this quarter. 
It was another solid quarter of growth across all of our major markets with the exception of Brazil, the Netherlands and, to a lesser extent, Japan. Primary drivers of our growth this quarter included the continued strong performance across our media businesses and notable performances by several of our advertising brands across our geographies as well as our full-service health care businesses, which turned in solid performances in the quarter. Euro Markets overall had positive organic growth. The Asia Pacific region continued to show solid performance across most markets, particularly China and India, and we also benefited from good performance in both Mexico and the UAE. 
On Slide 5, we present our regional mix of business. During the quarter, the split was 61% for North America, 10% for the U.K., 16% for the rest of Europe, 10% for Asia Pacific with the remainder being split between Latin America and Africa and the Middle East. 
In North America, both the U.S. and Canada turned in solid performances. We had organic revenue growth of 4.5%, again, primarily driven this quarter by the performance of our advertising and media discipline and our health care businesses.
Turning to Europe. The U.K. had another quarter of positive organic growth, up 2.2%. The rest of Europe was up 3%, led by our agencies in Germany and Spain as well as good performance in Italy. Additionally, France had positive organic growth for the first time in a while the Netherlands continued to struggle and Poland had a down quarter. 
Asia Pacific was up 5.1% with solid performances from most of our major Asian markets, including China and India, with Japan down slightly. 
Africa and Middle East, although off a small base, was marginally positive. Our UAE businesses were strong performers offset by year-over-year reductions in the quarter in other smaller markets in that region.
One region that was down organically was Latin America. Our Brazilian agencies continue to face uncertainty in both the economic conditions and the political climate in the country. Revenues were down about 20% organically in the quarter. And while the quarter included the successful acquisition of Grupo ABC, the increase in revenue in the quarter from Grupo ABC was more than offset by the significant reduction in revenue resulting from both the negative impact of FX translation and the negative organic growth of our operating companies. As such, our reported revenues for Brazil were down in Q1 when compared to the prior year. In the region, the performance in Brazil overshadowed the strong performance by Mexico, which had double-digit organic growth in the quarter. 
Slide 6 shows our mix of business. For the quarter, the split was 52% for advertising services and 48% for marketing services. As for their performance, our advertising discipline was up 7.9% in the quarter, driven by the strong performance of our media businesses and notable performances by several of our advertising brands across our geographies. While CRM was down 0.7%, results were mixed across businesses and geographies. Our field marketing and point-of-sale businesses had a challenging quarter, and our activation and events businesses were flat while our research businesses performed well. PR was down 0.9%. We expect this performance to improve in the second half of the year. Specialty communications was up 2.2%, driven by the solid performance of our full-service health care agencies that was partially offset by the other smaller businesses in this discipline. 
On Slide 7, we present our mix of business by industry sector. In comparing the Q1 revenue for 2016 to 2015, you can see that there are minor changes in the mix of our client revenue by industry but nothing worth special notice.
Turning now to our cash flow performance. On Slide 8, you can see that in the first quarter we generated $346 million of free cash flow, including changes in working capital. 
As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 9, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $122 million. As you know, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend. The increase is scheduled for our next dividend payment. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $15 million, down due to our purchase in prior year periods of additional shares from our local partners. Capital expenditures were $41 million, and acquisitions, including earnout payments, the net of the proceeds received from the sale of investments, totaled $103 million. And stock repurchases, net of the proceeds received from the stock issuances under our employee share plans, totaled $193 million. All-in, we outspent our free cash flow in the quarter by about $129 million.
Turning to Slide 10. Regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter, our total debt at March 31, 2016, of $4.65 billion is up about $70 million from this time last year. That's primarily due to the change in the fair value of our debt's carrying value as required to be reported on the balance sheet under U.S. GAAP. Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $2.9 billion, down principally as a result of the increase in our cash balances versus this time last year. 
As you may know, after March 31, we closed on our issuance of $1.4 billion in 10-year senior notes at an effective rate of about 4.05%. So our quarter-end debt levels do not reflect this new issuance. Most of the proceeds of this issuance were used to retire the $1 billion of 2016 senior notes at the maturity date on April 15. The 2016 notes had a coupon of 5.9% and an effective rate of 5.25%. So even with the increased principal, the interest expense on new debt compared to the debt that recently matured will only be $4 million to $5 million higher on an annualized basis. 
However, for the year, we expect interest expense to increase in excess of $20 million primarily due to the changes that we previously mentioned to our fixed to floating interest rate swaps. As a result of these changes, we've adjusted the effective mix of our fixed to floating rate debt from approximately 50-50 a year ago to a 70% fixed, 30% floating mix today. By terminating some of these swaps, we reduced our exposure to further interest rate volatility and we locked in interest savings over the remaining life of the 2022 bonds. However, in the short term, we will receive less floating rate benefit from the swaps in 2016 when compared to 2015. 
The increase in our cash and short-term investments of $218 million over the past 12 months was driven primarily as a result of positive changes in our operating capital of $310 million, which were partially offset by the negative impact of FX translation of approximately $45 million on our cash balance over the last 12 months as well as the slight overspend of our free cash flow of $17 million. 
Net debt increased by $951 million compared to year-end as a result of the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of approximately $130 million, adjustments to the carrying value of our debt of about $45 million and the typical uses of cash for working capital that historically occur in our first quarter of approximately $805 million. These increases in net debt were partially offset by the effective exchange rates on cash during Q1 that increased our cash balance by about $80 million.
As for our ratios, our total debt to EBITDA was 2.1x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3x, essentially unchanged since this time last year. And due to the increase in our interest expense, our interest coverage ratio went down to 11.9x, but it remains very strong. 
Turning to Slide 11. We continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well-focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased 19.3% and return on equity increased 46.3%. 
And finally, on Slide 12, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders over the past 10-plus years. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2006 to Q1 of 2016, which totaled $9.8 billion, and the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which, during the same period, totaled $10.9 billion for a cumulative payout ratio of 111%. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we've included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions."

In terms of how much time spent, I'm not sure I got that part of the question clearly. But as far as our expectations for the year and the timing, certainly, we probably spent more time pursuing initiatives in the area of real estate here. It's an initiative that's taking quite some time, major market by major market, and there's still more to come, because we've had the plan and lined up a number of leases in each of our major markets as opposed to moving out of less efficient real estate into hub buildings and taking a big charge for vacating real estate. We haven't taken that approach. We've been a little more patient.

By having a single individual or team that becomes intimately familiar with the 6,000 people we have there, we'll -- we will do a better job, I think, of -- and increase our opportunities of winning new business, simply from the knowledge and the control of somebody's that focused 100% of the time on managing our PR assets. I hope that answers your question."

Thank you for joining our call. Second quarter organic revenue growth was 3.4%, continuing the pace we set last quarter and in line with our expectations.

Second quarter organic revenue growth was 3.4%, continuing the pace we set last quarter and in line with our expectations. We also met our margin targets for the quarter and remain on track to deliver a 30 basis point margin improvement for the full year of 2016 or 13.7% EBITA versus 13.4% in '15. 
For the second quarter, EBITA margin was 15.2% versus 14.9% last year. Our results were solid during the quarter even in the face of continued currency headwinds. In the second quarter, 44% of our total revenue was derived from markets outside the United States. As a result, foreign currency in the second quarter reduced our revenue by $63 million or 1.6%. It's too early to fully assess the impact resulting from the ongoing Brexit discussions and upcoming U.S. elections. So far, the most significantly effect is the continuing weakness of the British pound on our reported revenues. 
Additionally, when combined with backdrop in recent really [indiscernible] related events, clients have become more cautious with the most immediate effect being the cancellation of some customer events, which has had an impact on some of our CRM businesses. Phil will provide more details during his remarks. 
Looking up our organic growth, it was broad-based across geographies. Our strong consistent performance over many years is a testament to the strength of our services and the diversity of our offerings across the portfolio. By region, North America was up 3.2% with our media, advertising and specialty health businesses performing quite well during the quarter. 
Our growth in the North American reflects in part the new business we captured in the United States in 2015 as well as the continued to strength of our digital and data-driven platforms. Revenue from some of our 2015 new business wins start in the second half of this year and recent new business wins like Volkswagen media started in 2017. 
In terms of client trends, we continue to see growth in digital media despite increasing concerns around digital measurement, viewability and fraud. We also see modest growth in TV budgets, which is fueling a stronger upfront U.S. TV market with pricing up double digits in many cases. 
Please note, these increases while good for the TV business, do not directly correlate to an increase in revenue to us. Our U.K. growth was 3.3%, with specialty health care and public relations having a very strong performances in the market this quarter. In the Euro Markets, Spain, Germany were positive; France and Netherlands were slightly negative for the quarter as those countries continue to experience tepid economic growth. 
Outside the Euro Markets, we had very strong growth with the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, Turkey generated solid results. 
Looking ahead, it is still too early to know what the impact of Brexit will be for the advertising market in Europe. What is clear is that the U.K. decision to leave the EU creates uncertainty and may slow down decision-making in many markets. Our agencies continue to operate without disruption in the U.K. and Europe. Over time, we expect the volatility and the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote to subside and for our agencies to adapt to the post-Brexit marketplace. 
Omnicom remains committed to serve the needs of our clients in the U.K. and European markets and to our people who provide great value to them. 
Turning to Asia. Second quarter organic growth was 4.5%, with almost all of our markets showing positive results, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam were exceptionally strong in the quarter. 
And Latin America grew 1.7% with Mexico well into double digits which more than offsets the negative performance in Brazil. While Brazil continues to be a challenge, we saw a better performance compared to the first quarter of this year. We are hopeful that this trend will continue and that the recent changes in leadership and economic policies as well as the Olympics later this summer will have a lasting positive effect. 
Looking at our bottom line, EPS increased 7.9% to $1.36 per share for the quarter versus $1.26 per share in the same quarter a year ago. Excluding the impact of currencies, EPS would have been higher for the quarter. Phil will provide details during his remarks. 
Our results follow a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.50 to $0.55 earlier in this quarter. Finally, our balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance for the quarter and the first half of the year. 
Turning now to media and the ANA report, which was released earlier in June, as we said from the outset, our U.S. media agencies do not seek or retain rebates and return to clients all value negotiated in the form it is received. 
In the case of 1 global digital media provider, there is an incentive provision in our agreement that includes the U.S. This incentive continues to be returned to all clients in the U.S. on a pro rata basis according to their spending with this provider. We have contacted our clients to review our agency buying protocols, reassure them of the practices we follow and address any questions that they have. At Omnicom, we maintain a strong compliance controls in both meeting the [ph] of our client relationships and the terms of our client contracts. 
Our outside counsel, formerly ask ANA, K2 [ph] and [ph] to share any specific findings relating to Omnicom so we can answer continuing contracting clients. No findings have been provided. 
It is our hope that after the ubiquity report as we release, the ANA and the 4A's will restore the joint task force that was suspended earlier this year. So that a meaningful and clear agreement on joint practices and principles can be reached between advertisers and the agencies. 
With respect to our media operations, we continued to outperform the industry. Volkswagen recently selected Omnicom Media Group's PHD as its global media agency following a lengthy review. It was a huge winter PHD covering all BW group brands, including Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, Fiat, Skoda and commercial vehicles. Volkswagen indicated that our teams stood out versus the competition by offering new digital data and analytical techniques for improved media targeting. 
In addition to VW, PHD also won media assignments from Delta Air Lines and Carnival Cruise Lines and our OMB media agency won ancestry.com business. These results follow the win of P&G's North American media business and the creation of our third media network, Hearts & Science, which launched with integrated data and analytics and marketing science capabilities into its core media service. 
What we've been seeing in media we are now experiencing more broadly across our advertising businesses as more clients are focused on leveraging data to inform creative messaging decisions. 
In several new business opportunities, clients are asking us to increase the collaboration of our media and creative services in order to maximize these benefits. The changes we are seeing underscore the importance of talent and capabilities we've assembled in Annalect, our data and analytics platform, which has integrated its sources across many of our agencies, allowing our creative talent to bring new insights and value to clients. 
Across Omnicom, we continue to expand our capabilities and simplify our service offerings to internal investments in our agencies and through acquisitions. We recently announced the formation of 2 groups, 1 that aggregates our diverse offerings in the global health care industry into Omnicom Health Group and 1 that combines the strengths of all Omnicom's public relation firms, Omnicom PR group. Both groups made their first acquisitions in the second quarter. Omnicom PR Group acquired David Martyn, a health care consulting firm that focuses global public health issues, including chronic disease, enhancing women's health and preventing the spread of infectious disease. Rave and [ph] deep expertise in global public health is an important and growing specialty area as an increasing number of our clients see the need to address critical health issues in the world. 
Omnicom Health Group's first acquisition was Bio Pharm, an agency that specializes in multichannel marketing programs for pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients. Founded in 2005, Biopharma is an impressive client roster, which includes 17 of the 25 largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Omnicom's Health Group is organized by service offerings into 4 primary categories based on client needs: Professional, patient, payer, and regulatory evidence in medical. 
To further our capabilities in professional services, we recently launched DDB Health. DDB Health includes 5 professional health care agencies spanning in the U.S. and Europe. Omnicom Health Group now has creatively inspire dedicated partnerships with each of our global creative networks, TBWA WorldHealth, BBDO health works and DDB Health. I'm happy to report that we're seeing good results strategic and operationally from both Omnicom Health Group and Omnicom Public Relations Group. We're also in the process of forming another group comprised of our independent national agencies, including good [ph] team, GST [ph] , margarines and and [ph], among others. While these agencies will continue to go-to-market is independent brands, we believe placing them in a singular group will provide benefits through the sharing of best practices across their management and operations. 
Finally, I recently returned from the Canada Festival. I'm always impressed when I meet our creative talent from around the world. I'm proud to report that the caliber of our creative continues to be outstanding. We prove once again we have the best people in business producing award winning campaigns for our clients. 
Here are few of the highlights demonstrating the depth and breadth of channel. [ph] 90 Omnicom agencies won almost 300 [ph] lines from 27 different countries across more than 20 categories. Omnicom Media Group including OMD and PHD earned the most media lines of any media agency holding company scoring a grand total of 15 awards. 
BBDO plays second and DDB was fourth in the Network of the Year category and finally, BBDO won the title of Agency of the Year. I want to congratulate all of our people and our agencies for their outstanding work. Our investments and talent technology and farmer order ships are making a difference for Omnicom and our agencies. They are critical to our success that we will continue to strategic only invest in these areas as the marketing environment increases in complexity. In closing, we achieved our goals for organic growth, margins and profitability in the second quarter while it is impossible to predict and the affect of Brexit as well as the impact of the U.S. presidential elections, we remain cautiously optimistic for the second half of the year and on target to achieve our 2016 plan. 
I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the second quarter results. Phil?"
96161,372943786,1006608,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 14, 2016",2016-07-14,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, during second quarter of 2016, our business has once again delivered on their financial and strategic objectives while continuing to deliver best-in-class services to their clients. Our organic revenue gr",2316,"Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, during second quarter of 2016, our business has once again delivered on their financial and strategic objectives while continuing to deliver best-in-class services to their clients. 
Our organic revenue growth of 3.4% for the second quarter was in line with our expectations and keeps us on track to meet our organic growth target of 3% to 3.5% for the full year. As has been the case for the last several quarters, the strength of the dollar continues to create a negative FX headwind on our revenue. 
For the second quarter, the reduction was 1.6% overall or about $63 million. Net acquisitions added 0.3% to revenue this quarter. In addition to the Grupo ABC acquisition in Brazil that we close during the first quarter, in the second quarter, we added Rabun [ph], a health care public relations agencies; and BioPharm, a specialty health care agency, late in the second quarter. 
As a result, total revenue for the quarter was just under $3.9 billion, an increase of 2.1% versus Q2 of last year. I'll discuss our revenue growth in further detail in a few minutes. 
Moving down to P&L below revenue, our Q2 EBITDA increased 4.3% to $590 million. And the resulting EBITA margin of 15.2% represented a 30 basis point increase over Q2 of last year. The margin improvement, which is also in line with our expectations for the full year of 2016, is the result of our continuing efforts to leverage scale as we continue to pursue efficiency initiatives in the areas of real estate, back-office services, information technology and strategic purchasing across the entire organization. 
Operating income, or EBIT, for the quarter increased 4.3% to $562 million with operating margin improving to 14.5%, in line with the increase in our EBITA margin. Now turning to the items below operating income. Net interest expense for the quarter was $44.8 million, up $4.7 million versus the first quarter of 2016 and up $10.2 million versus Q2 of 2015. 
The increase in net interest expense versus the first quarter was primarily due to the termination of the fixed [ph] floating rate swaps on our 2016 and 2022 notes. As you know, in April, we issued $1.4 billion of 10-year senior notes and redeemed [ph] 1 billion of notes that reached maturity on April 15. Although we grew mentally added $400 million in debt, it had no effect on interest expense as rates have declined compared to when the up 2016 notes were each of. Interest income earned in Q2 was lower compared to Q1 of 2016 as a result of lower interest earned on our cash balances, which were lower on average during Q2. 
Similarly, as compared to Q2 of last year, the increase in net interest expense of $10.2 million was primarily related to the termination of the fixed to floating rate swaps on our 2016 and 2022 notes. 
Additionally, our interest income on our cash balances held by our international treasury centers decreased year-over-year, primarily driven by negative FX translation. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.5%, which is down slightly versus Q1 of 2016 and the prior year as well as a result of some small tax planning items. Earnings from our affiliates totaled $2.8 million for the quarter, down a bit versus Q2 of last year. 
The allocation of earnings to minority shareholders in our less than fully-owned subsidiaries decreased by $3 million to $25.8 million. The decrease is primarily as a result of 2 factors. First, the impact of FX because a large portion of our less than fully-owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S. And second, the purchase of the minority interest in certain subsidiaries over the past year. 
As a result, net income was $326 million, that's an increase of $12 million or 3.9% versus Q2 of last year. 
Turning to Slide 3, remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after allocation of $2 million of net income to participating securities was $324 million, an increase of 4.5% versus last year. 
You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was 239 million shares, which is down 2.7% versus last year as a result of repurchases of shares over the past year. As a result, diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.36, up $0.10 or 7.9% versus Q2 of 2015. 
On Slides 4 through 6, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the year-to-date period. Since the year-to-date results are essentially in line with the results for the quarter, I'll just give you a few highlights. 
While organic revenue growth was 3.6% during the first 6 months of the year, the FX headwind reduced revenue by 2.2%. Factoring in the increase from acquisitions net of dispositions, of 0.1%, our revenue increased on a year-to-date basis by 1.5% to just under $7.4 billion. 
EBITDA increased 4.1% to just over $1 billion. As a result of the initiatives we've mentioned over the last several calls, both and operating margins in the year-to-date aces have increased consistent with the increase from Q2. 
And on Slide 6, you can see our 6-month diluted EPS of [ph] $2.25 per share, which is up $0.16 or 7.7% versus 2015. Turning to Slide 7, we shifted the discussion to our revenue performance. Starting with FX for the quarter, the net impact decreased our revenue by $63 million or 1.6%. The dollar remains relatively strong overall and when compared to Q2 of 2015, strengthened on a reported basis against most of our major currencies, including the pound, the real, the Chinese yuan and the Australian and Canadian dollars. However, the U.S. dollar weakened on a reported basis against the euro and the yen. 
Looking ahead, if rates stay were they are, the negative impact of FX may reduce revenue by about 1.5% during the third quarter and for the full year. That being said, given the result of the Brexit vote and the current volatility in the pound as well as other global currencies, this estimate is certainly subject to further change as we move through the second half of the year. Revenue from acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue $13.2 million in the quarter or 0.3%. Along with the acquisition of Grupo ABC in Brazil during the first quarter, this figure included the impact of the acquisitions we've made in the U.S. and Europe over the past 12 months. The net figure also includes the impact of some strategic dispositions that we've completed as well. 
Going forward, we expect the net impact of acquisitions and dispositions will continue to be positive by about approximately 50 basis points per quarter. And finally, organic growth was positive $129 million or 3.4% this quarter. It was a solid quarter of growth across all of our major markets with the exception of Brazil, France and the Netherlands. 
The primary drivers of our growth this quarter include the continued strong performance across our media businesses as well as several of our advertising brands, our full-service health care businesses, which turned in solid performances; and despite weaknesses France and Netherlands, the Euro Markets overall had positive organic growth. The Asia Pacific region also had solid performances across almost all of our markets. And in Latin America, excellent performance by our agencies in Mexico, which are option continued challenges experienced in Brazil. 
Further highlighting our regional mix of business on Slide 8, you can see during the quarter the split was 60% for North America, 9% for the U.K., 16% for the rest of Europe, 10% for Asia Pacific, 3% for Latin America and 2% for Africa and Middle East. 
Turning to the details of the performance by region on Slide 9, in North America, we had organic revenue growth of 3.2%, driven by the continued strong performance of our media businesses as well as several advertising brands and our full-service health care businesses. 
In Europe, the U.K. had organic growth of 3.3% on the strength of our specialty health and PR businesses. The rest of Europe was up for .3 percent led by our agencies in Spain and the Czech Republic, with solid performance in Poland and Russia as well. 
Germany was also positive while the Netherlands and France lagged with negative growth. The Asia Pacific region was up 4.5%, most markets growing very well during the quarter, including Greater China and Japan. And although relatively small, we also saw a double-digit organic growth from many of our emerging market countries in the region, including India, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. 
In Latin America, strong performance by our agencies in Mexico offset continued weakness in Brazil as the region was up organically 1.7% for the quarter. Brazil was down once again with the negative impact this quarter was better compared to Q1 of 2016. However, it's still too early to tell when the political and economic situation will stabilize. And Africa and Middle East, which is our smallest region, was slightly negative. 
Slide 10 shows our mix of business by discipline. For the quarter, the split was 53% for advertising services and 47% for marketing services. Our advertising discipline was up 7.7% in the quarter, led by the performance of our global media businesses and several of our advertising brands. 
While CRM was down 2.7%, the results were mixed across businesses and geographies. The reduction in CRM was driven primarily by our events, field marketing and point-of-sale businesses. PR was flat in this quarter as we mentioned in the last quarter's call, we expect this performance to continue to improve as we move through the second half of the year and specialty communications was up 4.4% organically. The solid performance was driven by Omnicom Health Group with several new business wins by a were full-service health care agencies. 
On Slide 11, we present our mix of business by industry sector. When comparing the year-to-date revenue for 2016 to 2015, you can see there was some minor shifts in the distribution of our client revenue by industry but nothing particularly significant. 
Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 12, you can see that in the first 6 months of the year, we generated $722 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. As for our primary uses of the cash on Slide 13, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $243 million. Keep in mind though the 10% increase in our quarterly dividend that we announced back in April was effective with the payment we made in early July. So the cash flow impact of the increase will be seen starting in Q3. 
Dividends paves to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $52 million. This is down versus last year due to purchase of additional shares from our local partners in prior year periods. Capital expenditures were $78 million; acquisitions, including earnout payments totaled $360 million; and stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances our other employee share plans totaled $352 million. All-in, we have spent our free cash flow by about $362 million in the first half of the year. 
Turning to Slide 14, regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter, our total debt at June 30, 2016, of just over $5 billion is up about $490 million from this time last year, reflecting the incremental $400 million increase in our borrowings related to the debt issuance back in April as well as an increase in the noncash fair value of our debt of about $90 million directly related to an offset by the positive fair value of their respective interest rate swaps on our debt as required to be reported on the balance sheet under U.S. GAAP. 
Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $3.5 billion, up $310 million versus the June 30, 2015 amount, primarily resulting from 2 noncash items in the quarter. The increase in that from the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps and it the reduction on in cash from the negative effect of FX translation of the balance sheet dates from our foreign cash balances. Additionally, the positive change in our operating capital were approximately $250 million was more than offset by our offer spend free cash flow of $290 million. 
Net debt increased by $1,546 million compared to year-end as a result of the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of approximately $362 million and uses of working capital that typically occur in our first half of the year of approximately $1.1 billion. 
As for our ratios, they've increased slightly, reflected increase our debt since this time last year. Our total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.2x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.6x. And due to the increase in our interest expense, our interest coverage ratio went down to 11.4x but it remains quite solid. 
Turning to Slide 15, we continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions. 
For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 18.4% and return on equity increased to 45.3%. 
And finally, on Slide 16, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders over the past 10-plus years. The line on top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2006 through Q2 of 2016, which totaled $10.1 billion. And the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $11.2 billion for a cumulative payout ratio of 111%. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we've included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review but at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you. Thanks."

Second quarter organic revenue growth was 3.4%, continuing the pace we set last quarter and in line with our expectations. We also met our margin targets for the quarter and remain on track to deliver a 30 basis point margin improvement for the full year of 2016 or 13.7% EBITA versus 13.4% in '15. 
For the second quarter, EBITA margin was 15.2% versus 14.9% last year. Our results were solid during the quarter even in the face of continued currency headwinds. In the second quarter, 44% of our total revenue was derived from markets outside the United States. As a result, foreign currency in the second quarter reduced our revenue by $63 million or 1.6%. It's too early to fully assess the impact resulting from the ongoing Brexit discussions and upcoming U.S. elections. So far, the most significantly effect is the continuing weakness of the British pound on our reported revenues. 
Additionally, when combined with the backdrop of recent terrorist-related events, clients have become more cautious with the most immediate effect being the cancellation of some customer events, which has had an impact on some of our CRM businesses. Phil will provide more details during his remarks. 
Looking at our organic growth, it was broad-based across geographies. Our strong consistent performance over many years is a testament to the strength of our services and the diversity of our offerings across the portfolio. By region, North America was up 3.2% with our media, advertising and specialty health businesses performing quite well during the quarter. 
Our growth in North America reflects in part the new business we captured in the United States in 2015 as well as the continued strength of our digital and data-driven platforms. Revenue from some of our 2015 new business wins start in the second half of this year and recent new business wins like Volkswagen media start in 2017. 
In terms of client trends, we continue to see growth in digital media despite increasing concerns around digital measurement, viewability and fraud. We also see modest growth in TV budgets, which is fueling a stronger upfront U.S. TV market with pricing up double digits in many cases. 
Please note, these increases while good for the TV business, do not directly correlate to an increase in revenue to us. Our U.K. growth was 3.3%, with specialty health care and public relations having very strong performances in the market this quarter. In the Euro Markets, Spain, Germany were positive; France and Netherlands were slightly negative for the quarter as those countries continue to experience tepid economic growth. 
Outside the Euro Markets, we had very strong growth with the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia and Turkey generating solid results. 
Looking ahead, it is still too early to know what the impact of Brexit will be for the advertising market in Europe. What is clear is that the U.K. decision to leave the EU creates uncertainty and may slow down decision-making in many markets. Our agencies continue to operate without disruption in the U.K. and Europe. Over time, we expect the volatility and the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote to subside and for our agencies to adapt to the post-Brexit marketplace. 
Omnicom remains committed to serve the needs of our clients in the U.K. and European markets and to our people who provide great value to them. 
Turning to Asia. Second quarter organic growth was 4.5%, with almost all of our markets showing positive results, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam were exceptionally strong in the quarter. 
And Latin America grew 1.7% with Mexico well into double digits which more than offset the negative performance in Brazil. While Brazil continues to be a challenge, we saw better performance compared to the first quarter of this year. We are hopeful that this trend will continue and that the recent changes in leadership and economic policies as well as the Olympics later this summer will have a lasting positive effect. 
Looking at our bottom line, EPS increased 7.9% to $1.36 per share for the quarter versus $1.26 per share to the same quarter a year ago. Excluding the impact of currencies, EPS would have been higher for the quarter. Phil will provide details during his remarks. 
Our results follow a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.50 to $0.55 earlier in this quarter. Finally, our balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance for the quarter and the first half of the year. 
Turning now to media and the ANA report, which was released earlier in June, as we said from the outset, our U.S. media agencies do not seek or retain rebates and return to clients all value negotiated in the form it is received. 
In the case of 1 global digital media provider, there is an incentive provision in our agreement that includes the U.S. This incentive continues to be returned to all clients in the U.S. on a pro rata basis according to their spending with this provider. We have contacted our clients to review our agency buying protocols, reassure them of the practices we follow and address any questions that they have. At Omnicom, we maintain strong compliance controls in both meeting the spirit of our client relationships and the terms of our client contracts. 
Our outside counsel, formerly asked ANA, K2 and Ebiquity to share any specific findings relating to Omnicom so we can ensure continuing contracting clients. No findings have been provided. 
It is our hope that after the Ebiquity report is released, the ANA and the 4A's restore the joint task force that was suspended earlier this year. So that a meaningful and clear agreement on joint practices and principles can be reached between advertisers and the agencies. 
With respect to our media operations, we continued to outperform the industry. Volkswagen recently selected Omnicom Media Group's PHD as its global media agency following a lengthy review. It was a huge win for PHD covering all BW group brands, including Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, Fiat, Skoda and commercial vehicles. Volkswagen indicated that our teams stood out versus the competition by offering new digital data and analytical techniques for improved media targeting. 
In addition to VW, PHD also won media assignments from Delta Air Lines and Carnival Cruise Lines and our OMD media agency won ancestry.com business. These results follow the win of P&G's North American media business and the creation of our third media network, Hearts & Science, which launched with integrated data and analytics and marketing science capabilities into its core media service. 
What we've been seeing in media we are now experiencing more broadly across our advertising businesses as more clients are focused on leveraging data to inform creative messaging decisions. 
In several new business opportunities, clients are asking us to increase the collaboration of our media and creative services in order to maximize these benefits. The changes we are seeing underscore the importance of the talent and capabilities we've assembled in Annalect, our data and analytics platform, which has integrated its resources across many of our agencies, allowing our creative talent to bring new insight and value to clients. 
Across Omnicom, we continue to expand our capabilities and simplify our service offerings through internal investments in our agencies and through acquisitions. We recently announced the formation of 2 groups, 1 that aggregates our diverse offerings in the global health care industry into Omnicom Health Group and 1 that combines the strengths of all Omnicom's public relation firms, Omnicom PR group. Both groups made their first acquisitions in the second quarter. Omnicom PR Group acquired Rabin Martin, a health care consulting firm that focuses on global public health issues, including chronic disease, enhancing women's health and preventing the spread of infectious disease. Rabin Martin's deep expertise in global public health is an important and growing specialty area as an increasing number of our clients see the need to address critical health issues in the world. 
Omnicom Health Group's first acquisition was BioPharm, an agency that specializes in multichannel marketing programs for pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients. Founded in 2005, BioPharm has an impressive client roster, which includes 17 of the 25 largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Omnicom's Health Group is organized by service offerings into 4 primary categories based on client needs: Professional, patient, payer, and regulatory evidence in medical. 
To further our capabilities in professional services, we recently launched DDB Health. DDB Health includes 5 professional health care agencies spanning in the U.S. and Europe. Omnicom Health Group now has creatively inspired dedicated partnerships with each of our global creative networks, TBWA\WorldHealth, BBDO Health Works and DDB Health. I'm happy to report that we're seeing good results strategically and operationally from both Omnicom Health Group and Omnicom Public Relations Group. We're also in the process of forming another group comprised of our independent national agencies, including Goodby, Silverstein, GSD&M, Martin Williams, and Zimmerman among others. While these agencies will continue to go-to-market as independent brands, we believe placing them in a singular group will provide benefits through the sharing of best practices across their management and operations. 
Finally, I recently returned from the  Cannes Lions Festival. I'm always impressed when I meet our creative talent from around the world. I'm proud to report the caliber of our creative continues to be outstanding. We proved once again we have the best people in business producing award winning campaigns for our clients. 
Here are few of the highlights demonstrating the depth and breadth of our channel. 90 Omnicom agencies won almost 300 Lions from 27 different countries across more than 20 categories. Omnicom Media Group including OMD and PHD earned the most media Lions of any media agency holding company scoring a grand total of 15 awards. 
BBDO placed second and DDB was fourth in the Network of the Year category and finally, AlmapBBDO won the title of Agency of the Year. I want to congratulate all of our people and our agencies for their outstanding work. Our investments in talent, technology, and partnerships are making a difference for Omnicom and our agencies. They are critical to our success. We will continue to strategically invest in these areas as the marketing environment increases in complexity. In closing, we achieved our goals for organic growth, margins and profitability in the second quarter while it is impossible to predict the effects of Brexit as well as the impact of the U.S. presidential elections, we remain cautiously optimistic for the second half of the year and on target to achieve our 2016 plan. 
I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the second quarter results. Phil?"
96161,372943786,1006756,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 14, 2016",2016-07-14,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, during the second quarter of 2016, our business has once again delivered on their financial and strategic objectives while continuing to deliver best-in-class services to their clients. Our organic revenu",2303,"Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, during the second quarter of 2016, our business has once again delivered on their financial and strategic objectives while continuing to deliver best-in-class services to their clients. 
Our organic revenue growth of 3.4% for the second quarter was in line with our expectations and keeps us on track to meet our organic growth target of 3% to 3.5% for the full year. As has been the case for the last several quarters, the strength of the dollar continues to create a negative FX headwind on our revenue. 
For the second quarter, the reduction was 1.6% overall or about $63 million. Net acquisitions added 0.3% to revenue this quarter. In addition to the Grupo ABC acquisition in Brazil that we closed during the first quarter, in the second quarter, we added Rabin Martin, a health care public relations agency; and BioPharm, a specialty health care agency, late in the second quarter. 
As a result, total revenue for the quarter was just under $3.9 billion, an increase of 2.1% versus Q2 of last year. I'll discuss our revenue growth in further detail in a few minutes. 
Moving down to P&L below revenue, our Q2 EBITA increased 4.3% to $590 million. And the resulting EBITA margin of 15.2% represented a 30 basis point increase over Q2 of last year. The margin improvement, which is also in line with our expectations for the full year of 2016, is the result of our continuing efforts to leverage scale as we continue to pursue efficiency initiatives in the areas of real estate, back-office services, information technology and strategic purchasing across the entire organization. 
Operating income, or EBIT, for the quarter increased 4.3% to $562 million with operating margin improving to 14.5%, in line with the increase in our EBITA margin. Now turning to the items below operating income. Net interest expense for the quarter was $44.8 million, up $4.7 million versus the first quarter of 2016 and up $10.2 million versus Q2 of 2015. 
The increase in net interest expense versus the first quarter was primarily due to the termination of the fixed-to-floating rate swaps on our 2016 and 2022 notes. As you know, in April, we issued $1.4 billion of 10-year senior notes and redeemed 1 billion of notes that reached maturity on April 15. Although we incrementally added $400 million in debt, it had little effect on interest expense as rates have declined compared to when the 2016 notes were issued. Interest income earned in Q2 was lower compared to Q1 of 2016 as a result of lower interest earned on our cash balances, which were lower on average during Q2. 
Similarly, as compared to Q2 of last year, the increase in net interest expense of $10.2 million was primarily related to the termination of the fixed-to-floating rate swaps on our 2016 and 2022 notes. 
Additionally, our interest income on our cash balances held by our international treasury centers decreased year-over-year, primarily driven by negative FX translation. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.5%, which is down slightly versus Q1 of 2016 and the prior year as well as a result of some small tax planning items. Earnings from our affiliates totaled $2.8 million for the quarter, down a bit versus Q2 of last year. 
The allocation of earnings to minority shareholders in our less than fully-owned subsidiaries decreased by $3 million to $25.8 million. The decrease is primarily as a result of 2 factors. First, the impact of FX because a large portion of our less than fully-owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S. And second, purchase of minority interest in certain subsidiaries over the past year. 
As a result, net income was $326 million, that's an increase of $12 million or 3.9% versus Q2 of last year. 
Turning to Slide 3, remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after allocation of $2 million of net income to participating securities was $324 million, an increase of 4.5% versus last year. 
You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was 239 million shares, which is down 2.7% versus last year as a result of repurchases of shares over the past year. As a result, diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.36, up $0.10 or 7.9% versus Q2 of 2015. 
On Slides 4 through 6, we provided the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the year-to-date period. Since the year-to-date results are essentially in line with the results for the quarter, I'll just give you a few highlights. 
While organic revenue growth was 3.6% during the first 6 months of the year, the FX headwind reduced revenue by 2.2%. Factoring in the increase from acquisitions net of dispositions, of 0.1%, our revenue increased on a year-to-date basis by 1.5% to just under $7.4 billion. 
EBITDA increased 4.1% to just over $1 billion. As a result of the initiatives we've mentioned over the last several calls, both our EBITDA and operating margins on a year-to-date basis have increased consistent with the increase from Q2. 
And on Slide 6, you can see our 6-month diluted EPS, was $2.25 per share, which is up $0.16 or 7.7% versus 2015. Turning to Slide 7, we shift the discussion to our revenue performance. Starting with FX for the quarter, the net impact decreased our revenue by $63 million or 1.6%. The dollar remains relatively strong overall and when compared to Q2 of 2015, strengthened on a reported basis against most of our major currencies, including the pound, the real, the Chinese yuan and the Australian and Canadian dollars. However, the U.S. dollar weakened on a reported basis against the euro and the yen. 
Looking ahead, if rates stay where they are, the negative impact of FX may reduce revenue by about 1.5% during the third quarter and for the full year. That being said, given the result of the Brexit vote and the current volatility in the pound as well as other global currencies, this estimate is certainly subject to further change as we move through the second half of the year. Revenue from acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue $13.2 million in the quarter or 0.3%. Along with the acquisition of Grupo ABC in Brazil during the first quarter, this figure included the impact of the acquisitions we've made in the U.S. and Europe over the past 12 months. The net figure also includes the impact of some strategic dispositions that we've completed as well. 
Going forward, we expect the net impact of acquisitions and dispositions will continue to be positive by about approximately 50 basis points per quarter. And finally, organic growth was positive $129 million or 3.4% this quarter. It was a solid quarter of growth across all of our major markets with the exception of Brazil, France and the Netherlands. 
The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included the continued strong performance across our media businesses as well as several of our advertising brands, our full-service health care businesses, which turned in solid performances; and despite weaknesses in France and Netherlands, the Euro Markets overall had positive organic growth. The Asia-Pacific region also had solid performances across almost all of our markets. And in Latin America, excellent performance by our agencies in Mexico, which offset the continued challenges experienced in Brazil. 
Further highlighting our regional mix of business on Slide 8, you can see during the quarter the split was 60% for North America, 9% for the U.K., 16% for the rest of Europe, 10% for Asia-Pacific, 3% for Latin America and 2% for Africa and the Middle East. 
Turning to the details of the performance by region on Slide 9, in North America, we had organic revenue growth of 3.2%, driven by the continued strong performance of our media businesses as well as several advertising brands and our full-service health care businesses. 
In Europe, the U.K. had organic growth of 3.3% on the strength of our specialty health care and PR businesses. The rest of Europe was up 4.3% led by our agencies in Spain and the Czech Republic, with a solid performance in Poland and Russia as well. 
Germany was also positive while the Netherlands and France lagged with negative growth. The Asia Pacific region was up 4.5%, most markets growing very well during the quarter, including Greater China and Japan. And although relatively small, we also saw a double-digit organic growth from many of our emerging market countries in the region, including India, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. 
In Latin America, strong performance by our agencies in Mexico offset continued weakness in Brazil as the region was up organically 1.7% for the quarter. Brazil was down once again with the negative impact this quarter was better compared to Q1 of 2016. However, it's still too early to tell when the political and economic situation will stabilize. And Africa and Middle East, which is our smallest region, was slightly negative. 
Slide 10 shows our mix of business by discipline. For the quarter, the split was 53% for advertising services and 47% for marketing services. Our advertising discipline was up 7.7% in the quarter, led by the performance of our global media businesses and several of our advertising brands. 
While CRM was down 2.7%, the results were mixed across businesses and geographies. The reduction in CRM was driven primarily by our events, field marketing and point-of-sale businesses. PR was flat this quarter as we mentioned in the last quarter's call, we expect this performance to continue to improve as we move through the second half of the year and specialty communications was up 4.4% organically. The solid performance was driven by Omnicom Health Group with several new business wins by our full-service health care agencies. 
On Slide 11, we present our mix of business by industry sector. When comparing the year-to-date revenue for 2016 to 2015, you can see there were some minor shifts in the distribution of our client revenue by industry but nothing particularly significant. 
Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 12, you can see that in the first 6 months of the year, we generated $722 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. As for our primary uses of the cash on Slide 13, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $243 million. Keep in mind though the 10% increase in our quarterly dividend that we announced back in April was effective with the payment we made in early July. So the cash flow impact of the increase will be seen starting in Q3. 
Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $52 million. This is down versus last year due to the purchase of additional shares from our local partners in prior periods. Capital expenditures were $78 million; acquisitions, including earnout payments totaled $360 million; and stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled $352 million. All-in, we have spent our free cash flow by about $362 million in the first half of the year. 
Turning to Slide 14, regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter, our total debt at June 30, 2016, of just over $5 billion is up about $490 million from this time last year, reflecting the incremental $400 million increase in our borrowings related to the debt issuance back in April as well as an increase in the noncash fair value of our debt of about $90 million directly related to an offset by the positive fair value of the respective interest rate swaps on our debt as required to be reported on the balance sheet under U.S. GAAP. 
Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $3.5 billion, up $310 million versus the June 30, 2015 amount, primarily resulting from 2 noncash items in the quarter. The increase in debt from the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps and the reduction in cash from the negative effect of FX translation at the balance sheet date from our foreign cash balances. Additionally, positive change in operating capital were approximately $250 million was more than offset by our over spend of free cash flow of $290 million. 
Net debt increased by $1,546,000,000 compared to year-end as a result of the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of approximately $362 million and uses of working capital that typically occur in our first half of the year of approximately $1.1 billion. 
As for our ratios, they've increased slightly, reflecting the increase in our debt since this time last year. Our total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.2x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.6x. And due to the increase in our interest expense, our interest coverage ratio went down to 11.4x but it remains quite solid. 
Turning to Slide 15, we continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well-focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions. 
For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 18.4% and return on equity increased to 45.3%. 
And finally, on Slide 16, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders over the past 10-plus years. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2006 through Q2 of 2016, which totaled $10.1 billion. And the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $11.2 billion or a cumulative payout ratio of 111%. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we've included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review but at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you."

So part of it, of the move is undoubtedly some advertisers moving more to the upfront to avoid the experience they had a year ago paying those big premiums. But I do think there a couple of other factors contributing to the price increase itself. You've got the pattern of diminished audiences so there is less supply there. We've also seen some advertisers that while they're continuing to grow their digital budgets, there is a tap of the brakes in that space as some react to concerns about viewability or fraud matters. So we see the demand is up some points. The prices are up higher than the increases in revenue because of the decreases in supply.

Can you give any further color or commentary on any client reactions to the vote? And do you think there would be any spillover effects beyond the U.K.? I'm actually wondering if we could spend this positively and wonder, if any, potential slowdown in the U.K. might mean clients would allocate spending to other regions like the U.S. if the economy here remains fairly strong? And then a follow-on but related question perhaps more for Phil. Talking about the FX impact, I hear what you said about the impact on revenues. I'm assuming the impact on earnings from pound/dollar would be almost nothing. But I just want to clarify that and then if there's anything to know about interest expense, FX impacts from here on?"

Well, Brexit was recent and I think there will be uncertainty until we get greater color, they've just changed government, on some of the trade arrangements that the U.K. is able to enter into with the rest of Europe, its biggest trading partner. So there could be shifts, I mean there has been noises about banks making moves but, I think, it's way too early to tell. The biggest impact is that we were in Cannes and when you looked at the demographics, everybody from the U.K. that was there went to bed Thursday night thinking that the vote would fail and it passed. So there is still a lot -- a bit of uncertainty. We are represented everywhere, so if there is a shift from 1 market to another, we can easily follow it and pick it up without any real disruption to our business."

And I think, we're finding although FX is not always intuitive as the connection between the impact it has on revenues and our margins because it depends on where the FX movements are, what markets they're in and the relative margins of those markets, generally, we find when FX is plus or minus 1%, may be 2% typically it doesn't impact our margins that much. There could be exceptions but we haven't found that this year yet. And as far as interest expense goes and/or interest income, FX might have, as we've experienced in the last year, 1.5 year here, might have somewhat of an impact on our interest income, on our cash balances overseas, but not on our interest expense."

And as far as minority interests are concerned or noncontrolling interests declining for the rest of the year. I think we actually hope it doesn't because that means that the businesses with minority owners are performing better, and we're getting -- they're getting their share of a larger piece of the pie. But there is a bit of -- we did acquire some additional interests within the last 12 months or within the last 6 months, I'd say. That might bring that number down a bit.

96161,372943786,1006803,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 14, 2016",2016-07-14,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Shub. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call. Second quarter organic revenue growth was 3.4%, continuing the pace we set last quarter and in line with our expectations.

Second quarter organic revenue growth was 3.4%, continuing the pace we set last quarter and in line with our expectations. We also met our margin targets for the quarter and remain on track to deliver a 30 basis point margin improvement for the full year of 2016, or 13.7% EBITA versus 13.4% in '15. 
For the second quarter, EBITA margin was 15.2% versus 14.9% last year. Our results were solid during the quarter even in the face of continued currency headwinds. In the second quarter, 44% of our total revenue was derived from markets outside the United States. As a result, foreign currency in the second quarter reduced our revenue by $63 million or 1.6%. It's too early to fully assess the impact resulting from the ongoing Brexit discussions and upcoming U.S. elections. So far, the most significant effect is the continuing weakness of the British pound on our reported revenues. 
Additionally, when combined with the backdrop of recent terrorist-related events, clients have become more cautious with the most immediate effect being the cancellation of some customer events, which has had an impact on some of our CRM businesses. Phil will provide more details during his remarks. 
Looking at our organic growth, it was broad-based across geographies. Our strong consistent performance over many years is a testament to the strength of our services and the diversity of our offerings across the portfolio. By region, North America was up 3.2% with our media, advertising and specialty health businesses performing quite well during the quarter. 
Our growth in North America reflects in part the new business we captured in the United States in 2015 as well as the continued strength of our digital and data-driven platforms. Revenue from some of our 2015 new business wins start in the second half of this year and recent new business wins like Volkswagen media start in 2017. 
In terms of client trends, we continue to see growth in digital media despite increasing concerns around digital measurement, viewability and fraud. We also see modest growth in TV budgets, which is fueling a stronger upfront U.S. TV market with pricing up double digits in many cases. 
Please note, these increases, while good for the TV business, do not directly correlate to an increase in revenue to us. Our U.K. growth was 3.3%, with specialty health care and public relations having very strong performances in the market this quarter. In the Euro Markets, Spain and Germany were positive; France and Netherlands were slightly negative for the quarter as those countries continue to experience tepid economic growth. 
Outside the Euro Markets, we had very strong growth with the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia and Turkey generating solid results. 
Looking ahead, it is still too early to know what the impact of Brexit will be for the advertising market in Europe. What is clear is that the U.K. decision to leave the EU creates uncertainty and may slow down decision-making in many markets. Our agencies continue to operate without disruption in the U.K. and Europe. Over time, we expect the volatility and the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote to subside and for our agencies to adapt to the post-Brexit marketplace. 
Omnicom remains committed to serve the needs of our clients in the U.K. and European markets and to our people who provide great value to them. 
Turning to Asia. Second quarter organic growth was 4.5%, with almost all of our markets showing positive results, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam were exceptionally strong in the quarter. 
And Latin America grew 1.7% with Mexico well into double digits which more than offset the negative performance in Brazil. While Brazil continues to be a challenge, we saw better performance compared to the first quarter of this year. We are hopeful that this trend will continue and that the recent changes in leadership and economic policies as well as the Olympics later this summer will have a lasting positive effect. 
Looking at our bottom line, EPS increased 7.9% to $1.36 per share for the quarter versus $1.26 per share from the same quarter a year ago. Excluding the impact of currencies, EPS would have been higher for the quarter. Phil will provide the details during his remarks. 
Our results follow a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.50 to $0.55 earlier in this quarter. Finally, our balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance for the quarter and the first half of the year. 
Turning now to media and the ANA report, which was released earlier in June. As we said from the outset, our U.S. media agencies do not seek or retain rebates and return to clients all value negotiated in the form it is received. 
In the case of 1 global digital media provider, there is an incentive provision in our agreement that includes the U.S. This incentive continues to be returned to all clients in the U.S. on a pro rata basis according to their spending with this provider. We have contacted our clients to review our agency buying protocols, reassure them of the practices we follow and address any questions that they have. At Omnicom, we maintain strong compliance controls in both meeting the spirit of our client relationships and the terms of our client contracts. 
Our outside counsel, formerly asked ANA, K2 and Ebiquity to share any specific findings relating to Omnicom so we can ensure continuing contracting clients. No findings have been provided. 
It is our hope that after the Ebiquity report is released, the ANA and the 4A's restore the joint task force that was suspended earlier this year. So that a meaningful and clear agreement on joint practices and principles can be reached between advertisers and the agencies. 
With respect to our media operations, we continue to outperform the industry. Volkswagen recently selected Omnicom Media Group's PHD as its global media agency following a lengthy review. It was a huge win for PHD covering all VW group brands, including Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, Fiat, Skoda and commercial vehicles. Volkswagen indicated that our team stood out versus the competition by offering new digital data and analytical techniques for improved media targeting. 
In addition to VW, PHD also won media assignments from Delta Air Lines and Carnival Cruise Lines and our OMD media agency won ancestry.com business. These results follow the win of P&G's North American media business and the creation of our third media network, Hearts & Science, which launched with integrated data and analytics and marketing science capabilities into its core media service. 
What we've been seeing in media we are now experiencing more broadly across our advertising businesses as more clients are focused on leveraging data to inform creative messaging decisions. 
In several new business opportunities, clients are asking us to increase the collaboration of our media and creative services in order to maximize these benefits. The changes we are seeing underscore the importance of the talent and capabilities we've assembled in Annalect, our data and analytics platform, which has integrated its resources across many of our agencies, allowing our creative talent to bring new insight and value to clients. 
Across Omnicom, we continue to expand our capabilities and simplify our service offerings through internal investments in our agencies and through acquisitions. We recently announced the formation of 2 groups, 1 that aggregates our diverse offerings in the global health care industry into Omnicom Health Group and 1 that combines the strengths of all Omnicom's public relation firms, Omnicom PR Group. Both groups made their first acquisitions in the second quarter. Omnicom PR Group acquired Rabin Martin, a health care consulting firm that focuses on global public health issues, including chronic disease, enhancing women's health and preventing the spread of infectious disease. Rabin Martin's deep expertise in global public health is an important and growing specialty area as an increasing number of our clients see the need to address critical health issues in the world. 
Omnicom Health Group's first acquisition was BioPharm, an agency that specializes in multichannel marketing programs for pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients. Founded in 2005, BioPharm has an impressive client roster, which includes 17 of the 25 largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Omnicom's Health Group is organized by service offerings into 4 primary categories based on client needs: Professional, patient, payer, and regulatory evidence in medical. 
To further our capabilities in professional services, we recently launched DDB Health. DDB Health includes 5 professional health care agencies spanning in the U.S. and Europe. Omnicom Health Group now has creatively inspired dedicated partnerships with each of our global creative networks, TBWA\WorldHealth, BBDO Health Works and DDB Health. I'm happy to report that we're seeing good results strategically and operationally from both Omnicom Health Group and Omnicom Public Relations Group. We're also in the process of forming another group comprised of our independent national agencies, including Goodby, Silverstein, GSD&M, Martin Williams, and Zimmerman among others. While these agencies will continue to go-to-market as independent brands, we believe placing them in a singular group will provide benefits through the sharing of best practices across their management and operations. 
Finally, I recently returned from the  Cannes Lions Festival. I'm always impressed when I meet our creative talent from around the world. I'm proud to report the caliber of our creative continues to be outstanding. We proved once again we have the best people in business producing award winning campaigns for our clients. 
Here are a few of the highlights demonstrating the depth and breadth of our channel. 90 Omnicom agencies won almost 300 Lions from 27 different countries across more than 20 categories. Omnicom Media Group, including OMD and PHD, earned the most media Lions of any media agency holding company scoring a grand total of 15 awards. 
BBDO placed second and DDB was fourth in the Network of the Year category and finally, AlmapBBDO won the title of Agency of the Year. I want to congratulate all of our people and our agencies for their outstanding work. Our investments in talent, technology, and partnerships are making a difference for Omnicom and our agencies. They are critical to our success. We will continue to strategically invest in these areas as the marketing environment increases in complexity. In closing, we achieved our goals for organic growth, margins and profitability in the second quarter while it is impossible to predict the effects of Brexit as well as the impact of the U.S. presidential elections, we remain cautiously optimistic for the second half of the year and on target to achieve our 2016 plan. 
I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the second quarter results. Phil?"
96161,372943786,1006803,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 14, 2016",2016-07-14,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, during the second quarter of 2016, our business has once again delivered on their financial and strategic objectives while continuing to deliver best-in-class services to their clients. Our organic revenu",2304,"Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, during the second quarter of 2016, our business has once again delivered on their financial and strategic objectives while continuing to deliver best-in-class services to their clients. 
Our organic revenue growth of 3.4% for the second quarter was in line with our expectations and keeps us on track to meet our organic growth target of 3% to 3.5% for the full year. As has been the case for the last several quarters, the strength of the dollar continues to create a negative FX headwind on our revenue. 
For the second quarter, the reduction was 1.6% overall or about $63 million. Net acquisitions added 0.3% to revenue this quarter. In addition to the Grupo ABC acquisition in Brazil that we closed during the first quarter, in the second quarter, we added Rabin Martin, a health care public relations agency; and BioPharm, a specialty health care agency, late in the second quarter. 
As a result, total revenue for the quarter was just under $3.9 billion, an increase of 2.1% versus Q2 of last year. I'll discuss our revenue growth in further detail in a few minutes. 
Moving down to P&L below revenue, our Q2 EBITA increased 4.3% to $590 million. And the resulting EBITA margin of 15.2% represented a 30 basis point increase over Q2 of last year. The margin improvement, which is also in line with our expectations for the full year of 2016, is the result of our continuing efforts to leverage scale as we continue to pursue efficiency initiatives in the areas of real estate, back-office services, information technology and strategic purchasing across the entire organization. 
Operating income, or EBIT, for the quarter increased 4.3% to $562 million with operating margin improving to 14.5%, in line with the increase in our EBITA margin. Now turning to the items below operating income. Net interest expense for the quarter was $44.8 million, up $4.7 million versus the first quarter of 2016 and up $10.2 million versus Q2 of 2015. 
The increase in net interest expense versus the first quarter was primarily due to the termination of the fixed-to-floating rate swaps on our 2016 and 2022 notes. As you know, in April, we issued $1.4 billion of 10-year senior notes and redeemed 1 billion of notes that reached maturity on April 15. Although we incrementally added $400 million in debt, it had little effect on interest expense as rates have declined compared to when the 2016 notes were issued. Interest income earned in Q2 was lower compared to Q1 of 2016 as a result of lower interest earned on our cash balances, which were lower on average during Q2. 
Similarly, as compared to Q2 of last year, the increase in net interest expense of $10.2 million was primarily related to the termination of the fixed-to-floating rate swaps on our 2016 and 2022 notes. 
Additionally, our interest income on our cash balances held by our international treasury centers decreased year-over-year, primarily driven by negative FX translation. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.5%, which is down slightly versus Q1 of 2016 and the prior year as well as a result of some small tax planning items. Earnings from our affiliates totaled $2.8 million for the quarter, down a bit versus Q2 of last year. 
The allocation of earnings to minority shareholders in our less than fully-owned subsidiaries decreased by $3 million to $25.8 million. The decrease is primarily as a result of 2 factors. First, the impact of FX because a large portion of our less than fully-owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S. And second, purchase of minority interest in certain subsidiaries over the past year. 
As a result, net income was $326 million, that's an increase of $12 million or 3.9% versus Q2 of last year. 
Turning to Slide 3, the remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after allocation of $2 million of net income to participating securities was $324 million, an increase of 4.5% versus last year. 
You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was 239 million shares, which is down 2.7% versus last year as a result of repurchases of shares over the past year. As a result, diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.36, up $0.10 or 7.9% versus Q2 of 2015. 
On Slides 4 through 6, we provided the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the year-to-date period. Since the year-to-date results are essentially in line with the results for the quarter, I'll just give you a few highlights. 
While organic revenue growth was 3.6% during the first 6 months of the year, the FX headwind reduced revenue by 2.2%. Factoring in the increase from acquisitions net of dispositions of 0.1%, our revenue increased on a year-to-date basis by 1.5% to just under $7.4 billion. 
EBITDA increased 4.1% to just over $1 billion. As a result of the initiatives we've mentioned over the last several calls, both our EBITDA and operating margins on a year-to-date basis have increased consistent with the increase from Q2. 
And on Slide 6, you can see our 6-month diluted EPS, was $2.25 per share, which is up $0.16 or 7.7% versus 2015. Turning to Slide 7, we shift the discussion to our revenue performance. Starting with FX for the quarter, the net impact decreased our revenue by $63 million or 1.6%. The dollar remains relatively strong overall and when compared to Q2 of 2015, strengthened on a reported basis against most of our major currencies, including the pound, the real, the Chinese yuan and the Australian and Canadian dollars. However, the U.S. dollar weakened on a reported basis against the euro and the yen. 
Looking ahead, if rates stay where they are, the negative impact of FX may reduce revenue by about 1.5% during the third quarter and for the full year. That being said, given the result of the Brexit vote and the current volatility in the pound as well as other global currencies, this estimate is certainly subject to further change as we move through the second half of the year. Revenue from acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue $13.2 million in the quarter or 0.3%. Along with the acquisition of Grupo ABC in Brazil during the first quarter, this figure included the impact of the acquisitions we've made in the U.S. and Europe over the past 12 months. The net figure also includes the impact of some strategic dispositions that we've completed as well. 
Going forward, we expect the net impact of acquisitions and dispositions will continue to be positive by about approximately 50 basis points per quarter. And finally, organic growth was positive $129 million or 3.4% this quarter. It was a solid quarter of growth across all of our major markets with the exception of Brazil, France and the Netherlands. 
The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included the continued strong performance across our media businesses as well as several of our advertising brands, our full-service health care businesses, which turned in solid performances; and despite weaknesses in France and Netherlands, the Euro Markets overall had positive organic growth. The Asia-Pacific region also had solid performances across almost all of our markets. And in Latin America, excellent performance by our agencies in Mexico, which offset the continued challenges experienced in Brazil. 
Further highlighting our regional mix of business on Slide 8, you can see during the quarter the split was 60% for North America, 9% for the U.K., 16% for the rest of Europe, 10% for Asia-Pacific, 3% for Latin America and 2% for Africa and the Middle East. 
Turning to the details of the performance by region on Slide 9, in North America, we had organic revenue growth of 3.2%, driven by the continued strong performance of our media businesses as well as several advertising brands and our full-service health care businesses. 
In Europe, the U.K. had organic growth of 3.3% on the strength of our specialty health care and PR businesses. The rest of Europe was up 4.3% led by our agencies in Spain and the Czech Republic, with a solid performance in Poland and Russia as well. 
Germany was also positive while the Netherlands and France lagged with negative growth. The Asia Pacific region was up 4.5%, most markets growing very well during the quarter, including Greater China and Japan. And although relatively small, we also saw a double-digit organic growth from many of our emerging market countries in the region, including India, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. 
In Latin America, strong performance by our agencies in Mexico offset continued weakness in Brazil as the region was up organically 1.7% for the quarter. Brazil was down once again, but the negative impact this quarter was better compared to Q1 of 2016. However, it is still too early to tell when the political and economic situation will stabilize. And Africa and Middle East, which is our smallest region, was slightly negative. 
Slide 10 shows our mix of business by discipline. For the quarter, the split was 53% for advertising services and 47% for marketing services. Our advertising discipline was up 7.7% in the quarter, led by the performance of our global media businesses and several of our advertising brands. 
While CRM was down 2.7%, the results were mixed across businesses and geographies. The reduction in CRM was driven primarily by our events, field marketing and point-of-sale businesses. PR was flat this quarter as we mentioned in the last quarter's call, we expect this performance to continue to improve as we move through the second half of the year and specialty communications was up 4.4% organically. The solid performance was driven by Omnicom Health Group with several new business wins by our full-service health care agencies. 
On Slide 11, we present our mix of business by industry sector. When comparing the year-to-date revenue for 2016 to 2015, you can see there were some minor shifts in the distribution of our client revenue by industry but nothing particularly significant. 
Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 12, you can see that in the first 6 months of the year, we generated $722 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. As for our primary uses of the cash on Slide 13, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $243 million. Keep in mind though the 10% increase in our quarterly dividend that we announced back in April was effective with the payment we made in early July. So the cash flow impact of the increase will be seen starting in Q3. 
Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $52 million. This is down versus last year due to the purchase of additional shares from our local partners in prior periods. Capital expenditures were $78 million; acquisitions, including earnout payments totaled $360 million; and stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled $352 million. All-in, we outspent our free cash flow by about $362 million in the first half of the year. 
Turning to Slide 14, regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter, our total debt at June 30, 2016 of just over $5 billion is up about $490 million from this time last year, reflecting the incremental $400 million increase in our borrowings related to the debt issuance back in April as well as an increase in the noncash fair value of our debt of about $90 million directly related to an offset by the positive fair value of the respective interest rate swaps on our debt as required to be reported on the balance sheet under U.S. GAAP. 
Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $3.5 billion, up $310 million versus the June 30, 2015 amount, primarily resulting from 2 noncash items in the quarter. The increase in debt from the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps and the reduction in cash from the negative effect of FX translation at the balance sheet date from our foreign cash balances. Additionally, positive change in operating capital of approximately $250 million was more than offset by our over spend of free cash flow of $290 million. 
Net debt increased by $1,546,000,000 compared to year-end as a result of the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of approximately $362 million and uses of working capital that typically occur in our first half of the year of approximately $1.1 billion. 
As for our ratios, they've increased slightly, reflecting the increase in our debt since this time last year. Our total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.2x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.6x. And due to the increase in our interest expense, our interest coverage ratio went down to 11.4x but it remains quite solid. 
Turning to Slide 15, we continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well-focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions. 
For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 18.4% and return on equity increased to 45.3%. 
And finally, on Slide 16, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders over the past 10-plus years. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2006 through Q2 of 2016, which totaled $10.1 billion. And the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $11.2 billion or a cumulative payout ratio of 111%. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we've included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review but at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you."

There is -- a year ago, we did see or over the past year, I should say, we did see some significant scatter premium. So part of it, of the move is undoubtedly some advertisers moving more to the upfront to avoid the experience they had a year ago paying those big premiums. But I do think there are a couple of other factors contributing to the price increase itself. You've got the pattern of diminished audiences so there is less supply there. We've also seen some advertisers that while they're continuing to grow their digital budgets, there is a tap of the brakes in that space as some react to concerns about viewability or fraud matters. So we see the demand is up some points. The prices are up higher than the increases in revenue because of the decreases in supply. And we'll have to see as the year unfolds whether those revenue increases hold in scatter."

There could be exceptions but we haven't found that this year yet.

I would also like to remind you that during the course of the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about Omnicom's performance. You will find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation materials.
We are going to begin this morning's call with an overview of our business from John Wren, then Phil Angelastro will provide our financial results for the quarter and then we will open up the line for your questions."
96161,372943786,1006995,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 14, 2016",2016-07-14,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Shub. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call. Second quarter organic revenue growth was 3.4%, continuing the pace we set last quarter and in line with our expectations. We also met our margin targets for the quarter and remain on track to",1789,"Thank you, Shub. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call. Second quarter organic revenue growth was 3.4%, continuing the pace we set last quarter and in line with our expectations. We also met our margin targets for the quarter and remain on track to deliver a 30 basis point margin improvement for the full year of 2016, or 13.7% EBITA versus 13.4% in '15. 
For the second quarter, EBITA margin was 15.2% versus 14.9% last year. Our results were solid during the quarter even in the face of continued currency headwinds. In the second quarter, 44% of our total revenue was derived from markets outside the United States. As a result, foreign currency in the second quarter reduced our revenue by $63 million or 1.6%. It's too early to fully assess the impact resulting from the ongoing Brexit discussions and upcoming U.S. elections. So far, the most significant effect is the continuing weakness of the British pound on our reported revenues. 
Additionally, when combined with the backdrop of recent terrorist-related events, clients have become more cautious with the most immediate effect being the cancellation of some customer events, which has had an impact on some of our CRM businesses. Phil will provide more details during his remarks. 
Looking at our organic growth, it was broad-based across geographies. Our strong consistent performance over many years is a testament to the strength of our services and the diversity of our offerings across the portfolio. By region, North America was up 3.2% with our media, advertising and specialty health businesses performing quite well during the quarter. 
Our growth in North America reflects in part the new business we captured in the United States in 2015 as well as the continued strength of our digital and data-driven platforms. Revenue from some of our 2015 new business wins start in the second half of this year and recent new business wins like Volkswagen media start in 2017. 
In terms of client trends, we continue to see growth in digital media despite increasing concerns around digital measurement, viewability and fraud. We also see modest growth in TV budgets, which is fueling a stronger upfront U.S. TV market with pricing up double digits in many cases. 
Please note, these increases, while good for the TV business, do not directly correlate to an increase in revenue to us. Our U.K. growth was 3.3%, with specialty health care and public relations having very strong performances in the market this quarter. In the Euro Markets, Spain and Germany were positive; France and Netherlands were slightly negative for the quarter as those countries continue to experience tepid economic growth. 
Outside the Euro Markets, we had very strong growth with the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia and Turkey generating solid results. 
Looking ahead, it is still too early to know what the impact of Brexit will be for the advertising market in Europe. What is clear is that the U.K. decision to leave the EU creates uncertainty and may slow down decision-making in many markets. Our agencies continue to operate without disruption in the U.K. and Europe. Over time, we expect the volatility and the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote to subside and for our agencies to adapt to the post-Brexit marketplace. 
Omnicom remains committed to serve the needs of our clients in the U.K. and European markets and to our people who provide great value to them. 
Turning to Asia. Second quarter organic growth was 4.5%, with almost all of our markets showing positive results, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam were exceptionally strong in the quarter. 
And Latin America grew 1.7% with Mexico well into double digits which more than offset the negative performance in Brazil. While Brazil continues to be a challenge, we saw better performance compared to the first quarter of this year. We are hopeful that this trend will continue and that the recent changes in leadership and economic policies as well as the Olympics later this summer will have a lasting positive effect. 
Looking at our bottom line, EPS increased 7.9% to $1.36 per share for the quarter versus $1.26 per share from the same quarter a year ago. Excluding the impact of currencies, EPS would have been higher for the quarter. Phil will provide the details during his remarks. 
Our results follow a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.50 to $0.55 earlier in this quarter. Finally, our balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance for the quarter and the first half of the year. 
Turning now to media and the ANA report, which was released earlier in June. As we said from the outset, our U.S. media agencies do not seek or retain rebates and return to clients all value negotiated in the form it is received. 
In the case of 1 global digital media provider, there is an incentive provision in our agreement that includes the U.S. This incentive continues to be returned to all clients in the U.S. on a pro rata basis according to their spending with this provider. We have contacted our clients to review our agency buying protocols, reassure them of the practices we follow and address any questions that they have. At Omnicom, we maintain strong compliance controls in both meeting the spirit of our client relationships and the terms of our client contracts. 
Our outside counsel, formerly asked ANA, K2 and Ebiquity to share any specific findings relating to Omnicom so we can ensure continuing contracting clients. No findings have been provided. 
It is our hope that after the Ebiquity report is released, the ANA and the 4A's restore the joint task force that was suspended earlier this year. So that a meaningful and clear agreement on joint practices and principles can be reached between advertisers and the agencies. 
With respect to our media operations, we continue to outperform the industry. Volkswagen recently selected Omnicom Media Group's PHD as its global media agency following a lengthy review. It was a huge win for PHD covering all VW group brands, including Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, Fiat, Skoda and commercial vehicles. Volkswagen indicated that our team stood out versus the competition by offering new digital data and analytical techniques for improved media targeting. 
In addition to VW, PHD also won media assignments from Delta Air Lines and Carnival Cruise Lines and our OMD media agency won ancestry.com business. These results follow the win of P&G's North American media business and the creation of our third media network, Hearts & Science, which launched with integrated data and analytics and marketing science capabilities into its core media service. 
What we've been seeing in media we are now experiencing more broadly across our advertising businesses as more clients are focused on leveraging data to inform creative messaging decisions. 
In several new business opportunities, clients are asking us to increase the collaboration of our media and creative services in order to maximize these benefits. The changes we are seeing underscore the importance of the talent and capabilities we've assembled in Annalect, our data and analytics platform, which has integrated its resources across many of our agencies, allowing our creative talent to bring new insight and value to clients. 
Across Omnicom, we continue to expand our capabilities and simplify our service offerings through internal investments in our agencies and through acquisitions. We recently announced the formation of 2 groups, 1 that aggregates our diverse offerings in the global health care industry into Omnicom Health Group and 1 that combines the strengths of all Omnicom's public relation firms, Omnicom PR Group. Both groups made their first acquisitions in the second quarter. Omnicom PR Group acquired Rabin Martin, a health care consulting firm that focuses on global public health issues, including chronic disease, enhancing women's health and preventing the spread of infectious disease. Rabin Martin's deep expertise in global public health is an important and growing specialty area as an increasing number of our clients see the need to address critical health issues in the world. 
Omnicom Health Group's first acquisition was BioPharm, an agency that specializes in multichannel marketing programs for pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients. Founded in 2005, BioPharm has an impressive client roster, which includes 17 of the 25 largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Omnicom's Health Group is organized by service offerings into 4 primary categories based on client needs: Professional, patient, payer, and regulatory evidence in medical. 
To further our capabilities in professional services, we recently launched DDB Health. DDB Health includes 5 professional health care agencies spanning in the U.S. and Europe. Omnicom Health Group now has creatively inspired dedicated partnerships with each of our global creative networks, TBWA\WorldHealth, BBDO Health Works and DDB Health. I'm happy to report that we're seeing good results strategically and operationally from both Omnicom Health Group and Omnicom Public Relations Group. We're also in the process of forming another group comprised of our independent national agencies, including Goodby, Silverstein, GSD&M, Martin Williams, and Zimmerman among others. While these agencies will continue to go-to-market as independent brands, we believe placing them in a singular group will provide benefits through the sharing of best practices across their management and operations. 
Finally, I recently returned from the  Cannes Lions Festival. I'm always impressed when I meet our creative talent from around the world. I'm proud to report the caliber of our creative continues to be outstanding. We proved once again we have the best people in business producing award winning campaigns for our clients. 
Here are a few of the highlights demonstrating the depth and breadth of our channel. 90 Omnicom agencies won almost 300 Lions from 27 different countries across more than 20 categories. Omnicom Media Group, including OMD and PHD, earned the most media Lions of any media agency holding company scoring a grand total of 15 awards. 
BBDO placed second and DDB was fourth in the Network of the Year category and finally, AlmapBBDO won the title of Agency of the Year. I want to congratulate all of our people and our agencies for their outstanding work. Our investments in talent, technology, and partnerships are making a difference for Omnicom and our agencies. They are critical to our success. We will continue to strategically invest in these areas as the marketing environment increases in complexity. In closing, we achieved our goals for organic growth, margins and profitability in the second quarter while it is impossible to predict the effects of Brexit as well as the impact of the U.S. presidential elections, we remain cautiously optimistic for the second half of the year and on target to achieve our 2016 plan. 
I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the second quarter results. Phil?"
96161,372943786,1006995,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 14, 2016",2016-07-14,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, during the second quarter of 2016, our business has once again delivered on their financial and strategic objectives while continuing to deliver best-in-class services to their clients. Our organic revenu",2304,"Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, during the second quarter of 2016, our business has once again delivered on their financial and strategic objectives while continuing to deliver best-in-class services to their clients. 
Our organic revenue growth of 3.4% for the second quarter was in line with our expectations and keeps us on track to meet our organic growth target of 3% to 3.5% for the full year. As has been the case for the last several quarters, the strength of the dollar continues to create a negative FX headwind on our revenue. 
For the second quarter, the reduction was 1.6% overall or about $63 million. Net acquisitions added 0.3% to revenue this quarter. In addition to the Grupo ABC acquisition in Brazil that we closed during the first quarter, in the second quarter, we added Rabin Martin, a health care public relations agency; and BioPharm, a specialty health care agency, late in the second quarter. 
As a result, total revenue for the quarter was just under $3.9 billion, an increase of 2.1% versus Q2 of last year. I'll discuss our revenue growth in further detail in a few minutes. 
Moving down to P&L below revenue, our Q2 EBITA increased 4.3% to $590 million. And the resulting EBITA margin of 15.2% represented a 30 basis point increase over Q2 of last year. The margin improvement, which is also in line with our expectations for the full year of 2016, is the result of our continuing efforts to leverage scale as we continue to pursue efficiency initiatives in the areas of real estate, back-office services, information technology and strategic purchasing across the entire organization. 
Operating income, or EBIT, for the quarter increased 4.3% to $562 million with operating margin improving to 14.5%, in line with the increase in our EBITA margin. Now turning to the items below operating income. Net interest expense for the quarter was $44.8 million, up $4.7 million versus the first quarter of 2016 and up $10.2 million versus Q2 of 2015. 
The increase in net interest expense versus the first quarter was primarily due to the termination of the fixed-to-floating rate swaps on our 2016 and 2022 notes. As you know, in April, we issued $1.4 billion of 10-year senior notes and redeemed 1 billion of notes that reached maturity on April 15. Although we incrementally added $400 million in debt, it had little effect on interest expense as rates have declined compared to when the 2016 notes were issued. Interest income earned in Q2 was lower compared to Q1 of 2016 as a result of lower interest earned on our cash balances, which were lower on average during Q2. 
Similarly, as compared to Q2 of last year, the increase in net interest expense of $10.2 million was primarily related to the termination of the fixed-to-floating rate swaps on our 2016 and 2022 notes. 
Additionally, our interest income on our cash balances held by our international treasury centers decreased year-over-year, primarily driven by negative FX translation. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.5%, which is down slightly versus Q1 of 2016 and the prior year as well as a result of some small tax planning items. Earnings from our affiliates totaled $2.8 million for the quarter, down a bit versus Q2 of last year. 
The allocation of earnings to minority shareholders in our less than fully-owned subsidiaries decreased by $3 million to $25.8 million. The decrease is primarily as a result of 2 factors. First, the impact of FX because a large portion of our less than fully-owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S. And second, purchase of minority interest in certain subsidiaries over the past year. 
As a result, net income was $326 million, that's an increase of $12 million or 3.9% versus Q2 of last year. 
Turning to Slide 3, the remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after allocation of $2 million of net income to participating securities was $324 million, an increase of 4.5% versus last year. 
You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was 239 million shares, which is down 2.7% versus last year as a result of repurchases of shares over the past year. As a result, diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.36, up $0.10 or 7.9% versus Q2 of 2015. 
On Slides 4 through 6, we provided the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the year-to-date period. Since the year-to-date results are essentially in line with the results for the quarter, I'll just give you a few highlights. 
While organic revenue growth was 3.6% during the first 6 months of the year, the FX headwind reduced revenue by 2.2%. Factoring in the increase from acquisitions net of dispositions of 0.1%, our revenue increased on a year-to-date basis by 1.5% to just under $7.4 billion. 
EBITDA increased 4.1% to just over $1 billion. As a result of the initiatives we've mentioned over the last several calls, both our EBITDA and operating margins on a year-to-date basis have increased consistent with the increase from Q2. 
And on Slide 6, you can see our 6-month diluted EPS, was $2.25 per share, which is up $0.16 or 7.7% versus 2015. Turning to Slide 7, we shift the discussion to our revenue performance. Starting with FX for the quarter, the net impact decreased our revenue by $63 million or 1.6%. The dollar remains relatively strong overall and when compared to Q2 of 2015, strengthened on a reported basis against most of our major currencies, including the pound, the real, the Chinese yuan and the Australian and Canadian dollars. However, the U.S. dollar weakened on a reported basis against the euro and the yen. 
Looking ahead, if rates stay where they are, the negative impact of FX may reduce revenue by about 1.5% during the third quarter and for the full year. That being said, given the result of the Brexit vote and the current volatility in the pound as well as other global currencies, this estimate is certainly subject to further change as we move through the second half of the year. Revenue from acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue $13.2 million in the quarter or 0.3%. Along with the acquisition of Grupo ABC in Brazil during the first quarter, this figure included the impact of the acquisitions we've made in the U.S. and Europe over the past 12 months. The net figure also includes the impact of some strategic dispositions that we've completed as well. 
Going forward, we expect the net impact of acquisitions and dispositions will continue to be positive by about approximately 50 basis points per quarter. And finally, organic growth was positive $129 million or 3.4% this quarter. It was a solid quarter of growth across all of our major markets with the exception of Brazil, France and the Netherlands. 
The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included the continued strong performance across our media businesses as well as several of our advertising brands, our full-service health care businesses, which turned in solid performances; and despite weaknesses in France and Netherlands, the Euro Markets overall had positive organic growth. The Asia-Pacific region also had solid performances across almost all of our markets. And in Latin America, excellent performance by our agencies in Mexico, which offset the continued challenges experienced in Brazil. 
Further highlighting our regional mix of business on Slide 8, you can see during the quarter the split was 60% for North America, 9% for the U.K., 16% for the rest of Europe, 10% for Asia-Pacific, 3% for Latin America and 2% for Africa and the Middle East. 
Turning to the details of the performance by region on Slide 9, in North America, we had organic revenue growth of 3.2%, driven by the continued strong performance of our media businesses as well as several advertising brands and our full-service health care businesses. 
In Europe, the U.K. had organic growth of 3.3% on the strength of our specialty health care and PR businesses. The rest of Europe was up 4.3% led by our agencies in Spain and the Czech Republic, with a solid performance in Poland and Russia as well. 
Germany was also positive while the Netherlands and France lagged with negative growth. The Asia Pacific region was up 4.5%, most markets growing very well during the quarter, including Greater China and Japan. And although relatively small, we also saw a double-digit organic growth from many of our emerging market countries in the region, including India, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. 
In Latin America, strong performance by our agencies in Mexico offset continued weakness in Brazil as the region was up organically 1.7% for the quarter. Brazil was down once again, but the negative impact this quarter was better compared to Q1 of 2016. However, it is still too early to tell when the political and economic situation will stabilize. And Africa and Middle East, which is our smallest region, was slightly negative. 
Slide 10 shows our mix of business by discipline. For the quarter, the split was 53% for advertising services and 47% for marketing services. Our advertising discipline was up 7.7% in the quarter, led by the performance of our global media businesses and several of our advertising brands. 
While CRM was down 2.7%, the results were mixed across businesses and geographies. The reduction in CRM was driven primarily by our events, field marketing and point-of-sale businesses. PR was flat this quarter as we mentioned in the last quarter's call, we expect this performance to continue to improve as we move through the second half of the year and specialty communications was up 4.4% organically. The solid performance was driven by Omnicom Health Group with several new business wins by our full-service health care agencies. 
On Slide 11, we present our mix of business by industry sector. When comparing the year-to-date revenue for 2016 to 2015, you can see there were some minor shifts in the distribution of our client revenue by industry but nothing particularly significant. 
Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 12, you can see that in the first 6 months of the year, we generated $722 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. As for our primary uses of the cash on Slide 13, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $243 million. Keep in mind though the 10% increase in our quarterly dividend that we announced back in April was effective with the payment we made in early July. So the cash flow impact of the increase will be seen starting in Q3. 
Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $52 million. This is down versus last year due to the purchase of additional shares from our local partners in prior periods. Capital expenditures were $78 million; acquisitions, including earnout payments totaled $360 million; and stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled $352 million. All-in, we outspent our free cash flow by about $362 million in the first half of the year. 
Turning to Slide 14, regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter, our total debt at June 30, 2016 of just over $5 billion is up about $490 million from this time last year, reflecting the incremental $400 million increase in our borrowings related to the debt issuance back in April as well as an increase in the noncash fair value of our debt of about $90 million directly related to an offset by the positive fair value of the respective interest rate swaps on our debt as required to be reported on the balance sheet under U.S. GAAP. 
Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $3.5 billion, up $310 million versus the June 30, 2015 amount, primarily resulting from 2 noncash items in the quarter. The increase in debt from the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps and the reduction in cash from the negative effect of FX translation at the balance sheet date from our foreign cash balances. Additionally, positive change in operating capital of approximately $250 million was more than offset by our over spend of free cash flow of $290 million. 
Net debt increased by $1,546,000,000 compared to year-end as a result of the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of approximately $362 million and uses of working capital that typically occur in our first half of the year of approximately $1.1 billion. 
As for our ratios, they've increased slightly, reflecting the increase in our debt since this time last year. Our total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.2x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.6x. And due to the increase in our interest expense, our interest coverage ratio went down to 11.4x but it remains quite solid. 
Turning to Slide 15, we continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well-focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions. 
For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 18.4% and return on equity increased to 45.3%. 
And finally, on Slide 16, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders over the past 10-plus years. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2006 through Q2 of 2016, which totaled $10.1 billion. And the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $11.2 billion or a cumulative payout ratio of 111%. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we've included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review but at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you."

There is -- a year ago, we did see or over the past year, I should say, we did see some significant scatter premium. So part of it, of the move is undoubtedly some advertisers moving more to the upfront to avoid the experience they had a year ago paying those big premiums. But I do think there are a couple of other factors contributing to the price increase itself. You've got the pattern of diminished audiences so there is less supply there. We've also seen some advertisers that while they're continuing to grow their digital budgets, there is a tap of the brakes in that space as some react to concerns about viewability or fraud matters. So we see the demand is up some points. The prices are up higher than the increases in revenue because of the decreases in supply. And we'll have to see as the year unfolds whether those revenue increases hold in scatter."

Thank you for joining our call. Second quarter organic revenue growth was 3.4%, continuing the pace we set last quarter and in line with our expectations.

Second quarter organic revenue growth was 3.4%, continuing the pace we set last quarter and in line with our expectations. We also met our margin targets for the quarter and remain on track to deliver a 30 basis point margin improvement for the full year of 2016, or 13.7% EBITA versus 13.4% in '15. 
For the second quarter, EBITA margin was 15.2% versus 14.9% last year. Our results were solid during the quarter even in the face of continued currency headwinds. In the second quarter, 44% of our total revenue was derived from markets outside the United States. As a result, foreign currency in the second quarter reduced our revenue by $63 million or 1.6%. It's too early to fully assess the impact resulting from the ongoing Brexit discussions and upcoming U.S. elections. So far, the most significant effect is the continuing weakness of the British pound on our reported revenues. 
Additionally, when combined with the backdrop of recent terrorist-related events, clients have become more cautious with the most immediate effect being the cancellation of some customer events, which has had an impact on some of our CRM businesses. Phil will provide more details during his remarks. 
Looking at our organic growth, it was broad-based across geographies. Our strong consistent performance over many years is a testament to the strength of our services and the diversity of our offerings across the portfolio. By region, North America was up 3.2% with our media, advertising and specialty health businesses performing quite well during the quarter. 
Our growth in North America reflects in part the new business we captured in the United States in 2015 as well as the continued strength of our digital and data-driven platforms. Revenue from some of our 2015 new business wins start in the second half of this year and recent new business wins like Volkswagen media start in 2017. 
In terms of client trends, we continue to see growth in digital media despite increasing concerns around digital measurement, viewability and fraud. We also see modest growth in TV budgets, which is fueling a stronger upfront U.S. TV market with pricing up double digits in many cases. 
Please note, these increases, while good for the TV business, do not directly correlate to an increase in revenue to us. Our U.K. growth was 3.3%, with specialty health care and public relations having very strong performances in the market this quarter. In the Euro Markets, Spain and Germany were positive; France and Netherlands were slightly negative for the quarter as those countries continue to experience tepid economic growth. 
Outside the Euro Markets, we had very strong growth with the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia and Turkey generating solid results. 
Looking ahead, it is still too early to know what the impact of Brexit will be for the advertising market in Europe. What is clear is that the U.K. decision to leave the EU creates uncertainty and may slow down decision-making in many markets. Our agencies continue to operate without disruption in the U.K. and Europe. Over time, we expect the volatility and the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote to subside and for our agencies to adapt to the post-Brexit marketplace. 
Omnicom remains committed to serve the needs of our clients in the U.K. and European markets and to our people who provide great value to them. 
Turning to Asia. Second quarter organic growth was 4.5%, with almost all of our markets showing positive results, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam were exceptionally strong in the quarter. 
And Latin America grew 1.7% with Mexico well into double digits which more than offset the negative performance in Brazil. While Brazil continues to be a challenge, we saw better performance compared to the first quarter of this year. We are hopeful that this trend will continue and that the recent changes in leadership and economic policies as well as the Olympics later this summer will have a lasting positive effect. 
Looking at our bottom line, EPS increased 7.9% to $1.36 per share for the quarter versus $1.26 per share from the same quarter a year ago. Excluding the impact of currencies, EPS would have been higher for the quarter. Phil will provide the details during his remarks. 
Our results follow a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.50 to $0.55 earlier in this quarter. Finally, our balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance for the quarter and the first half of the year. 
Turning now to media and the ANA report, which was released earlier in June. As we said from the outset, our U.S. media agencies do not seek or retain rebates and return to clients all value negotiated in the form it is received. 
In the case of 1 global digital media provider, there is an incentive provision in our agreement that includes the U.S. This incentive continues to be returned to all clients in the U.S. on a pro rata basis according to their spending with this provider. We have contacted our clients to review our agency buying protocols, reassure them of the practices we follow and address any questions that they have. At Omnicom, we maintain strong compliance controls in both meeting the spirit of our client relationships and the terms of our client contracts. 
Our outside counsel, formerly asked ANA, K2 and Ebiquity to share any specific findings relating to Omnicom so we can ensure continuing contracting clients. No findings have been provided. 
It is our hope that after the Ebiquity report is released, the ANA and the 4A's restore the joint task force that was suspended earlier this year. So that a meaningful and clear agreement on joint practices and principles can be reached between advertisers and the agencies. 
With respect to our media operations, we continue to outperform the industry. Volkswagen recently selected Omnicom Media Group's PHD as its global media agency following a lengthy review. It was a huge win for PHD covering all VW group brands, including Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, Fiat, Skoda and commercial vehicles. Volkswagen indicated that our team stood out versus the competition by offering new digital data and analytical techniques for improved media targeting. 
In addition to VW, PHD also won media assignments from Delta Air Lines and Carnival Cruise Lines and our OMD media agency won ancestry.com business. These results follow the win of P&G's North American media business and the creation of our third media network, Hearts & Science, which launched with integrated data and analytics and marketing science capabilities into its core media service. 
What we've been seeing in media we are now experiencing more broadly across our advertising businesses as more clients are focused on leveraging data to inform creative messaging decisions. 
In several new business opportunities, clients are asking us to increase the collaboration of our media and creative services in order to maximize these benefits. The changes we are seeing underscore the importance of the talent and capabilities we've assembled in Annalect, our data and analytics platform, which has integrated its resources across many of our agencies, allowing our creative talent to bring new insight and value to clients. 
Across Omnicom, we continue to expand our capabilities and simplify our service offerings through internal investments in our agencies and through acquisitions. We recently announced the formation of 2 groups, 1 that aggregates our diverse offerings in the global health care industry into Omnicom Health Group and 1 that combines the strengths of all Omnicom's public relation firms, Omnicom PR Group. Both groups made their first acquisitions in the second quarter. Omnicom PR Group acquired Rabin Martin, a health care consulting firm that focuses on global public health issues, including chronic disease, enhancing women's health and preventing the spread of infectious disease. Rabin Martin's deep expertise in global public health is an important and growing specialty area as an increasing number of our clients see the need to address critical health issues in the world. 
Omnicom Health Group's first acquisition was BioPharm, an agency that specializes in multichannel marketing programs for pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients. Founded in 2005, BioPharm has an impressive client roster, which includes 17 of the 25 largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Omnicom's Health Group is organized by service offerings into 4 primary categories based on client needs: Professional, patient, payer, and regulatory evidence in medical. 
To further our capabilities in professional services, we recently launched DDB Health. DDB Health includes 5 professional health care agencies spanning in the U.S. and Europe. Omnicom Health Group now has creatively inspired dedicated partnerships with each of our global creative networks, TBWA\WorldHealth, BBDO Health Works and DDB Health. I'm happy to report that we're seeing good results strategically and operationally from both Omnicom Health Group and Omnicom Public Relations Group. We're also in the process of forming another group comprised of our independent national agencies, including Goodby, Silverstein, GSD&M, Martin Williams, and Zimmerman among others. While these agencies will continue to go-to-market as independent brands, we believe placing them in a singular group will provide benefits through the sharing of best practices across their management and operations. 
Finally, I recently returned from the  Cannes Lions Festival. I'm always impressed when I meet our creative talent from around the world. I'm proud to report the caliber of our creative continues to be outstanding. We proved once again we have the best people in business producing award winning campaigns for our clients. 
Here are a few of the highlights demonstrating the depth and breadth of our channel. 90 Omnicom agencies won almost 300 Lions from 27 different countries across more than 20 categories. Omnicom Media Group, including OMD and PHD, earned the most media Lions of any media agency holding company scoring a grand total of 15 awards. 
BBDO placed second and DDB was fourth in the Network of the Year category and finally, AlmapBBDO won the title of Agency of the Year. I want to congratulate all of our people and our agencies for their outstanding work. Our investments in talent, technology, and partnerships are making a difference for Omnicom and our agencies. They are critical to our success. We will continue to strategically invest in these areas as the marketing environment increases in complexity. In closing, we achieved our goals for organic growth, margins and profitability in the second quarter while it is impossible to predict the effects of Brexit as well as the impact of the U.S. presidential elections, we remain cautiously optimistic for the second half of the year and on target to achieve our 2016 plan. 
I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the second quarter results. Phil?"

Our organic revenue growth of 3.4% for the second quarter was in line with our expectations and keeps us on track to meet our organic growth target of 3% to 3.5% for the full year. As has been the case for the last several quarters, the strength of the dollar continues to create a negative FX headwind on our revenue. 
For the second quarter, the reduction was 1.6% overall or about $63 million. Net acquisitions added 0.3% to revenue this quarter. In addition to the Grupo ABC acquisition in Brazil that we closed during the first quarter, in the second quarter, we added Rabin Martin, a health care public relations agency; and BioPharm, a specialty health care agency, late in the second quarter. 
As a result, total revenue for the quarter was just under $3.9 billion, an increase of 2.1% versus Q2 of last year. I'll discuss our revenue growth in further detail in a few minutes. 
Moving down to P&L below revenue, our Q2 EBITA increased 4.3% to $590 million. And the resulting EBITA margin of 15.2% represented a 30 basis point increase over Q2 of last year. The margin improvement, which is also in line with our expectations for the full year of 2016, is the result of our continuing efforts to leverage scale as we continue to pursue efficiency initiatives in the areas of real estate, back-office services, information technology and strategic purchasing across the entire organization. 
Operating income, or EBIT, for the quarter increased 4.3% to $562 million with operating margin improving to 14.5%, in line with the increase in our EBITA margin. Now turning to the items below operating income. Net interest expense for the quarter was $44.8 million, up $4.7 million versus the first quarter of 2016 and up $10.2 million versus Q2 of 2015. 
The increase in net interest expense versus the first quarter was primarily due to the termination of the fixed-to-floating rate swaps on our 2016 and 2022 notes. As you know, in April, we issued $1.4 billion of 10-year senior notes and redeemed 1 billion of notes that reached maturity on April 15. Although we incrementally added $400 million in debt, it had little effect on interest expense as rates have declined compared to when the 2016 notes were issued. Interest income earned in Q2 was lower compared to Q1 of 2016 as a result of lower interest earned on our cash balances, which were lower on average during Q2. 
Similarly, as compared to Q2 of last year, the increase in net interest expense of $10.2 million was primarily related to the termination of the fixed-to-floating rate swaps on our 2016 and 2022 notes. 
Additionally, our interest income on our cash balances held by our international treasury centers decreased year-over-year, primarily driven by negative FX translation. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.5%, which is down slightly versus Q1 of 2016 and the prior year as well as a result of some small tax planning items. Earnings from our affiliates totaled $2.8 million for the quarter, down a bit versus Q2 of last year. 
The allocation of earnings to minority shareholders in our less than fully-owned subsidiaries decreased by $3 million to $25.8 million. The decrease is primarily as a result of 2 factors. First, the impact of FX because a large portion of our less than fully-owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S. And second, purchase of minority interest in certain subsidiaries over the past year. 
As a result, net income was $326 million, that's an increase of $12 million or 3.9% versus Q2 of last year. 
Turning to Slide 3, the remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after allocation of $2 million of net income to participating securities was $324 million, an increase of 4.5% versus last year. 
You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was 239 million shares, which is down 2.7% versus last year as a result of repurchases of shares over the past year. As a result, diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.36, up $0.10 or 7.9% versus Q2 of 2015. 
On Slides 4 through 6, we provided the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the year-to-date period. Since the year-to-date results are essentially in line with the results for the quarter, I'll just give you a few highlights. 
While organic revenue growth was 3.6% during the first 6 months of the year, the FX headwind reduced revenue by 2.2%. Factoring in the increase from acquisitions net of dispositions of 0.1%, our revenue increased on a year-to-date basis by 1.5% to just under $7.4 billion. 
EBITDA increased 4.1% to just over $1 billion. As a result of the initiatives we've mentioned over the last several calls, both our EBITDA and operating margins on a year-to-date basis have increased consistent with the increase from Q2. 
And on Slide 6, you can see our 6-month diluted EPS, was $2.25 per share, which is up $0.16 or 7.7% versus 2015. Turning to Slide 7, we shift the discussion to our revenue performance. Starting with FX for the quarter, the net impact decreased our revenue by $63 million or 1.6%. The dollar remains relatively strong overall and when compared to Q2 of 2015, strengthened on a reported basis against most of our major currencies, including the pound, the real, the Chinese yuan and the Australian and Canadian dollars. However, the U.S. dollar weakened on a reported basis against the euro and the yen. 
Looking ahead, if rates stay where they are, the negative impact of FX may reduce revenue by about 1.5% during the third quarter and for the full year. That being said, given the result of the Brexit vote and the current volatility in the pound as well as other global currencies, this estimate is certainly subject to further change as we move through the second half of the year. Revenue from acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue $13.2 million in the quarter or 0.3%. Along with the acquisition of Grupo ABC in Brazil during the first quarter, this figure included the impact of the acquisitions we've made in the U.S. and Europe over the past 12 months. The net figure also includes the impact of some strategic dispositions that we've completed as well. 
Going forward, we expect the net impact of acquisitions and dispositions will continue to be positive by about approximately 50 basis points per quarter. And finally, organic growth was positive $129 million or 3.4% this quarter. It was a solid quarter of growth across all of our major markets with the exception of Brazil, France and the Netherlands. 
The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included the continued strong performance across our media businesses as well as several of our advertising brands, our full-service health care businesses, which turned in solid performances; and despite weaknesses in France and Netherlands, the Euro Markets overall had positive organic growth. The Asia-Pacific region also had solid performances across almost all of our markets. And in Latin America, excellent performance by our agencies in Mexico, which offset the continued challenges experienced in Brazil. 
Further highlighting our regional mix of business on Slide 8, you can see during the quarter the split was 60% for North America, 9% for the U.K., 16% for the rest of Europe, 10% for Asia-Pacific, 3% for Latin America and 2% for Africa and the Middle East. 
Turning to the details of the performance by region on Slide 9, in North America, we had organic revenue growth of 3.2%, driven by the continued strong performance of our media businesses as well as several advertising brands and our full-service health care businesses. 
In Europe, the U.K. had organic growth of 3.3% on the strength of our specialty health care and PR businesses. The rest of Europe was up 4.3% led by our agencies in Spain and the Czech Republic, with a solid performance in Poland and Russia as well. 
Germany was also positive while the Netherlands and France lagged with negative growth. The Asia Pacific region was up 4.5%, most markets growing very well during the quarter, including Greater China and Japan. And although relatively small, we also saw a double-digit organic growth from many of our emerging market countries in the region, including India, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. 
In Latin America, strong performance by our agencies in Mexico offset continued weakness in Brazil as the region was up organically 1.7% for the quarter. Brazil was down once again, but the negative impact this quarter was better compared to Q1 of 2016. However, it is still too early to tell when the political and economic situation will stabilize. And Africa and Middle East, which is our smallest region, was slightly negative. 
Slide 10 shows our mix of business by discipline. For the quarter, the split was 53% for advertising services and 47% for marketing services. Our advertising discipline was up 7.7% in the quarter, led by the performance of our global media businesses and several of our advertising brands. 
While CRM was down 2.7%, the results were mixed across businesses and geographies. The reduction in CRM was driven primarily by our events, field marketing and point-of-sale businesses. PR was flat this quarter as we mentioned in the last quarter's call, we expect this performance to continue to improve as we move through the second half of the year and specialty communications was up 4.4% organically. The solid performance was driven by Omnicom Health Group with several new business wins by our full-service health care agencies. 
On Slide 11, we present our mix of business by industry sector. When comparing the year-to-date revenue for 2016 to 2015, you can see there were some minor shifts in the distribution of our client revenue by industry but nothing particularly significant. 
Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 12, you can see that in the first 6 months of the year, we generated $722 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. As for our primary uses of the cash on Slide 13, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $243 million. Keep in mind though the 10% increase in our quarterly dividend that we announced back in April was effective with the payment we made in early July. So the cash flow impact of the increase will be seen starting in Q3. 
Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $52 million. This is down versus last year due to the purchase of additional shares from our local partners in prior periods. Capital expenditures were $78 million; acquisitions, including earnout payments totaled $360 million; and stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled $352 million. All-in, we outspent our free cash flow by about $362 million in the first half of the year. 
Turning to Slide 14, regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter, our total debt at June 30, 2016 of just over $5 billion is up about $490 million from this time last year, reflecting the incremental $400 million increase in our borrowings related to the debt issuance back in April as well as an increase in the noncash fair value of our debt of about $90 million directly related to an offset by the positive fair value of the respective interest rate swaps on our debt as required to be reported on the balance sheet under U.S. GAAP. 
Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $3.5 billion, up $310 million versus the June 30, 2015 amount, primarily resulting from 2 noncash items in the quarter. The increase in debt from the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps and the reduction in cash from the negative effect of FX translation at the balance sheet date from our foreign cash balances. Additionally, positive change in operating capital of approximately $250 million was more than offset by our overspend of free cash flow of $290 million. 
Net debt increased by $1,546,000,000 compared to year-end as a result of the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of approximately $362 million and uses of working capital that typically occur in our first half of the year of approximately $1.1 billion. 
As for our ratios, they've increased slightly, reflecting the increase in our debt since this time last year. Our total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.2x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.6x. And due to the increase in our interest expense, our interest coverage ratio went down to 11.4x but it remains quite solid. 
Turning to Slide 15, we continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well-focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions. 
For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 18.4% and return on equity increased to 45.3%. 
And finally, on Slide 16, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders over the past 10-plus years. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2006 through Q2 of 2016, which totaled $10.1 billion. And the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $11.2 billion or a cumulative payout ratio of 111%. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we've included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review but at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you."

So part of it, of the move is undoubtedly some advertisers moving more to the upfront to avoid the experience they had a year ago paying those big premiums. But I do think there are a couple of other factors contributing to the price increase itself. You've got the pattern of diminished audiences so there is less supply there. We've also seen some advertisers that while they're continuing to grow their digital budgets, there is a tap of the brakes in that space as some react to concerns about viewability or fraud matters. So we see the demand is up some points. The prices are up higher than the increases in revenue because of the decreases in supply. And we'll have to see as the year unfolds whether those revenue increases hold in scatter."

And I think we're finding although FX is not always intuitive as the connection between the impact it has on revenues and our margins because it depends on where the FX movements are, what markets they're in and the relative margins of those markets, generally, we find when FX is plus or minus 1%, maybe 2%, typically it doesn't impact our margins that much. There could be exceptions but we haven't found that this year yet. 
And as far as interest expense goes and/or interest income, FX might have, as we've experienced in the last year, 1.5 year here, might have somewhat of an impact on our interest income, on our cash balances overseas, but not on our interest expense."

And as far as minority interests are concerned or noncontrolling interests declining for the rest of the year, I think we actually hope it doesn't because that means that the businesses with minority owners are performing better, and we're getting -- they're getting their share of a larger piece of the pie. But there is a bit of -- we did acquire some additional interests within the last 12 months -- or within the last 6 months, I'd say. That might bring that number down a bit. And the rest of it, the bigger impact, frankly on that number typically is FX. So it's possible that FX will reduce the number, it's possible FX will have a positive impact on that number depends on what market it's in. I think we have time for 1 more question, operator."

96161,372943786,1007011,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 14, 2016",2016-07-14,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Shub. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call. Second quarter organic revenue growth was 3.4%, continuing the pace we set last quarter and in line with our expectations. We also met our margin targets for the quarter and remain on track to",1789,"Thank you, Shub. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call. Second quarter organic revenue growth was 3.4%, continuing the pace we set last quarter and in line with our expectations. We also met our margin targets for the quarter and remain on track to deliver a 30 basis point margin improvement for the full year of 2016, or 13.7% EBITA versus 13.4% in '15. 
For the second quarter, EBITA margin was 15.2% versus 14.9% last year. Our results were solid during the quarter even in the face of continued currency headwinds. In the second quarter, 44% of our total revenue was derived from markets outside the United States. As a result, foreign currency in the second quarter reduced our revenue by $63 million or 1.6%. It's too early to fully assess the impact resulting from the ongoing Brexit discussions and upcoming U.S. elections. So far, the most significant effect is the continuing weakness of the British pound on our reported revenues. 
Additionally, when combined with the backdrop of recent terrorist-related events, clients have become more cautious with the most immediate effect being the cancellation of some customer events, which has had an impact on some of our CRM businesses. Phil will provide more details during his remarks. 
Looking at our organic growth, it was broad-based across geographies. Our strong consistent performance over many years is a testament to the strength of our services and the diversity of our offerings across the portfolio. By region, North America was up 3.2% with our media, advertising and specialty health businesses performing quite well during the quarter. 
Our growth in North America reflects in part the new business we captured in the United States in 2015 as well as the continued strength of our digital and data-driven platforms. Revenue from some of our 2015 new business wins start in the second half of this year and recent new business wins like Volkswagen media start in 2017. 
In terms of client trends, we continue to see growth in digital media despite increasing concerns around digital measurement, viewability and fraud. We also see modest growth in TV budgets, which is fueling a stronger upfront U.S. TV market with pricing up double digits in many cases. 
Please note, these increases, while good for the TV business, do not directly correlate to an increase in revenue to us. Our U.K. growth was 3.3%, with specialty health care and public relations having very strong performances in the market this quarter. In the Euro Markets, Spain and Germany were positive; France and Netherlands were slightly negative for the quarter as those countries continue to experience tepid economic growth. 
Outside the Euro Markets, we had very strong growth with the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia and Turkey generating solid results. 
Looking ahead, it is still too early to know what the impact of Brexit will be for the advertising market in Europe. What is clear is that the U.K. decision to leave the EU creates uncertainty and may slow down decision-making in many markets. Our agencies continue to operate without disruption in the U.K. and Europe. Over time, we expect the volatility and the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote to subside and for our agencies to adapt to the post-Brexit marketplace. 
Omnicom remains committed to serve the needs of our clients in the U.K. and European markets and to our people who provide great value to them. 
Turning to Asia. Second quarter organic growth was 4.5%, with almost all of our markets showing positive results, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam were exceptionally strong in the quarter. 
And Latin America grew 1.7% with Mexico well into double digits which more than offset the negative performance in Brazil. While Brazil continues to be a challenge, we saw better performance compared to the first quarter of this year. We are hopeful that this trend will continue and that the recent changes in leadership and economic policies as well as the Olympics later this summer will have a lasting positive effect. 
Looking at our bottom line, EPS increased 7.9% to $1.36 per share for the quarter versus $1.26 per share from the same quarter a year ago. Excluding the impact of currencies, EPS would have been higher for the quarter. Phil will provide the details during his remarks. 
Our results follow a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.50 to $0.55 earlier in this quarter. Finally, our balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance for the quarter and the first half of the year. 
Turning now to media and the ANA report, which was released earlier in June. As we said from the outset, our U.S. media agencies do not seek or retain rebates and return to clients all value negotiated in the form it is received. 
In the case of 1 global digital media provider, there is an incentive provision in our agreement that includes the U.S. This incentive continues to be returned to all clients in the U.S. on a pro rata basis according to their spending with this provider. We have contacted our clients to review our agency buying protocols, reassure them of the practices we follow and address any questions that they have. At Omnicom, we maintain strong compliance controls in both meeting the spirit of our client relationships and the terms of our client contracts. 
Our outside counsel, formerly asked ANA, K2 and Ebiquity to share any specific findings relating to Omnicom so we can ensure continuing contracting clients. No findings have been provided. 
It is our hope that after the Ebiquity report is released, the ANA and the 4A's restore the joint task force that was suspended earlier this year. So that a meaningful and clear agreement on joint practices and principles can be reached between advertisers and the agencies. 
With respect to our media operations, we continue to outperform the industry. Volkswagen recently selected Omnicom Media Group's PHD as its global media agency following a lengthy review. It was a huge win for PHD covering all VW group brands, including Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, Fiat, Skoda and commercial vehicles. Volkswagen indicated that our team stood out versus the competition by offering new digital data and analytical techniques for improved media targeting. 
In addition to VW, PHD also won media assignments from Delta Air Lines and Carnival Cruise Lines and our OMD media agency won ancestry.com business. These results follow the win of P&G's North American media business and the creation of our third media network, Hearts & Science, which launched with integrated data and analytics and marketing science capabilities into its core media service. 
What we've been seeing in media we are now experiencing more broadly across our advertising businesses as more clients are focused on leveraging data to inform creative messaging decisions. 
In several new business opportunities, clients are asking us to increase the collaboration of our media and creative services in order to maximize these benefits. The changes we are seeing underscore the importance of the talent and capabilities we've assembled in Annalect, our data and analytics platform, which has integrated its resources across many of our agencies, allowing our creative talent to bring new insight and value to clients. 
Across Omnicom, we continue to expand our capabilities and simplify our service offerings through internal investments in our agencies and through acquisitions. We recently announced the formation of 2 groups, 1 that aggregates our diverse offerings in the global health care industry into Omnicom Health Group and 1 that combines the strengths of all Omnicom's public relation firms, Omnicom PR Group. Both groups made their first acquisitions in the second quarter. Omnicom PR Group acquired Rabin Martin, a health care consulting firm that focuses on global public health issues, including chronic disease, enhancing women's health and preventing the spread of infectious disease. Rabin Martin's deep expertise in global public health is an important and growing specialty area as an increasing number of our clients see the need to address critical health issues in the world. 
Omnicom Health Group's first acquisition was BioPharm, an agency that specializes in multichannel marketing programs for pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients. Founded in 2005, BioPharm has an impressive client roster, which includes 17 of the 25 largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Omnicom's Health Group is organized by service offerings into 4 primary categories based on client needs: Professional, patient, payer, and regulatory evidence in medical. 
To further our capabilities in professional services, we recently launched DDB Health. DDB Health includes 5 professional health care agencies spanning in the U.S. and Europe. Omnicom Health Group now has creatively inspired dedicated partnerships with each of our global creative networks, TBWA\WorldHealth, BBDO Health Works and DDB Health. I'm happy to report that we're seeing good results strategically and operationally from both Omnicom Health Group and Omnicom Public Relations Group. We're also in the process of forming another group comprised of our independent national agencies, including Goodby, Silverstein, GSD&M, Martin Williams, and Zimmerman among others. While these agencies will continue to go-to-market as independent brands, we believe placing them in a singular group will provide benefits through the sharing of best practices across their management and operations. 
Finally, I recently returned from the  Cannes Lions Festival. I'm always impressed when I meet our creative talent from around the world. I'm proud to report the caliber of our creative continues to be outstanding. We proved once again we have the best people in business producing award winning campaigns for our clients. 
Here are a few of the highlights demonstrating the depth and breadth of our channel. 90 Omnicom agencies won almost 300 Lions from 27 different countries across more than 20 categories. Omnicom Media Group, including OMD and PHD, earned the most media Lions of any media agency holding company scoring a grand total of 15 awards. 
BBDO placed second and DDB was fourth in the Network of the Year category and finally, AlmapBBDO won the title of Agency of the Year. I want to congratulate all of our people and our agencies for their outstanding work. Our investments in talent, technology, and partnerships are making a difference for Omnicom and our agencies. They are critical to our success. We will continue to strategically invest in these areas as the marketing environment increases in complexity. In closing, we achieved our goals for organic growth, margins and profitability in the second quarter while it is impossible to predict the effects of Brexit as well as the impact of the U.S. presidential elections, we remain cautiously optimistic for the second half of the year and on target to achieve our 2016 plan. 
I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the second quarter results. Phil?"
96161,372943786,1007011,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 14, 2016",2016-07-14,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, during the second quarter of 2016, our business has once again delivered on their financial and strategic objectives while continuing to deliver best-in-class services to their clients. Our organic revenu",2303,"Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, during the second quarter of 2016, our business has once again delivered on their financial and strategic objectives while continuing to deliver best-in-class services to their clients. 
Our organic revenue growth of 3.4% for the second quarter was in line with our expectations and keeps us on track to meet our organic growth target of 3% to 3.5% for the full year. As has been the case for the last several quarters, the strength of the dollar continues to create a negative FX headwind on our revenue. 
For the second quarter, the reduction was 1.6% overall or about $63 million. Net acquisitions added 0.3% to revenue this quarter. In addition to the Grupo ABC acquisition in Brazil that we closed during the first quarter, in the second quarter, we added Rabin Martin, a health care public relations agency; and BioPharm, a specialty health care agency, late in the second quarter. 
As a result, total revenue for the quarter was just under $3.9 billion, an increase of 2.1% versus Q2 of last year. I'll discuss our revenue growth in further detail in a few minutes. 
Moving down to P&L below revenue, our Q2 EBITA increased 4.3% to $590 million. And the resulting EBITA margin of 15.2% represented a 30 basis point increase over Q2 of last year. The margin improvement, which is also in line with our expectations for the full year of 2016, is the result of our continuing efforts to leverage scale as we continue to pursue efficiency initiatives in the areas of real estate, back-office services, information technology and strategic purchasing across the entire organization. 
Operating income, or EBIT, for the quarter increased 4.3% to $562 million with operating margin improving to 14.5%, in line with the increase in our EBITA margin. Now turning to the items below operating income. Net interest expense for the quarter was $44.8 million, up $4.7 million versus the first quarter of 2016 and up $10.2 million versus Q2 of 2015. 
The increase in net interest expense versus the first quarter was primarily due to the termination of the fixed-to-floating rate swaps on our 2016 and 2022 notes. As you know, in April, we issued $1.4 billion of 10-year senior notes and redeemed 1 billion of notes that reached maturity on April 15. Although we incrementally added $400 million in debt, it had little effect on interest expense as rates have declined compared to when the 2016 notes were issued. Interest income earned in Q2 was lower compared to Q1 of 2016 as a result of lower interest earned on our cash balances, which were lower on average during Q2. 
Similarly, as compared to Q2 of last year, the increase in net interest expense of $10.2 million was primarily related to the termination of the fixed-to-floating rate swaps on our 2016 and 2022 notes. 
Additionally, our interest income on our cash balances held by our international treasury centers decreased year-over-year, primarily driven by negative FX translation. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.5%, which is down slightly versus Q1 of 2016 and the prior year as well as a result of some small tax planning items. Earnings from our affiliates totaled $2.8 million for the quarter, down a bit versus Q2 of last year. 
The allocation of earnings to minority shareholders in our less than fully-owned subsidiaries decreased by $3 million to $25.8 million. The decrease is primarily as a result of 2 factors. First, the impact of FX because a large portion of our less than fully-owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S. And second, purchase of minority interest in certain subsidiaries over the past year. 
As a result, net income was $326 million, that's an increase of $12 million or 3.9% versus Q2 of last year. 
Turning to Slide 3, the remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after allocation of $2 million of net income to participating securities was $324 million, an increase of 4.5% versus last year. 
You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was 239 million shares, which is down 2.7% versus last year as a result of repurchases of shares over the past year. As a result, diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.36, up $0.10 or 7.9% versus Q2 of 2015. 
On Slides 4 through 6, we provided the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the year-to-date period. Since the year-to-date results are essentially in line with the results for the quarter, I'll just give you a few highlights. 
While organic revenue growth was 3.6% during the first 6 months of the year, the FX headwind reduced revenue by 2.2%. Factoring in the increase from acquisitions net of dispositions of 0.1%, our revenue increased on a year-to-date basis by 1.5% to just under $7.4 billion. 
EBITDA increased 4.1% to just over $1 billion. As a result of the initiatives we've mentioned over the last several calls, both our EBITDA and operating margins on a year-to-date basis have increased consistent with the increase from Q2. 
And on Slide 6, you can see our 6-month diluted EPS, was $2.25 per share, which is up $0.16 or 7.7% versus 2015. Turning to Slide 7, we shift the discussion to our revenue performance. Starting with FX for the quarter, the net impact decreased our revenue by $63 million or 1.6%. The dollar remains relatively strong overall and when compared to Q2 of 2015, strengthened on a reported basis against most of our major currencies, including the pound, the real, the Chinese yuan and the Australian and Canadian dollars. However, the U.S. dollar weakened on a reported basis against the euro and the yen. 
Looking ahead, if rates stay where they are, the negative impact of FX may reduce revenue by about 1.5% during the third quarter and for the full year. That being said, given the result of the Brexit vote and the current volatility in the pound as well as other global currencies, this estimate is certainly subject to further change as we move through the second half of the year. Revenue from acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue $13.2 million in the quarter or 0.3%. Along with the acquisition of Grupo ABC in Brazil during the first quarter, this figure included the impact of the acquisitions we've made in the U.S. and Europe over the past 12 months. The net figure also includes the impact of some strategic dispositions that we've completed as well. 
Going forward, we expect the net impact of acquisitions and dispositions will continue to be positive by about approximately 50 basis points per quarter. And finally, organic growth was positive $129 million or 3.4% this quarter. It was a solid quarter of growth across all of our major markets with the exception of Brazil, France and the Netherlands. 
The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included the continued strong performance across our media businesses as well as several of our advertising brands, our full-service health care businesses, which turned in solid performances; and despite weaknesses in France and Netherlands, the Euro Markets overall had positive organic growth. The Asia-Pacific region also had solid performances across almost all of our markets. And in Latin America, excellent performance by our agencies in Mexico, which offset the continued challenges experienced in Brazil. 
Further highlighting our regional mix of business on Slide 8, you can see during the quarter the split was 60% for North America, 9% for the U.K., 16% for the rest of Europe, 10% for Asia-Pacific, 3% for Latin America and 2% for Africa and the Middle East. 
Turning to the details of the performance by region on Slide 9, in North America, we had organic revenue growth of 3.2%, driven by the continued strong performance of our media businesses as well as several advertising brands and our full-service health care businesses. 
In Europe, the U.K. had organic growth of 3.3% on the strength of our specialty health care and PR businesses. The rest of Europe was up 4.3% led by our agencies in Spain and the Czech Republic, with a solid performance in Poland and Russia as well. 
Germany was also positive while the Netherlands and France lagged with negative growth. The Asia Pacific region was up 4.5%, most markets growing very well during the quarter, including Greater China and Japan. And although relatively small, we also saw a double-digit organic growth from many of our emerging market countries in the region, including India, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. 
In Latin America, strong performance by our agencies in Mexico offset continued weakness in Brazil as the region was up organically 1.7% for the quarter. Brazil was down once again, but the negative impact this quarter was better compared to Q1 of 2016. However, it is still too early to tell when the political and economic situation will stabilize. And Africa and Middle East, which is our smallest region, was slightly negative. 
Slide 10 shows our mix of business by discipline. For the quarter, the split was 53% for advertising services and 47% for marketing services. Our advertising discipline was up 7.7% in the quarter, led by the performance of our global media businesses and several of our advertising brands. 
While CRM was down 2.7%, the results were mixed across businesses and geographies. The reduction in CRM was driven primarily by our events, field marketing and point-of-sale businesses. PR was flat this quarter as we mentioned in the last quarter's call, we expect this performance to continue to improve as we move through the second half of the year and specialty communications was up 4.4% organically. The solid performance was driven by Omnicom Health Group with several new business wins by our full-service health care agencies. 
On Slide 11, we present our mix of business by industry sector. When comparing the year-to-date revenue for 2016 to 2015, you can see there were some minor shifts in the distribution of our client revenue by industry but nothing particularly significant. 
Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 12, you can see that in the first 6 months of the year, we generated $722 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. As for our primary uses of the cash on Slide 13, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $243 million. Keep in mind though the 10% increase in our quarterly dividend that we announced back in April was effective with the payment we made in early July. So the cash flow impact of the increase will be seen starting in Q3. 
Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $52 million. This is down versus last year due to the purchase of additional shares from our local partners in prior periods. Capital expenditures were $78 million; acquisitions, including earnout payments totaled $360 million; and stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled $352 million. All-in, we outspent our free cash flow by about $362 million in the first half of the year. 
Turning to Slide 14, regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter, our total debt at June 30, 2016 of just over $5 billion is up about $490 million from this time last year, reflecting the incremental $400 million increase in our borrowings related to the debt issuance back in April as well as an increase in the noncash fair value of our debt of about $90 million directly related to an offset by the positive fair value of the respective interest rate swaps on our debt as required to be reported on the balance sheet under U.S. GAAP. 
Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $3.5 billion, up $310 million versus the June 30, 2015 amount, primarily resulting from 2 noncash items in the quarter. The increase in debt from the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps and the reduction in cash from the negative effect of FX translation at the balance sheet date from our foreign cash balances. Additionally, positive change in operating capital of approximately $250 million was more than offset by our overspend of free cash flow of $290 million. 
Net debt increased by $1,546,000,000 compared to year-end as a result of the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of approximately $362 million and uses of working capital that typically occur in our first half of the year of approximately $1.1 billion. 
As for our ratios, they've increased slightly, reflecting the increase in our debt since this time last year. Our total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.2x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.6x. And due to the increase in our interest expense, our interest coverage ratio went down to 11.4x but it remains quite solid. 
Turning to Slide 15, we continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well-focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions. 
For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 18.4% and return on equity increased to 45.3%. 
And finally, on Slide 16, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders over the past 10-plus years. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2006 through Q2 of 2016, which totaled $10.1 billion. And the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $11.2 billion or a cumulative payout ratio of 111%. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we've included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review but at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you."

There is -- a year ago, we did see or over the past year, I should say, we did see some significant scatter premium. So part of it, of the move is undoubtedly some advertisers moving more to the upfront to avoid the experience they had a year ago paying those big premiums. But I do think there are a couple of other factors contributing to the price increase itself. You've got the pattern of diminished audiences so there is less supply there. We've also seen some advertisers that while they're continuing to grow their digital budgets, there is a tap of the brakes in that space as some react to concerns about viewability or fraud matters. So we see the demand is up some points. The prices are up higher than the increases in revenue because of the decreases in supply. And we'll have to see as the year unfolds whether those revenue increases hold in scatter."

Second quarter organic revenue growth was 3.4%, continuing the pace we set last quarter and in line with our expectations. We also met our margin targets for the quarter and remain on track to deliver a 30 basis point margin improvement for the full year of 2016, or 13.7% EBITA versus 13.4% in '15. 
For the second quarter, EBITA margin was 15.2% versus 14.9% last year. Our results were solid during the quarter even in the face of continued currency headwinds. In the second quarter, 44% of our total revenue was derived from markets outside the United States. As a result, foreign currency in the second quarter reduced our revenue by $63 million or 1.6%. It's too early to fully assess the impact resulting from the ongoing Brexit discussions and upcoming U.S. elections. So far, the most significant effect is the continuing weakness of the British pound on our reported revenues. 
Additionally, when combined with the backdrop of recent terrorist-related events, clients have become more cautious with the most immediate effect being the cancellation of some customer events, which has had an impact on some of our CRM businesses. Phil will provide more details during his remarks. 
Looking at our organic growth, it was broad-based across geographies. Our strong consistent performance over many years is a testament to the strength of our services and the diversity of our offerings across the portfolio. By region, North America was up 3.2% with our media, advertising and specialty health businesses performing quite well during the quarter. 
Our growth in North America reflects in part the new business we captured in the United States in 2015 as well as the continued strength of our digital and data-driven platforms. Revenue from some of our 2015 new business wins start in the second half of this year and recent new business wins like Volkswagen media start in 2017. 
In terms of client trends, we continue to see growth in digital media despite increasing concerns around digital measurement, viewability and fraud. We also see modest growth in TV budgets, which is fueling a stronger upfront U.S. TV market with pricing up double digits in many cases. 
Please note, these increases, while good for the TV business, do not directly correlate to an increase in revenue to us. Our U.K. growth was 3.3%, with specialty health care and public relations having very strong performances in the market this quarter. In the Euro Markets, Spain and Germany were positive; France and Netherlands were slightly negative for the quarter as those countries continue to experience tepid economic growth. 
Outside the Euro Markets, we had very strong growth with the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia and Turkey generating solid results. 
Looking ahead, it is still too early to know what the impact of Brexit will be for the advertising market in Europe. What is clear is that the U.K. decision to leave the EU creates uncertainty and may slow down decision-making in many markets. Our agencies continue to operate without disruption in the U.K. and Europe. Over time, we expect the volatility and the uncertainty surrounding the Brexit vote to subside and for our agencies to adapt to the post-Brexit marketplace. 
Omnicom remains committed to serve the needs of our clients in the U.K. and European markets and to our people who provide great value to them. 
Turning to Asia. Second quarter organic growth was 4.5%, with almost all of our markets showing positive results, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam were exceptionally strong in the quarter. 
And Latin America grew 1.7% with Mexico well into double digits which more than offset the negative performance in Brazil. While Brazil continues to be a challenge, we saw better performance compared to the first quarter of this year. We are hopeful that this trend will continue and that the recent changes in leadership and economic policies as well as the Olympics later this summer will have a lasting positive effect. 
Looking at our bottom line, EPS increased 7.9% to $1.36 per share for the quarter versus $1.26 per share from the same quarter a year ago. Excluding the impact of currencies, EPS would have been higher for the quarter. Phil will provide the details during his remarks. 
Our results follow a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.50 to $0.55 earlier in this quarter. Finally, our balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance for the quarter and the first half of the year. 
Turning now to media and the ANA report, which was released earlier in June. As we said from the outset, our U.S. media agencies do not seek or retain rebates and return to clients all value negotiated in the form it is received. 
In the case of 1 global digital media provider, there is an incentive provision in our agreement that includes the U.S. This incentive continues to be returned to all clients in the U.S. on a pro rata basis according to their spending with this provider. We have contacted our clients to review our agency buying protocols, reassure them of the practices we follow and address any questions that they have. At Omnicom, we maintain strong compliance controls in both meeting the spirit of our client relationships and the terms of our client contracts. 
Our outside counsel, formerly asked ANA, K2 and Ebiquity to share any specific findings relating to Omnicom so we can ensure continuing contracting clients. No findings have been provided. 
It is our hope that after the Ebiquity report is released, the ANA and the 4A's restore the joint task force that was suspended earlier this year. So that a meaningful and clear agreement on joint practices and principles can be reached between advertisers and the agencies. 
With respect to our media operations, we continue to outperform the industry. Volkswagen recently selected Omnicom Media Group's PHD as its global media agency following a lengthy review. It was a huge win for PHD covering all VW group brands, including Volkswagen, Audi, Porsche, Fiat, Skoda and commercial vehicles. Volkswagen indicated that our team stood out versus the competition by offering new digital data and analytical techniques for improved media targeting. 
In addition to VW, PHD also won media assignments from Delta Air Lines and Carnival Cruise Lines and our OMD media agency won ancestry.com business. These results follow the win of P&G's North American media business and the creation of our third media network, Hearts & Science, which launched with integrated data and analytics and marketing science capabilities into its core media service. 
What we've been seeing in media we are now experiencing more broadly across our advertising businesses as more clients are focused on leveraging data to inform creative messaging decisions. 
In several new business opportunities, clients are asking us to increase the collaboration of our media and creative services in order to maximize these benefits. The changes we are seeing underscore the importance of the talent and capabilities we've assembled in Annalect, our data and analytics platform, which has integrated its resources across many of our agencies, allowing our creative talent to bring new insight and value to clients. 
Across Omnicom, we continue to expand our capabilities and simplify our service offerings through internal investments in our agencies and through acquisitions. We recently announced the formation of 2 groups, 1 that aggregates our diverse offerings in the global health care industry into Omnicom Health Group and 1 that combines the strengths of all Omnicom's public relation firms, Omnicom PR Group. Both groups made their first acquisitions in the second quarter. Omnicom PR Group acquired Rabin Martin, a health care consulting firm that focuses on global public health issues, including chronic disease, enhancing women's health and preventing the spread of infectious disease. Rabin Martin's deep expertise in global public health is an important and growing specialty area as an increasing number of our clients see the need to address critical health issues in the world. 
Omnicom Health Group's first acquisition was BioPharm, an agency that specializes in multichannel marketing programs for pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients. Founded in 2005, BioPharm has an impressive client roster, which includes 17 of the 25 largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Omnicom's Health Group is organized by service offerings into 4 primary categories based on client needs: Professional, patient, payer, and regulatory evidence in medical. 
To further our capabilities in professional services, we recently launched DDB Health. DDB Health includes 5 professional health care agencies spanning in the U.S. and Europe. Omnicom Health Group now has creatively inspired dedicated partnerships with each of our global creative networks, TBWA\WorldHealth, BBDO Health Works and DDB Health. I'm happy to report that we're seeing good results strategically and operationally from both Omnicom Health Group and Omnicom Public Relations Group. We're also in the process of forming another group comprised of our independent national agencies, including Goodby, Silverstein, GSD&M, Martin Williams, and Zimmerman among others. While these agencies will continue to go-to-market as independent brands, we believe placing them in a singular group will provide benefits through the sharing of best practices across their management and operations. 
Finally, I recently returned from the  Cannes Lions Festival. I'm always impressed when I meet our creative talent from around the world. I'm proud to report the caliber of our creative continues to be outstanding. We proved once again we have the best people in business producing award winning campaigns for our clients. 
Here are a few of the highlights demonstrating the depth and breadth of our channel. 90 Omnicom agencies won almost 300 Lions from 27 different countries across more than 20 categories. Omnicom Media Group, including OMD and PHD, earned the most media Lions of any media agency holding company scoring a grand total of 15 awards. 
BBDO placed second and DDB was fourth in the Network of the Year category and finally, AlmapBBDO won the title of Agency of the Year. I want to congratulate all of our people and our agencies for their outstanding work. Our investments in talent, technology, and partnerships are making a difference for Omnicom and our agencies. They are critical to our success. We will continue to strategically invest in these areas as the marketing environment increases in complexity. In closing, we achieved our goals for organic growth, margins and profitability in the second quarter while it is impossible to predict the effects of Brexit as well as the impact of the U.S. presidential elections, we remain cautiously optimistic for the second half of the year and on target to achieve our 2016 plan. 
I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the second quarter results. Phil?"
96161,372943786,1007013,"Omnicom Group Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 14, 2016",2016-07-14,"Earnings Calls","Omnicom Group Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, during the second quarter of 2016, our business has once again delivered on their financial and strategic objectives while continuing to deliver best-in-class services to their clients. Our organic revenu",2303,"Thank you, John, and good morning. As John said, during the second quarter of 2016, our business has once again delivered on their financial and strategic objectives while continuing to deliver best-in-class services to their clients. 
Our organic revenue growth of 3.4% for the second quarter was in line with our expectations and keeps us on track to meet our organic growth target of 3% to 3.5% for the full year. As has been the case for the last several quarters, the strength of the dollar continues to create a negative FX headwind on our revenue. 
For the second quarter, the reduction was 1.6% overall or about $63 million. Net acquisitions added 0.3% to revenue this quarter. In addition to the Grupo ABC acquisition in Brazil that we closed during the first quarter, in the second quarter, we added Rabin Martin, a health care public relations agency; and BioPharm, a specialty health care agency, late in the second quarter. 
As a result, total revenue for the quarter was just under $3.9 billion, an increase of 2.1% versus Q2 of last year. I'll discuss our revenue growth in further detail in a few minutes. 
Moving down to P&L below revenue, our Q2 EBITA increased 4.3% to $590 million. And the resulting EBITA margin of 15.2% represented a 30 basis point increase over Q2 of last year. The margin improvement, which is also in line with our expectations for the full year of 2016, is the result of our continuing efforts to leverage scale as we continue to pursue efficiency initiatives in the areas of real estate, back-office services, information technology and strategic purchasing across the entire organization. 
Operating income, or EBIT, for the quarter increased 4.3% to $562 million with operating margin improving to 14.5%, in line with the increase in our EBITA margin. Now turning to the items below operating income. Net interest expense for the quarter was $44.8 million, up $4.7 million versus the first quarter of 2016 and up $10.2 million versus Q2 of 2015. 
The increase in net interest expense versus the first quarter was primarily due to the termination of the fixed-to-floating rate swaps on our 2016 and 2022 notes. As you know, in April, we issued $1.4 billion of 10-year senior notes and redeemed 1 billion of notes that reached maturity on April 15. Although we incrementally added $400 million in debt, it had little effect on interest expense as rates have declined compared to when the 2016 notes were issued. Interest income earned in Q2 was lower compared to Q1 of 2016 as a result of lower interest earned on our cash balances, which were lower on average during Q2. 
Similarly, as compared to Q2 of last year, the increase in net interest expense of $10.2 million was primarily related to the termination of the fixed-to-floating rate swaps on our 2016 and 2022 notes. 
Additionally, our interest income on our cash balances held by our international treasury centers decreased year-over-year, primarily driven by negative FX translation. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.5%, which is down slightly versus Q1 of 2016 and the prior year as well as a result of some small tax planning items. Earnings from our affiliates totaled $2.8 million for the quarter, down a bit versus Q2 of last year. 
The allocation of earnings to minority shareholders in our less than fully-owned subsidiaries decreased by $3 million to $25.8 million. The decrease is primarily as a result of 2 factors. First, the impact of FX because a large portion of our less than fully-owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S. And second, purchase of minority interest in certain subsidiaries over the past year. 
As a result, net income was $326 million, that's an increase of $12 million or 3.9% versus Q2 of last year. 
Turning to Slide 3, the remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after allocation of $2 million of net income to participating securities was $324 million, an increase of 4.5% versus last year. 
You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was 239 million shares, which is down 2.7% versus last year as a result of repurchases of shares over the past year. As a result, diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.36, up $0.10 or 7.9% versus Q2 of 2015. 
On Slides 4 through 6, we provided the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the year-to-date period. Since the year-to-date results are essentially in line with the results for the quarter, I'll just give you a few highlights. 
While organic revenue growth was 3.6% during the first 6 months of the year, the FX headwind reduced revenue by 2.2%. Factoring in the increase from acquisitions net of dispositions of 0.1%, our revenue increased on a year-to-date basis by 1.5% to just under $7.4 billion. 
EBITDA increased 4.1% to just over $1 billion. As a result of the initiatives we've mentioned over the last several calls, both our EBITDA and operating margins on a year-to-date basis have increased consistent with the increase from Q2. 
And on Slide 6, you can see our 6-month diluted EPS, was $2.25 per share, which is up $0.16 or 7.7% versus 2015. Turning to Slide 7, we shift the discussion to our revenue performance. Starting with FX for the quarter, the net impact decreased our revenue by $63 million or 1.6%. The dollar remains relatively strong overall and when compared to Q2 of 2015, strengthened on a reported basis against most of our major currencies, including the pound, the real, the Chinese yuan and the Australian and Canadian dollars. However, the U.S. dollar weakened on a reported basis against the euro and the yen. 
Looking ahead, if rates stay where they are, the negative impact of FX may reduce revenue by about 1.5% during the third quarter and for the full year. That being said, given the result of the Brexit vote and the current volatility in the pound as well as other global currencies, this estimate is certainly subject to further change as we move through the second half of the year. Revenue from acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue $13.2 million in the quarter or 0.3%. Along with the acquisition of Grupo ABC in Brazil during the first quarter, this figure included the impact of the acquisitions we've made in the U.S. and Europe over the past 12 months. The net figure also includes the impact of some strategic dispositions that we've completed as well. 
Going forward, we expect the net impact of acquisitions and dispositions will continue to be positive by about approximately 50 basis points per quarter. And finally, organic growth was positive $129 million or 3.4% this quarter. It was a solid quarter of growth across all of our major markets with the exception of Brazil, France and the Netherlands. 
The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included the continued strong performance across our media businesses as well as several of our advertising brands, our full-service health care businesses, which turned in solid performances; and despite weaknesses in France and Netherlands, the Euro Markets overall had positive organic growth. The Asia-Pacific region also had solid performances across almost all of our markets. And in Latin America, excellent performance by our agencies in Mexico, which offset the continued challenges experienced in Brazil. 
Further highlighting our regional mix of business on Slide 8, you can see during the quarter the split was 60% for North America, 9% for the U.K., 16% for the rest of Europe, 10% for Asia-Pacific, 3% for Latin America and 2% for Africa and the Middle East. 
Turning to the details of the performance by region on Slide 9, in North America, we had organic revenue growth of 3.2%, driven by the continued strong performance of our media businesses as well as several advertising brands and our full-service health care businesses. 
In Europe, the U.K. had organic growth of 3.3% on the strength of our specialty health care and PR businesses. The rest of Europe was up 4.3% led by our agencies in Spain and the Czech Republic, with a solid performance in Poland and Russia as well. 
Germany was also positive while the Netherlands and France lagged with negative growth. The Asia Pacific region was up 4.5%, most markets growing very well during the quarter, including Greater China and Japan. And although relatively small, we also saw a double-digit organic growth from many of our emerging market countries in the region, including India, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. 
In Latin America, strong performance by our agencies in Mexico offset continued weakness in Brazil as the region was up organically 1.7% for the quarter. Brazil was down once again, but the negative impact this quarter was better compared to Q1 of 2016. However, it is still too early to tell when the political and economic situation will stabilize. And Africa and Middle East, which is our smallest region, was slightly negative. 
Slide 10 shows our mix of business by discipline. For the quarter, the split was 53% for advertising services and 47% for marketing services. Our advertising discipline was up 7.7% in the quarter, led by the performance of our global media businesses and several of our advertising brands. 
While CRM was down 2.7%, the results were mixed across businesses and geographies. The reduction in CRM was driven primarily by our events, field marketing and point-of-sale businesses. PR was flat this quarter as we mentioned in the last quarter's call, we expect this performance to continue to improve as we move through the second half of the year and specialty communications was up 4.4% organically. The solid performance was driven by Omnicom Health Group with several new business wins by our full-service health care agencies. 
On Slide 11, we present our mix of business by industry sector. When comparing the year-to-date revenue for 2016 to 2015, you can see there were some minor shifts in the distribution of our client revenue by industry but nothing particularly significant. 
Turning to our cash flow performance on Slide 12, you can see that in the first 6 months of the year, we generated $722 million of free cash flow, excluding changes in working capital. As for our primary uses of the cash on Slide 13, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $243 million. Keep in mind though the 10% increase in our quarterly dividend that we announced back in April was effective with the payment we made in early July. So the cash flow impact of the increase will be seen starting in Q3. 
Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $52 million. This is down versus last year due to the purchase of additional shares from our local partners in prior periods. Capital expenditures were $78 million; acquisitions, including earnout payments totaled $360 million; and stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled $352 million. All-in, we outspent our free cash flow by about $362 million in the first half of the year. 
Turning to Slide 14, regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter, our total debt at June 30, 2016 of just over $5 billion is up about $490 million from this time last year, reflecting the incremental $400 million increase in our borrowings related to the debt issuance back in April as well as an increase in the noncash fair value of our debt of about $90 million directly related to an offset by the positive fair value of the respective interest rate swaps on our debt as required to be reported on the balance sheet under U.S. GAAP. 
Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $3.5 billion, up $310 million versus the June 30, 2015 amount, primarily resulting from 2 noncash items in the quarter. The increase in debt from the increase in the fair value of our interest rate swaps and the reduction in cash from the negative effect of FX translation at the balance sheet date from our foreign cash balances. Additionally, positive change in operating capital of approximately $250 million was more than offset by our overspend of free cash flow of $290 million. 
Net debt increased by $1,546,000,000 compared to year-end as a result of the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of approximately $362 million and uses of working capital that typically occur in our first half of the year of approximately $1.1 billion. 
As for our ratios, they've increased slightly, reflecting the increase in our debt since this time last year. Our total debt-to-EBITDA was 2.2x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.6x. And due to the increase in our interest expense, our interest coverage ratio went down to 11.4x but it remains quite solid. 
Turning to Slide 15, we continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well-focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions. 
For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital increased to 18.4% and return on equity increased to 45.3%. 
And finally, on Slide 16, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders over the past 10-plus years. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2006 through Q2 of 2016, which totaled $10.1 billion. And the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $11.2 billion or a cumulative payout ratio of 111%. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we've included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review but at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you."

So part of it, of the move is undoubtedly some advertisers moving more to the upfront to avoid the experience they had a year ago paying those big premiums. But I do think there are a couple of other factors contributing to the price increase itself. You've got the pattern of diminished audiences so there is less supply there. We've also seen some advertisers that while they're continuing to grow their digital budgets, there is a tap of the brakes in that space as some react to concerns about viewability or fraud matters.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I am pleased to speak to you this morning about our third quarter 2016 business results.

I am pleased to speak to you this morning about our third quarter 2016 business results. 
Organic revenue growth for the third quarter was 3.2%, which is in line with our internal targets. For the 9 months ended September 30, organic growth is 3.4%. Our EBITDA margins exceeded our expectations and increased 40 basis points for the third quarter and are up 40 basis points for the 9 months ended September 30. Based on our year-to-date results, we are on track to meet our internal revenue and margin targets for the year. 
As we have discussed, foreign exchange continued to have a negative impact on our earnings during the quarter, although the effect of currency has significantly declined compared to what we experienced in 2015. At this point, the biggest movement is the decline of the British pound versus the U.S. dollar. Phil will provide more details on our margin improvement and currency outlook during his remarks.
Turning to our organic growth. It was broad-based across our major regions and disciplines. This growth highlights the consistency and diversity of our operations even in the face of tepid economic conditions and the uncertainty created by events in our 2 largest markets, the presidential election in the United States and Brexit in the U.K. Our performance underscores the strong competitive position of our agencies across the spectrum of advertising and marketing disciplines and key geographic markets as well as our digital and analytical expertise.
Looking at organic growth by region. North America was up 1.7%. This was in the face of difficult comps when compared to the third quarter 2015. North American growth was driven by strong performance in media and public relations. Our U.K. organic growth was 5.2%, reflecting very solid performance from our portfolio of agencies in the market. The situation in the U.K. is clearly something we're monitoring closely. At this point, we're not able to fully assess the effect Brexit could have on our operations in either the U.K. or the rest of Europe.
In Europe, we experienced growth of 2%. The eurozone markets were essentially flat for the quarter as very strong growth in Italy and Spain was offset by a difficult quarter in Germany and declines in France and the Netherlands. Outside the Euro Markets, growth was in the low-teens with the Czech Republic, Russia and Sweden outperforming during the quarter.
Turning to Asia. Third quarter organic growth was 8%. Australia, India, Japan and New Zealand all had strong results and growth in Greater China moderated to just over 4%. Latin America was up 11.9%, driven by very strong performance in Mexico. Brazil was also positive for the quarter, helped in part by Olympic activity. 
Our EBITA for the quarter increased $27.4 million or 6% to $482.1 million. Our EBITA margin increased to  12.7% versus 12.3% in the third quarter of 2015.
Looking at our bottom line. Net income available for common shares for the third quarter of 2016 increased $15.8 million or 6.7% to $252.6 million and our average share count was down 2.3% from the prior year. The combined result was an increase in EPS of 9.3% to $1.06 per share for the quarter versus $0.97 per share for the same quarter a year ago.
For the 9 months ended September 30, our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong. We generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow and returned approximately $800 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Looking at the rest of the year. There are a couple of factors that result in less visibility as we plan for Q4. As has consistently been the case over a number of years, there's quite a bit of project work in the fourth quarter that can impact revenue. Each year, we have found this year-end project work is between $200 million and $250 million. Client spending on these projects is not easily forecast and typically is based on individual client circumstance and general economic conditions.
This year is further complicated by the upcoming U.S. presidential election, the increasing likelihood that the Fed will raise rates before year-end and the potential effects of Brexit. Partially offsetting these unknowns is our recent new business success. Some of these wins, like AT&T, will start generating incremental revenue in the fourth quarter and others, like Volkswagen media and McDonald's, will not contribute to incremental revenue until January 2017.
Let me now discuss what we're seeing in the industry and how our strategies allow us to achieve consistent financial results. During the third quarter, we stayed focused on executing our strategies for growth; attracting, retaining and developing top talent; extending our capabilities around the world and moving into new service areas; building our digital and analytical competencies by investing in platforms and agencies; and partnering with innovative technology companies and collaborating to deliver big ideas and results based upon meaningful consumer insights across all channels.
The significant wins I just mentioned prove Omnicom has the brightest talent using the latest digital and analytical tools in the marketplace. In August, we were awarded the consolidated data, analytics, media, digital and creative business for AT&T across the United States and Mexico. AT&T is the largest advertised brand in the United States and the second-largest advertiser. 
BBDO had a significant share of creative for many years and now has responsibility for the subscription TV business, including DIRECTTV and the Internet service businesses. Hearts & Science will be their new media agency. It will be a fully integrated offering with people from BBDO, Hearts & Science and other Omnicom agencies sitting and working together in offices in New York, Dallas and Atlanta.
Late in the quarter, McDonald's chose Omnicom to consolidate its U.S. creative account under the leadership of Wendy Clark, DDB North America CEO. We've been a partner of McDonald's for over 40 years and look forward to taking our partnership to a new level. We are forming a dedicated agency for McDonald's based in Chicago with data and digital as its core. It will house talent from several Omnicom agencies that will work jointly to deliver seamless execution across all platforms and disciplines, including creative, media and sales promotion. 
The client feedback from these wins highlights 2 major themes: First, we have outstanding talent that can truly work together; and second, we have the ability to leverage superior data and analytics that drive shopper insights, more relevant and resident creative work and more efficient and effective media delivery. 
Effective collaboration among our agencies and with our clients and outside partners is part of the culture we have worked to organically build at Omnicom. It's gratifying to see that it is being recognized by clients. We believe the ability of our people to effectively and actively coordinate will be increasingly important as marketers use data-driven insights to inform creative and media planning. Over the past few months, I've had the pleasure to work with our people on some of the biggest new business pitches we have ever seen. Many gave up their holidays and vacations, even honeymoons. I want to thank and congratulate all of our agencies and our people for their dedication, commitment and ongoing success on this front.
Underpinning all of this is Annalect, our cornerstone data and marketing and sciences group. We built it from within and continue to invest in it. We developed this capability in-house as opposed to trying to gain this competency through bolt-on acquisitions. As a result of this internal investment, the level of collaboration and integration of Annalect with our agencies across the group is second to none. Annalect's data scientists are embedded across our group in almost all disciplines, from media to creative and most recently, to CRM and PR. It has evolved to play a major role in servicing our existing clients and winning new business and is truly a differentiating asset for us.
Our belief in investment in talent, data and analytics, creativity and collaboration as core strategies are paying off. Our ability to innovate was formally recognized last quarter when Forbes magazine named Omnicom 1 of the 100 most innovative companies in the world. It is a significant recognition for us. And what's more, it's a first for any advertising and marketing company.
On the topic of winning, let me just mention a few highlights from the Spikes Advertising Festival recently held in Singapore, which is considered the Cannes of Asia. BBDO Asia Pacific received top honor, winning Network of the Year for the third year in a row. Colenso BBDO won Agency of the Year while sister shop, Clemenger BBDO, came in second. TBWA\HAKUHODO was the digital Grand Prix winner and won 12 Spikes. All told, 31 agencies in 10 countries contributed to more than 130 Spike awards. I want to congratulate everyone who helped win these awards. Your talent is a great reflection on Omnicom and your hard work is appreciated. 
Omnicom's ability to win awards relies on talent. And for us, that means a diverse workforce. We recognize that a diverse group of people will create a stronger culture, perform at a higher level and will be better at developing meaningful insights and creative content. That's why we continue to push hard on our diversity initiatives. 
Last quarter, Omniwomen, which is well-established in the United States and Europe, formally launched in Asia with an event in Shanghai to inspire and celebrate women in our agencies in Greater China. Omniwomen serves as a catalyst for increasing the influence and number of our women leaders. And I'm especially proud of this effort and the benefit it provides to our people, our clients and the company. We also launched OPEN Pride, a resource group committed to inclusion and diversity efforts across Omnicom. OPEN Pride promotes awareness, acceptance and advocacy by fostering an inclusive and engaging work environment for Omnicom's LGBT community.
In closing, we achieved our goals for revenue growth, margins and profitability in the third quarter and remain cautiously optimistic for the fourth quarter. I will turn the phone call over to Phil for a closer look at the third quarter results. Phil?"

For the third quarter, organic growth was 3.2%. And for the year-to-date period, it was 3.4%. FX continues to represent a headwind to our revenue, driven in large part by the weakening of the British pound year-over-year. For the third quarter, the FX impact reduced revenue 1.3% or about $50 million. Including the positive impact of 0.4% from our net acquisition activity, total revenue for the quarter was just under $3.8 billion, an increase of 2.3% versus Q3 of last year. I'll review our revenue growth in detail in a few minutes.
Moving down the income statement to the items below revenue. Our Q3 EBITA increased 6.0% to $482 million and the resulting EBITA margin of 12.7% represents a 40 basis points increase over Q3 of last year. The increase, which exceeded by a bit our targeted 30 basis point improvement for the full year of 2016 is mainly the result of our ongoing initiatives to leverage scale and enhance efficiency on a company-wide basis as well as a change in business mix for the quarter. Operating income or EBIT for the quarter increased 5.8% to $453 million with operating margin improving 12.0%, in line with the the EBITA margin improvement. 
Now turning to the items below operating income. Net interest expense for the quarter was $42 million, down $2.8 million versus the second quarter of 2016 and up $6.1 million versus Q3 of 2015. Gross interest expense was down slightly compared to Q2 2016. As you know, when our $1 billion in 2016 senior notes reached maturity back in April, we issued $1.4 billion of 10-year senior notes due in 2026. We also entered into a fixed to floating interest rate swap on $500 million of the 2026 notes. Although we incrementally added $400 million in debt, the net effect of the reduction in rates on the new notes, combined with the rate swaps, reduced our gross interest expense. 
Third quarter had the benefit of this reduction for the full quarter compared to only a partial benefit in Q2, resulting in a reduction compared to Q2 of approximately $1.5 million in interest expense. As compared to Q3 of last year, the increase in gross interest expense of $7.3 million primarily resulted from the termination of the fixed to floating rate swaps on our 2022 notes. Interest income earned in Q3 of 2016 was a bit higher when compared to both Q2 of 2016 and Q3 of 2015, resulting from higher interest earned on the cash held by our international treasury centers.
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 32.7%, which is in line with our current expectations for our annual rate. Earnings from our affiliates totaled $1.4 million for the quarter, down a little versus Q3 last year. The allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased $3 million to $24.4 million. The decrease is the result of the purchase of minority interest in certain subsidiaries over the past year; operational changes on a few agencies; and the negative effect of FX because the large portion of our less than fully owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S. As a result, net income was $253.8 million. That's an increase of $14.5 million or 6.1% versus Q3 of last year. 
Turning to Slide 3. The remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after allocation of $1.2 million of net income to participating securities was $252.6 million, up $15.8 million or 6.7% when compared to last year's Q3. You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was 238.7 million, which is down 2.3% versus last year as a result of repurchases of shares over the past year. As a result, diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.06, up $0.09 or 9.3% versus Q3 2015. 
On Slides 4 through 6, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the year-to-date period. Since the year-to-date results are essentially in line with the results for the quarter, I will just give you a few highlights.
While organic revenue growth was 3.4% during the first 9 months of the year, the FX headwind reduced revenue by 1.9%. Factoring in the increase from acquisitions net of dispositions of 0.3%, our revenue increased on a year-to-date basis by 1.8% to just under $11.2 billion. EBITA increased 4.7% to just under $1.5 billion. And consistent with our third quarter performance, both our EBITA and operating margins increased 40 basis points on a year-to-date basis compared to last year. And on Slide 6, you can see our 6-month diluted EPS was $3.31 per share, which is up $0.25 or 8.2% versus 2015. 
Turning to Slide 7. We shift the discussion to our revenue performance. Regarding FX, while the volatility in the foreign currency markets has declined over the past year, the continuing slide of the British pound after the Brexit vote in late June remains a notable exception. In isolation, the FX impact of the pound's decline reduced our revenue by about $60 million in the third quarter. As for other notable currency moves on a reported basis, compared to Q3 of 2015, the dollar strengthened in the quarter against the Chinese yuan and the Mexican peso. And conversely, the dollar weakened against the Japanese yen, the Aussie dollar and the Brazilian real. As a result, the net impact of FX decreased our quarterly revenue by $50 million or about 1.3%. Looking ahead, if rates stay where they currently are, the negative impact of FX is expected to reduce revenue by about 1% during the fourth quarter of 2016, which would bring the full year estimated reduction to around 1.75%.
Revenue from acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue $15.3 million in the quarter or 0.4%. We expect the net impact of acquisitions net of dispositions will remain roughly the same in Q4. And finally, organic growth was positive $119 million or 3.2% this quarter. For the quarter, we had positive organic growth across all of our major markets with the exception of Germany and Singapore as well as France and Netherlands. 
The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included the continued strong performance across our media businesses as well as certain of our advertising agencies in the face of difficult comparisons to the growth in the same quarter in 2015 as well as our full-service health care businesses, which had a strong quarter with particular strength internationally. And our public relations businesses performed well across most markets with particular strength in the U.S. 
On Slide 8, highlighting our regional mix of business, you can see during the quarter, the split was 59% for North America, 9% for the U.K, 16% for the rest of Europe, 11% for Asia Pacific, 3% for Latin America and a little less than 2% for Africa and the Middle East.
Turning to the details of our performance by region on Slide 9. In the face of a difficult comparison to Q3 of last year, when organic revenue growth exceeded 6%, organic revenue growth in North America was 1.7%. In the quarter, we saw strong performances from our media and PR businesses. 
In Europe, the U.K. had organic growth of 5.2% with good performances across the portfolio, especially in our media, specialty health care and PR businesses. The rest of Europe was up 2%. Our agencies in Italy and Spain performed well while Germany was negative organically for the first time in several years and the Netherlands and France continued to struggle. Growth in Europe outside the eurozone was strong and especially notable in the Czech Republic, Russia and Sweden. 
The Asia Pacific region was up 8%. Once again, most major markets in the region performed well in the quarter, including Japan and Australia as well as Greater China, which continues to grow, albeit at a slower rate than in prior years. We also saw solid organic growth from the emerging market countries in the region, including India, Indonesia and the Philippines. 
In Latin America, the region had an excellent quarter with organic revenue growth of 11.9% with Mexico leading the way. Brazil was positive in the quarter, helped some by Olympic activity. While the revenue performance in Brazil has improved each quarter this year, the questions regarding the political and economic climate remain too unsettled to confidently predict when we will see the market return to consistent growth going forward. And Africa and the Middle East, our smallest region, was up double digits organically for the quarter, driven by the strength of our agencies in South Africa and the UAE. 
Slide 10 shows our mix of business by discipline. For the quarter, the split was 52% for advertising services and 48% for marketing services. As for their performance, our advertising discipline was up 3.6% compared to Q3 of 2015, which was a challenging comparison given the strong performance last year. The growth was led by the performance of our media businesses, which performed well across almost all of their offerings and in all markets as well as good performance at certain of our advertising agencies.
While CRM returned to positive organic growth, up 1.6% for the quarter, the results remain mixed across businesses and geographies. While our shopper marketing in direct and interactive businesses had a nice quarter, our field marketing and point-of-sale businesses and our event businesses continued to struggle as did our branding businesses. PR was up 4.4% this quarter, although this is compared to a relatively easy comp in the prior year. And specialty communications was up 6.2% organically. The solid performance was driven by Omnicom health care group with notable performances by its agencies outside the U.S. 
Although we remain on track to meet the internal target we set for organic growth for the full year of 3% to 3.5%, as John said earlier, as we go through our planning process for Q4, there are several factors that result in less visibility that could have an impact on our current expectations for revenue growth for the fourth quarter.
On Slide 11, we present our mix of business by industry sector. In comparing the year-to-date revenue for 2016 to 2015, you can see there were some minor shifts in the distribution of our client revenue between industries with health care and travel and entertainment up slightly as a percentage of revenue and retail and tech down but nothing particularly significant. 
Turning to our cash flow performance. On Slide 12, you can see that we generated just over $1.1 billion of free cash flow during the first 9 months of the year, excluding changes in working capital. 
As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 13, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $374 million. The 10% increase in our quarterly dividend was effective with the payment we made during Q3 of 2016. So only 1 of the 3 payments so far this year was at the higher amount. And the cash flow impact of that higher payment was partially offset by a lower share continue due to repurchase activity. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $71 million. This is down versus last year due to the purchase of additional shares from our local partners. 
Capital expenditures were $101 million, a reduction compared to 2015 resulting from the lower spending of leasehold improvements and an increase in our equipment leasing program. Acquisitions, including earn-out payments, totaled $438 million and stock repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans, totaled $423 million. All-in, we outspent our free cash flow by just over $300 million in the first 9 months of the year.
Turning to Slide 14. Regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter, our total debt at September 30, 2016, of just over $5 billion is up about $435 million from this time last year. This increase reflects the incremental $400 million in our borrowings related to the debt issuance back in April, along with an increase in the noncash fair value of our debt to about $20 million directly related to and outset by the positive fair value of the respective interest rate swaps on our debt and as required to be reported in the balance sheet under U.S. GAAP.
Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $3.06 billion, down $105 million compared to September 30, 2015. The positive change in operating capital of approximately $440 million was partially offset by the overspend of our free cash flow by about $295 million for the 12 months ended September 30, 2016, as well as the noncash U.S. GAAP adjustments to the carrying value of our debt. Net debt increased by $1.1 billion compared to year-end as a result of the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of approximately $300 million and uses of working capital that typically occur through the first 9 months of the year, which approximated $785 million. As for our debt ratios, they remain strong. Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.2x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3x. And due to the year-over-year increase in our interest expense, our interest coverage ratio decreased to 11.1x but remains quite solid. 
Turning to Slide 15. We continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well-focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital ratio improved to 19.4% while our return on equity increased to 47.1%. 
And finally, on Slide 16, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders over the past 10-plus years. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2006 through the third quarter of 2016, which totaled $10.4 billion. And the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $11.4 billion, resulting in a cumulative payout ratio of 110% over the period. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we've included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you."

And for each of those 20 years in the third quarter, I think I've said in the last several years, it was $200 million to $250 million, talked about the project business that's very difficult for us to forecast today. And we just have to experience it as we go through the rest of the quarter. I think there's only 1 year that it didn't come in out of those 20 years, and that was probably 2008. So I'm cautious, but we're looking at everything and we don't see any fundamental changes to the trends that we will experience and have been experiencing. Our new business wins, some of them don't kick in or start to contribute to incremental revenue until 2017. So we're glad to have them, but we're in the process of trying to staff up for them now. And there's no large contribution that's going to solve that problem for us immediately in the fourth quarter. But looking past that, those trends are good. It's business as usual. I think the thing that's made this fourth quarter a little crazy is the general election. And uncertainty with what the outcome is going to be and clients who have the ability in a little growth environment to holdback on projects have been waiting to put this behind us. And hopefully, it will be soon. So that's really the state of the state, Alexia. And the U.S. is the largest part of our portfolio. We're well represented in the U.S., but all this noise isn't contributing to anything. In the past, we probably participated in years of presidential elections to a greater extent than we are participating this year because whereas the Democrats are spending money, the Republicans are not. They're not in the same level."

Most of your competitors say they wouldn't do it, it would be possible. What the competitors, they would say that. I am sure, you think would be profitable. So without getting to confidential information, can you give us some color on how that contract is structured? And, whether it can be more or less profitable under normal contract?"

We are very pleased with these wins but they will only be a component part of how the whole company performs, and we have to go through a very bottoms up profit planning process between now and the end of the year that is traditional in the company. But you always rather win a client a new piece of business because that makes that process easier as you move forward. With respect to McDonald's, the McDonald's contract, which I won't go into detail, will be profitable and whatever the competitors said they have said. Our goals and objectives in that contract, which get us paid, are perfectly aligned with what how we can impact the business, and with their management's goals and objectives. So we have a high degree of confidence of what we will be able to achieve."

And PHD is a network with the global Volkswagen win certainly has more than many of the markets, where they were smaller player in the past. So as far as our media networks go, we feel really good that we've got 3 very strong platforms to grow of. And I think the other comment John had touched on this earlier, the investments we made in our data and analytics business, you really see them come to bear some fruit, especially when you look at some of these more recent wins. So we think the benefits to the foundation for growth in the future are as important, if not more important, than the actual revenues that the first few client wins here that we had will give us in '17."

Hearts & Science, in addition to the U.S. and Canada, they launch in the U.K. They're are currently pitching for business in Germany and with the AT&T win, Hearts & Science was opened in Mexico. So there you have a network that really is 1 year old, that's 1 in 2 [ph] largest -- the first and second largest advertisers in the U.S. as a base and we're starting to expand and win business in other markets. And what Phil said about PHD is important. We've had PHD for a very long time. And it was pretty much amble based in the Northern Europe and in the U.S. With the Volkswagen win, that allows us to compete in many more markets [indiscernible] that was 1 [ph] that the company actually needed and so we're expecting more opportunities to win business through both of those vehicles as we move forward. The other thing, which is an intangible but a terribly important one is the way that we won business is through the accounts that we won. Their level of collaboration and coordination was second to none, and I can't say that enough. We worked very hard at that culturally within Omnicom and always have. But this was, I'd have to say, the first time that sort of paid out in big tangible real wins. So I'm very bullish with regard to all these positive signs and what we might expect as we move forward as a result of the strength that we built."

And then secondly, if you could spend a little bit of time on where you're doing programmatic add buying outside of Accuen? I think, sometimes it's lost on the outside community vendors, investors alike that this is a discipline that is increasingly embedded right at various agencies at Hearts & Science, PHD and OMD.

It's all based upon ROI at the end of the day and effective targeting of audiences for programmatic. What we've done these we can offer clients a bundled product, which has certain guarantees and they know the price that they're going to pay and what they're expecting to get out of it, and we also through the 3 media groups that you talked about, are quite able to offer them on level products, where they do have a level of transparency. It depends upon what the client's objectives are and how well -- what their preference really is. But we're capable and willing and able to offer both solutions or either solution to the brands that we serve. And the clients, they all have different objectives. So 1 model might meet certain clients objectives and more disclosed model other clients. So I think it's -- there's a lot more choices associated than the headlines would lead you to believe. And the biggest question I think, is 1 that was alluded to earlier, which is really ultimately what measurement is going to be used and is the client getting the value that they've signed up for. And what is true and is always been true is if you're providing the service, you can't grade your own homework."

We also saw a decline in our use of freelance labor. And frankly, some better performance at some of our underperforming agencies in the quarter year-on-year. So yes, I think, when you look at though the year-to-date, is relatively year-to-date margin, most of the benefit is coming from our leverage and scale efficiency initiatives, which we expect will continue to push and we expect will be able to sustain. As we look at the fourth quarter, we're still somewhat conservative, given a little bit less visibility than we traditionally have in our other quarters. So similar to prior year's, we're not ready yet to change our expectations of 30 basis points of improvements in Q4. But certainly, we're going to continued to push the initiatives we have been working on.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I am pleased to speak to you this morning about our third quarter 2016 business results.

I am pleased to speak to you this morning about our third quarter 2016 business results. 
Organic revenue growth for the third quarter was 3.2%, which is in line with our internal targets. For the 9 months ended September 30, organic growth is 3.4%. Our EBITDA margins exceeded our expectations and increased 40 basis points for the third quarter and are up 40 basis points for the 9 months ended September 30. Based on our year-to-date results, we are on track to meet our internal revenue and margin targets for the year. 
As we have discussed, foreign exchange continued to have a negative impact on our earnings during the quarter, although the effect of currency has significantly declined compared to what we experienced in 2015. At this point, the biggest movement is the decline of the British pound versus the U.S. dollar. Phil will provide more details on our margin improvement and currency outlook during his remarks.
Turning to our organic growth. It was broad-based across our major regions and disciplines. This growth highlights the consistency and diversity of our operations even in the face of tepid economic conditions and the uncertainty created by events in our 2 largest markets, the presidential election in the United States and Brexit in the U.K. Our performance underscores the strong competitive position of our agencies across the spectrum of advertising and marketing disciplines and key geographic markets as well as our digital and analytical expertise.
Looking at organic growth by region. North America was up 1.7%. This was in the face of difficult comps when compared to the third quarter 2015. North American growth was driven by strong performance in media and public relations. Our U.K. organic growth was 5.2%, reflecting very solid performance from our portfolio of agencies in the market. The situation in the U.K. is clearly something we're monitoring closely. At this point, we're not able to fully assess the effect Brexit could have on our operations in either the U.K. or the rest of Europe.
In Europe, we experienced growth of 2%. The eurozone markets were essentially flat for the quarter as very strong growth in Italy and Spain was offset by a difficult quarter in Germany and declines in France and the Netherlands. Outside the Euro Markets, growth was in the low-teens with the Czech Republic, Russia and Sweden outperforming during the quarter.
Turning to Asia. Third quarter organic growth was 8%. Australia, India, Japan and New Zealand all had strong results and growth in Greater China moderated to just over 4%. Latin America was up 11.9%, driven by very strong performance in Mexico. Brazil was also positive for the quarter, helped in part by Olympic activity. 
Our EBITA for the quarter increased $27.4 million or 6% to $482.1 million. Our EBITA margin increased to  12.7% versus 12.3% in the third quarter of 2015.
Looking at our bottom line. Net income available for common shares for the third quarter of 2016 increased $15.8 million or 6.7% to $252.6 million and our average share count was down 2.3% from the prior year. The combined result was an increase in EPS of 9.3% to $1.06 per share for the quarter versus $0.97 per share for the same quarter a year ago.
For the 9 months ended September 30, our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong. We generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow and returned approximately $800 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Looking at the rest of the year. There are a couple of factors that result in less visibility as we plan for Q4. As has consistently been the case over a number of years, there's quite a bit of project work in the fourth quarter that can impact revenue. Each year, we have found this year-end project work is between $200 million and $250 million. Client spending on these projects is not easily forecast and typically is based on individual client circumstance and general economic conditions.
This year is further complicated by the upcoming U.S. presidential election, the increasing likelihood that the Fed will raise rates before year-end and the potential effects of Brexit. Partially offsetting these unknowns is our recent new business success. Some of these wins, like AT&T, will start generating incremental revenue in the fourth quarter and others, like Volkswagen media and McDonald's, will not contribute to incremental revenue until January 2017.
Let me now discuss what we're seeing in the industry and how our strategies allow us to achieve consistent financial results. During the third quarter, we stayed focused on executing our strategies for growth; attracting, retaining and developing top talent; extending our capabilities around the world and moving into new service areas; building our digital and analytical competencies by investing in platforms and agencies; and partnering with innovative technology companies and collaborating to deliver big ideas and results based upon meaningful consumer insights across all channels.
The significant wins I just mentioned prove Omnicom has the brightest talent using the latest digital and analytical tools in the marketplace. In August, we were awarded the consolidated data, analytics, media, digital and creative business for AT&T across the United States and Mexico. AT&T is the largest advertised brand in the United States and the second-largest advertiser. 
BBDO had a significant share of creative for many years and now has responsibility for the subscription TV business, including DIRECTTV and the Internet service businesses. Hearts & Science will be their new media agency. It will be a fully integrated offering with people from BBDO, Hearts & Science and other Omnicom agencies sitting and working together in offices in New York, Dallas and Atlanta.
Late in the quarter, McDonald's chose Omnicom to consolidate its U.S. creative account under the leadership of Wendy Clark, DDB North America CEO. We've been a partner of McDonald's for over 40 years and look forward to taking our partnership to a new level. We are forming a dedicated agency for McDonald's based in Chicago with data and digital as its core. It will house talent from several Omnicom agencies that will work jointly to deliver seamless execution across all platforms and disciplines, including creative, media and sales promotion. 
The client feedback from these wins highlights 2 major themes: First, we have outstanding talent that can truly work together; and second, we have the ability to leverage superior data and analytics that drive shopper insights, more relevant and resident creative work and more efficient and effective media delivery. 
Effective collaboration among our agencies and with our clients and outside partners is part of the culture we have worked to organically build at Omnicom. It's gratifying to see that it is being recognized by clients. We believe the ability of our people to effectively and actively coordinate will be increasingly important as marketers use data-driven insights to inform creative and media planning. Over the past few months, I've had the pleasure to work with our people on some of the biggest new business pitches we have ever seen. Many gave up their holidays and vacations, even honeymoons. I want to thank and congratulate all of our agencies and our people for their dedication, commitment and ongoing success on this front.
Underpinning all of this is Annalect, our cornerstone data and marketing and sciences group. We built it from within and continue to invest in it. We developed this capability in-house as opposed to trying to gain this competency through bolt-on acquisitions. As a result of this internal investment, the level of collaboration and integration of Annalect with our agencies across the group is second to none. Annalect's data scientists are embedded across our group in almost all disciplines, from media to creative and most recently, to CRM and PR. It has evolved to play a major role in servicing our existing clients and winning new business and is truly a differentiating asset for us.
Our belief in investment in talent, data and analytics, creativity and collaboration as core strategies are paying off. Our ability to innovate was formally recognized last quarter when Forbes magazine named Omnicom 1 of the 100 most innovative companies in the world. It is a significant recognition for us. And what's more, it's a first for any advertising and marketing company.
On the topic of winning, let me just mention a few highlights from the Spikes Advertising Festival recently held in Singapore, which is considered the Cannes of Asia. BBDO Asia Pacific received top honor, winning Network of the Year for the third year in a row. Colenso BBDO won Agency of the Year while sister shop, Clemenger BBDO, came in second. TBWA\HAKUHODO was the digital Grand Prix winner and won 12 Spikes. All told, 31 agencies in 10 countries contributed to more than 130 Spike awards. I want to congratulate everyone who helped win these awards. Your talent is a great reflection on Omnicom and your hard work is appreciated. 
Omnicom's ability to win awards relies on talent. And for us, that means a diverse workforce. We recognize that a diverse group of people will create a stronger culture, perform at a higher level and will be better at developing meaningful insights and creative content. That's why we continue to push hard on our diversity initiatives. 
Last quarter, Omniwomen, which is well-established in the United States and Europe, formally launched in Asia with an event in Shanghai to inspire and celebrate women in our agencies in Greater China. Omniwomen serves as a catalyst for increasing the influence and number of our women leaders. And I'm especially proud of this effort and the benefit it provides to our people, our clients and the company. We also launched OPEN Pride, a resource group committed to inclusion and diversity efforts across Omnicom. OPEN Pride promotes awareness, acceptance and advocacy by fostering an inclusive and engaging work environment for Omnicom's LGBT community.
In closing, we achieved our goals for revenue growth, margins and profitability in the third quarter and remain cautiously optimistic for the fourth quarter. I will turn the phone call over to Phil for a closer look at the third quarter results. Phil?"

For the third quarter, organic growth was 3.2%. And for the year-to-date period, it was 3.4%. FX continues to represent a headwind to our revenue, driven in large part by the weakening of the British pound year-over-year. For the third quarter, the FX impact reduced revenue 1.3% or about $50 million. Including the positive impact of 0.4% from our net acquisition activity, total revenue for the quarter was just under $3.8 billion, an increase of 2.3% versus Q3 of last year. I'll review our revenue growth in detail in a few minutes.
Moving down the income statement to the items below revenue. Our Q3 EBITA increased 6.0% to $482 million and the resulting EBITA margin of 12.7% represents a 40 basis points increase over Q3 of last year. The increase, which exceeded by a bit our targeted 30 basis point improvement for the full year of 2016 is mainly the result of our ongoing initiatives to leverage scale and enhance efficiency on a company-wide basis as well as a change in business mix for the quarter. Operating income or EBIT for the quarter increased 5.8% to $453 million with operating margin improving 12.0%, in line with the EBITA margin improvement. 
Now turning to the items below operating income. Net interest expense for the quarter was $42 million, down $2.8 million versus the second quarter of 2016 and up $6.1 million versus Q3 of 2015. Gross interest expense was down slightly compared to Q2 2016. As you know, when our $1 billion in 2016 senior notes reached maturity back in April, we issued $1.4 billion of 10-year senior notes due in 2026. We also entered into a fixed to floating interest rate swap on $500 million of the 2026 notes. Although we incrementally added $400 million in debt, the net effect of the reduction in rates on the new notes, combined with the rate swaps, reduced our gross interest expense. 
Third quarter had the benefit of this reduction for the full quarter compared to only a partial benefit in Q2, resulting in a reduction compared to Q2 of approximately $1.5 million in interest expense. As compared to Q3 of last year, the increase in gross interest expense of $7.3 million primarily resulted from the termination of the fixed to floating rate swaps on our 2022 notes. Interest income earned in Q3 of 2016 was a bit higher when compared to both Q2 of 2016 and Q3 of 2015, resulting from higher interest earned on the cash held by our international treasury centers.
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 32.7%, which is in line with our current expectations for our annual rate. Earnings from our affiliates totaled $1.4 million for the quarter, down a little versus Q3 last year. The allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased $3 million to $24.4 million. The decrease is the result of the purchase of minority interest in certain subsidiaries over the past year; operational changes on a few agencies; and the negative effect of FX because the large portion of our less than fully owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S. As a result, net income was $253.8 million. That's an increase of $14.5 million or 6.1% versus Q3 of last year. 
Turning to Slide 3. The remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after allocation of $1.2 million of net income to participating securities was $252.6 million, up $15.8 million or 6.7% when compared to last year's Q3. You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was 238.7 million, which is down 2.3% versus last year as a result of repurchases of shares over the past year. As a result, diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.06, up $0.09 or 9.3% versus Q3 2015. 
On Slides 4 through 6, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the year-to-date period. Since the year-to-date results are essentially in line with the results for the quarter, I will just give you a few highlights.
While organic revenue growth was 3.4% during the first 9 months of the year, the FX headwind reduced revenue by 1.9%. Factoring in the increase from acquisitions net of dispositions of 0.3%, our revenue increased on a year-to-date basis by 1.8% to just under $11.2 billion. EBITA increased 4.7% to just under $1.5 billion. And consistent with our third quarter performance, both our EBITA and operating margins increased 40 basis points on a year-to-date basis compared to last year. And on Slide 6, you can see our 6-month diluted EPS was $3.31 per share, which is up $0.25 or 8.2% versus 2015. 
Turning to Slide 7. We shift the discussion to our revenue performance. Regarding FX, while the volatility in the foreign currency markets has declined over the past year, the continuing slide of the British pound after the Brexit vote in late June remains a notable exception. In isolation, the FX impact of the pound's decline reduced our revenue by about $60 million in the third quarter. As for other notable currency moves on a reported basis, compared to Q3 of 2015, the dollar strengthened in the quarter against the Chinese yuan and the Mexican peso. And conversely, the dollar weakened against the Japanese yen, the Aussie dollar and the Brazilian real. As a result, the net impact of FX decreased our quarterly revenue by $50 million or about 1.3%. Looking ahead, if rates stay where they currently are, the negative impact of FX is expected to reduce revenue by about 1% during the fourth quarter of 2016, which would bring the full year estimated reduction to around 1.75%.
Revenue from acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue $15.3 million in the quarter or 0.4%. We expect the net impact of acquisitions net of dispositions will remain roughly the same in Q4. And finally, organic growth was positive $119 million or 3.2% this quarter. For the quarter, we had positive organic growth across all of our major markets with the exception of Germany and Singapore as well as France and Netherlands. 
The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included the continued strong performance across our media businesses as well as certain of our advertising agencies in the face of difficult comparisons to the growth in the same quarter in 2015 as well as our full-service health care businesses, which had a strong quarter with particular strength internationally. And our public relations businesses performed well across most markets with particular strength in the U.S. 
On Slide 8, highlighting our regional mix of business, you can see during the quarter, the split was 59% for North America, 9% for the U.K, 16% for the rest of Europe, 11% for Asia Pacific, 3% for Latin America and a little less than 2% for Africa and the Middle East.
Turning to the details of our performance by region on Slide 9. In the face of a difficult comparison to Q3 of last year, when organic revenue growth exceeded 6%, organic revenue growth in North America was 1.7%. In the quarter, we saw strong performances from our media and PR businesses. 
In Europe, the U.K. had organic growth of 5.2% with good performances across the portfolio, especially in our media, specialty health care and PR businesses. The rest of Europe was up 2%. Our agencies in Italy and Spain performed well while Germany was negative organically for the first time in several years and the Netherlands and France continued to struggle. Growth in Europe outside the eurozone was strong and especially notable in the Czech Republic, Russia and Sweden. 
The Asia Pacific region was up 8%. Once again, most major markets in the region performed well in the quarter, including Japan and Australia as well as Greater China, which continues to grow, albeit at a slower rate than in prior years. We also saw solid organic growth from the emerging market countries in the region, including India, Indonesia and the Philippines. 
In Latin America, the region had an excellent quarter with organic revenue growth of 11.9% with Mexico leading the way. Brazil was positive in the quarter, helped some by Olympic activity. While the revenue performance in Brazil has improved each quarter this year, the questions regarding the political and economic climate remain too unsettled to confidently predict when we will see the market return to consistent growth going forward. And Africa and the Middle East, our smallest region, was up double digits organically for the quarter, driven by the strength of our agencies in South Africa and the UAE. 
Slide 10 shows our mix of business by discipline. For the quarter, the split was 52% for advertising services and 48% for marketing services. As for their performance, our advertising discipline was up 3.6% compared to Q3 of 2015, which was a challenging comparison given the strong performance last year. The growth was led by the performance of our media businesses, which performed well across almost all of their offerings and in all markets as well as good performance at certain of our advertising agencies.
While CRM returned to positive organic growth, up 1.6% for the quarter, the results remain mixed across businesses and geographies. While our shopper marketing in direct and interactive businesses had a nice quarter, our field marketing and point-of-sale businesses and our event businesses continued to struggle as did our branding businesses. PR was up 4.4% this quarter, although this is compared to a relatively easy comp in the prior year. And specialty communications was up 6.2% organically. The solid performance was driven by Omnicom health care group with notable performances by its agencies outside the U.S. 
Although we remain on track to meet the internal target we set for organic growth for the full year of 3% to 3.5%, as John said earlier, as we go through our planning process for Q4, there are several factors that result in less visibility that could have an impact on our current expectations for revenue growth for the fourth quarter.
On Slide 11, we present our mix of business by industry sector. In comparing the year-to-date revenue for 2016 to 2015, you can see there were some minor shifts in the distribution of our client revenue between industries with health care and travel and entertainment up slightly as a percentage of revenue and retail and tech down but nothing particularly significant. 
Turning to our cash flow performance. On Slide 12, you can see that we generated just over $1.1 billion of free cash flow during the first 9 months of the year, excluding changes in working capital. 
As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 13, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $374 million. The 10% increase in our quarterly dividend was effective with the payment we made during Q3 of 2016. So only 1 of the 3 payments so far this year was at the higher amount. And the cash flow impact of that higher payment was partially offset by a lower share continue due to repurchase activity. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $71 million. This is down versus last year due to the purchase of additional shares from our local partners. 
Capital expenditures were $101 million, a reduction compared to 2015 resulting from the lower spending of leasehold improvements and an increase in our equipment leasing program. Acquisitions, including earn-out payments, totaled $438 million and stock repurchases, net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans, totaled $423 million. All-in, we outspent our free cash flow by just over $300 million in the first 9 months of the year.
Turning to Slide 14. Regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter, our total debt at September 30, 2016, of just over $5 billion is up about $435 million from this time last year. This increase reflects the incremental $400 million in our borrowings related to the debt issuance back in April, along with an increase in the noncash fair value of our debt to about $20 million directly related to and outset by the positive fair value of the respective interest rate swaps on our debt and as required to be reported in the balance sheet under U.S. GAAP.
Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $3.06 billion, down $105 million compared to September 30, 2015. The positive change in operating capital of approximately $440 million was partially offset by the overspend of our free cash flow by about $295 million for the 12 months ended September 30, 2016, as well as the noncash U.S. GAAP adjustments to the carrying value of our debt. Net debt increased by $1.1 billion compared to year-end as a result of the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of approximately $300 million and uses of working capital that typically occur through the first 9 months of the year, which approximated $785 million. As for our debt ratios, they remain strong. Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.2x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3x. And due to the year-over-year increase in our interest expense, our interest coverage ratio decreased to 11.1x but remains quite solid. 
Turning to Slide 15. We continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well-focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital ratio improved to 19.4% while our return on equity increased to 47.1%. 
And finally, on Slide 16, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders over the past 10-plus years. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2006 through the third quarter of 2016, which totaled $10.4 billion. And the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $11.4 billion, resulting in a cumulative payout ratio of 110% over the period. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we've included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you."

And for each of those 20 years in the third quarter, I think I've said in the last several years, it was $200 million to $250 million, talked about the project business that's very difficult for us to forecast today. And we just have to experience it as we go through the rest of the quarter. I think there's only 1 year that it didn't come in out of those 20 years, and that was probably 2008. So I'm cautious, but we're looking at everything and we don't see any fundamental changes to the trends that we will experience and have been experiencing. Our new business wins, some of them don't kick in or start to contribute to incremental revenue until 2017. So we're glad to have them, but we're in the process of trying to staff up for them now. And there's no large contribution that's going to solve that problem for us immediately in the fourth quarter. But looking past that, those trends are good. It's business as usual. I think the thing that's made this fourth quarter a little crazy is the general election and uncertainty with what the outcome is going to be. And clients who have the ability in a low growth environment to hold back on projects have been waiting to put this behind us. And hopefully, it will be soon. So that's really the state of the state, Alexia. And the U.S. is the largest part of our portfolio. We're well represented in the U.S., but all of this noise isn't contributing anything. And in the past, we probably participated in the years of presidential elections to a greater extent than we're participating this year because whereas the Democrats are spending money, the Republicans are not, not to the same levels."

We don't think it's going to dramatically impact our revenue streams and didn't in the quarter. And in the area of measurement, I think certainly that had something to do with it. We think there's plenty of players involved that are working closely to come up with a better solution so that clients' comfort levels can get to the point where they're more confident that they're getting what they paid for. And I think we're going to see that continue to evolve and continue to get better and better and clients get more comfortable with where they're spending their money, that they're getting the value that they're paying for."

And PHD as a network with the global Volkswagen win certainly has more haves [ph] than many of the markets, where they were a smaller player in the past. So as far as our media networks go, we feel really good that we've got 3 very strong platforms to grow off. And I think the other comment, John had touched on this earlier, the investments we made in our data and analytics business, you've really seen them come to bear some fruit, especially when you look at some of these more recent wins. So we think the benefits to the foundation for growth in the future are as important, if not more important, than the actual revenues that the first few client wins here that we had will give us in '17."

Hearts & Science, in addition to the U.S. and Canada, they launched in the U.K. They're currently pitching for business in Germany. And with the AT&T win, Hearts & Science was opened in Mexico. So there you have a network that really is a year-old that's 1 and 2 largest -- the first- and second-largest advertisers in the U.S. as a base. And we're starting to expand and win business in other markets. And what Phil said about PHD is important. We've had PHD for a very long time. And it was pretty much Anglo-based in the Northern Europe and in the U.S. With the Volkswagen win, that allows us to compete in many more markets and fills out -- that was the one client that the company actually needed. And so we're expecting more opportunities to win business through both of those vehicles as we move forward. The other thing, which is an intangible but a terribly important one, is the way that we've won businesses in the accounts that we've won, the level of collaboration and coordination was second to none. And I can't say that enough. We work very hard at that culturally within Omnicom and always have. But this was, I'd have to say, the first time where it sort of paid out in big, tangible, real wins. So I'm very bullish with regard to all these positive signs and what we might expect as we move forward as a result of the strength that we've built."

And then secondly, if you could spend a little bit of time on where you're doing programmatic ad buying outside of Accuen? I think sometimes it's lost on the outside community vendors, investors alike that this is a discipline that is increasingly embedded right at OMG, various agencies, at Hearts & Science, PHD and OMD.

It's all based upon ROI at the end of the day and effective targeting of audiences through programmatic. What we've done is we can offer clients a bundled product, which has certain guarantees and they know the price that they're going to pay and what they're expecting to get out of it. And we also, through the 3 media groups that you talked about, are quite able to offer them unbundled products, where they do have a level of transparency. It depends upon what the clients' objectives are and how well -- what their preference really is. But we're capable and willing and able to offer both solutions or either solution to the brands that we serve. And the clients, they all have different objectives. So one model might meet certain clients' objectives and a more disclosed model, other clients. So I think it's -- there's a lot more choice associated than the headlines would lead you to believe. And the biggest question, I think, is one that was alluded to earlier, which is really ultimately what measurement is going to be used and is the client getting the value that they've signed up for.

So yes, in any 1 particular quarter, 10 basis points isn't all that large. The drivers for this quarter, we continued to see some benefits from the work we've been doing to leverage scale and efficiency throughout the organization. We also saw a decline in our use of freelance labor and frankly, some better performance at some of our underperforming agencies in the quarter year-on-year. So I think when you look at though the year-to-date, the relative year-to-date margin, most of the benefit is coming from our leverage and scale efficiency initiatives, which we expect we'll continue to push and we expect we're going to be able to sustain. As we look at the fourth quarter, we're still somewhat conservative, given a little bit less visibility than we traditionally have in our other quarters. So similar to prior year's, we're not ready yet to change our expectations of 30 basis points of improvement in Q4. But certainly, we're going to continue to push the initiatives we've been working on. And we always reevaluate the portfolio and we're going to continue to look at the portfolio strategically. And where there are some situations that might make sense to do some pruning, we may do that as we head into '17.

I am pleased to speak to you this morning about our third quarter 2016 business results. 
Organic revenue growth for the third quarter was 3.2%, which is in line with our internal targets. For the 9 months ended September 30, organic growth is 3.4%. Our EBITDA margins exceeded our expectations and increased 40 basis points for the third quarter and are up 40 basis points for the 9 months ended September 30. Based on our year-to-date results, we are on track to meet our internal revenue and margin targets for the year. 
As we have discussed, foreign exchange continued to have a negative impact on our earnings during the quarter, although the effect of currency has significantly declined compared to what we experienced in 2015. At this point, the biggest movement is the decline of the British pound versus the U.S. dollar. Phil will provide more details on our margin improvement and currency outlook during his remarks.
Turning to our organic growth. It was broad-based across our major regions and disciplines. This growth highlights the consistency and diversity of our operations even in the face of tepid economic conditions and the uncertainty created by events in our 2 largest markets, the presidential election in the United States and Brexit in the U.K. Our performance underscores the strong competitive position of our agencies across the spectrum of advertising and marketing disciplines and key geographic markets as well as our digital and analytical expertise.
Looking at organic growth by region. North America was up 1.7%. This was in the face of difficult comps when compared to the third quarter 2015. North American growth was driven by strong performance in media and public relations. Our U.K. organic growth was 5.2%, reflecting very solid performance from our portfolio of agencies in the market. The situation in the U.K. is clearly something we're monitoring closely. At this point, we're not able to fully assess the effect Brexit could have on our operations in either the U.K. or the rest of Europe.
In Europe, we experienced growth of 2%. The eurozone markets were essentially flat for the quarter as very strong growth in Italy and Spain was offset by a difficult quarter in Germany and declines in France and the Netherlands. Outside the Euro Markets, growth was in the low-teens, with the Czech Republic, Russia and Sweden outperforming during the quarter.
Turning to Asia. Third quarter organic growth was 8%. Australia, India, Japan and New Zealand all had strong results, and growth in Greater China moderated to just over 4%. Latin America was up 11.9%, driven by very strong performance in Mexico. Brazil was also positive for the quarter, helped in part by Olympic activity. 
Our EBITA for the quarter increased $27.4 million or 6% to $482.1 million. Our EBITA margin increased to 12.7% versus 12.3% in the third quarter of 2015.
Looking at our bottom line. Net income available for common shares for the third quarter of 2016 increased $15.8 million or 6.7% to $252.6 million, and our average share count was down 2.3% from the prior year. The combined result was an increase in EPS of 9.3% to $1.06 per share for the quarter versus $0.97 per share for the same quarter a year ago.
For the 9 months ended September 30, our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong. We generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow and returned approximately $800 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Looking at the rest of the year, there are a couple of factors that result in less visibility as we plan for Q4. As has consistently been the case over a number of years, there's quite a bit of project work in the fourth quarter that can impact revenue. Each year, we have found this year-end project work is between $200 million and $250 million. Client spending on these projects is not easily forecast and typically is based on individual client circumstance and general economic conditions.
This year is further complicated by the upcoming U.S. presidential election, the increasing likelihood that the Fed will raise rates before year-end and the potential effects of Brexit. Partially offsetting these unknowns is our recent new business success. Some of these wins, like AT&T, will start generating incremental revenue in the fourth quarter, and others, like Volkswagen media and McDonald's, will not contribute to incremental revenue until January 2017.
Let me now discuss what we're seeing in the industry and how our strategies allow us to achieve consistent financial results. During the third quarter, we stayed focused on executing our strategies for growth; attracting, retaining and developing top talent; extending our capabilities around the world and moving into new service areas; building our digital and analytical competencies by investing in platforms and agencies; and partnering with innovative technology companies and collaborating to deliver big ideas and results based upon meaningful consumer insights across all channels.
The significant wins I just mentioned prove Omnicom has the brightest talent using the latest digital and analytical tools in the marketplace. In August, we were awarded the consolidated data, analytics, media, digital and creative business for AT&T across the United States and Mexico. AT&T is the largest advertised brand in the United States and the second-largest advertiser. BBDO had a significant share of creative for many years and now has responsibility for the subscription TV business, including DIRECTTV, and the Internet service businesses. Hearts & Science will be their new media agency. It will be a fully integrated offering with people from BBDO, Hearts & Science and other Omnicom agencies sitting and working together in offices in New York, Dallas and Atlanta.
Late in the quarter, McDonald's chose Omnicom to consolidate its U.S. creative account under the leadership of Wendy Clark, DDB North America CEO. We've been a partner of McDonald's for over 40 years and look forward to taking our partnership to a new level. We are forming a dedicated agency for McDonald's based in Chicago with data and digital as its core. It will house talent from several Omnicom agencies that will work jointly to deliver seamless execution across all platforms and disciplines, including creative, media and sales promotion. 
The client feedback from these wins highlights 2 major themes: First, we have outstanding talent that can truly work together; and second, we have the ability to leverage superior data and analytics that drive shopper insights, more relevant and resonant creative work and more efficient and effective media delivery. 
Effective collaboration among our agencies and with our clients and outside partners is part of the culture we have worked to organically build at Omnicom. It's gratifying to see that it is being recognized by clients. We believe the ability of our people to effectively and actively coordinate will be increasingly important as marketers use data-driven insights to inform creative and media planning. Over the past few months, I've had the pleasure to work with our people on some of the biggest new business pitches we have ever seen. Many gave up their holidays and vacations, even honeymoons. I want to thank and congratulate all of our agencies and our people for their dedication, commitment and ongoing success on this front.
Underpinning all of this is Annalect, our cornerstone data and marketing and sciences group. We built it from within and continue to invest in it. We developed this capability in-house as opposed to trying to gain this competency through bolt-on acquisitions. As a result of this internal investment, the level of collaboration and integration of Annalect with our agencies across the group is second to none. Annalect's data scientists are embedded across our group in almost all disciplines, from media to creative and most recently, to CRM and PR. It has evolved to play a major role in servicing our existing clients and winning new business and is truly a differentiating asset for us.
Our belief in investment in talent, data and analytics, creativity and collaboration as core strategies are paying off. Our ability to innovate was formally recognized last quarter when Forbes magazine named Omnicom 1 of the 100 most innovative companies in the world. It is a significant recognition for us. And what's more, it's a first for any advertising and marketing company.
On the topic of winning, let me just mention a few highlights from the Spikes Advertising Festival recently held in Singapore, which is considered the Cannes of Asia. BBDO Asia Pacific received top honor, winning Network of the Year for the third year in a row. Colenso BBDO won Agency of the Year while sister shop Clemenger BBDO came in second. TBWA\HAKUHODO was the digital Grand Prix winner and won 12 Spikes. All told, 31 agencies in 10 countries contributed to more than 130 Spike awards. I want to congratulate everyone who helped win these awards. Your talent is a great reflection on Omnicom, and your hard work is appreciated. 
Omnicom's ability to win awards relies on talent. And for us, that means a diverse workforce. We recognize that a diverse group of people will create a stronger culture, perform at a higher level and will be better at developing meaningful insights and creative content. That's why we continue to push hard on our diversity initiatives. 
Last quarter, Omniwomen, which is well-established in the United States and Europe, formally launched in Asia with an event in Shanghai to inspire and celebrate women in our agencies in Greater China. Omniwomen serves as a catalyst for increasing the influence and number of our women leaders. And I'm especially proud of this effort and the benefit it provides to our people, our clients and the company. We also launched OPEN Pride, a resource group committed to inclusion and diversity efforts across Omnicom. OPEN Pride promotes awareness, acceptance and advocacy by fostering an inclusive and engaging work environment for Omnicom's LGBT community.
In closing, we achieved our goals for revenue growth, margins and profitability in the third quarter and remain cautiously optimistic for the fourth quarter. I will now turn the phone call over to Phil for a closer look at the third quarter results. Phil?"

For the third quarter, organic growth was 3.2%. And for the year-to-date period, it was 3.4%. FX continues to represent a headwind to our revenue, driven in large part by the weakening of the British pound year-over-year. For the third quarter, the FX impact reduced revenue 1.3% or about $50 million. Including the positive impact of 0.4% from our net acquisition activity, total revenue for the quarter was just under $3.8 billion, an increase of 2.3% versus Q3 of last year. I'll review our revenue growth in detail in a few minutes.
Moving down the income statement to the items below revenue. Our Q3 EBITA increased 6.0% to $482 million, and the resulting EBITA margin of 12.7% represents a 40 basis points increase over Q3 of last year. The increase, which exceeded by a bit our targeted 30 basis point improvement for the full year of 2016, is mainly the result of our ongoing initiatives to leverage scale and enhance efficiency on a company-wide basis as well as a change in business mix for the quarter. Operating income or EBIT for the quarter increased 5.8% to $453 million with operating margin improving 12.0%, in line with the EBITA margin improvement. 
Now turning to the items below operating income. Net interest expense for the quarter was $42 million, down $2.8 million versus the second quarter of 2016 and up $6.1 million versus Q3 of 2015. Gross interest expense was down slightly compared to Q2 2016. As you know, when our $1 billion in 2016 senior notes reached maturity back in April, we issued $1.4 billion of 10-year senior notes due in 2026. We also entered into a fixed to floating interest rate swap on $500 million of the 2026 notes. Although we incrementally added $400 million in debt, the net effect of the reduction in rates on the new notes, combined with the rate swaps, reduced our gross interest expense. 
Third quarter had the benefit of this reduction for the full quarter compared to only a partial benefit in Q2, resulting in a reduction compared to Q2 of approximately $1.5 million in interest expense. As compared to Q3 of last year, the increase in gross interest expense of $7.3 million primarily resulted from the termination of the fixed to floating rate swaps on our 2022 notes. Interest income earned in Q3 of 2016 was a bit higher when compared to both Q2 of 2016 and Q3 of 2015, resulting from higher interest earned on the cash held by our international treasury centers.
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 32.7%, which is in line with our current expectations for our annual rate. Earnings from our affiliates totaled $1.4 million for the quarter, down a little versus Q3 last year. The allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased $3 million to $24.4 million. The decrease is the result of the purchase of minority interest in certain subsidiaries over the past year, operational changes on a few agencies and the negative effect of FX because a large portion of our less than fully owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S. As a result, net income was $253.8 million. That's an increase of $14.5 million or 6.1% versus Q3 of last year. 
Turning to Slide 3. The remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after allocation of $1.2 million of net income to participating securities was $252.6 million, up $15.8 million or 6.7% when compared to last year's Q3. You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was 238.7 million, which is down 2.3% versus last year as a result of repurchases of shares over the past year. As a result, diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.06, up $0.09 or 9.3% versus Q3 2015. 
On Slides 4 through 6, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the year-to-date period. Since the year-to-date results are essentially in line with the results for the quarter, I will just give you a few highlights.
While organic revenue growth was 3.4% during the first 9 months of the year, the FX headwind reduced revenue by 1.9%. Factoring in the increase from acquisitions net of dispositions of 0.3%, our revenue increased on a year-to-date basis by 1.8% to just under $11.2 billion. EBITA increased 4.7% to just under $1.5 billion. And consistent with our third quarter performance, both our EBITA and operating margins increased 40 basis points on a year-to-date basis compared to last year. And on Slide 6, you can see our 6-month diluted EPS was $3.31 per share, which is up $0.25 or 8.2% versus 2015. 
Turning to Slide 7. We shift the discussion to our revenue performance. Regarding FX, while the volatility in the foreign currency markets has declined over the past year, the continuing slide of the British pound after the Brexit vote in late June remains a notable exception. In isolation, the FX impact of the pound's decline reduced our revenue by about $60 million in the third quarter. As for other notable currency moves, on a reported basis, compared to Q3 of 2015, the dollar strengthened in the quarter against the Chinese yuan and the Mexican peso. And conversely, the dollar weakened against the Japanese yen, the Aussie dollar and the Brazilian real. As a result, the net impact of FX decreased our quarterly revenue by $50 million or about 1.3%. Looking ahead, if rates stay where they currently are, the negative impact of FX is expected to reduce revenue by about 1% during the fourth quarter of 2016, which would bring the full year estimated reduction to around 1.75%.
Revenue from acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue $15.3 million in the quarter or 0.4%. We expect the net impact of acquisitions net of dispositions will remain roughly the same in Q4. And finally, organic growth was positive $119 million or 3.2% this quarter. For the quarter, we had positive organic growth across all of our major markets with the exception of Germany and Singapore as well as France and the Netherlands. 
The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included the continued strong performance across our media businesses as well as certain of our advertising agencies in the face of difficult comparisons to the growth in the same quarter in 2015 as well as our full-service health care businesses, which had a strong quarter with particular strength internationally. And our public relations businesses performed well across most markets with particular strength in the U.S. 
On Slide 8, highlighting our regional mix of business, you can see during the quarter, the split was 59% for North America, 9% for the U.K, 16% for the rest of Europe, 11% for Asia Pacific, 3% for Latin America and a little less than 2% for Africa and the Middle East.
Turning to the details of our performance by region on Slide 9. In the face of a difficult comparison to Q3 of last year, when organic revenue growth exceeded 6%, organic revenue growth in North America was 1.7%. In the quarter, we saw strong performances from our media and PR businesses. 
In Europe, the U.K. had organic growth of 5.2% with good performances across the portfolio, especially in our media, specialty health care and PR businesses. The rest of Europe was up 2%. Our agencies in Italy and Spain performed well while Germany was negative organically for the first time in several years and the Netherlands and France continued to struggle. Growth in Europe outside the eurozone was strong and especially notable in the Czech Republic, Russia and Sweden. 
The Asia Pacific region was up 8%. Once again, most major markets in the region performed well in the quarter, including Japan and Australia as well as Greater China, which continues to grow, albeit at a slower rate than in prior years. We also saw solid organic growth from the emerging market countries in the region, including India, Indonesia and the Philippines. 
In Latin America, the region had an excellent quarter with organic revenue growth of 11.9% with Mexico leading the way. Brazil was positive in the quarter, helped some by Olympic activity. While the revenue performance in Brazil has improved each quarter this year, the questions regarding the political and economic climate remain too unsettled to confidently predict when we will see the market return to consistent growth going forward. And Africa and the Middle East, our smallest region, was up double digits organically for the quarter, driven by the strength of our agencies in South Africa and the UAE. 
Slide 10 shows our mix of business by discipline. For the quarter, the split was 52% for advertising services and 48% for marketing services. As for their performance, our advertising discipline was up 3.6% compared to Q3 of 2015, which was a challenging comparison given the strong performance last year. The growth was led by the performance of our media businesses, which performed well across almost all of their offerings and in all markets as well as good performance at certain of our advertising agencies.
While CRM returned to positive organic growth, up 1.6% for the quarter, the results remain mixed across businesses and geographies. While our shopper marketing in direct and interactive businesses had a nice quarter, our field marketing and point-of-sale businesses and our event businesses continued to struggle as did our branding businesses. PR was up 4.4% this quarter, although this is compared to a relatively easy comp in the prior year. And specialty communications was up 6.2% organically. The solid performance was driven by Omnicom health care group with notable performances by its agencies outside the U.S. 
Although we remain on track to meet the internal target we set for organic growth for the full year of 3% to 3.5%, as John said earlier, as we go through our planning process for Q4, there are several factors that result in less visibility that could have an impact on our current expectations for revenue growth for the fourth quarter.
On Slide 11, we present our mix of business by industry sector. In comparing the year-to-date revenue for 2016 to 2015, you can see there were some minor shifts in the distribution of our client revenue between industries, with health care and travel and entertainment up slightly as a percentage of revenue and retail and tech down, but nothing particularly significant. 
Turning to our cash flow performance. On Slide 12, you can see that we generated just over $1.1 billion of free cash flow during the first 9 months of the year, excluding changes in working capital. 
As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 13, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $374 million. The 10% increase in our quarterly dividend was effective with the payment we made during Q3 of 2016. So only 1 of the 3 payments so far this year was at the higher amount. And the cash flow impact of that higher payment was partially offset by a lower share count due to repurchase activity. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $71 million. This is down versus last year due to the purchase of additional shares from our local partners. 
Capital expenditures were $101 million, a reduction compared to 2015 resulting from lower spending on leasehold improvements and an increase in our equipment leasing program. Acquisitions, including earn-out payments, totaled $438 million and stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled $423 million. All-in, we outspent our free cash flow by just over $300 million in the first 9 months of the year.
Turning to Slide 14. Regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter, our total debt at September 30, 2016, of just over $5 billion is up about $435 million from this time last year. This increase reflects the incremental $400 million in our borrowings related to the debt issuance back in April, along with an increase in the noncash fair value of our debt to about $20 million directly related to and offset by the positive fair value of the respective interest rate swaps on our debt and as required to be reported in the balance sheet under U.S. GAAP.
Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $3.06 billion, down $105 million compared to September 30, 2015. The positive change in operating capital of approximately $440 million was partially offset by the overspend of our free cash flow by about $295 million for the 12 months ended September 30, 2016, as well as the noncash U.S. GAAP adjustments to the carrying value of our debt. Net debt increased by $1.1 billion compared to year-end as a result of the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of approximately $300 million and uses of working capital that typically occur through the first 9 months of the year, which approximated $785 million. As for our debt ratios, they remain strong. Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.2x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3x. And due to the year-over-year increase in our interest expense, our interest coverage ratio decreased to 11.1x but it remains quite solid. 
Turning to Slide 15. We continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well-focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital ratio improved to 19.4% while our return on equity increased to 47.1%. 
And finally, on Slide 16, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders over the past 10-plus years. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2006 through the third quarter of 2016, which totaled $10.4 billion. And the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $11.4 billion, resulting in a cumulative payout ratio of 110% over the period. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we've included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you."

And for each of those 20 years in the third quarter, I think I've said in the last several years, it was $200 million to $250 million, talked about the project business that's very difficult for us to forecast today. And we just have to experience it as we go through the rest of the quarter. I think there's only 1 year that it didn't come in out of those 20 years, and that was probably 2008. So I'm cautious, but we're looking at everything and we don't see any fundamental changes to the trends that we will experience and have been experiencing. Our new business wins, some of them don't kick in or start to contribute to incremental revenue until 2017. So we're glad to have them, but we're in the process of trying to staff up for them now. And there's no large contribution that's going to solve that problem for us immediately in the fourth quarter. But looking past that, those trends are good. It's business as usual. I think the thing that's made this fourth quarter a little crazy is the general election and uncertainty with what the outcome is going to be. And clients who have the ability in a low growth environment to hold back on projects have been waiting to put this behind us. And hopefully, it will be soon. So that's really the state of the state, Alexia. And the U.S. is the largest part of our portfolio. We're well represented in the U.S., but all of this noise isn't contributing anything. And in the past, we probably participated in the years of presidential elections to a greater extent than we're participating this year because whereas the Democrats are spending money, the Republicans are not, not to the same levels."

Was it anything to do with TV or Internet spending that you could comment on? And just in general, is there any observation you can give us as to the TV versus online spending situation, which has been kind of fluctuating between the 2 for the last few quarters? And we've heard, obviously we've seen very poor ratings for TV and we've also had a lot of questions around measurement of Internet viewership. So I'm just wondering what your updated thoughts are there, please."

Well, in the area of field services, which has always been a revenue contributor, we've done a lot of consolidation in that. This tends to be a good business, gives us positive EBIT but at a lower margin. And as we look at some of those things, we haven't pushed as hard as we would have in the past. We saw a conservatism, I think, in terms of some of the events that would normally -- that have happened in the past. I think the Olympics was tepid at best. So it didn't make the same level of contribution that we would expect from almost any other Summer Olympics. And our branding businesses, we see a little bit of conservatism there in terms of projects getting pushed back or delayed in terms of what clients are spending their money on. So it's just a general conservatism. But I think it's been, as I said, and everybody knows this, a very unusual year with this presidential election. And people don't know how -- I think they can probably take a very good guess as to who's going to become President, but they don't know what's going to happen to the Congress. And so I think once that's cleared up, people will adjust and get back to doing whatever they can to grow their top line."

Certainly, we've seen a bit of a shift. Over the years, clients are spending more online versus in the traditional TV area. Did that rate of growth or rate of shift slow a bit? It slowed a bit, but clients certainly didn't pull back and stop spending online versus TV. I think we see that trend continuing. We don't think it's going to dramatically impact our revenue streams and didn't in the quarter. And in the area of measurement, I think certainly that had something to do with it. We think there's plenty of players involved that are working closely to come up with a better solution so that clients' comfort levels can get to the point where they're more confident that they're getting what they paid for. And I think we're going to see that continue to evolve and continue to get better and better and clients get more comfortable with where they're spending their money, that they're getting the value that they're paying for."

And PHD as a network with the global Volkswagen win certainly has more haves [ph] than many of the markets, where they were a smaller player in the past. So as far as our media networks go, we feel really good that we've got 3 very strong platforms to grow off. And I think the other comment, John had touched on this earlier, the investments we made in our data and analytics business, you've really seen them come to bear some fruit, especially when you look at some of these more recent wins. So we think the benefits to the foundation for growth in the future are as important, if not more important, than the actual revenues that the first few client wins here that we had will give us in '17."

Hearts & Science, in addition to the U.S. and Canada, they launched in the U.K. They're currently pitching for business in Germany. And with the AT&T win, Hearts & Science was opened in Mexico. So there you have a network that really is a year old that's won the 1 and 2 largest -- the first- and second-largest advertisers in the U.S. as a base. And we're starting to expand and win business in other markets. And what Phil said about PHD is important. We've had PHD for a very long time. And it was pretty much Anglo-based in the Northern Europe and in the U.S. With the Volkswagen win, that allows us to compete in many more markets and fills out -- that was the one win, that client, that the company actually needed. And so we're expecting more opportunities to win business through both of those vehicles as we move forward. The other thing, which is an intangible but a terribly important one, is the way that we've won businesses in the accounts that we've won, the level of collaboration and coordination was second to none. And I can't say that enough. We work very hard at that culturally within Omnicom and always have. But this was, I'd have to say, the first time where it sort of paid out in big, tangible, real wins.

I think sometimes it's lost on the outside community vendors, investors alike that this is a discipline that is increasingly embedded right at OMGs various agencies, at Hearts & Science, PHD and OMD.

It's all based upon ROI at the end of the day and effective targeting of audiences through programmatic. What we've done is we can offer clients a bundled product, which has certain guarantees and they know the price that they're going to pay and what they're expecting to get out of it. And we also, through the 3 media groups that you talked about, are quite able to offer them unbundled products, where they do have a level of transparency. It depends upon what the clients' objectives are and how well -- what their preference really is. But we're capable and willing and able to offer both solutions or either solution to the brands that we serve. And the clients, they all have different objectives. So one model might meet certain clients' objectives and a more disclosed model, other clients. So I think it's -- there's a lot more choice associated than the headlines would lead you to believe. And the biggest question, I think, is one that was alluded to earlier, which is really ultimately what measurement is going to be used and is the client getting the value that they've signed up for.

I am pleased to speak to you this morning about our third quarter 2016 business results. 
Organic revenue growth for the third quarter was 3.2%, which is in line with our internal targets. For the 9 months ended September 30, organic growth is 3.4%. Our EBITDA margins exceeded our expectations and increased 40 basis points for the third quarter and are up 40 basis points for the 9 months ended September 30. Based on our year-to-date results, we are on track to meet our internal revenue and margin targets for the year. 
As we have discussed, foreign exchange continued to have a negative impact on our earnings during the quarter, although the effect of currency has significantly declined compared to what we experienced in 2015. At this point, the biggest movement is the decline of the British pound versus the U.S. dollar. Phil will provide more details on our margin improvement and currency outlook during his remarks.
Turning to our organic growth. It was broad-based across our major regions and disciplines. This growth highlights the consistency and diversity of our operations even in the face of tepid economic conditions and the uncertainty created by events in our 2 largest markets, the presidential election in the United States and Brexit in the U.K. Our performance underscores the strong competitive position of our agencies across the spectrum of advertising and marketing disciplines and key geographic markets as well as our digital and analytical expertise.
Looking at organic growth by region. North America was up 1.7%. This was in the face of difficult comps when compared to the third quarter 2015. North American growth was driven by strong performance in media and public relations. Our U.K. organic growth was 5.2%, reflecting very solid performance from our portfolio of agencies in the market. The situation in the U.K. is clearly something we're monitoring closely. At this point, we're not able to fully assess the effect Brexit could have on our operations in either the U.K. or the rest of Europe.
In Europe, we experienced growth of 2%. The eurozone markets were essentially flat for the quarter as very strong growth in Italy and Spain was offset by a difficult quarter in Germany and declines in France and the Netherlands. Outside the Euro Markets, growth was in the low-teens, with the Czech Republic, Russia and Sweden outperforming during the quarter.
Turning to Asia. Third quarter organic growth was 8%. Australia, India, Japan and New Zealand all had strong results, and growth in Greater China moderated to just over 4%. Latin America was up 11.9%, driven by very strong performance in Mexico. Brazil was also positive for the quarter, helped in part by Olympic activity. 
Our EBITA for the quarter increased $27.4 million or 6% to $482.1 million. Our EBITA margin increased to 12.7% versus 12.3% in the third quarter of 2015.
Looking at our bottom line. Net income available for common shares for the third quarter of 2016 increased $15.8 million or 6.7% to $252.6 million, and our average share count was down 2.3% from the prior year. The combined result was an increase in EPS of 9.3% to $1.06 per share for the quarter versus $0.97 per share for the same quarter a year ago.
For the 9 months ended September 30, our cash flow, balance sheet and liquidity remain very strong. We generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow and returned approximately $800 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Looking at the rest of the year, there are a couple of factors that result in less visibility as we plan for Q4. As has consistently been the case over a number of years, there's quite a bit of project work in the fourth quarter that can impact revenue. Each year, we have found this year-end project work is between $200 million and $250 million. Client spending on these projects is not easily forecast and typically is based on individual client circumstance and general economic conditions.
This year is further complicated by the upcoming U.S. presidential election, the increasing likelihood that the Fed will raise rates before year-end and the potential effects of Brexit. Partially offsetting these unknowns is our recent new business success. Some of these wins, like AT&T, will start generating incremental revenue in the fourth quarter, and others, like Volkswagen media and McDonald's, will not contribute to incremental revenue until January 2017.
Let me now discuss what we're seeing in the industry and how our strategies allow us to achieve consistent financial results. During the third quarter, we stayed focused on executing our strategies for growth; attracting, retaining and developing top talent; extending our capabilities around the world and moving into new service areas; building our digital and analytical competencies by investing in platforms and agencies; and partnering with innovative technology companies and collaborating to deliver big ideas and results based upon meaningful consumer insights across all channels.
The significant wins I just mentioned prove Omnicom has the brightest talent using the latest digital and analytical tools in the marketplace. In August, we were awarded the consolidated data, analytics, media, digital and creative business for AT&T across the United States and Mexico. AT&T is the largest advertised brand in the United States and the second-largest advertiser. BBDO had a significant share of creative for many years and now has responsibility for the subscription TV business, including DIRECTTV, and the Internet service businesses. Hearts & Science will be their new media agency. It will be a fully integrated offering with people from BBDO, Hearts & Science and other Omnicom agencies sitting and working together in offices in New York, Dallas and Atlanta.
Late in the quarter, McDonald's chose Omnicom to consolidate its U.S. creative account under the leadership of Wendy Clark, DDB North America CEO. We've been a partner of McDonald's for over 40 years and look forward to taking our partnership to a new level. We are forming a dedicated agency for McDonald's based in Chicago with data and digital as its core. It will house talent from several Omnicom agencies that will work jointly to deliver seamless execution across all platforms and disciplines, including creative, media and sales promotion. 
The client feedback from these wins highlights 2 major themes: First, we have outstanding talent that can truly work together; and second, we have the ability to leverage superior data and analytics that drive shopper insights, more relevant and resonant creative work and more efficient and effective media delivery. 
Effective collaboration among our agencies and with our clients and outside partners is part of the culture we have worked to organically build at Omnicom. It's gratifying to see that it is being recognized by clients. We believe the ability of our people to effectively and actively coordinate will be increasingly important as marketers use data-driven insights to inform creative and media planning. Over the past few months, I've had the pleasure to work with our people on some of the biggest new business pitches we have ever seen. Many gave up their holidays and vacations, even honeymoons. I want to thank and congratulate all of our agencies and our people for their dedication, commitment and ongoing success on this front.
Underpinning all of this is Annalect, our cornerstone data and marketing and sciences group. We built it from within and continue to invest in it. We developed this capability in-house as opposed to trying to gain this competency through bolt-on acquisitions. As a result of this internal investment, the level of collaboration and integration of Annalect with our agencies across the group is second to none. Annalect's data scientists are embedded across our group in almost all disciplines, from media to creative and most recently, to CRM and PR. It has evolved to play a major role in servicing our existing clients and winning new business and is truly a differentiating asset for us.
Our belief in investment in talent, data and analytics, creativity and collaboration as core strategies are paying off. Our ability to innovate was formally recognized last quarter when Forbes magazine named Omnicom 1 of the 100 most innovative companies in the world. It is a significant recognition for us. And what's more, it's a first for any advertising and marketing company.
On the topic of winning, let me just mention a few highlights from the Spikes Advertising Festival recently held in Singapore, which is considered the Cannes of Asia. BBDO Asia Pacific received top honor, winning Network of the Year for the third year in a row. Colenso BBDO won Agency of the Year while sister shop Clemenger BBDO came in second. TBWA\HAKUHODO was the digital Grand Prix winner and won 12 Spikes. All told, 31 agencies in 10 countries contributed to more than 130 Spike awards. I want to congratulate everyone who helped win these awards. Your talent is a great reflection on Omnicom, and your hard work is appreciated. 
Omnicom's ability to win awards relies on talent. And for us, that means a diverse workforce. We recognize that a diverse group of people will create a stronger culture, perform at a higher level and will be better at developing meaningful insights and creative content. That's why we continue to push hard on our diversity initiatives. 
Last quarter, Omniwomen, which is well-established in the United States and Europe, formally launched in Asia with an event in Shanghai to inspire and celebrate women in our agencies in Greater China. Omniwomen serves as a catalyst for increasing the influence and number of our women leaders. And I'm especially proud of this effort and the benefit it provides to our people, our clients and the company. We also launched OPEN Pride, a resource group committed to inclusion and diversity efforts across Omnicom. OPEN Pride promotes awareness, acceptance and advocacy by fostering an inclusive and engaging work environment for Omnicom's LGBT community.
In closing, we achieved our goals for revenue growth, margins and profitability in the third quarter and remain cautiously optimistic for the fourth quarter. I will now turn the phone call over to Phil for a closer look at the third quarter results. Phil?"

For the third quarter, organic growth was 3.2%. And for the year-to-date period, it was 3.4%. FX continues to represent a headwind to our revenue, driven in large part by the weakening of the British pound year-over-year. For the third quarter, the FX impact reduced revenue 1.3% or about $50 million. Including the positive impact of 0.4% from our net acquisition activity, total revenue for the quarter was just under $3.8 billion, an increase of 2.3% versus Q3 of last year. I'll review our revenue growth in detail in a few minutes.
Moving down the income statement to the items below revenue. Our Q3 EBITA increased 6.0% to $482 million, and the resulting EBITA margin of 12.7% represents a 40 basis points increase over Q3 of last year. The increase, which exceeded by a bit our targeted 30 basis point improvement for the full year of 2016, is mainly the result of our ongoing initiatives to leverage scale and enhance efficiency on a company-wide basis as well as a change in business mix for the quarter. Operating income or EBIT for the quarter increased 5.8% to $453 million with operating margin improving 12.0%, in line with the EBITA margin improvement. 
Now turning to the items below operating income. Net interest expense for the quarter was $42 million, down $2.8 million versus the second quarter of 2016 and up $6.1 million versus Q3 of 2015. Gross interest expense was down slightly compared to Q2 2016. As you know, when our $1 billion in 2016 senior notes reached maturity back in April, we issued $1.4 billion of 10-year senior notes due in 2026. We also entered into a fixed to floating interest rate swap on $500 million of the 2026 notes. Although we incrementally added $400 million in debt, the net effect of the reduction in rates on the new notes, combined with the rate swaps, reduced our gross interest expense. 
Third quarter had the benefit of this reduction for the full quarter compared to only a partial benefit in Q2, resulting in a reduction compared to Q2 of approximately $1.5 million in interest expense. As compared to Q3 of last year, the increase in gross interest expense of $7.3 million primarily resulted from the termination of the fixed to floating rate swaps on our 2022 notes. Interest income earned in Q3 of 2016 was a bit higher when compared to both Q2 of 2016 and Q3 of 2015, resulting from higher interest earned on the cash held by our international treasury centers.
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 32.7%, which is in line with our current expectations for our annual rate. Earnings from our affiliates totaled $1.4 million for the quarter, down a little versus Q3 last year. The allocation of earnings to the minority shareholders in our less than fully owned subsidiaries decreased $3 million to $24.4 million. The decrease is the result of the purchase of minority interest in certain subsidiaries over the past year, operational changes on a few agencies and the negative effect of FX because a large portion of our less than fully owned subsidiaries are located outside the U.S. As a result, net income was $253.8 million. That's an increase of $14.5 million or 6.1% versus Q3 of last year. 
Turning to Slide 3. The remaining net income available for common shareholders for the quarter after allocation of $1.2 million of net income to participating securities was $252.6 million, up $15.8 million or 6.7% when compared to last year's Q3. You can also see that our diluted share count for the quarter was 238.7 million, which is down 2.3% versus last year as a result of repurchases of shares over the past year. As a result, diluted EPS for the quarter was $1.06, up $0.09 or 9.3% versus Q3 2015. 
On Slides 4 through 6, we provide the summary P&L, EPS and other information for the year-to-date period. Since the year-to-date results are essentially in line with the results for the quarter, I will just give you a few highlights.
While organic revenue growth was 3.4% during the first 9 months of the year, the FX headwind reduced revenue by 1.9%. Factoring in the increase from acquisitions net of dispositions of 0.3%, our revenue increased on a year-to-date basis by 1.8% to just under $11.2 billion. EBITA increased 4.7% to just under $1.5 billion. And consistent with our third quarter performance, both our EBITA and operating margins increased 40 basis points on a year-to-date basis compared to last year. And on Slide 6, you can see our 6-month diluted EPS was $3.31 per share, which is up $0.25 or 8.2% versus 2015. 
Turning to Slide 7. We shift the discussion to our revenue performance. Regarding FX, while the volatility in the foreign currency markets has declined over the past year, the continuing slide of the British pound after the Brexit vote in late June remains a notable exception. In isolation, the FX impact of the pound's decline reduced our revenue by about $60 million in the third quarter. As for other notable currency moves, on a reported basis, compared to Q3 of 2015, the dollar strengthened in the quarter against the Chinese yuan and the Mexican peso. And conversely, the dollar weakened against the Japanese yen, the Aussie dollar and the Brazilian real. As a result, the net impact of FX decreased our quarterly revenue by $50 million or about 1.3%. Looking ahead, if rates stay where they currently are, the negative impact of FX is expected to reduce revenue by about 1% during the fourth quarter of 2016, which would bring the full year estimated reduction to around 1.75%.
Revenue from acquisitions net of dispositions increased revenue $15.3 million in the quarter or 0.4%. We expect the net impact of acquisitions net of dispositions will remain roughly the same in Q4. And finally, organic growth was positive $119 million or 3.2% this quarter. For the quarter, we had positive organic growth across all of our major markets with the exception of Germany and Singapore as well as France and the Netherlands. 
The primary drivers of our growth this quarter included the continued strong performance across our media businesses as well as certain of our advertising agencies in the face of difficult comparisons to the growth in the same quarter in 2015 as well as our full-service health care businesses, which had a strong quarter with particular strength internationally. And our public relations businesses performed well across most markets with particular strength in the U.S. 
On Slide 8, highlighting our regional mix of business, you can see during the quarter, the split was 59% for North America, 9% for the U.K, 16% for the rest of Europe, 11% for Asia Pacific, 3% for Latin America and a little less than 2% for Africa and the Middle East.
Turning to the details of our performance by region on Slide 9. In the face of a difficult comparison to Q3 of last year, when organic revenue growth exceeded 6%, organic revenue growth in North America was 1.7%. In the quarter, we saw strong performances from our media and PR businesses. 
In Europe, the U.K. had organic growth of 5.2% with good performances across the portfolio, especially in our media, specialty health care and PR businesses. The rest of Europe was up 2%. Our agencies in Italy and Spain performed well while Germany was negative organically for the first time in several years and the Netherlands and France continued to struggle. Growth in Europe outside the eurozone was strong and especially notable in the Czech Republic, Russia and Sweden. 
The Asia Pacific region was up 8%. Once again, most major markets in the region performed well in the quarter, including Japan and Australia as well as Greater China, which continues to grow, albeit at a slower rate than in prior years. We also saw solid organic growth from the emerging market countries in the region, including India, Indonesia and the Philippines. 
In Latin America, the region had an excellent quarter with organic revenue growth of 11.9% with Mexico leading the way. Brazil was positive in the quarter, helped some by Olympic activity. While the revenue performance in Brazil has improved each quarter this year, the questions regarding the political and economic climate remain too unsettled to confidently predict when we will see the market return to consistent growth going forward. And Africa and the Middle East, our smallest region, was up double digits organically for the quarter, driven by the strength of our agencies in South Africa and the UAE. 
Slide 10 shows our mix of business by discipline. For the quarter, the split was 52% for advertising services and 48% for marketing services. As for their performance, our advertising discipline was up 3.6% compared to Q3 of 2015, which was a challenging comparison given the strong performance last year. The growth was led by the performance of our media businesses, which performed well across almost all of their offerings and in all markets as well as good performance at certain of our advertising agencies.
While CRM returned to positive organic growth, up 1.6% for the quarter, the results remain mixed across businesses and geographies. While our shopper marketing in direct and interactive businesses had a nice quarter, our field marketing and point-of-sale businesses and our event businesses continued to struggle as did our branding businesses. PR was up 4.4% this quarter, although this is compared to a relatively easy comp in the prior year. And specialty communications was up 6.2% organically. The solid performance was driven by Omnicom health care group with notable performances by its agencies outside the U.S. 
Although we remain on track to meet the internal target we set for organic growth for the full year of 3% to 3.5%, as John said earlier, as we go through our planning process for Q4, there are several factors that result in less visibility that could have an impact on our current expectations for revenue growth for the fourth quarter.
On Slide 11, we present our mix of business by industry sector. In comparing the year-to-date revenue for 2016 to 2015, you can see there were some minor shifts in the distribution of our client revenue between industries, with health care and travel and entertainment up slightly as a percentage of revenue and retail and tech down, but nothing particularly significant. 
Turning to our cash flow performance. On Slide 12, you can see that we generated just over $1.1 billion of free cash flow during the first 9 months of the year, excluding changes in working capital. 
As for our primary uses of cash on Slide 13, dividends paid to our common shareholders were $374 million. The 10% increase in our quarterly dividend was effective with the payment we made during Q3 of 2016. So only 1 of the 3 payments so far this year was at the higher amount. And the cash flow impact of that higher payment was partially offset by a lower share count due to repurchase activity. Dividends paid to our noncontrolling interest shareholders totaled $71 million. This is down versus last year due to the purchase of additional shares from our local partners. 
Capital expenditures were $101 million, a reduction compared to 2015 resulting from lower spending on leasehold improvements and an increase in our equipment leasing program. Acquisitions, including earn-out payments, totaled $438 million and stock repurchases net of the proceeds received from stock issuances under our employee share plans totaled $423 million. All-in, we outspent our free cash flow by just over $300 million in the first 9 months of the year.
Turning to Slide 14. Regarding our capital structure at the end of the quarter, our total debt at September 30, 2016, of just over $5 billion is up about $435 million from this time last year. This increase reflects the incremental $400 million in our borrowings related to the debt issuance back in April, along with an increase in the noncash fair value of our debt to about $20 million directly related to and offset by the positive fair value of the respective interest rate swaps on our debt and as required to be reported in the balance sheet under U.S. GAAP.
Our net debt position at the end of the quarter was $3.06 billion, down $105 million compared to September 30, 2015. The positive change in operating capital of approximately $440 million was partially offset by the overspend of our free cash flow by about $295 million for the 12 months ended September 30, 2016, as well as the noncash U.S. GAAP adjustments to the carrying value of our debt. Net debt increased by $1.1 billion compared to year-end as a result of the use of cash in excess of our free cash flow of approximately $300 million and uses of working capital that typically occur through the first 9 months of the year, which approximated $785 million. As for our debt ratios, they remain strong. Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.2x and our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.3x. And due to the year-over-year increase in our interest expense, our interest coverage ratio decreased to 11.1x but it remains quite solid. 
Turning to Slide 15. We continue to manage and build the company through a combination of well-focused internal development initiatives and prudently priced acquisitions. For the last 12 months, our return on invested capital ratio improved to 19.4% while our return on equity increased to 47.1%. 
And finally, on Slide 16, we track our cumulative return of cash to shareholders over the past 10-plus years. The line on the top of the chart shows our cumulative net income from 2006 through the third quarter of 2016, which totaled $10.4 billion. And the bars show the cumulative return of cash to shareholders, including both dividends and net share repurchases, the sum of which during the same period totaled $11.4 billion, resulting in a cumulative payout ratio of 110% over the period. 
And that concludes our prepared remarks. Please note that we've included a number of other supplemental slides in the presentation materials for your review. But at this point, we're going to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you."

And for each of those 20 years in the third quarter, I think I've said in the last several years, it was $200 million to $250 million, talked about the project business that's very difficult for us to forecast today. And we just have to experience it as we go through the rest of the quarter. I think there's only 1 year that it didn't come in out of those 20 years, and that was probably 2008. So I'm cautious, but we're looking at everything and we don't see any fundamental changes to the trends that we will experience and have been experiencing. Our new business wins, some of them don't kick in or start to contribute to incremental revenue until 2017. So we're glad to have them, but we're in the process of trying to staff up for them now. And there's no large contribution that's going to solve that problem for us immediately in the fourth quarter. But looking past that, those trends are good. It's business as usual. I think the thing that's made this fourth quarter a little crazy is the general election and uncertainty with what the outcome is going to be. And clients who have the ability in a low growth environment to hold back on projects have been waiting to put this behind us. And hopefully, it will be soon. So that's really the state of the state, Alexia. And the U.S. is the largest part of our portfolio. We're well represented in the U.S., but all of this noise isn't contributing anything. And in the past, we probably participated in the years of presidential elections to a greater extent than we're participating this year because whereas the Democrats are spending money, the Republicans are not, not to the same levels."

So it didn't make the same level of contribution that we would expect from almost any other Summer Olympics. And our branding businesses, we see a little bit of conservatism there in terms of projects getting pushed back or delayed in terms of what clients are spending their money on. So it's just a general conservatism. But I think it's been, as I said, and everybody knows this, a very unusual year with this presidential election. And people don't know how -- I think they can probably take a very good guess as to who's going to become President, but they don't know what's going to happen to the Congress.

And PHD as a network with the global Volkswagen win certainly has more haves [ph] than many of the markets, where they were a smaller player in the past. So as far as our media networks go, we feel really good that we've got 3 very strong platforms to grow off. And I think the other comment, John had touched on this earlier, the investments we made in our data and analytics business, you've really seen them come to bear some fruit, especially when you look at some of these more recent wins.

Hearts & Science, in addition to the U.S. and Canada, they launched in the U.K. They're currently pitching for business in Germany. And with the AT&T win, Hearts & Science was opened in Mexico.

And we're starting to expand and win business in other markets. And what Phil said about PHD is important. We've had PHD for a very long time. And it was pretty much Anglo-based in the Northern Europe and in the U.S. With the Volkswagen win, that allows us to compete in many more markets and fills out -- that was the one win, that client, that the company actually needed. And so we're expecting more opportunities to win business through both of those vehicles as we move forward. The other thing, which is an intangible but a terribly important one, is the way that we've won businesses in the accounts that we've won, the level of collaboration and coordination was second to none. And I can't say that enough. We work very hard at that culturally within Omnicom and always have. But this was, I'd have to say, the first time where it sort of paid out in big, tangible, real wins.

It's all based upon ROI at the end of the day and effective targeting of audiences through programmatic. What we've done is we can offer clients a bundled product, which has certain guarantees and they know the price that they're going to pay and what they're expecting to get out of it. And we also, through the 3 media groups that you talked about, are quite able to offer them unbundled products, where they do have a level of transparency. It depends upon what the clients' objectives are and how well -- what their preference really is. But we're capable and willing and able to offer both solutions or either solution to the brands that we serve. And the clients, they all have different objectives. So one model might meet certain clients' objectives and a more disclosed model, other clients. So I think it's -- there's a lot more choice associated than the headlines would lead you to believe. And the biggest question, I think, is one that was alluded to earlier, which is really ultimately what measurement is going to be used and is the client getting the value that they've signed up for.
