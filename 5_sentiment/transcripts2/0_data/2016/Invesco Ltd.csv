And I'll briefly review the 2015 highlights before getting into the review the business results for the fourth quarter. And then Loren will go into more depth of the financial results. And then of course, we'll open up to Q&A as we always do. 
So let me start by providing a brief overview of the operating results for the full year and so inclined, I'm on Page 3 of the presentation. Long-term investment performance remained very strong in 2015, 79% and 85% of actively managed assets were ahead of peers over 3 years and 5 years, respectively at the end of the fourth quarter. 
Strong investment performance combined with a comprehensive range of strategies and solutions we offer, help clients achieve their desired investment objectives contributed to long-term net inflows of $16.2 billion for the year. Our efforts to deliver for clients while taking a disciplined approach to managing our business resulted in an operating margin of 41% for the full year, off just slightly from the very strong prior year. 
The annual dividend totaled $1.08 per share, which represents an 8% increase over the prior year. We also returned more than $1 billion to shareholders during 2015 through dividends and stock buybacks. Assets under management were $775 billion at the end of 2015, down from $792 billion at the end of the prior year, mostly reflecting some later volatility. 
Average assets under management were $794 billion for 2015 versus $790 billion for 2014. Adjusted earnings per share for the year were $2.44 versus $2.51 from the prior year. As you can see on Slide 4, foreign exchange had a significant impact, diluting earnings per share up by $0.15 per share from the prior year. During 2015, Fitch upgraded the firm's credit rating to positive outlook and we repurchased $549 million worth of stock. 
So let me take a moment and look back over the achievements over the past year, which will provide insights into our continued long-range plans. First and foremost, of course, we remained focused on delivering strong long-term investment performance, which continue to grow our business. And as I mentioned, 79% and 85% of the assets were ahead of peers on a 3-year and 5-year basis, respectively at the end of 2015. 
By delivering strong investment performance and focusing on clients needs, we achieved further growth across the business. In the U.S., Invesco was the only firm to appear in the top 5 over 1, 5 and 10 years in the Barents best annual ranking. Our Asia Pacific continues to grow and we saw strong inflows in the range of strategies resulting in net sales of $5.7 billion. The strongest showing in the region since 2011. 
Institutional sales of $14.2 billion nearly doubled the prior year. We also saw continued growth in our EMEA business, driven by a focus on delivering strong investment performance in meeting our client needs. Cross-border and institutional were particularly strong with $7 billion and $4.5 billion in net inflows, respectively. And we remain in a very dominant position in the United Kingdom. 
We continue investing in capabilities where we see strong client demand or future opportunities by hiring world-class talent, upgrading our technology platforms, launching new products and providing additional resources where necessary in 2015. The ability to leverage the capabilities developed by our investment teams to meet client demand across the globe is a significant differentiator for our firm and will continue to bring the best of Invesco to different parts of our business where it makes sense for our clients. 
By delivering strong investment performance, Invesco Global Targeted Return achieved strong flows in its second year of offering with assets under management surpassing $11 billion globally at the end of the year. We continued to invest and strengthened our Fixed Income platform in 2015, which is enhancing our ability to meet our client needs. We also invested in our institutional business in 2015, refining our global strategy, bringing on additional highly regarded talent and more effectively aligning ourselves to the opportunities in the marketplace. 
We are seeing some early successes from this work, institutional flows during the first quarter were amongst the strongest in the past several quarters in spite of the very volatile markets. We're very focused on bringing together the full range of our capabilities to help meet our client investment objectives, Rhode Island mandate of $7.2 billion is an example of the success we're achieving with our Invesco solutions effort. 
Throughout the year, we continue to innovate and expand the range of alternative products we offer, leveraging our strong themes and capabilities for the benefit of our clients globally. Two years ago, we began leveraging our presence in China to explore and better understand the opportunities in digital and mobile technologies in the marketplace. We've also been exploring the possibilities with market-leading firms in Silicon Valley. Our acquisition of Jemstep in mid-January is an outcome of this research. Jemstep is one of the most digital platforms that focused exclusively on advisers and is a market-leading provider adviser-focused digital solutions. 
The Invesco-Jemstep platform enables Wealth Management home offices and their advisors, a full suite of technology solutions that are highly flexible, customizable and easily integrated into their existing systems. This acquisition represents an investment in our partnership with the advise community and highlights our efforts to participate in technology evolution within our industry. 
Turning to the fourth quarter. Let me take a moment to highlight the results, which you'll find on Slide 8. Strong investment performance contributed to long-term net inflows of $3.9 billion in the quarter. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 40.1% versus 41.4% in the prior quarter. Quarterly dividend remains at $0.27 per share. We also returned $329 million of shares to shareholders during the quarter, through dividends and stock buybacks. Assets under management were $775 billion at the end of the fourth quarter to $755 billion, we reported in the prior quarter. 
Operating income was $356 million, a quarter down from $373 million in the prior quarter reflecting a very volatile quarter -- the markets that we saw in the quarter. Earnings per share were $0.58 versus $0.61 in the prior quarter. We repurchased $214 million of stock during the quarter, representing 6.5 million shares. Turning to Page 11 and looking at investment performance as I mentioned during the quarter, it continued to be quite strong with 79% of the assets in the top half over 3-year basis and 85% were in the top half on a 5-year basis. 
We also saw improvement in the 1 year number, which was 60% of assets of leading peers. Turning to flows on Page 12. You'll see that active and passive flows were passive during the volatile quarter. Active flows during the quarter, were driven by a variety of capabilities, including Global Targeted Return, investment-grade fixed income, real estate and quantitative equities to name a few. 
Passive flows were positive with renewed strength in Invesco shares ETF were saw net inflows of $2 billion. These flows were offset by $1.2 billion outflows associated with the Invesco mortgage capital deleveraging. This did have an impact across a number of categories. If you look at passive institutional fixed income in the U.S. and if you add $1.2 billion in each of those categories, you'll eliminate the impact of the deleveraging of the Invesco mortgage capital during that quarter. 
Retail flows were relatively flat during the quarter, impacted my macroenvironment as investors weighed their options during the very volatile quarter. Institutional flows were particularly strong, driven by inflows in the Fixed Income real estate and reflecting our continued focus on this part of the business. The pipeline of 1, but not funded mandates remains at near all-time highs and is up more than 28% versus the prior year. Notably, this excludes the previous announced $7.2 billion Rhode Island 5/29 win, which is expected to fund sometime in the third quarter. 
We feel good about the results for the year on the fourth quarter and this puts us in a strong position heading into a volatile year in 2016. Continued strong investment performance, our focus on meeting client needs, contributed solid to operating results despite a very volatile environment. We continue to see strength across the global business, in particular in Asia Pacific and EMEA. Our focus remains on strengthening our efforts to deliver strong long-term results and help clients meet their long-term investment objectives from enhancing our comprehensive range of capabilities. 
But given the very volatile markets, we are taking a disciplined approach to managing our business, balancing our goals of reinvesting the business for the benefit of clients with the need to run our business effectively and efficiently as we have in the past very volatile markets. I'd now like to turn the call over to Loren to go through the financials in more depth."

Quarter-over-quarter, our total assets under management increased $19.8 billion or 2.6%, this was driven by market returns of $21 billion [ph], long-term net inflows of $2.9 [ph] billion and inflows from the Qs of $2 billion, offset by nega",1020,"Thanks, Marty. Quarter-over-quarter, our total assets under management increased $19.8 billion or 2.6%, this was driven by market returns of $21 billion [ph], long-term net inflows of $2.9 [ph] billion and inflows from the Qs of $2 billion, offset by negative FX translation of $5.3 billion and outflows from money market of $1.8 billion. Our average AUM for the fourth quarter was $783.7 billion years that was down 0.7% versus the third quarter. 
Our net revenue yield came in at 45.2 basis points with a decrease of 0.6 basis points versus Q3. FX translation reduced the yield by 0.4 basis points and change in mix reduced the yield by another 0.4 basis points. These impacts were offset by an increase in performance fees and other revenues in the quarter, which in combination added 0.2 basis points. 
Next let's turn to the operating results. You'll see that net revenues declined by $16.9 million or 1.9% quarter-over-quarter to $886.1 million, which includes a negative FX rate impact of $8.1 million. Within the net revenue number, you'll see that investment management fees fell by $29.3 million or 2.8% to $1.01 billion. This reflects the lower average AUM during the quarter, as well as changes in the AUM product and currency mix. 
Foreign exchange decreased fourth quarter management fees by $10.1 million. Service and distribution revenue decreased by $7.2 million or 3.4%, again reflecting the change in mix and lower average AUM during the quarter. FX reduced service and distribution revenue by $0.1 million. Performance fees came in at $18.8 million in Q4 and this was earned from a variety of different investment capabilities, including $9.8 million from real estate and $3.2 million from U.K. equities. 
Foreign exchange decreased performance fees by $0.1 million. Other revenues in the fourth quarter were $29 million, an increase of $1.4 million, driven by a higher real estate transaction fees. Foreign exchange decreased other revenues by $0.1 million. Distribution service and advisory expense, which we net against across gross revenues fell by $17 million or 4.3%. This movement was in line with our lower retail management fees and source and distribution revenues. 
Foreign exchange decreased these expenses by $2.3 million. Moving on down the slide, you'll see that our adjusted operating expenses at $530.4 million increased by $0.8 million or 0.2% relative to the third quarter. Foreign exchange decreased operating expenses by $3.9 million during the quarter. Employee compensation came in at $338.8 million, a decline of $8.1 million or 2.3%. This was due to lower incentive compensation for the quarter. FX reduced compensation by $2.3 million. 
Marketing expenses increased by $8.8 million or 34% to $34.6 million. This is a function of seasonally higher expenditures for advertising and other marketing costs particularly in EMEA. FX reduced marketing expense by $0.4 million in the quarter. Property, office and technology expenses were $80.4 million in the quarter, an increase of $0.5 million over the third quarter. FX decreasing expenses by $0.5 million. 
General administrative expenses came in at $76.6 million and that fell by $0.4 million or 0.5 percentage point. FX decreased G&A by $0.7 million. Going on further down the slide, you'll see that nonoperating income decreased $2.3 [ph] million compared to the third quarter. Included in the fourth quarter were a $7.3 million loss on the disposition of private equity partnership interest, as well as a $2 million mark to market on feed money investments. These were offset by gains from consolidated sponsored investment products compared to a loss in the prior quarter. 
In terms of effective tax rate. On pretax adjusted net income in Q4 was 26.6%, up slightly from 26.5% in the prior quarter, which then takes us to our adjusted EPS of $0.58 and our adjusted net operating margin of 40.1%. Now before I turn things back to Marty, I'd like to provide a little more detail on the business optimization work that we began implementing in Q4 current and the market volatility and as well as in light of our lower levels. 
We believe this optimization work will make Invesco an even stronger company, further increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our operating platform. The business optimization work that's underway is primarily focused on our use of shared service centers, outsourcing, automation and office location strategy. In the fourth quarter, U.S. GAAP results, we recognized $16.2 [ph] million of expenses primarily in the form of staff severance costs and we expect costs associated with the optimization initiative to continue through 2016 total costs for 2016 are estimated to be up to $85 million. 
Reducing our run rate operating expenses in 2016 and in future years is an important outcome of this work. And we expect the outgoing benefits of this project will be well in excess of the projected onetime implementation costs that I just discussed. We anticipate the project will achieve cash payback within less than 3 years, and it will add in an estimated 3 -- I'm sorry, $0.06 to $0.08 EPS accretion in fiscal year 2017 and beyond. 
Finally, in terms of reporting and consistent with our past approach to dealing with material one-off expenses, the incremental optimization charges will continue to be adjusted out of our non-GAAP presentation but will be detailed and tracked each quarter in the U.S. gap reconciliation within the earnings press release. Additionally, we'll provide you updated estimates of the implementation costs and benefits of this initiative to the extent that these change in any material way. 
The One additional item for me to note is that new for this quarter, we've included a schedule, detailing the impact that the change in foreign exchange rates had on our non-GAAP operating results and expenses for the quarter. The amounts presented on Slide 17 represent the impact of the change and exchange rate movement in the quarter and the year, and were calculated by applying the prior period FX rates to the current period non-U.S. dollar earnings. Going forward, the schedule will include each quarter and can be found in the appendix of our earnings presentations. And with that, I will now turn it back to Marty."

Probably one of the biggest is direct real estate, it's probably 30% of the pipeline. It continues to be a strong driver. Fixed income generally across a broad Fixed Income. Alternative Fixed Income stable value, it'll probably be another 30%. And then the remainder is split between asset allocation and multi-asset solutions. And then quantitative and regional equities would be other. So it's fairly well-diversified. And generally high fee. And so when we look at the fee rate of the pipeline, it's actually at one of the highest levels we've ever seen it. It's well above our current net revenue yields for the firm as a whole. And so as these assets come in, it will be accretive to our fee rates, which is great news. Obviously, the negative that we've seen in our fee rate is due to the compression on equities just given what's happened in the market and then foreign exchange has also had an impact as well. But in terms of the mix overall in the pipeline the institutional pipeline we think is very positive for our fee rates."

There's a lot of work I obviously, discussed being done around some of this optimization work, which will have some impacts on those line items as well. Generally, we're working hard to bring expenses down, right? As you can imagine, year-over-year decline in expenses, our compensation generally moves and in line with operating income, so those will be down. Some of the optimization work especially around -- we just mentioned some of the severance will also help bring some of the compensation line down. But the benefits of the optimization work will probably spread across most of the other categories of the marketing explicitly. We're looking at marketing. That's another interesting topic for us. It is one of these conundrums when you're in this market, given your clients want to hear from you and you want to be out with them. But at the same time, it certainly is a discretionary expense and it's one we'll continue to look at. So I'd say we're obviously, going to be very vigilant to making sure that we manage expenses very smartly in this environment with no presumption of snapback or some reversal. The other thing that I would like to just mention, there is some impact just due to the acquisitions that we discussed in terms of Jemstep and in terms of, after management completing 100% ownership there. It's absolutely immaterial in terms of the earnings impact, so you don't have to worry about EPS impact. But it does add probably roughly $15 million of expense and a little bit more in revenue in 2016. So you'll see some of those line items go up just as a result of those acquisitions. But offset by obviously, higher levels of revenues. So we don't want anyone to be surprised by that. The optimization work that we're doing should have a benefit in 2016 that you'll see. So again, we'll quantify that as we get through it. But that will help drive expenses down year-over-year."

But factor investment team, but really the Quad T we're seeing real demand for factor investing both outside of the United States both retail and institutional.

So there is this first mover advantage topic within ETFs. It's something very, very real. And if you look at the length of the time that our smartbeta ETFs have done in the market, they have liquidity. They have real track records. And when you're the incumbent then denier in a really strong position. We think other people coming to the smart beta area.

And I'll briefly review the 2015 highlights before getting into the review of the business results for the fourth quarter. And then Loren will go into more depth of the financial results. And then of course, we'll open up to Q&A as we always do.
So let me start by providing a brief overview of the operating results for the full year and if you're so inclined, I'm on Page 3 of the presentation. Long-term investment performance remained very strong in 2015. 79% and 85% of actively managed assets were ahead of peers over 3 years and 5 years, respectively, at the end of the fourth quarter.
Strong investment performance, combined with a comprehensive range of strategies and solutions we offer, help clients achieve their desired investment objectives, contributed to long-term net inflows of $16.2 billion for the year. Our efforts to deliver for clients while taking a disciplined approach to managing our business resulted in an operating margin of 41% for the full year, off just slightly from the very strong prior year.
The annual dividend totaled $1.08 per share, which represents an 8% increase over the prior year. We also returned more than $1 billion to shareholders during 2015 through dividends and stock buybacks. Assets under management were $775 billion at the end of 2015, down from $792 billion at the end of the prior year, mostly reflecting some late year volatility.
Average assets under management were $794 billion for 2015 versus $790 billion for 2014. Adjusted earnings per share for the year were $2.44 versus $2.51 in the prior year. As you can see on Slide 4, foreign exchange had a significant impact, diluting earnings per share by $0.15 per share from the prior year. During 2015, Fitch upgraded the firm's credit rating to positive outlook, and we repurchased $549 million worth of stock.
So let me take a moment and look back over the achievements over the past year, which will provide insights into our continued long-range plans. First and foremost, of course, we remained focused on delivering strong long-term investment performance, which continue the drive to grow our business. And as I mentioned, 79% and 85% of the assets were ahead of peers on a 3-year and 5-year basis, respectively, at the end of 2015.
By delivering strong investment performance and focusing on clients' needs, we achieved further growth across the business. In the U.S., Invesco was the only firm to appear in the top 5 over 1, 5 and 10 years in the Barron's Best Fund Families annual ranking. Our Asia Pacific business continued to grow, and we saw strong inflows in the range of strategies resulting in net sales of $5.7 billion, the strongest showing in the region since 2011.
Institutional sales of $14.2 billion nearly doubled the prior year. We also saw continued growth in our EMEA business, driven by a focus on delivering strong investment performance in meeting our client needs. Cross-border and institutional were particularly strong with $7 billion and $4.5 billion in net inflows, respectively. And we remain in a very dominant position in the United Kingdom.
We continue to invest in capabilities where we see strong client demand or future opportunities by hiring world-class talent, upgrading our technology platforms, launching new products and providing additional resources where necessary in 2015. The ability to leverage the capabilities developed by our investment teams to meet client demand across the globe is a significant differentiator for our firm and will continue to bring the best of Invesco to different parts of our business where it makes sense for our clients.
By delivering strong investment performance, Invesco Global Targeted Return achieved strong flows in its second year of offering with assets under management surpassing $11 billion globally at the end of the year. We continued to invest and strengthen our Fixed Income platform in 2015, which is enhancing our ability to meet our client needs. We also invested in our institutional business in 2015, refining our global strategy, bringing on additional highly regarded talent and more effectively aligning ourselves to the opportunities in the marketplace.
We are seeing some early successes from this work. Institutional flows during the first quarter were amongst the strongest in the past several quarters in spite of the very volatile markets. We're very focused on bringing together the full range of our capabilities to help meet our client investment objectives. Rhode Island mandate of $7.2 billion is an example of the success we're achieving with our Invesco solutions effort.
Throughout the year, we continue to innovate and expand the range of alternative products we offer, leveraging our strong themes and capabilities for the benefit of our clients globally. 2 years ago, we began leveraging our presence in China to explore and better understand the opportunities in digital and mobile technologies in the marketplace. We've also been exploring the possibilities with market-leading firms in Silicon Valley. Our acquisition of Jemstep in mid-January is an outcome of this research. Jemstep is one of the first digital platforms to focus exclusively on advisers and is a market-leading provider of adviser-focused digital solutions.
The Invesco-Jemstep platform enables Wealth Management home offices and their advisers with a full suite of technology solutions that are highly flexible, customizable and easily integrated into their existing systems. This acquisition represents an investment in our partnership with the advice community and highlights our efforts to participate in technology evolution within our industry.
Turning to the fourth quarter. Let me take a moment to highlight the results, which you'll find on Slide 8. Strong investment performance contributed to long-term net inflows of $3.9 billion for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 40.1% versus 41.4% in the prior quarter. Quarterly dividend remained at $0.27 per share. We also returned $329 million to shareholders during the quarter through dividends and stock buybacks. Assets under management were $775 billion at the end of the fourth quarter compared to $755 billion we reported in the prior quarter.
Operating income was $356 million in the quarter, down from $373 million in the prior quarter, reflecting a very volatile quarter -- markets we saw in the quarter. Earnings per share were $0.58 versus $0.61 in the prior quarter. We repurchased $214 million of stock during the quarter, representing 6.5 million shares. Turning to Page 11 and looking at investment performance. As I mentioned, during the quarter, it continued to be quite strong with 79% of the assets in the top half over 3-year basis and 85% were in the top half on a 5-year basis.
We also saw improvement in the 1 year number, which was 60% of assets leading peers. Turning to flows on Page 12. You'll see that active and passive flows were positive during the volatile quarter. Active flows during the quarter were driven by a variety of capabilities, including Global Targeted Return, investment-grade fixed income, real estate and quantitative equities to name a few.
Passive flows were positive with renewed strength in Invesco PowerShares ETF which saw net inflows of $2 billion. These flows were offset by $1.2 billion outflows associated with the Invesco mortgage capital deleveraging. This did have an impact across a number of categories. If you look at passive institutional fixed income in the U.S. and if you add $1.2 billion in each of those categories, you'll eliminate the impact of the deleveraging of the Invesco mortgage capital during that quarter.
Retail flows were relatively flat during the quarter, impacted by the macroenvironment as investors weighed their options during the very volatile quarter. Institutional flows were particularly strong, driven by inflows in the fixed income, real estate and reflecting our continued focus on this part of the business. The pipeline of one but not funded mandate remains at near all-time highs and is up more than 28% versus the prior year. Notably, this excludes the previous announced $7.2 billion Rhode Island 529 win, which is expected to fund sometime in the third quarter.
We feel good about the results for the year on the fourth quarter, and it puts us in a strong position heading into a volatile year, 2016. Continued strong investment performance, our focus on meeting client needs contributed solid operating results despite a very volatile environment. We continue to see strength across the global business, in particular in Asia Pacific and EMEA. Our focus remains on strengthening our efforts to deliver strong long-term results and help clients meet their investment objectives and enhancing our comprehensive range of capabilities.
But given the very volatile markets, we are taking a disciplined approach to managing our business, balancing our goals of reinvesting the business for the benefit of clients with the need to run our business effectively and efficiently as we have in past very volatile markets. I'd now like to turn the call over to Loren to go through the financials in more depth."

Quarter-over-quarter, our total assets under management increased $19.8 billion or 2.6%.

Quarter-over-quarter, our total assets under management increased $19.8 billion or 2.6%. This was driven by market returns of $21 billion, long-term net inflows of $3.9 billion and inflows from the Qs of $2 billion, offset by negative FX translation of $5.3 billion and outflows from money market of $1.8 billion. Our average AUM for the fourth quarter was $783.7 billion, that was down 0.7% versus the third quarter.
Our net revenue yield came in at 45.2 basis points with a decrease of 0.6 basis points versus Q3. FX translation reduced the yield by 0.4 basis points and change in mix reduced the yield by another 0.4 basis points. These impacts were offset by an increase in performance fees and other revenues in the quarter, which in combination added 0.2 basis points.
Next, let's turn to the operating results. You'll see that net revenues declined by $16.9 million or 1.9% quarter-over-quarter to $886.1 million, which includes a negative FX rate impact of $8.1 million. Within the net revenue number, you'll see that investment management fees fell by $29.3 million or 2.8% to $1.01 billion. This reflects the lower average AUM during the quarter as well as changes in the AUM product and currency mix.
Foreign exchange decreased fourth quarter management fees by $10.1 million. Service and distribution revenue decreased by $7.2 million or 3.4%, again, reflecting the change in mix and lower average AUM during the quarter. FX reduced service and distribution revenue by $0.1 million. Performance fees came in at $18.8 million in Q4, and this was earned from a variety of different investment capabilities, including $9.8 million from real estate and $3.2 million from U.K. equities.
Foreign exchange decreased performance fees by $0.1 million. Other revenues in the fourth quarter were $29 million, an increase of $1.4 million, driven by higher real estate transaction fees. Foreign exchange decreased other revenues by $0.1 million. Reported distribution service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, fell by $17 million or 4.3%. This movement was in line with our lower retail management fees and service and distribution revenues.
Foreign exchange decreased these expenses by $2.3 million. Moving on down the slide, you'll see that our adjusted operating expenses at $530.4 million increased by $0.8 million or 0.2% relative to the third quarter. Foreign exchange decreased operating expenses by $3.9 million during the quarter. Employee compensation came in at $338.8 million, a decline of $8.1 million or 2.3%. This was due to lower incentive compensation for the quarter. FX reduced compensation by $2.3 million.
Marketing expenses increased by $8.8 million or 34% to $34.6 million. This is a function of seasonally higher expenditures for advertising and other marketing costs particularly in EMEA. FX reduced marketing expense by $0.4 million in the quarter. Property, office and technology expenses were $80.4 million in the quarter, an increase of $0.5 million over the third quarter. FX decreasing expenses by $0.5 million.
General, administrative expenses came in at $76.6 million, and that fell by $0.4 million or 0.5 percentage point. FX decreased G&A by $0.7 million. Going on further down the slide, you'll see that nonoperating income decreased $2.3 million compared to the third quarter. Included in the fourth quarter were a $7.3 million loss on the disposition of private equity partnership interest as well as a $2 million mark to market on seed money investments. These were offset by gains from consolidated sponsored investment products compared to a loss in the prior quarter.
In terms of effective tax rate. Our pretax adjusted net income in Q4 was 26.6%, up slightly from 26.5% in the prior quarter, which then takes us to our adjusted EPS of $0.58 and our adjusted net operating margin of 40.1%. Now before I turn things back to Marty, I'd like to provide a little more detail on the business optimization work that we began implementing in Q4 in light of the current market volatility and as well as in light of our lower AUM levels.
We believe this optimization work will make Invesco an even stronger company, further increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our operating platform. The business optimization work that's underway is primarily focused on our use of shared service centers, outsourcing, automation and office location strategy. In the fourth quarter U.S. GAAP results, we recognized $16.2 million of expenses primarily in the form of staff severance costs, and we expect costs associated with the optimization initiative to continue through 2016. Total costs for 2016 are estimated to be up to $85 million.
Reducing our run rate operating expenses in 2016 and in future years is an important outcome of this work. And we expect the outgoing benefits of this project will be well in excess of the projected onetime implementation costs I just discussed. We anticipate the project will achieve cash payback within less than 3 years, and it will add an estimated 3 to -- I'm sorry, $0.06 to $0.08 EPS accretion in fiscal year 2017 and beyond. 
Finally, in terms of reporting and consistent with our past approach to dealing with material one-off expenses, the incremental optimization charges will continue to be adjusted out of our non-GAAP presentation but will be detailed and tracked each quarter in the U.S. GAAP reconciliation table within the earnings release. Additionally, we'll provide you updated estimates of the implementation costs and benefits of this initiative to the extent that these change in any material way.
The one additional item for me to note is that new for this quarter, we've included a schedule detailing the impact that the change in foreign exchange rates had on our non-GAAP operating results and expenses for the quarter. The amounts presented on Slide 17 represent the impact of the change and exchange rate movement in the quarter and the year and were calculated by applying the prior period FX rates to the current period's non-U.S. dollar earnings. Going forward, the schedule will be included each quarter and can be found in the appendix of our earnings presentations. And with that, I will now turn it back to Marty."

It's probably 30% of the pipeline. It continues to be a strong driver. Fixed income generally across a broad Fixed Income. Alternative Fixed Income, stable value. It's probably another 30%. And then the remainder is split between asset allocation and multi-asset solutions. And then the quantitative and regional equities would be others. So it's fairly well diversified and generally high fee. And so when we look at the fee rate of the pipeline, it's actually at one of the highest levels we've ever seen it. It's well above our current net revenue yields for the firm as a whole. And so as these assets come in, it will be accretive to our fee rates, which is great news. Obviously, the negative that we've seen in our fee rate is due to the compression on equities just given what's happened in the market and then foreign exchange has also had an impact as well. But in terms of the mix overall in the pipeline, the institutional pipeline, we think it's very positive for our fee rates."

I'd say given the volatility, we're probably going to not give any explicit guidance around line items at this stage. There's a lot of work, obviously, that I discussed being done around some of this optimization work, which will have some impacts on those line items as well. Generally, we're working hard to bring expenses down, right? As you can imagine, year-over-year decline in expenses, our compensation generally moves and flexes in line with operating income, so those will be down. Some of the optimization work especially around -- we just mentioned some of the severance will also help bring some of the compensation line down. But the benefits of the optimization work will probably spread across most of the other categories of the marketing explicitly. We're looking at marketing. That's another interesting topic for us. It is one of these conundrums, when you're in this market, your clients want to hear from you and you want to be out with them. But at the same time, it certainly is a discretionary expense, and it's one that we're continuing to look at. So I'd say we're obviously going to be very vigilant to making sure that we manage expenses very smartly in this environment with no presumption of snapback or some reversal. The other thing I would like to just mention, there is some impact just due to the acquisitions that we discussed in terms of Jemstep and in terms of Religare, after management completing our 100% ownership there. It's absolutely immaterial in terms of the earnings impact, so you don't have to worry about EPS impacts. But it does add probably roughly $15 million of expense and a little bit more in revenue in 2016. So you'll see some of those line items go up just as a result of those acquisitions but offset by, obviously, higher levels of revenues. So we don't want anyone to be surprised by that.

So that is one that, certainly outside the U.S., has really taken on a lot of good momentum. And I think the product that it competes with in the marketplace had some issues around its performance. And so the positioning is even better probably now than it's ever been. Still early days in the U.S. for us. And so we'd like nothing more to see GTR sort of reach its appropriate time frame and sort of get through all the hurdles that it needed to get through for it to be on the platform. But I think that and real estate, and then perhaps as well, alternative fixed income is still an area where we believe we can play at a much more significant level than we have in the past. And there are a lot of products that are still sort of early days in terms of their track record. So I think it's really GTR and real estate right now are the primary drivers for us and where the demand is."

And I'll briefly review the 2015 highlights before getting into the review of the business results for the fourth quarter. And then Loren will go into more depth of the financial results. And then of course, we'll open up to Q&A as we always do.
So let me start by providing a brief overview of the operating results for the full year and if you're so inclined, I'm on Page 3 of the presentation. Long-term investment performance remained very strong in 2015. 79% and 85% of actively managed assets were ahead of peers over 3 years and 5 years, respectively, at the end of the fourth quarter.
Strong investment performance, combined with a comprehensive range of strategies and solutions we offer to help clients achieve their desired investment objectives, contributed to long-term net inflows of $16.2 billion for the year. Our efforts to deliver for clients while taking a disciplined approach to managing our business resulted in an operating margin of 41% for the full year, off just slightly from the very strong prior year.
The annual dividend totaled $1.08 per share, which represents an 8% increase over the prior year. We also returned more than $1 billion to shareholders during 2015 through dividends and stock buybacks. Assets under management were $775 billion at the end of 2015, down from $792 billion at the end of the prior year, mostly reflecting some late year volatility.
Average assets under management were $794 billion for 2015 versus $790 billion for 2014. Adjusted earnings per share for the year were $2.44 versus $2.51 in the prior year. As you can see on Slide 4, foreign exchange had a significant impact, diluting earnings per share by $0.15 per share from the prior year. During 2015, Fitch upgraded the firm's credit rating to positive outlook, and we repurchased $549 million worth of stock.
So let me take a moment and look back over the achievements over the past year, which will provide insights into our continued long-range plans. First and foremost, of course, we remained focused on delivering strong long-term investment performance, which continue to drive to grow our business. And as I mentioned, 79% and 85% of the assets were ahead of peers on a 3-year and 5-year basis, respectively, at the end of 2015.
By delivering strong investment performance and focusing on clients' needs, we achieved further growth across the business. In the U.S., Invesco was the only firm to appear in the top 5 over 1, 5 and 10 years in the Barron's Best Fund Families annual ranking. Our Asia Pacific business continued to grow, and we saw strong inflows in a range of strategies, resulting in net sales of $5.7 billion, the strongest showing in the region since 2011.
Institutional sales of $14.2 billion nearly doubled the prior year. We also saw continued growth in our EMEA business, driven by a focus on delivering strong investment performance in meeting our client needs. Cross-border and institutional were particularly strong with $7 billion and $4.5 billion in net inflows, respectively. And we remain in a very dominant position in the United Kingdom.
We continue to invest in capabilities where we see strong client demand or future opportunities by hiring world-class talent, upgrading our technology platforms, launching new products and providing additional resources where necessary in 2015. The ability to leverage the capabilities developed by our investment teams to meet client demand across the globe is a significant differentiator for our firm and will continue to bring the best of Invesco to different parts of our business where it makes sense for our clients.
By delivering strong investment performance, Invesco Global Targeted Return achieved strong flows in its second year of offering with assets under management surpassing $11 billion globally at the end of the year. We continued to invest and strengthen our Fixed Income platform in 2015, which is enhancing our ability to meet our client needs. We also invested in our institutional business in 2015, refining our global strategy, bringing on additional highly regarded talent and more effectively aligning ourselves to the opportunities in the marketplace.
We are seeing some early successes from this work. Institutional flows during the first quarter were amongst the strongest in the past several quarters in spite of the very volatile markets. We're very focused on bringing together the full range of our capabilities to help meet our client investment objectives. Rhode Island mandate of $7.2 billion is an example of the success we're achieving with our Invesco solutions effort.
Throughout the year, we continue to innovate and expand the range of alternative products we offer, leveraging our strong teams and capabilities for the benefit of our clients globally. 2 years ago, we began leveraging our presence in China to explore and better understand the opportunities in digital and mobile technologies in the marketplace. We've also been exploring the possibilities with market-leading firms in Silicon Valley. Our acquisition of Jemstep in mid-January is an outcome of this research. Jemstep is one of the first digital platforms to focus exclusively on advisers and is a market-leading provider of adviser-focused digital solutions.
The Invesco-Jemstep platform enables wealth management home offices and their advisers with a full suite of technology solutions that are highly flexible, customizable and easily integrated into their existing systems. This acquisition represents an investment in our partnership with the advice community and highlights our efforts to participate in the technology evolution within our industry.
Turning to the fourth quarter, let me take a moment to highlight the results, which you'll find on Slide 8. Strong investment performance contributed long-term net inflows of $3.9 billion for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 40.1% versus 41.4% in the prior quarter. Quarterly dividend remained at $0.27 per share. We also returned $329 million to shareholders during the quarter through dividends and stock buybacks. Assets under management were $775 billion at the end of the fourth quarter compared to $755 billion we reported in the prior quarter.
Operating income was $356 million in the quarter, down from $373 million in the prior quarter, reflecting a very volatile quarter -- markets we saw in the quarter. Earnings per share were $0.58 versus $0.61 in the prior quarter. We repurchased $214 million of stock during the quarter, representing 6.5 million shares. Turning to Page 11 and looking at investment performance. As I mentioned, during the quarter, it continued to be quite strong with 79% of the assets in the top half over a 3-year basis and 85% were in the top half on a 5-year basis.
We also saw improvement in the 1 year number, which was 60% of assets leading peers. Turning to flows on Page 12. You'll see that active and passive flows were positive during the volatile quarter. Active flows during the quarter were driven by a variety of capabilities, including Global Targeted Return, investment-grade fixed income, real estate and quantitative equities, to name a few.
Passive flows were positive with renewed strength in Invesco PowerShares ETF, which saw net inflows of $2 billion. These flows were offset by $1.2 billion outflows associated with the Invesco mortgage capital deleveraging. This did have an impact across a number of categories. If you look at passive institutional fixed income in the U.S. and if you add $1.2 billion in each of those categories, you'll eliminate the impact of the deleveraging of the Invesco mortgage capital during that quarter.
Retail flows were relatively flat during the quarter, impacted by the macro environment as investors weighed their options during the very volatile quarter. Institutional flows were particularly strong, driven by inflows in the fixed income, real estate and reflecting our continued focus on this part of the business. The pipeline of won but not funded mandate remains at near all-time highs and is up more than 28% versus the prior year. Notably, this excludes the previous announced $7.2 billion Rhode Island 529 win, which is expected to fund sometime in the third quarter.
We feel good about the results for the year and the fourth quarter, and it puts us in a strong position heading into a volatile year, 2016. Continued strong investment performance, our focus on meeting client needs contributed solid operating results despite a very volatile environment. We continue to see strength across the global business, in particular in Asia Pacific and EMEA. Our focus remains on strengthening our efforts to deliver strong long-term results and help clients meet their investment objectives and enhancing our comprehensive range of capabilities.
But given the very volatile markets, we are taking a disciplined approach to managing our business, balancing our goals of reinvesting the business for the benefit of clients with the need to run our business effectively and efficiently as we have in past very volatile markets. I'd now like to turn the call over to Loren to go through the financials in more depth."

Quarter-over-quarter, our total assets under management increased $19.8 billion or 2.6%.

Quarter-over-quarter, our total assets under management increased $19.8 billion or 2.6%. This was driven by market returns of $21 billion, long-term net inflows of $3.9 billion and inflows from the Qs of $2 billion, offset by negative FX translation of $5.3 billion and outflows from money market of $1.8 billion. Our average AUM for the fourth quarter was $783.7 billion; that was down 0.7% versus the third quarter.
Our net revenue yield came in at 45.2 basis points with a decrease of 0.6 basis points versus Q3. FX translation reduced the yield by 0.4 basis points and change in mix reduced the yield by another 0.4 basis points. These impacts were offset by an increase in performance fees and other revenues in the quarter, which in combination added 0.2 basis points.
Next, let's turn to the operating results. You'll see that net revenues declined by $16.9 million or 1.9% quarter-over-quarter to $886.1 million, which includes a negative FX rate impact of $8.1 million. Within the net revenue number, you'll see that investment management fees fell by $29.3 million or 2.8% to $1.01 billion. This reflects the lower average AUM during the quarter as well as changes in the AUM product and currency mix.
Foreign exchange decreased fourth quarter management fees by $10.1 million. Service and distribution revenues decreased by $7.2 million or 3.4%, again, reflecting the change in mix and lower average AUM during the quarter. FX reduced service and distribution revenues by $0.1 million. Performance fees came in at $18.8 million in Q4, and this was earned from a variety of different investment capabilities, including $9.8 million from real estate and $3.2 million from U.K. equities.
Foreign exchange decreased performance fees by $0.1 million. Other revenues in the fourth quarter were $29 million, an increase of $1.4 million, driven by higher real estate transaction fees. Foreign exchange decreased other revenues by $0.1 million. Reported distribution service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, fell by $17 million or 4.3%. This movement was in line with our lower retail management fees and service and distribution revenues.
Foreign exchange decreased these expenses by $2.3 million. Moving on down the slide, you'll see that our adjusted operating expenses at $530.4 million increased by $0.8 million or 0.2% relative to the third quarter. Foreign exchange decreased operating expenses by $3.9 million during the quarter. Employee compensation came in at $338.8 million, a decline of $8.1 million or 2.3%. This was due to lower incentive compensation for the quarter. FX reduced compensation by $2.3 million.
Marketing expenses increased by $8.8 million or 34% to $34.6 million. This was a function of seasonally higher expenditures for advertising and other marketing costs, particularly in EMEA. FX reduced marketing expense by $0.4 million in the quarter. Property, office and technology expenses were $80.4 million in the quarter, an increase of $0.5 million over the third quarter. FX decreased these expenses by $0.5 million.
General, administrative expenses came in at $76.6 million, and that fell by $0.4 million or 0.5 percentage point. FX decreased G&A by $0.7 million. Going on further down the slide, you'll see that nonoperating income decreased $2.3 million compared to the third quarter. Included in the fourth quarter were a $7.3 million loss on the disposition of private equity partnership interest as well as a $2 million mark-to-market on seed money investments. These were offset by gains from consolidated sponsored investment products compared to a loss in the prior quarter.
In terms of effective tax rate. Our pretax adjusted net income in Q4 was 26.6%, up slightly from 26.5% in the prior quarter, which then takes us to our adjusted EPS of $0.58 and our adjusted net operating margin of 40.1%. Now before I turn things back to Marty, I'd like to provide a little more detail on the business optimization work that we began to implement in Q4 in light of the current market volatility and as well as in light of our lower AUM levels.
We believe this optimization work will make Invesco an even stronger company, further increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our operating platform. The business optimization work that's underway is primarily focused on our use of shared service centers, outsourcing, automation and office location strategy. In the fourth quarter U.S. GAAP results, we recognized $16.2 million of expenses, primarily in the form of staff severance costs, and we expect costs associated with the optimization initiative to continue through 2016. Total costs for 2016 are estimated to be up to $85 million.
Reducing our run rate operating expenses in 2016 and in future years is an important outcome of this work. And we expect the outgoing benefits of this project will be well in excess of the projected onetime implementation costs I just discussed. We anticipate the project will achieve cash payback within less than 3 years, and it will add an estimated 3 to -- I'm sorry, $0.06 to $0.08 EPS accretion in fiscal year 2017 and beyond. 
Finally, in terms of reporting and consistent with our past approach to dealing with material one-off expenses, the incremental optimization charges will continue to be adjusted out of our non-GAAP presentation but will be detailed and tracked each quarter in the U.S. GAAP reconciliation table within the earnings release. Additionally, we'll provide you updated estimates of the implementation costs and benefits of this initiative to the extent that these change in any material way.
The one additional item for me to note is that new for this quarter, we've included a schedule detailing the impact that the change in foreign exchange rates had on our non-GAAP operating results and expenses for the quarter. The amounts presented on Slide 17 represent the impact of the change in exchange rate movement in the quarter and the year and were calculated by applying the prior period FX rates to the current period's non-U.S. dollar earnings. Going forward, the schedule will be included each quarter and can be found in the appendix of our earnings presentations. And with that, I will now turn it back to Marty."

Probably one of the biggest is direct real estate, probably 30% of the pipeline. It continues to be a strong driver. Fixed income generally, across broad Fixed Income, alternative Fixed Income, stable value, is probably another 30%. And then the remainder is split between asset allocation and multi-asset solutions. And then quantitative and regional equities would be others. So it's fairly well diversified and generally high fee. And so when we look at the fee rate of the pipeline, it's actually at one of the highest levels we've ever seen it. It's well above our current net revenue yields for the firm as a whole. And so as these assets come in, it will be accretive to our fee rates, which is great news. Obviously, the negative that we've seen in our fee rate is due to the compression on equities, just given what's happened in the market and then foreign exchange has also had an impact as well. But in terms of the mix overall on the pipeline, the institutional pipeline, we think it's very positive for our fee rates."

I'd say given the volatility, we're probably going to not give any explicit guidance around line items at this stage. There's a lot of work, obviously, that I discussed being done around some of this optimization work, which will have some impacts on those line items as well. Generally, we're working hard to bring expenses down, right? As you can imagine, year-over-year decline in expenses, our compensation generally moves and flexes in line with operating income, so those will be down. Some of the optimization work especially around -- we just mentioned some of the severance will also help bring some of the compensation line down. But the benefits of the optimization work will probably spread across most of the other categories other than marketing explicitly. We're looking at marketing. That's another interesting topic for us. It is one of these conundrums when you're in this market. Your clients want to hear from you and you want to be out with them. But at the same time, it certainly is a discretionary expense, and it's one that we're continuing to look at. So I'd say we're obviously going to be very vigilant to making sure that we manage expenses very smartly in this environment with no presumption of a snapback or some reversal. The other thing I would like to just mention, there is some impact just due to the acquisitions that we discussed in terms of Jemstep and in terms of Religare Asset Management, completing our 100% ownership there. It's absolutely immaterial in terms of the earnings impact, so you don't have to worry about EPS impacts. But it does add probably roughly $15 million of expense and a little bit more in revenue in 2016. So you'll see some of those line items go up just as a result of those acquisitions but offset by, obviously, higher levels of revenues. So we don't want anyone to be surprised by that. The optimization work that we're doing should have a benefit in 2016 that you'll see. So again, we'll quantify that as we get through it. But that will help drive expenses down year-over-year."

So yes, I think you're at a point where you're actually going to see, if you're a high-conviction manager, you're going to continue to start to do well. So I don't know what you put in traditional.

Institutional in particular in Europe, institutional in particular in Asia. And we've been doing it for 20 years. And I think the other thing, if you look at the PowerShares lineup, what is important is that differently than mutual funds, you really can't have more than maybe 3 in a category. So there is this first-mover advantage topic within ETFs. It's something very, very real. And if you look at the length of the time that our smart beta ETFs have been in the market, they have liquidity, they have real track records. And when you're the incumbent, you're in a really strong position. So we think other people coming into the smart beta area is confirmation that it's a better way to create exposure and -- to passive. And again, we're just seeing continued strength within PowerShares in particular and factor investing outside the United States."

And I'll briefly review the 2015 highlights before getting into the review of the business results for the fourth quarter. And then Loren will go into more depth of the financial results. And then of course, we'll open up to Q&A as we always do.
So let me start by providing a brief overview of the operating results for the full year and if you're so inclined, I'm on Page 3 of the presentation. Long-term investment performance remained very strong in 2015. 79% and 85% of actively managed assets were ahead of peers over 3 years and 5 years, respectively, at the end of the fourth quarter.
Strong investment performance, combined with a comprehensive range of strategies and solutions we offer to help clients achieve their desired investment objectives, contributed to long-term net inflows of $16.2 billion for the year. Our efforts to deliver for clients while taking a disciplined approach to managing our business resulted in an operating margin of 41% for the full year, off just slightly from the very strong prior year.
The annual dividend totaled $1.08 per share, which represents an 8% increase over the prior year. We also returned more than $1 billion to shareholders during 2015 through dividends and stock buybacks. Assets under management were $775 billion at the end of 2015, down from $792 billion at the end of the prior year, mostly reflecting some late year volatility.
Average assets under management were $794 billion for 2015 versus $790 billion for 2014. Adjusted earnings per share for the year were $2.44 versus $2.51 in the prior year. As you can see on Slide 4, foreign exchange had a significant impact, diluting earnings per share by $0.15 per share from the prior year. During 2015, Fitch upgraded the firm's credit rating to positive outlook, and we repurchased $549 million worth of stock.
So let me take a moment and look back over the achievements over the past year, which will provide insights into our continued long-range plans. First and foremost, of course, we remained focused on delivering strong long-term investment performance, which continue to drive to grow our business. And as I mentioned, 79% and 85% of the assets were ahead of peers on a 3-year and 5-year basis, respectively, at the end of 2015.
By delivering strong investment performance and focusing on clients' needs, we achieved further growth across the business. In the U.S., Invesco was the only firm to appear in the top 5 over 1, 5 and 10 years in the Barron's Best Fund Families annual ranking. Our Asia Pacific business continued to grow, and we saw strong inflows in a range of strategies, resulting in net sales of $5.7 billion, the strongest showing in the region since 2011.
Institutional sales of $14.2 billion nearly doubled the prior year. We also saw continued growth in our EMEA business, driven by a focus on delivering strong investment performance in meeting our client needs. Cross-border and institutional were particularly strong with $7 billion and $4.5 billion in net inflows, respectively. And we remain in a very dominant position in the United Kingdom.
We continue to invest in capabilities where we see strong client demand or future opportunities by hiring world-class talent, upgrading our technology platforms, launching new products and providing additional resources where necessary in 2015. The ability to leverage the capabilities developed by our investment teams to meet client demand across the globe is a significant differentiator for our firm and will continue to bring the best of Invesco to different parts of our business where it makes sense for our clients.
By delivering strong investment performance, Invesco Global Targeted Return achieved strong flows in its second year of offering with assets under management surpassing $11 billion globally at the end of the year. We continued to invest and strengthen our Fixed Income platform in 2015, which is enhancing our ability to meet our client needs. We also invested in our institutional business in 2015, refining our global strategy, bringing on additional highly regarded talent and more effectively aligning ourselves to the opportunities in the marketplace.
We are seeing some early successes from this work. Institutional flows during the first quarter were amongst the strongest in the past several quarters in spite of the very volatile markets. We're very focused on bringing together the full range of our capabilities to help meet our client investment objectives. Rhode Island mandate of $7.2 billion is an example of the success we're achieving with our Invesco solutions effort.
Throughout the year, we continue to innovate and expand the range of alternative products we offer, leveraging our strong teams and capabilities for the benefit of our clients globally. 2 years ago, we began leveraging our presence in China to explore and better understand the opportunities in digital and mobile technologies in the marketplace. We've also been exploring the possibilities with market-leading firms in Silicon Valley. Our acquisition of Jemstep in mid-January is an outcome of this research. Jemstep is one of the first digital platforms to focus exclusively on advisers and is a market-leading provider of adviser-focused digital solutions.
The Invesco-Jemstep platform enables wealth management home offices and their advisers with a full suite of technology solutions that are highly flexible, customizable and easily integrated into their existing systems. This acquisition represents an investment in our partnership with the advice community and highlights our efforts to participate in the technology evolution within our industry.
Turning to the fourth quarter, let me take a moment to highlight the results, which you'll find on Slide 8. Strong investment performance contributed long-term net inflows of $3.9 billion for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 40.1% versus 41.4% in the prior quarter. Quarterly dividend remained at $0.27 per share. We also returned $329 million to shareholders during the quarter through dividends and stock buybacks. Assets under management were $775 billion at the end of the fourth quarter compared to $755 billion we reported in the prior quarter.
Operating income was $356 million in the quarter, down from $373 million in the prior quarter, reflecting a very volatile quarter -- markets we saw in the quarter. Earnings per share were $0.58 versus $0.61 in the prior quarter. We repurchased $214 million of stock during the quarter, representing 6.5 million shares. Turning to Page 11 and looking at investment performance. As I mentioned, during the quarter, it continued to be quite strong with 79% of the assets in the top half over a 3-year basis and 85% were in the top half on a 5-year basis.
We also saw improvement in the 1 year number, which was 60% of assets leading peers. Turning to flows on Page 12. You'll see that active and passive flows were positive during the volatile quarter. Active flows during the quarter were driven by a variety of capabilities, including Global Targeted Return, investment-grade fixed income, real estate and quantitative equities, to name a few.
Passive flows were positive with renewed strength in Invesco PowerShares ETF, which saw net inflows of $2 billion. These flows were offset by $1.2 billion outflows associated with the Invesco mortgage capital deleveraging. This did have an impact across a number of categories. If you look at passive institutional fixed income in the U.S. and if you add $1.2 billion in each of those categories, you'll eliminate the impact of the deleveraging of the Invesco mortgage capital during that quarter.
Retail flows were relatively flat during the quarter, impacted by the macro environment as investors weighed their options during the very volatile quarter. Institutional flows were particularly strong, driven by inflows in the fixed income, real estate and reflecting our continued focus on this part of the business. The pipeline of won but not funded mandate remains at near all-time highs and is up more than 28% versus the prior year. Notably, this excludes the previous announced $7.2 billion Rhode Island 529 win, which is expected to fund sometime in the third quarter.
We feel good about the results for the year and the fourth quarter, and it puts us in a strong position heading into a volatile year, 2016. Continued strong investment performance, our focus on meeting client needs contributed solid operating results despite a very volatile environment. We continue to see strength across the global business, in particular in Asia Pacific and EMEA. Our focus remains on strengthening our efforts to deliver strong long-term results and help clients meet their investment objectives and enhancing our comprehensive range of capabilities.
But given the very volatile markets, we are taking a disciplined approach to managing our business, balancing our goals of reinvesting the business for the benefit of clients with the need to run our business effectively and efficiently as we have in past very volatile markets. I'd now like to turn the call over to Loren to go through the financials in more depth."

Quarter-over-quarter, our total assets under management increased $19.8 billion or 2.6%. This was driven by market returns of $21 billion, long-term net inflows of $3.9 billion and inflows from the Qs of $2 billion, offset by negative FX tr",1017,"Thanks, Marty. Quarter-over-quarter, our total assets under management increased $19.8 billion or 2.6%. This was driven by market returns of $21 billion, long-term net inflows of $3.9 billion and inflows from the Qs of $2 billion, offset by negative FX translation of $5.3 billion and outflows from money market of $1.8 billion. Our average AUM for the fourth quarter was $783.7 billion; that was down 0.7% versus the third quarter.
Our net revenue yield came in at 45.2 basis points with a decrease of 0.6 basis points versus Q3. FX translation reduced the yield by 0.4 basis points and change in mix reduced the yield by another 0.4 basis points. These impacts were offset by an increase in performance fees and other revenues in the quarter, which in combination added 0.2 basis points.
Next, let's turn to the operating results. You'll see that net revenues declined by $16.9 million or 1.9% quarter-over-quarter to $886.1 million, which includes a negative FX rate impact of $8.1 million. Within the net revenue number, you'll see that investment management fees fell by $29.3 million or 2.8% to $1.01 billion. This reflects the lower average AUM during the quarter as well as changes in the AUM product and currency mix.
Foreign exchange decreased fourth quarter management fees by $10.1 million. Service and distribution revenues decreased by $7.2 million or 3.4%, again, reflecting the change in mix and lower average AUM during the quarter. FX reduced service and distribution revenues by $0.1 million. Performance fees came in at $18.8 million in Q4, and this was earned from a variety of different investment capabilities, including $9.8 million from real estate and $3.2 million from U.K. equities.
Foreign exchange decreased performance fees by $0.1 million. Other revenues in the fourth quarter were $29 million, an increase of $1.4 million, driven by higher real estate transaction fees. Foreign exchange decreased other revenues by $0.1 million. Reported distribution service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, fell by $17 million or 4.3%. This movement was in line with our lower retail management fees and service and distribution revenues.
Foreign exchange decreased these expenses by $2.3 million. Moving on down the slide, you'll see that our adjusted operating expenses at $530.4 million increased by $0.8 million or 0.2% relative to the third quarter. Foreign exchange decreased operating expenses by $3.9 million during the quarter. Employee compensation came in at $338.8 million, a decline of $8.1 million or 2.3%. This was due to lower incentive compensation for the quarter. FX reduced compensation by $2.3 million.
Marketing expenses increased by $8.8 million or 34% to $34.6 million. This was a function of seasonally higher expenditures for advertising and other marketing costs, particularly in EMEA. FX reduced marketing expense by $0.4 million in the quarter. Property, office and technology expenses were $80.4 million in the quarter, an increase of $0.5 million over the third quarter. FX decreased these expenses by $0.5 million.
General, administrative expenses came in at $76.6 million, and that fell by $0.4 million or 0.5 percentage point. FX decreased G&A by $0.7 million. Going on further down the slide, you'll see that nonoperating income decreased $2.3 million compared to the third quarter. Included in the fourth quarter were a $7.3 million loss on the disposition of private equity partnership interest as well as a $2 million mark-to-market on seed money investments. These were offset by gains from consolidated sponsored investment products compared to a loss in the prior quarter.
In terms of effective tax rate. Our pretax adjusted net income in Q4 was 26.6%, up slightly from 26.5% in the prior quarter, which then takes us to our adjusted EPS of $0.58 and our adjusted net operating margin of 40.1%. Now before I turn things back to Marty, I'd like to provide a little more detail on the business optimization work that we began to implement in Q4 in light of the current market volatility and as well as in light of our lower AUM levels.
We believe this optimization work will make Invesco an even stronger company, further increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our operating platform. The business optimization work that's underway is primarily focused on our use of shared service centers, outsourcing, automation and office location strategy. In the fourth quarter U.S. GAAP results, we recognized $16.2 million of expenses, primarily in the form of staff severance costs, and we expect costs associated with the optimization initiative to continue through 2016. Total costs for 2016 are estimated to be up to $85 million.
Reducing our run rate operating expenses in 2016 and in future years is an important outcome of this work. And we expect the outgoing benefits of this project will be well in excess of the projected onetime implementation costs I just discussed. We anticipate the project will achieve cash payback within less than 3 years, and it will add an estimated 3 to -- I'm sorry, $0.06 to $0.08 EPS accretion in fiscal year 2017 and beyond. 
Finally, in terms of reporting and consistent with our past approach to dealing with material one-off expenses, the incremental optimization charges will continue to be adjusted out of our non-GAAP presentation but will be detailed and tracked each quarter in the U.S. GAAP reconciliation table within the earnings release. Additionally, we'll provide you updated estimates of the implementation costs and benefits of this initiative to the extent that these change in any material way.
The one additional item for me to note is that new for this quarter, we've included a schedule detailing the impact that the change in foreign exchange rates had on our non-GAAP operating results and expenses for the quarter. The amounts presented on Slide 17 represent the impact of the change in exchange rate movement in the quarter and the year and were calculated by applying the prior period FX rates to the current period's non-U.S. dollar earnings. Going forward, the schedule will be included each quarter and can be found in the appendix of our earnings presentations. 
And with that, I will now turn it back to Marty."

Probably one of the biggest is direct real estate, probably 30% of the pipeline. It continues to be a strong driver. Fixed income generally, across broad Fixed Income, alternative Fixed Income, stable value, is probably another 30%. And then the remainder is split between asset allocation and multi-asset solutions. And then quantitative and regional equities would be others. So it's fairly well diversified and generally high fee. And so when we look at the fee rate of the pipeline, it's actually at one of the highest levels we've ever seen it. It's well above our current net revenue yields for the firm as a whole. And so as these assets come in, it will be accretive to our fee rates, which is great news. Obviously, the negative that we've seen in our fee rate is due to the compression on equities, just given what's happened in the market and then foreign exchange has also had an impact as well. But in terms of the mix overall on the pipeline, the institutional pipeline, we think it's very positive for our fee rates."

I'd say given the volatility, we're probably going to not give any explicit guidance around line items at this stage. There's a lot of work, obviously, that I discussed being done around some of this optimization work, which will have some impacts on those line items as well. Generally, we're working hard to bring expenses down, right? As you can imagine, year-over-year decline in expenses, our compensation generally moves and flexes in line with operating income, so those will be down. Some of the optimization work especially around -- we just mentioned some of the severance will also help bring some of the compensation line down. But the benefits of the optimization work will probably spread across most of the other categories other than marketing explicitly. We're looking at marketing. That's another interesting topic for us. It is one of these conundrums when you're in this market. Your clients want to hear from you and you want to be out with them. But at the same time, it certainly is a discretionary expense, and it's one that we're continuing to look at. So I'd say we're obviously going to be very vigilant to making sure that we manage expenses very smartly in this environment with no presumption of a snapback or some reversal. The other thing I would like to just mention, there is some impact just due to the acquisitions that we discussed in terms of Jemstep and in terms of Religare Asset Management, completing our 100% ownership there. It's absolutely immaterial in terms of the earnings impact, so you don't have to worry about EPS impacts. But it does add probably roughly $15 million of expense and a little bit more in revenue in 2016. So you'll see some of those line items go up just as a result of those acquisitions but offset by, obviously, higher levels of revenues. So we don't want anyone to be surprised by that. The optimization work that we're doing should have a benefit in 2016 that you'll see. So again, we'll quantify that as we get through it. But that will help drive expenses down year-over-year."

We have both of those, and I think that is actually really important if you're going to be successful in solutions. And it's continuing to carry on for us in each of the regions. So the U.S., Asia Pacific, frankly, China in particular, and on the continent in particular. And so we'll just continue to go down that path. And there is growing opportunity in the area. And again, I think it's -- you really have to be a broad-gauged set of offerings to be successful. And that's where we start, and then the overlay of some very talented people that can do the solutions work for the clients."

On the call with me today is Loren Starr, Invesco's CFO, and we'll be speaking from the presentation that's available on the website if you're so inclined to follow. Today, I'll review the business results for the first quarter. Loren will go into greater details on the financials and we'll open it up to questions. But let me begin by highlighting the firm's operating results for the first quarter, which you'll find on Slide 3. 
Long-term investment performance remains strong during the quarter 72% and 76% of active managed assets were ahead of peers on a 3 to 5-year basis, respectively. Strong investment performance and our continued focus on meeting clients needs were not enough to offset the impact of the volatile markets particularly in January and February. Strong institutional and active demand were offset by volatility among retail and passive capabilities, which led to long-term net outflows of $1.3 billion during the quarter. Market volatility and net outflows put pressure on the operating margin during the quarter, which was 37.5%. During the quarter, we returned $238 million of shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. 
In addition, reflecting continued confidence in the fundamentals of our business over the long-term, we are raising our quarterly dividends to $0.28 per share, up 4% from the prior year. Assets under management were $771 billion at the end of the first quarter, down slightly from $775 billion at the end of last year. More indicative of the results during the quarter were the average assets under management, which are down $36 billion [ph] during the first quarter, as compared to $738 billion at year-end. Operating income was $307 million in the quarter versus $356 million in the prior quarter. Earnings per share were $0.49 versus $0.58 in the prior quarter. And as noted earlier, we increased the dividend $0.28 per share. We also purchased 125 million of stock during the quarter. 
Before Loren goes into detail on the company financials, let me take a moment to review the investment performance and flows in the quarter. Turning to Slide 6 now. You'll note investment performance is strong in the quarter with 72% of assets in this top half on a 3-year basis and 76% were on the top half on a 5-year basis. One year results partially reflect the underperformance of energy and financial sectors earlier in the year, which impacted some of our value portfolios. We'd seen both of these sectors beginning to recover somewhat largely in April and consequently, positively impacted the performance year-to-date. In fact, some very strong performance.
On Page 7 you'll see positive active flows were experienced during the quarter were not from passive capabilities. Active flows were driven primarily by alternative capabilities as we saw strong growth in real estate, including both direct and REITs and Global Targeted Return. Both in the passive capabilities declined during the market volatility in January and February, that were covered in March but not enough to return to positive territory for the quarter. It's important to note that although passive flows were negative, they were reduced by $1.5 billion of deleveraging from investor mortgage capital. As a reminder, there's no revenue impact related to those flows. 
Again, we saw strong institutional flows during the quarter, in spite of the volatility which continues a series of positive institutional flows or back nearly 2 years. Line demand trends remain consistent with particular strong interest in fixed income, real estate and GTR. Retail flows were impacted by the macro environment as investors weighed their options during the volatile quarter despite seeing outflows in many equity mutual funds in the U.S. and EMEA. We saw continued strength in retail alternative capabilities specifically GTR or real estate securities. As noted, our global target insurance capability continues to track strong flows globally achieving to $.3 billion in that flows during the quarter, across EMEA institutional and across borders since the U.K., retail, Asia Pacific and North America. 
Despite some challenges in the first 2 months of the year, we feel good about the momentum of our business. Flows in March were much better than January and February, and we experienced solid flows in April. We continue to see strength across our global business and in particular within Asia Pacific and EMEA. 
Before I hand the call over to Loren, let me say a few rules about the fiduciary rule, released by the U.S. Department of Labor in April. Ultimately, we believe the fiduciary role is good for investors. That said, we continue to be concerned about the potential for unintended consequences of a rule that proposes such dramatic changes within the industry. It's well known that many investors aren't saving enough to maintain their standard of living during retirement. That deal house rule is intended to ensure that retirement savers get better advice by expanding the types of retirement investment advice covered by the fiduciary protections. We've said all along investors are best served by using advisors who can help them assist -- help them assess their risk tolerance, savings, and other factors to develop a portfolio that help them achieve their investment objectives. The key outcome of the new rule could be greater confidence in the advice investors are receiving. Investors have been through a lot in the last 7 years since the financial crisis. Anything that build confidence could encourage more for retirement and seek advice that helps them achieve their investment objectives. 
That's good for investors and will also benefit the industry as well. The DOL rule is long and complex. The rule and its related documents were more than 1,000 pages. It's important to understand how are partners are intending -- how are partners are interpreting the rule, which will help us support and assist them. We believe the recent acquisition of Jemstep, a market leader adviser focused digital solutions opens up further opportunities to provide meaningful support to our clients as we engage with our clients and seek to understand how they will approach adopting the new rules we'll look for opportunities for Jemstep to assist our distribution partners. We believe that it's very well positioned to help our clients as the overall rule is implemented because Invesco puts our clients first in everything we do and has transparent experience in addressing topics, we review this as an opportunity to further deepen our relationship, provide new capabilities and enhance our business. I'd like to turn over to Loren to review the financials in more detail"

So quarter-over-quarter, our total AUM decreased $4.1 million or 4.5% and that was driven by dispositions of $3.6 billion, negative market returns of $3 billion, outflows from [indiscernible] of $2.6 billion and long-term net outflows of $1",880,"Thanks, Marty. So quarter-over-quarter, our total AUM decreased $4.1 million or 4.5% and that was driven by dispositions of $3.6 billion, negative market returns of $3 billion, outflows from [indiscernible] of $2.6 billion and long-term net outflows of $1.3 billion. These were partially offset by inflows from the money market of $3.8 million and positive FX translation of $2.6 billion. Our average AUM for the first quarter was $747.5 billion, which was down 4.6% versus the fourth quarter. Our net revenue yield came in at 43.8 basis points and that was a decrease of 1.4 basis points versus Q4. Currency mix reduced the yield by 0.7 basis points, 1 less day in the period reduced the yield by 0.4 basis points, a decrease in performance fees and other revenues together attend and for the remainder of 0.3 basis points. Now I'm going to turn to the operating results. Our net revenues declined by $68 million or 7.7% quarter-over-quarter to $818.1 million, which includes the negative FX rate impact of $12.6 million. Within the net revenue number, you'll see that investment management fees fell by $78.5 million or 7.8% to $930.3 million, this reflects the lower average AUM, the changes in the AUM product and currency mix and 1 less day in the quarter. FX reduced fourth quarter management fees by $16.1 million. 
Service and distribution revenues declined by $9.9 million or 4.8%, reflecting lower average AUM during the quarter. FX decreased service and distribution revenues by $0.2 million. Performance fees came in at $15.5 million in Q1 and they were earned from a variety of different investment capabilities, including $9.1 million from U.K. equities, foreign exchange reduced performance fees by $0.6 million. Other revenues in the first quarter were $24 million. That was a drop of $5 million lower due to lower transaction fees from real estate as well as a decline in UIT rollovers. Foreign exchange decreased revenues by $0.1 million. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expense between net against gross revenues fall by $28.7 million or 0.6% [ph] this movement was in line with lower revenues derived from retail AUM, our [indiscernible] decrease the expenses by $4.4 million. Moving on down the slide, you'll see that our adjusted operating expenses at $511 million decreased by $19.4 million or 3.7% relative to the prior quarter. Foreign exchange decreased operating expenses by $6.5 million during the quarter. Employee compensation came in at $340.3 million, an increase of $1.5 million or 0.4%. This is driven by a normal seasonal increase in payroll taxes, which was largely offset by reduction and variable compensation. FX reduced compensation by $4.3 million. Marketing expense decreased $9.2 million or 26.2% to $25.4 million. The drop was due to a lower level of advertising, literature, travel and client events during the quarter. These expenditures for deferred in light of the volatile market conditions that we're in. Foreign exchange reduced marketing expense by $0.2 million in the quarter. Property office and technology expenses came in at $81.1 million in the quarter, that was an increase of $0.7 million over the fourth quarter, driven by additional outsource administrative expenses. FX decreased these expenses by $0.9 million. 
General and administrative expenses at $64.2 million, decreased $12.2 million or 16.2%, this decline was a result of focused expense management during the quarter as nonessential perceptional services and other nonessential discretionary spending was reduced or postponed. FX decreased G&A by $1.1 million. Continuing on down the slide. You'll see that nonoperating income decreased $2.9 million compared to the fourth quarter. Included in the first quarter were noncash negative marks to -- March markets on each company loans of $7.1 million and $1.4 million on trading investments. These were slightly offset by a $3.4 million gain, which is realized on our pound sterling U.S. dollar hedge. 
Just to remind people as we've done in the past, we haven't placed a hedge through the end of Q1 2017 with a strike price of USD 1.4355. This is a pound that we put in place. The firms effective tax rate on pretax adjusted net income in Q1 was 26.5%. That was down from than 26.6% in the prior quarter, which then brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.49 and adjusted net operating margin of 37.5%. 
Before turning things back to over to Marty, I just want to provide a quick update on the business optimization work that we began to implement in Q4 last year. As a reminder, we -- as we stated, we expect to incur up to $85 million in expenses during 2016 related to these activities with an expected run rate savings, however, of $30 million to $45 million through -- the beginning of 2017. 
In the first quarter, we incurred $6.8 million of the $85 million optimization costs. That was primarily in the form of staff severance cost and as discussed in our expenses do impact our U.S. GAAP P&L and they are being excluded from our non-GAAP results. And also just to finalize the, point. We did generate a profit approximately $2 million in permanent run rate savings in Q1 as a result of the optimization efforts to date, which was in line with our plans. 
And so with that I'm going to turn it over back to Marty."

So I'm not going to put out a number in terms of what I think margins could be. Obviously, the inherent strength of the business is there. And as markets stabilize, currency stabilizes. We should continue to see a very positive trend of incremental margins working in our favor to pull up our overall rate of margin overall. But it will depend ultimately on what the markets do for the rest of the year. We are, as you know, still at the level of assets below where we were our average for last year. And so I'd say we're still catching up to where we were last year in terms of overall margin potential."

So my expectation of performance fees through the remainder of the year as I often said is sort of place March [indiscernible] when we're thinking about our planning and we're around that $5 million a quarter, which is an estimate that assumes a lot of different things kicking in across the globe, but no 1 thing driving it. So I'd say that's one thing. I mean we would hope to see the other revenue line improved somewhat because the volatility in the first quarter was pretty extreme. And so as I mentioned, your transaction fees and real estate rollovers in the UIT business were really slowed down by that degree of volatility. If we get to a more stable, and that's a big if, if we get to a more stable market environment, that line item should be closer to $30 million to $35 million number through each quarter."

It helps the business. It helps the growth of the business and we don't want to defer further expenses for a year, for example. So I think the other thing that we see in the second quarter versus the first quarter would be some of the impact around salary increases and deferred compensation which are typically -- you get a differential of about 2 months worth of impact in the second quarter versus the first quarter and between those 2 items, that's probably somewhere around an increase of $5 million to $6 million. So again, there is some things that we're going to manage and we're going to apply very thoughtful and disciplined approach to our hiring and to our discretionary expense management. But I don't want to sort of give guidance explicitly quarter-over-quarter because just given the volatility of markets and FX, it really becomes quite difficult for us to use for information."

If you have high conviction fundamental and factor-based capabilities like we do, I think your positioned very, very well.

You have better downside capture. We also have better risk-adjusted returns and they think that's really the value position that collectively we need to make clear. It has been a beta run with since '09, largely with lots of government intervention.

So I think we will begin to see recovery of the net revenue yield and particularly as we get to the tap review versus the first half, day count stuff that just happens normally and we always have that benefit of the last half having more days than the first half. So I just want to make people aware of that. It's no secret. In terms of the mix. Obviously, we're having some reduced performance fee expectations coming into Q2 versus what we realize in Q1. Some of that's going to be offset however by higher -- hopefully higher other revenues, which will help move the fee rate up. And I think we also will see a success of our ETF business, the success of our fixed income business. A lot of that is in the pipeline. They lower fee rate so they will be probably some degree of a little bit against the higher fee. The flows that are -- that we have been getting into EMEA and U.S. retail, have been a little bit more subdued. And so that was the -- that can be a driver of fee rate mix. So I'd say that's going to be a little bit of a question mark particularly as we get through all the budget thing and happened in the U.K. that may have some impact it doesn't have any impact on flows per say that we could identify, but it could have some impact on flows. Based on our modeling and our thinking, we expect to see the fee rate drive up through the quarter as you move through the course of the year. And so again I think the positive aliment generally around mix I would say on the institutional pipeline, even despite what I said around fixed income coming in, this -- over all, the fee rate on the products that are coming in far exceeds the fee rate on the products that would be leaving. So again, positive aliment on the fee rate. That's actually also have a big impact to -- I think we saw a pretty big impact on FX in the quarter, 0.7 basis points. And so that's was with the U.K., down 5% quarter-over-quarter of the pound. So again just to understand that they do not mix are probably one of the biggest drivers of fee rates issues. And hopefully that does recover and we get stabilization of the pound."

And so that is going to be a sort of U.S., non-U.S. makes. We think outside the U.S. there's a huge opportunity for the U.S. business and still has a lot of opportunity to grow at a faster rate even in the U.S. side. The UIT business you would hope to see that growth. It's been a very competitive market. And particularly in -- for us it somewhat transactional when people decide to roll their UIT if they do get volatility they're just going to wait and see. So we would want to see sort of a market stabilization which would allow our ability to roll that thing more rapidly or generate more active revenues as well.

With regards the flows, I think what you have to look at how narrow the flows are between the factor base ETFs, and probably from September through the end of February is about as narrow as you've ever seen. And what we're now seeing is what Loren is talking about, why are the flows picking up the way that they are, we're seeing the broadening of we look at this is an important as an organization the field we're absolutely on top of it.

What's tied up in the U.K. subgroup, as we talked about from a regulatory perspective is $651 million. And so sort of the free and clear is that 8 0 4. Q1 is always a very cash need quarter because of taxes and bonus payments. And so we fell below sort of our self-imposed targeting $1 billion, but we're not concerned about that. We're going to continue to be targeting a very healthy capital return in terms of dividends and buybacks as a percentage of our operating cash flow to shareholders. So in terms of our Q1 buyback, which we talked about, that was up 63% versus what we did in Q1 2015. So quite a bit of step up, $125 million but down a little bit versus the fourth quarter due to just generally, the lower operating cash that we are generating now because our asset levels are more affected by what happens in the market. But in terms of the percentage payout, we're sort of in line with what we were thinking about in terms of last year as a percentage of cash flow. But because our overall operating levels have been impacted by markets, the total levels may be somewhat smaller. So again, I think if you look at what we paid out, we'd probably be more in line with $1 million [ph] quarter run rate, which gets us at the same path rate that we have. But with that said, we're going to continue to be very opportunistic as we further impact on stock price at which we think is unwarranted if we get through some of the end understand some of the dynamics there. We feel more able to commit more capital. So again, it's one of those things that we feel very well positioned to return capital, but we are being a little bit cautious just given the volatility in the market right now."

So typically what happens in those downturns, first thing that happens is people stop buying and that's where you get that -- and that's what generates the net.

If they are much more willing and capable of working with the industry to get the right answers, and so again, we'll have to see one by one, so I would say they're going to come, but I would hopefully get to places that are workable and we'll get to a relatively good spot. I will say again though, back to some of the earlier conversations, this does continue to put pressure on -- drive up compliance costs and in a difficult market, it's just very difficult for institutions to -- these are not optional expenses, right? And so if you do compliance costs in cyber, I think that's just being a larger money manager, you're much more -- better placed to be able to deal with those.

On the call with me today is Loren Starr, Invesco's CFO, and we'll be speaking from the presentation that's available on the website if you're so inclined to follow. Today, I'll review the business results for the first quarter. Loren will go into greater details of the financials, and we'll open it up to questions. But let me begin by highlighting the firm's operating results for the first quarter, which you'll find on Slide 3. 
Long-term investment performance remained strong during the quarter, 72% and 76% of active managed assets were ahead of peers on a 3 to 5-year basis, respectively. Strong investment performance and our continued focus on meeting client needs were not enough to offset the impact of the volatile markets, particularly in January and February. Strong institutional and active demand were offset by volatility among retail and passive capabilities, which led to long-term net outflows of $1.3 billion during the quarter. Market volatility and net outflows put pressure on the operating margin during the quarter, which was 37.5%. During the quarter, we've returned $238 million to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. 
In addition, reflecting continued confidence in the fundamentals of our business over the long-term, we are raising our quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share, up 4% from the prior year. Assets under management were $771 billion at the end of the first quarter, down slightly from $775 billion at the end of last year. More indicative of the results during the quarter were the average assets under management, which are down $36 billion during the first quarter as compared to $738 billion at year-end. Operating income was $307 million in the quarter versus $356 million in the prior quarter. Earnings per share was $0.49 versus $0.58 in the prior quarter. And as noted earlier, we increased the dividend $0.28 per share. We also purchased $125 million of stock during the quarter. 
Before Loren goes into detail on the company financials, let me take a moment to review the investment performance and flows during the quarter. Turning to Slide 6 now. You'll note investment performance is strong in the quarter with 72% of assets in the top half on a 3-year basis and 76% were in the top half on a 5-year basis. One-year results partially reflect the underperformance of energy and financial sectors earlier in the year, which impacted some of our value portfolios. We've seen both of these sectors beginning to recover somewhat in March and April and consequently, positively impacted the performance year-to-date. In fact, some very strong performance.
On Page 7, you'll see positive active flows we're experienced during the quarter were not [indiscernible] passive capabilities. Active flows were driven primarily by alternative capabilities as we saw strong growth in real estate, including both direct and REITs and Global Targeted Return. Those in the passive capabilities declined during the market volatility in January and February, they were covered in March but not enough to return to positive territory for the quarter. It's important to note that although passive flows were negative, they were reduced by $1.5 billion of deleveraging from Invesco Mortgage Capital. As a reminder, there's no revenue impact related to those flows. 
Again, we saw strong institutional flows during the quarter in spite of the volatility, which continues a series of positive institutional flows going back nearly 2 years. Client demand demand trends remained consistent, with particular strong interest in fixed income, real estate and GTR. Retail flows were impacted by the macro environment as investors weighed their options during the volatile quarter. Despite seeing outflows in many equity mutual funds in the U.S. and EMEA, we saw continued strength in retail alternative capabilities, specifically GTR real estate securities. As noted, our Global Targeted Return capability continues to attract strong flows globally, achieving $2.3 billion in net flows during the quarter across EMEA institutional and cross-border. It's the U.K. retail, Asia Pacific and North America. 
Despite some challenges in the first 2 months of the year, we feel good about the momentum of our business. Flows in March were much better than January and February, and we're experiencing solid flows in April. We continue to see strength across our global business and in particular within Asia Pacific and EMEA. 
Before I hand the call over to Loren, let me say a few words about the new fiduciary rule released by the U.S. Department of Labor in early April. Ultimately, we believe the fiduciary rule is good for investors. That said, we continue to be concerned about the potential for unintended consequences of the rule that proposes such dramatic changes within the industry. It's well known that many investors aren't saving enough to maintain the standard of living during retirement. The DOL's rule is intended to ensure the retirement savers get better advice by expanding the types of retirement investment advice covered by the fiduciary protections. We said all along investors are best served by using advisers who can help them assist -- help them assess their risk tolerance, savings horizons and other factors to develop a portfolio that help them achieve their investment objectives. The key outcome of the new rule could be greater confidence in the advice investors are receiving. Investors have been through a lot in the last 7 years since the financial crisis. Anything that builds confidence could encourage them to save more for retirement and seek advice that helps them achieve their investment objectives. 
That's good for investors and will also benefit the industry as well. The DOL rule is long and complex. The rule and its related documents are more than 1,000 pages. We're working to understand how our distributor partners are intending -- how our partners are interpreting the rule, which will help us support and assist them. We believe the recent acquisition of Jemstep, a market-leading provider of adviser-focused digital solutions opens up further opportunities to provide meaningful support to our clients as we engage with our clients and seek to understand how they will approach adopting the new rules. We'll look for opportunities for Jemstep to assist our distribution partners. We believe Invesco is very well positioned to help our clients as the DOL rule is implemented, because Invesco puts our clients first in everything we do and has tremendous experience in addressing regulatory topics. We review this as an opportunity to further deepen our relationship, provide new capabilities and enhance our business. I'd like to turn it over to Loren to review the financials in more detail."
384779,331142570,968378,"Invesco Ltd., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Invesco Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Marty. So quarter-over-quarter, our total AUM decreased $4.1 million or 0.5% and that was driven by dispositions of $3.6 billion, negative market returns of $3 billion, outflows from the QQQs [ph] of $2.6 billion and long-term net outflows of $1.3",882,"Thanks, Marty. So quarter-over-quarter, our total AUM decreased $4.1 million or 0.5% and that was driven by dispositions of $3.6 billion, negative market returns of $3 billion, outflows from the QQQs [ph] of $2.6 billion and long-term net outflows of $1.3 billion. These were partially offset by inflows from the money market of $3.8 million and positive FX translation of $2.6 billion. Our average AUM for the first quarter was $747.5 billion, which was down 4.6% versus the fourth quarter. Our net revenue yield came in at 43.8 basis points and that was a decrease of 1.4 basis points versus Q4. Currency mix reduced the yield by 0.7 basis points, 1 less day in the period reduced the yield by 0.4 basis points. A decrease in performance fees and other revenues together accounted for the remainder of 0.3 basis points. Now I'm going to turn to the operating results. Our net revenues declined by $68 million or 7.7% quarter-over-quarter to $818.1 million, which includes the negative FX rate impact of $12.6 million. Within the net revenue number, you'll see the investment management fees fell by $78.5 million or 7.8% to $930.3 million. This reflects the lower average AUM, the changes in the AUM product and currency mix and 1 less day during the quarter. FX reduced fourth quarter management fees by $16.1 million. 
Service and distribution revenues declined by $9.9 million or 4.8%, reflecting lower average AUM during the quarter. FX decreased service and distribution revenues by $0.2 million. Performance fees came in at $15.5 million in Q1 and they were earned from a variety of different investment capabilities, including $9.1 million from U.K. equities. Foreign exchange reduced performance fees by $0.6 million. Other revenues in the first quarter were $24 million. That was a drop of $5 million lower due to lower transaction fees from real estate as well as a decline in UIT rollovers. Foreign exchange decreased revenues by $0.1 million. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expense which we net against gross revenues fell by $28.7 million or 7.6% and this movement was in line with lower revenues derived from retail AUM. Foreign exchange decreased these expenses by $4.4 million.
Moving on down the slide, you'll see that our adjusted operating expenses at $511 million, decreased by $19.4 million or 3.7% relative to the prior quarter. Foreign exchange decreased operating expenses by $6.5 million during the quarter. Employee compensation came in at $340.3 million, an increase of $1.5 million or 0.4%. This is driven by a normal seasonal increase in payroll taxes, which was largely offset by a reduction in variable compensation. FX reduced compensation by $4.3 million. Marketing expense decreased $9.2 million or 26.2% to $25.4 million. The drop was due to a lower level of advertising, literature, travel and client events during the quarter. These expenditures were deferred in light of the volatile market conditions that we're in. Foreign exchange reduced marketing expense by $0.2 million in the quarter. Property office and technology expenses came in at $81.1 million in the quarter, that was an increase of $0.7 million over the fourth quarter, driven by additional outsource administrative expenses. FX decreased these expenses by $0.9 million. 
General and administrative expenses at $64.2 million, decreased $12.4 million or 16.2%. This decline was a result of focused expense management during the quarter as nonessential professional services and other nonessential discretionary spending was reduced or postponed. FX decreased G&A by $1.1 million. Continuing on down the slide. You'll see that nonoperating income decreased $2.9 million compared to the fourth quarter. Included in the first quarter were noncash negative marks to March markets on intercompany loans of $7.1 million and $1.4 million on trading investments. These were slightly offset by a $3.4 million gain, which is realized on our pound sterling-U.S. dollar hedge. 
Just to remind people, as we've said in the past, we haven't placed a hedge through the end of Q1 2017 with a strike price of USD 1.4355. This was the pound hedge that we put in place. The firm's effective tax rate on pretax adjusted net income in Q1 was 26.5%. That was down from 26.6% in the prior quarter, which then brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.49 and adjusted net operating margin of 37.5%. 
Before turning things back to over to Marty, I just want to provide a quick update on the business optimization work that we began to implement in Q4 last year. As a reminder, we -- as we stated, we expect to incur up to $85 million in expenses during 2016 related to these activities with an expected run rate savings, however, of $30 million to $45 million through -- at the beginning of 2017. 
In the first quarter, we incurred $6.8 million of the $85 million optimization costs. That was primarily in the form of staff severance cost and as previously discussed, these expenses do impact our U.S. GAAP P&L, but they are being excluded from our non-GAAP results. And also just to finalize the point, we did generate a profit of approximately $2 million in permanent run rate savings in Q1 as a result of the optimization efforts to date, which was in line with our plan. 
And so with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Marty."

Obviously, there is a lot of moving parts, lot of volatility. We got the pound and currency topics, which can -- have been bouncing around a little bit. So I'm not going to put out a number in terms of what I think margins could be. Obviously, the inherent strength of the business is there. And as markets stabilize, currency stabilizes. We should continue to see the very positive trend of incremental margins working in our favor to pull up our overall rate of, sort of, margin overall. But it will depend ultimately on what the markets do for the rest of the year. We are, as you know, still at the level of assets below where we were on average for last year. And so I'd say we're still catching up to where we were last year in terms of overall margin potential."

So my expectation of performance fees through the remainder of the year, as I often said, is sort of place marked, earmarked when we're thinking about our planning somewhere around that $5 million a quarter, which is an estimate that assumes a lot of different things kicking in across the globe, but no 1 thing driving it. So I'd say that's one thing. I mean we would hope to see the other revenue line improved somewhat because the volatility in the first quarter was pretty extreme. And then so, as I mentioned, the transaction fees in real estate rollovers in the UIT business were really slowed down by that degree of volatility. If we get to a more stable, and that's a big if, if we get to a more stable market environment, that line item should be closer to $30 million to $35 million number through each quarter."

Some of that you can defer for a reasonable period of time. Some of that you can't defer for forever. And so we do have some seasonal cost related to marketing that will be little bit heavier in the first and the fourth quarters as they always are. And so I think it's just good to know that we want to continue to be present and continue to be able to work with our clients and have client events as we've always had. That's important. It helps the business. It helps the growth of the business. And we don't want to defer those expenses for a year, for example. So I think the other thing that we see in the second quarter versus the first quarter would be some of the impacts around salary increases and deferred compensation, which are typically -- you get a differential of about 2 months worth of impact in the second quarter versus the first quarter and between those 2 items that's probably somewhere around an increase of $5 million to $6 million.

And so at that level, the notion of fiduciary rule and having better outcomes for end clients, that's a great thing. I think we're all supportive of it, but it's really the magnitude of what has been included in the rule way beyond that notion. And what we learned with RDR, and it's just an absolute fact, there are more on advised individuals because of RDR right now and probably the individuals that need advice the most and the totality of the costs have gone up. And I think that's a really bad outcome. And I think there is a lot of -- you could see that happening here. That said, what are the lessons learned that we had from that is, be aware of that.

If you have high conviction fundamental and factor-based capabilities like we do, I think you're positioned very, very well. And if -- again, if you look at the work that we've done, when you look at high conviction actives, you do get better returns through market cycles, but it's not just excess return. You have better downside capture. You also have better risk-adjusted returns and I think that's really the value proposition that collectively we need to make clear. It has been a beta run with since '09, largely with lots of government intervention. And you start to look at quarters like where all of a sudden, you're seeing active managers outperform the S&P by 300, 350 basis points, that's pretty impressive. So again, I think you have to have high conviction fundamental, and the factor base, we believe very, very strongly in the combination thereof.

So I think we will begin to see recovery of the net revenue yield and particularly as we get into the last half of the year versus the first half, there is some day count stuff that just happens normally. And we always have that benefit of the last h",430,"Yes. So I think we will begin to see recovery of the net revenue yield and particularly as we get into the last half of the year versus the first half, there is some day count stuff that just happens normally. And we always have that benefit of the last half having more days than the first half. So I just want to make people aware of that. It's no secret. In terms of the mix, obviously, we're having some reduced performance fee expectations coming into Q2 versus what we realized in Q1. Some of that's going to be offset, however, by higher -- hopefully higher other revenues, which will help move the fee rate up. And I think we also will see a success of our ETF business, success of our fixed income business. A lot of that is in the pipeline. They tend to have lower fee rate so there will be probably some degree of mix issue that's working a little bit against the higher fee. The flows that are -- that we have been getting into EMEA and U.S. retail, have been a little bit more subdued, and so that was -- it can be a driver of fee rate mix and so I'd say that's going to be a little bit of a question mark, particularly as we get through the whole Brexit thing and understanding what happened in the U.K. that may have some impact we don't know. It hasn't had any impact on flows per se that we could identify yet, but it could have some impact on flows. Based on our modeling and our thinking, we expect to see the fee rate drive up further each quarter as we move through the course of the year. And so again, I think the positive element's generally around mix still exists and I would say that on the institutional pipeline, even despite what I said around fixed income coming in, overall, the fee rate on the products that are coming in far exceeds the fee rate on the products that would be leaving. So again, a positive element on the fee rate. FX will also have a big impact too and I think we saw a pretty big impact on FX in the quarter, 0.7 basis points. And so that's was with U.K. down 5% quarter-over-quarter, the pound. So again just to understand that those dynamics are probably one of the big drivers of fee rates issues. And hopefully, that does recover as we get to Brexit and we get stabilization of the pound."

Generally, our real state business has been growing well and so that will, as a team, help allow that line item to grow. And I'd say particularly as being a success in Europe and Asia, that's where a lot of the funds actually do have transaction fees and that work in the U.S., some of the products that are managed by our real estate team don't, actually aren't able to generate transaction fees. And so that is going to be sort of a U.S., non-U.S. mix. So we think outside the U.S. is a huge opportunity for the real estate business and still has a lot of opportunity to grow at a faster rate, even in the U.S. side. The UIT business, we would hope to see that grow. It's been a very competitive market and particularly in -- because it's somewhat transactional, when people decide to roll their UITs, if you do get volatility, they're just going to wait and see. And so we would want to see sort of a market stabilization which would allow our ability to roll those things more rapidly and generate more other revenues as well. But I mean, we think that the UIT business has a lot of opportunity to grow, and so we would expect to see between those elements, that other line item grow. Again, on an organic growth basis, we should be able to grow in that 3% to 5% level that we talked about before."

With regard to the flows, I think what you have to look at is how narrow the flows were within the factor base ETFs. And probably from September through the end of February, it's about as narrow as you've ever seen. And what we're now seeing, as Loren was talking about, why are the flows picking up the way that they are. We're seeing a broadening of interest in the range of capabilities that we have.

What is tied -- I'm sorry, billion so $1.45 billion. What's tied up in the U.K. subgroup as we've talked about from a regulatory perspective is the $651 million. And so sort of the free and clear is that 8 0 4. Q1 is always a very heavy cash need quarter because of taxes and bonus payments, so we fell below sort of our self-imposed sort of target of $1 billion, but we're not concerned about that. We're still going to continue to be targeting a very healthy capital return in terms of dividends and buybacks as a percentage of our operating cash flow to shareholders. So in terms of our Q1 buyback, which we talked, I mean, that was up 63% versus what we did in Q1 in 2015, so quite a bit of step up, $125 million. But down a little bit versus the fourth quarter due to just generally, the lower operating cash that we are generating now because our asset levels are more affected by what happens in the market. But in terms of the percentage payout, we're sort of in line with what we were thinking about in terms of last year as a percentage of cash flow. But because our overall operating levels have been impacted by markets, the total levels may be somewhat smaller. So again, I think if you look at what we paid out, I mean, it's probably more in line with an $18 million [ph] quarter run rate which gets us at that same payout rate that we didn't have. But with that said, we're going to continue to be very opportunistic as we see further impact on stock price which we think is unwarranted. If we get through some of the Brexit and understanding dynamics there. We may feel more able to commit more capital. So again, it's one of these things that we feel very well positioned to return capital, but we are being a little bit cautious, just given the volatility in the market right now."

Probably, hopefully, comp will actually be flat-to-up with the benefit of higher asset levels, end markets driving incentive compensation ahead."

And if we have markets that's helping us to grow and FX I would say as well, incremental margins could be much higher to 65%. So we would hope to see, as Marty had talked about, our operating leverage begin to work in our favor as opposed to work against us as assets are recovering. And we absolutely will see that happening, particularly as we've managed to maintain a fairly tight control on the expense side. So that would be our hope, is to get ourselves back to that 40%. And hopefully this year, just through organic growth and expense management. If we have market on top of that, we should be able to do better than that. So there's nothing that stopped us from generating very strong operating leverage on the plus side if we have positive markets, plus FX, plus organic growth working in our favor."

Then with regards to the various SEC proposals, my view is the indications, I would say, is that the SEC absolutely wants to get them done, they also absolutely want to get them right and they are much more willing and capable of working with the industry to get the right answers. And so again, we'll have to see it one by one and so I would say they're going to come, but I'd say they'll hopefully get to places that are workable, and we'll get to a relatively good spot. I will say again though, back to some of the earlier conversations, this does continue to put pressure on -- while it doesn't drive up compliance costs and in a difficult market, it's just very difficult for institutions to -- these are not optional expenses, right?

On the call with me today is Loren Starr, Invesco's CFO, and we'll be speaking from the presentation that's available on the website if you're so inclined to follow. Today, I'll review the business results for the first quarter. Loren will go into greater details of the financials, and we'll open it up to questions. But let me begin by highlighting the firm's operating results for the first quarter, which you'll find on Slide 3. 
Long-term investment performance remained strong during the quarter, 72% and 76% of active managed assets were ahead of peers on a 3 to 5-year basis, respectively. Strong investment performance and our continued focus on meeting client needs were not enough to offset the impact of the volatile markets, particularly in January and February. Strong institutional and active demand were offset by volatility among retail and passive capabilities, which led to long-term net outflows of $1.3 billion during the quarter. Market volatility and net outflows put pressure on the operating margin during the quarter, which was 37.5%. During the quarter, we returned $238 million to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. 
In addition, reflecting continued confidence in the fundamentals of our business over the long-term, we are raising our quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share, up 4% from the prior year. Assets under management were $771 billion at the end of the first quarter, down slightly from $775 billion at the end of last year. More indicative of the results during the quarter were the average assets under management, which are down $36 billion during the first quarter as compared to $778 billion at year-end. Operating income was $307 million in the quarter versus $356 million in the prior quarter. Earnings per share were $0.49 versus $0.58 in the prior quarter. And as noted earlier, we increased the dividend $0.28 per share. We also purchased $125 million of stock during the quarter. 
Before Loren goes into detail on the company financials, let me take a moment to review the investment performance and flows during the quarter. Turning to Slide 6 now. You'll note investment performance is strong in the quarter with 72% of assets in the top half on a 3-year basis and 76% were in the top half on a 5-year basis. One-year results partially reflect the underperformance of energy and financial sectors earlier in the year, which impacted some of our value portfolios. We've seen both of these sectors beginning to recover somewhat in March and April and consequently, positively impacted the performance year-to-date. In fact, with some very strong performance.
On Page 7, you'll see positive active flows were experienced during the quarter were not [indiscernible] passive capabilities. Active flows were driven primarily by alternative capabilities as we saw strong growth in real estate, including both direct and REITs and Global Targeted Return. Those in the passive capabilities declined during the market volatility in January and February, they recovered in March but not enough to return to positive territory for the quarter. It's important to note that although passive flows were negative, they were reduced by $1.5 billion of deleveraging from Invesco Mortgage Capital. As a reminder, there's no revenue impact related to those flows. 
Again, we saw strong institutional flows during the quarter in spite of the volatility, which continues a series of positive institutional flows going back nearly 2 years. Client demand trends remain consistent, with particular strong interest in fixed income, real estate and GTR. Retail flows were impacted by the macro environment as investors weighed their options during the volatile quarter. Despite seeing outflows in many equity mutual funds in the U.S. and EMEA, we saw continued strength in retail alternative capabilities, specifically GTR real estate securities. As noted, our Global Targeted Return capability continues to attract strong flows globally, achieving $2.3 billion in net flows during the quarter across EMEA institutional and cross-border. It's the U.K., retail, Asia Pacific and North America. 
Despite some challenges in the first 2 months of the year, we feel good about the momentum of our business. Flows in March were much better than January and February, and we're experiencing solid flows in April. We continue to see strength across our global business and in particular within Asia Pacific and EMEA. 
Before I hand the call over to Loren, let me say a few words about the new fiduciary rule released by the U.S. Department of Labor in early April. Ultimately, we believe the fiduciary rule is good for investors. That said, we continue to be concerned about the potential for unintended consequences of the rule that proposes such dramatic changes within the industry. It's well known that many investors aren't saving enough to maintain their standard of living during retirement. The DOL's rule is intended to ensure the retirement savers get better advice by expanding the types of retirement investment advice covered by the fiduciary protections. We’ve said all along investors are best served by using advisers who can help them assist -- help them assess their risk tolerance, savings horizons and other factors to develop a portfolio that help them achieve their investment objectives. The key outcome of the new rule could be greater confidence in the advice investors are receiving. Investors have been through a lot in the last 7 years since the financial crisis. Anything that builds confidence could encourage them to save more for retirement and seek advice that helps them achieve their investment objectives. 
That's good for investors and will also benefit the industry as well. The DOL rule is long and complex. The rule and its related documents are more than 1,000 pages. We're working to understand how our distributor partners are intending -- how our partners are interpreting the rule, which will help us support and assist them. We believe the recent acquisition of Jemstep, a market-leading provider of adviser-focused digital solutions, opens up further opportunities to provide meaningful support to our clients as we engage with our clients and seek to understand how they will approach adopting the new rules. We'll look for opportunities for Jemstep to assist our distribution partners. We believe Invesco is very well positioned to help our clients as the DOL rule is implemented, because Invesco puts our clients first in everything we do and has tremendous experience in addressing regulatory topics. We review this as an opportunity to further deepen our relationship, provide new capabilities and enhance our business. I'd like to turn it over to Loren to review the financials in more detail."
384779,331142570,968452,"Invesco Ltd., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Invesco Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Marty. So quarter-over-quarter, our total AUM decreased $4.1 million or 0.5% and that was driven by dispositions of $3.6 billion, negative market returns of $3 billion, outflows from the QQQs of $2.6 billion and long-term net outflows of $1.3 bill",882,"Thanks, Marty. So quarter-over-quarter, our total AUM decreased $4.1 million or 0.5% and that was driven by dispositions of $3.6 billion, negative market returns of $3 billion, outflows from the QQQs of $2.6 billion and long-term net outflows of $1.3 billion. These were partially offset by inflows from the money market of $3.8 million and positive FX translation of $2.6 billion. Our average AUM for the first quarter was $747.5 billion, which was down 4.6% versus the fourth quarter. Our net revenue yield came in at 43.8 basis points and that was a decrease of 1.4 basis points versus Q4. Currency mix reduced the yield by 0.7 basis points, 1 less day in the period reduced the yield by 0.4 basis points. A decrease in performance fees and other revenues together accounted for the remainder of 0.3 basis points. 
Now I'm going to turn to the operating results. Our net revenues declined by $68 million or 7.7% quarter-over-quarter to $818.1 million, which includes the negative FX rate impact of $12.6 million. Within the net revenue number, you'll see the investment management fees fell by $78.5 million or 7.8% to $930.3 million. This reflects the lower average AUM, the changes in the AUM product and currency mix and 1 less day during the quarter. FX reduced fourth quarter management fees by $16.1 million. 
Service and distribution revenues declined by $9.9 million or 4.8%, reflecting lower average AUM during the quarter. FX decreased service and distribution revenues by $0.2 million. Performance fees came in at $15.5 million in Q1 and they were earned from a variety of different investment capabilities, including $9.1 million from U.K. equities. Foreign exchange reduced performance fees by $0.6 million. Other revenues in the first quarter were $24 million. That was a drop of $5 million lower due to lower transaction fees from real estate as well as a decline in UIT rollovers. Foreign exchange decreased revenues by $0.1 million. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues fell by $28.7 million or 7.6% and this movement was in line with lower revenues derived from retail AUM. Foreign exchange decreased these expenses by $4.4 million.
Moving on down the slide, you'll see that our adjusted operating expenses at $511 million, decreased by $19.4 million or 3.7% relative to the prior quarter. Foreign exchange decreased operating expenses by $6.5 million during the quarter. Employee compensation came in at $340.3 million, an increase of $1.5 million or 0.4%. This is driven by a normal seasonal increase in payroll taxes, which was largely offset by a reduction in variable compensation. FX reduced compensation by $4.3 million. Marketing expense decreased $9.2 million or 26.2% to $25.4 million. The drop was due to a lower level of advertising, literature, travel and client events during the quarter. These expenditures were deferred in light of the volatile market conditions that we were in. Foreign exchange reduced marketing expense by $0.2 million in the quarter. Property, office and technology expenses came in at $81.1 million in the quarter, that was an increase of $0.7 million over the fourth quarter, driven by additional outsource administrative expenses. FX decreased these expenses by $0.9 million. 
General and administrative expenses at $64.2 million, decreased $12.4 million or 16.2%. This decline was a result of focused expense management during the quarter as nonessential professional services and other nonessential discretionary spending was reduced or postponed. FX decreased G&A by $1.1 million. Continuing on down the slide. You'll see that nonoperating income decreased $2.9 million compared to the fourth quarter. Included in the first quarter were noncash negative marks to March markets on intercompany loans of $7.1 million and $1.4 million on trading investments. These were slightly offset by a $3.4 million gain, which is realized on our pound sterling-U.S. dollar hedge. 
Just to remind people, as we've said in the past, we haven't placed a hedge through the end of Q1 2017 with a strike price of USD 1.4355. This was the pound hedge that we put in place. The firm's effective tax rate on pretax adjusted net income in Q1 was 26.5%. That was down from 26.6% in the prior quarter, which then brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.49 and adjusted net operating margin of 37.5%. 
Before turning things back to over to Marty, I just want to provide a quick update on the business optimization work that we began to implement in Q4 last year. As a reminder, we -- as we stated, we expect to incur up to $85 million in expenses during 2016 related to these activities with an expected run rate savings, however, of $30 million to $45 million through -- at the beginning of 2017. 
In the first quarter, we incurred $6.8 million of the $85 million optimization costs. That was primarily in the form of staff severance costs and as previously discussed, these expenses do impact our U.S. GAAP P&L, but they are being excluded from our non-GAAP results. And also just to finalize the point, we did generate a profit of approximately $2 million in permanent run rate savings in Q1 as a result of the optimization efforts to date, which was in line with our plan. 
And so with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Marty."

Obviously, there is a lot of moving parts, lot of volatility. We got the pound and currency topics, which can -- have been bouncing around a little bit. So I'm not going to put out a number in terms of what I think margins could be. Obviously, the inherent strength of the business is there. And as markets stabilize, currency stabilizes. We should continue to see the very positive trend of incremental margins working in our favor to pull up our overall rate of, sort of, margin overall. But it will depend ultimately on what the markets do for the rest of the year. We are, as you know, still at the level of assets below where we were on average for last year. And so I'd say we're still catching up to where we were last year in terms of overall margin potential."

So you get to one of my favorite topics, Glenn, and predicting performance fees, which again, I will continue to profess, I'm not very able to do that. Generally, our performance fees are lighter through the last half of the year. They're the heaviest in the first quarter and so you sort of see the heavy performance fee quarter already. So my expectation of performance fees through the remainder of the year, as I have often said, is sort of place marked, earmarked when we're thinking about our planning somewhere around that $5 million a quarter, which is an estimate that assumes a lot of different things kicking in across the globe, but no 1 thing driving it. So I'd say that's one thing. I mean we would hope to see the other revenue line improved somewhat because the volatility in the first quarter was pretty extreme. And then so, as I mentioned, the transaction fees in real estate, rollovers in the UIT business were really slowed down by that degree of volatility. If we get to a more stable, and that's a big if, if we get to a more stable market environment, that line item should be closer to that $30 million to $35 million number through each quarter."

But it certainly -- I mean, there's work that we can do and we have done in the first quarter and we're going to continue to do through the rest of the year in terms of trying to manage our discretionary expenses to lower levels. Some of that you can defer for a reasonable period of time. Some of that you can't defer for forever. And so we do have some seasonal costs related to marketing that will be a little bit heavier in the first and the fourth quarters as they always are. And so I think it's just good to know that we want to continue to be present and then continue to be able to work with our clients and have client events as we've always had. That's important. It helps the business. It helps the growth of the business. And we don't want to defer those expenses for a year, for example. So I think the other thing that we see in the second quarter versus the first quarter would be some of the impacts around salary increases and deferred compensation, which are typically -- you get a differential of about 2 months’ worth of impact in the second quarter versus the first quarter and between those 2 items that's probably somewhere around an increase of $5 million to $6 million. So again, there are some things that we're going to manage and we're going to continue to apply a very thoughtful and disciplined approach to our hiring and to our discretionary expense management. But I don't want to sort of give guidance explicitly quarter-over-quarter, also because just given the volatility of markets and FX, it really becomes quite difficult for us to give some useful information."

I will say we are in that season where -- that's today what the flows are. This is a month where there is all that rebalancing throughout the industry. So we don't have line of sight -- who knows what happens between now and the rest of the week, right? So it could be a little noiseful, but I will tell you that the quarter, if it stays on this path, will be a good quarter. But it could look a little noisy month-to-month just because of all the industry sort of rebalancing, which is pretty typical and will not be unique to us.

And being good fiduciaries is a critical thing and putting clients first is absolutely essential. And being the industry of trust matters a lot. And so at that level, the notion of fiduciary rule and having better outcomes for end clients, that's a great thing. I think we're all supportive of it, but it's really the magnitude of what has been included in the rule way beyond that notion. And what we learned with RDR, and it's just an absolute fact, there are more unadvised individuals because of RDR right now and they’re probably the individuals that need advice the most and the totality of the costs have gone up. And I think that's a really bad outcome. And I think there is a lot of -- you could see that happening here. That said, so what are the lessons learned that we had from that is, be aware of that. We also see that's also why we went down the Jemstep route. The root of it is something that we know we can help our clients with tools like this, make it -- advice more accessible for those that could be hurt frankly from this rule. And again, that's not the intent of the rule, that's what we think is possible and also very importantly how we position the firm. And I think this is what's being missed in the conversation. What money managers are going to do well and who might be challenged? If you're an index hugger, active management, I'd say you're in trouble. If you have high conviction fundamental and factor-based capabilities like we do, I think you're positioned very, very well. And if -- again, if you look at the work that we've done, when you look at high conviction actives, you do get better returns through market cycles, but it's not just excess return. You have better downside capture. You also have better risk-adjusted returns and I think that's really the value proposition that collectively we need to make clear. It has been a beta run with -- since '09, largely with lots of government intervention. And you start to look at quarters like where all of a sudden, you're seeing active managers outperform the S&P by 300, 350 basis points, that's pretty impressive. So again, I think you have to have a high conviction fundamental, and the factor base, we believe very, very strongly in the combination thereof. We think positions us very well and much of that would, as you would say, come out of some of the lessons learned, we learned out of the U.K. Sorry, it's a bit long-winded but."

So it really came back strongly. And as I indicated, it's continuing strong into April. The passive category that we show, Marty mentioned it, I mean got very much affected by the deleveraging of IVR. So it really is not [indiscernible] noise in our numbers because the deleveraging has no impact on revenues and even though we count it as an outflow, it’s just really part of how they're managing that [indiscernible]. So I wouldn't read too much into the first quarter passive outflow story. Really just understanding that, we do believe that our ETF's business is very well positioned. It is gaining momentum. It is the most diversified set of smart beta offerings, and we are gaining share in smart beta year-to-date. So we feel very confident about our ability to continue to grow that business."

So I think we will begin to see recovery of the net revenue yield and particularly as we get into the last half of the year versus the first half, there is some day count stuff that just happens normally. And we always have that benefit of the last half having more days than the first half. So I just want to make people aware of that. It's no secret. In terms of the mix, obviously, we're having some reduced performance fee expectations coming into Q2 versus what we realized in Q1. Some of that's going to be offset, however, by higher -- hopefully higher other revenues, which will help move the fee rate up. And I think we also will see a success of our ETF business, success of our fixed income business. A lot of that is in the pipeline. They tend to have lower fee rates so there will be probably some degree of mix issue that's working a little bit against the higher fee. The flows that are -- that we have been getting into EMEA and U.S. retail, have been a little bit more subdued, and so that was -- it can be a driver of fee rate mix and so I'd say that's going to be a little bit of a question mark, particularly as we get through the whole Brexit thing and understanding what happened in the U.K., that may have some impact we don't know. It hasn't had any impact on flows per se that we could identify yet, but it could have some impact on flows. Based on our modeling and our thinking, we expect to see the fee rate drive up further each quarter as we move through the course of the year. And so again, I think the positive elements generally around mix still exist and I wouldn’t say that on the institutional pipeline, even despite what I said around fixed income coming in. Overall, the fee rate on the products that are coming in far exceed the fee rate on the products that would be leaving. So again, a positive element on the fee rate. FX will also have a big impact too and I think we saw a pretty big impact on FX in the quarter, 0.7 basis points. And so that was with U.K. down 5% quarter-over-quarter, the pound. So again just to understand that those dynamics are probably one of the big drivers of fee rate issues. And hopefully, that does recover as we get through Brexit and we get stabilization of the pound."

Generally, our real estate business has been growing well and so that will, as a team, help allow that line item to grow. And I'd say particularly as it’s seen success in Europe and Asia, that's where a lot of the funds actually do have transaction fees and that work in the U.S. Some of the products that are managed by our real estate team don't, actually aren't able to generate transaction fees. And so that is going to be sort of a U.S., non-U.S. mix. But we think outside the U.S. is a huge opportunity for the real estate business and still has a lot of opportunity to grow at a faster rate, even in the U.S. side. The UIT business, we would hope to see that grow. It's been a very competitive market and particularly in -- because it's somewhat transactional, when people decide to roll their UITs, if you do get volatility, they're just going to wait and see. And so we would want to see sort of a market stabilization, which would allow our ability to roll those things more rapidly and generate more other revenues as well. But I mean, we think that the UIT business has a lot of opportunity to grow, and so we would expect to see between those 2 elements, that other line item grow.

What is tied -- I'm sorry, billion so $1.455 billion. What's tied up in the U.K. subgroup as we've talked about from a regulatory perspective is $651 million. And so sort of the free and clear is that $804 million. Q1 is always a very heavy cash-need quarter because of taxes and bonus payments, so we fell below sort of our self-imposed sort of target of $1 billion, but we're not concerned about that. We're still going to continue to be targeting a very healthy capital return in terms of dividends and buybacks as a percentage of our operating cash flow to shareholders. So in terms of our Q1 buyback, which we talked, I mean, that was up 63% versus what we did in Q1 in 2015, so quite a bit of step up, $125 million. But down a little bit versus the fourth quarter due to just generally, the lower operating cash that we are generating now because our asset levels are more affected by what happens in the market. But in terms of the percentage payout, we're sort of in line with what we were thinking about in terms of last year as a percentage of cash flow. But because our overall operating levels have been impacted by markets, the total levels may be somewhat smaller. So again, I think if you look at what we paid out, I mean, it's probably more in line with an $80 million quarter run rate, which gets us at that same payout rate that you’ve seen in the past. But with that said, we're going to continue to be very opportunistic as we see further impact on stock price, which we think is unwarranted. If we get through some of the Brexit and understand the dynamics there, we may feel more able to commit more capital. So again, it's one of these things that we feel very well positioned to return capital, but we are being a little bit cautious, just given the volatility in the market right now."

I think it's a couple billion dollars of some assets that we think could sort of get caught up in the crosshairs. But again, it's just scenario planning, so the exposure’s high. So from that point of view, we're very well placed. The issue is if it is an outvote, it is going to be -- the stated time is mid-'18 that they’d still be a part of the EU. I'd say most people that are very involved in this would tell you the likelihood of trade agreements and the likelihood it takes longer than that. It's just hard to assess what the psychological impact on investors would be. That said, we just think relatively, we're very well -placed to deal with it as it goes through.

And then because we have a very diversified set of offerings, some are entirely active, others are on the more passive side. And so depending on the market that we're in, we should be able to grow at a more I think, modest rate but still very good rate of that 3% of 5%. And it could be in certain of those market scenarios where active is an outflow and we're winning on the passive side. That's not going to be every market but it certainly has been a current market where we're seeing the interest in passive being at a higher level than some of the active offerings. But again, you've seen our active and passive both actually succeeding in this environment."

So typically, what happens in those downturns is the first thing that happens is people stop buying and that's where you get that and that's what generates the net. So you're actually starting to see gross flows -- gross sales pick up, which is a very important indicator, I would say, of sort of sentiment. Then with regards to the various SEC proposals, my view is the indications, I would say, is that the SEC absolutely wants to get them done, they also absolutely want to get them right and they are much more willing and capable of working with the industry to get the right answers. And so again, we'll have to see it one by one and so I would say they're going to come, but I'd say they'll hopefully get to places that are workable, and will get to a relatively good spot. I will say again though, back to some of the earlier conversations, this does continue to put pressure on -- all it does is drive up compliance costs and in a difficult market, it's just very difficult for institutions to -- these are not optional expenses, right? And so you do compliance costs in cyber and I think that just being a larger money manager and you're much more -- in a better place to be able to deal with those. So again, that’s going to be a continued dynamic, I would say, in the industry."

On the call with me today is Loren Starr, Invesco's CFO, and we'll be speaking from the presentation that's available on the website if you're so inclined to follow. Today, I'll review the business results for the first quarter. Loren will go into greater details of the financials, and we'll open it up to questions. But let me begin by highlighting the firm's operating results for the first quarter, which you'll find on Slide 3. 
Long-term investment performance remained strong during the quarter, 72% and 76% of active managed assets were ahead of peers on a 3 to 5-year basis, respectively. Strong investment performance and our continued focus on meeting client needs were not enough to offset the impact of the volatile markets, particularly in January and February. Strong institutional and active demand were offset by volatility among retail and passive capabilities, which led to long-term net outflows of $1.3 billion during the quarter. Market volatility and net outflows put pressure on the operating margin during the quarter, which was 37.5%. During the quarter, we returned $238 million to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. 
In addition, reflecting continued confidence in the fundamentals of our business over the long-term, we are raising our quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share, up 4% from the prior year. Assets under management were $771 billion at the end of the first quarter, down slightly from $775 billion at the end of last year. More indicative of the results during the quarter were the average assets under management, which are down $36 billion during the first quarter as compared to $778 billion at year-end. Operating income was $307 million in the quarter versus $356 million in the prior quarter. Earnings per share were $0.49 versus $0.58 in the prior quarter. And as noted earlier, we increased the dividend $0.28 per share. We also purchased $125 million of stock during the quarter. 
Before Loren goes into detail on the company financials, let me take a moment to review the investment performance and flows during the quarter. Turning to Slide 6 now. You'll note investment performance is strong in the quarter with 72% of assets in the top half on a 3-year basis and 76% were in the top half on a 5-year basis. One-year results partially reflect the underperformance of energy and financial sectors earlier in the year, which impacted some of our value portfolios. We've seen both of these sectors beginning to recover somewhat in March and April and consequently, positively impacted the performance year-to-date. In fact, with some very strong performance.
On Page 7, you'll see positive active flows were experienced during the quarter were not [indiscernible] passive capabilities. Active flows were driven primarily by alternative capabilities as we saw strong growth in real estate, including both direct and REITs and Global Targeted Return. Those in the passive capabilities declined during the market volatility in January and February, they recovered in March but not enough to return to positive territory for the quarter. It's important to note that although passive flows were negative, they were reduced by $1.5 billion of deleveraging from Invesco Mortgage Capital. As a reminder, there's no revenue impact related to those flows. 
Again, we saw strong institutional flows during the quarter in spite of the volatility, which continues a series of positive institutional flows going back nearly 2 years. Client demand trends remain consistent, with particular strong interest in fixed income, real estate and GTR. Retail flows were impacted by the macro environment as investors weighed their options during the volatile quarter. Despite seeing outflows in many equity mutual funds in the U.S. and EMEA, we saw continued strength in retail alternative capabilities, specifically GTR real estate securities. As noted, our Global Targeted Return capability continues to attract strong flows globally, achieving $2.3 billion in net flows during the quarter across EMEA institutional and cross-border. It's the U.K., retail, Asia Pacific and North America. 
Despite some challenges in the first 2 months of the year, we feel good about the momentum of our business. Flows in March were much better than January and February, and we're experiencing solid flows in April. We continue to see strength across our global business and in particular within Asia Pacific and EMEA. 
Before I hand the call over to Loren, let me say a few words about the new fiduciary rule released by the U.S. Department of Labor in early April. Ultimately, we believe the fiduciary rule is good for investors. That said, we continue to be concerned about the potential for unintended consequences of the rule that proposes such dramatic changes within the industry. It's well known that many investors aren't saving enough to maintain their standard of living during retirement. The DOL's rule is intended to ensure the retirement savers get better advice by expanding the types of retirement investment advice covered by the fiduciary protections. We’ve said all along investors are best served by using advisers who can help them assist -- help them assess their risk tolerance, savings horizons and other factors to develop a portfolio that help them achieve their investment objectives. The key outcome of the new rule could be greater confidence in the advice investors are receiving. Investors have been through a lot in the last 7 years since the financial crisis. Anything that builds confidence could encourage them to save more for retirement and seek advice that helps them achieve their investment objectives. 
That's good for investors and will also benefit the industry as well. The DOL rule is long and complex. The rule and its related documents are more than 1,000 pages. We're working to understand how our distributor partners are intending -- how our partners are interpreting the rule, which will help us support and assist them. We believe the recent acquisition of Jemstep, a market-leading provider of adviser-focused digital solutions, opens up further opportunities to provide meaningful support to our clients as we engage with our clients and seek to understand how they will approach adopting the new rules. We'll look for opportunities for Jemstep to assist our distribution partners. We believe Invesco is very well positioned to help our clients as the DOL rule is implemented, because Invesco puts our clients first in everything we do and has tremendous experience in addressing regulatory topics. We review this as an opportunity to further deepen our relationship, provide new capabilities and enhance our business. I'd like to turn it over to Loren to review the financials in more detail."

So quarter-over-quarter, our total AUM decreased $4.1 million or 0.5% and that was driven by dispositions of $3.6 billion, negative market returns of $3 billion, outflows from the QQQs of $2.6 billion and long-term net outflows of $1.3 bill",882,"Thanks, Marty. So quarter-over-quarter, our total AUM decreased $4.1 million or 0.5% and that was driven by dispositions of $3.6 billion, negative market returns of $3 billion, outflows from the QQQs of $2.6 billion and long-term net outflows of $1.3 billion. These were partially offset by inflows from the money market of $3.8 million and positive FX translation of $2.6 billion. Our average AUM for the first quarter was $747.5 billion, which was down 4.6% versus the fourth quarter. Our net revenue yield came in at 43.8 basis points and that was a decrease of 1.4 basis points versus Q4. Currency mix reduced the yield by 0.7 basis points, 1 less day in the period reduced the yield by 0.4 basis points. A decrease in performance fees and other revenues together accounted for the remainder of 0.3 basis points. 
Now I'm going to turn to the operating results. Our net revenues declined by $68 million or 7.7% quarter-over-quarter to $818.1 million, which includes the negative FX rate impact of $12.6 million. Within the net revenue number, you'll see the investment management fees fell by $78.5 million or 7.8% to $930.3 million. This reflects the lower average AUM, the changes in the AUM product and currency mix and 1 less day during the quarter. FX reduced fourth quarter management fees by $16.1 million. 
Service and distribution revenues declined by $9.9 million or 4.8%, reflecting lower average AUM during the quarter. FX decreased service and distribution revenues by $0.2 million. Performance fees came in at $15.5 million in Q1 and they were earned from a variety of different investment capabilities, including $9.1 million from U.K. equities. Foreign exchange reduced performance fees by $0.6 million. Other revenues in the first quarter were $24 million. That was a drop of $5 million lower due to lower transaction fees from real estate as well as a decline in UIT rollovers. Foreign exchange decreased revenues by $0.1 million. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues fell by $28.7 million or 7.6% and this movement was in line with lower revenues derived from retail AUM. Foreign exchange decreased these expenses by $4.4 million.
Moving on down the slide, you'll see that our adjusted operating expenses at $511 million, decreased by $19.4 million or 3.7% relative to the prior quarter. Foreign exchange decreased operating expenses by $6.5 million during the quarter. Employee compensation came in at $340.3 million, an increase of $1.5 million or 0.4%. This is driven by a normal seasonal increase in payroll taxes, which was largely offset by a reduction in variable compensation. FX reduced compensation by $4.3 million. Marketing expense decreased $9.2 million or 26.2% to $25.4 million. The drop was due to a lower level of advertising, literature, travel and client events during the quarter. These expenditures were deferred in light of the volatile market conditions that we were in. Foreign exchange reduced marketing expense by $0.2 million in the quarter. Property, office and technology expenses came in at $81.1 million in the quarter, that was an increase of $0.7 million over the fourth quarter, driven by additional outsource administrative expenses. FX decreased these expenses by $0.9 million. 
General and administrative expenses at $64.2 million, decreased $12.4 million or 16.2%. This decline was a result of focused expense management during the quarter as nonessential professional services and other nonessential discretionary spending was reduced or postponed. FX decreased G&A by $1.1 million. Continuing on down the slide. You'll see that nonoperating income decreased $2.9 million compared to the fourth quarter. Included in the first quarter were noncash negative marks to March markets on intercompany loans of $7.1 million and $1.4 million on trading investments. These were slightly offset by a $3.4 million gain, which is realized on our pound sterling-U.S. dollar hedge. 
Just to remind people, as we've said in the past, we haven't placed a hedge through the end of Q1 2017 with a strike price of USD 1.4355. This was the pound hedge that we put in place. The firm's effective tax rate on pretax adjusted net income in Q1 was 26.5%. That was down from 26.6% in the prior quarter, which then brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.49 and adjusted net operating margin of 37.5%. 
Before turning things back to over to Marty, I just want to provide a quick update on the business optimization work that we began to implement in Q4 last year. As a reminder, we -- as we stated, we expect to incur up to $85 million in expenses during 2016 related to these activities with an expected run rate savings, however, of $30 million to $45 million through -- at the beginning of 2017. 
In the first quarter, we incurred $6.8 million of the $85 million optimization costs. That was primarily in the form of staff severance costs and as previously discussed, these expenses do impact our U.S. GAAP P&L, but they are being excluded from our non-GAAP results. And also just to finalize the point, we did generate a profit of approximately $2 million in permanent run rate savings in Q1 as a result of the optimization efforts to date, which was in line with our plan. 
And so with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Marty."

So I'm not going to put out a number in terms of what I think margins could be. Obviously, the inherent strength of the business is there. And as markets stabilize, currency stabilizes. We should continue to see the very positive trend of incremental margins working in our favor to pull up our overall rate of, sort of, margin overall. But it will depend ultimately on what the markets do for the rest of the year. We are, as you know, still at the level of assets below where we were on average for last year. And so I'd say we're still catching up to where we were last year in terms of overall margin potential."

So you get to one of my favorite topics, Glenn, and predicting performance fees, which again, I will continue to profess, I'm not very able to do that. Generally, our performance fees are lighter through the last half of the year. They're the heaviest in the first quarter and so you sort of see the heavy performance fee quarter already. So my expectation of performance fees through the remainder of the year, as I have often said, is sort of place marked, earmarked when we're thinking about our planning somewhere around that $5 million a quarter, which is an estimate that assumes a lot of different things kicking in across the globe, but no 1 thing driving it. So I'd say that's one thing. I mean we would hope to see the other revenue line improved somewhat because the volatility in the first quarter was pretty extreme. And then so, as I mentioned, the transaction fees in real estate, rollovers in the UIT business were really slowed down by that degree of volatility. If we get to a more stable, and that's a big if, if we get to a more stable market environment, that line item should be closer to that $30 million to $35 million number through each quarter."

So the optimization work is what's going to drive a permanent reduction. And so that stuff is, I don't want to say real. But it certainly -- I mean, there's work that we can do and we have done in the first quarter and we're going to continue to do through the rest of the year in terms of trying to manage our discretionary expenses to lower levels. Some of that you can defer for a reasonable period of time. Some of that you can't defer for forever. And so we do have some seasonal costs related to marketing that will be a little bit heavier in the first and the fourth quarters as they always are. And so I think it's just good to know that we want to continue to be present and then continue to be able to work with our clients and have client events as we've always had. That's important. It helps the business. It helps the growth of the business. And we don't want to defer those expenses for a year, for example. So I think the other thing that we see in the second quarter versus the first quarter would be some of the impacts around salary increases and deferred compensation, which are typically -- you get a differential of about 2 months’ worth of impact in the second quarter versus the first quarter and between those 2 items that's probably somewhere around an increase of $5 million to $6 million. So again, there are some things that we're going to manage and we're going to continue to apply a very thoughtful and disciplined approach to our hiring and to our discretionary expense management. But I don't want to sort of give guidance explicitly quarter-over-quarter, also because just given the volatility of markets and FX, it really becomes quite difficult for us to give some useful information."

And being good fiduciaries is a critical thing and putting clients first is absolutely essential. And being the industry of trust matters a lot. And so at that level, the notion of fiduciary rule and having better outcomes for end clients, that's a great thing. I think we're all supportive of it, but it's really the magnitude of what has been included in the rule way beyond that notion. And what we learned with RDR, and it's just an absolute fact, there are more unadvised individuals because of RDR right now and they’re probably the individuals that need advice the most and the totality of the costs have gone up. And I think that's a really bad outcome. And I think there is a lot of -- you could see that happening here. That said, so what are the lessons learned that we had from that is, be aware of that. We also see that's also why we went down the Jemstep route. The root of it is something that we know we can help our clients with tools like this, make it -- advice more accessible for those that could be hurt frankly from this rule. And again, that's not the intent of the rule, that's what we think is possible and also very importantly how we position the firm. And I think this is what's being missed in the conversation. What money managers are going to do well and who might be challenged? If you're an index hugger, active management, I'd say you're in trouble. If you have high conviction fundamental and factor-based capabilities like we do, I think you're positioned very, very well. And if -- again, if you look at the work that we've done, when you look at high conviction actives, you do get better returns through market cycles, but it's not just excess return. You have better downside capture. You also have better risk-adjusted returns and I think that's really the value proposition that collectively we need to make clear. It has been a beta run with -- since '09, largely with lots of government intervention. And you start to look at quarters like where all of a sudden, you're seeing active managers outperform the S&P by 300, 350 basis points, that's pretty impressive. So again, I think you have to have a high conviction fundamental, and the factor base, we believe very, very strongly in the combination thereof.

The passive category that we show, Marty mentioned it, I mean got very much affected by the deleveraging of IVR.

So I think we will begin to see recovery of the net revenue yield and particularly as we get into the last half of the year versus the first half, there is some day count stuff that just happens normally. And we always have that benefit of the last half having more days than the first half. So I just want to make people aware of that. It's no secret. In terms of the mix, obviously, we're having some reduced performance fee expectations coming into Q2 versus what we realized in Q1. Some of that's going to be offset, however, by higher -- hopefully higher other revenues, which will help move the fee rate up. And I think we also will see a success of our ETF business, success of our fixed income business. A lot of that is in the pipeline. They tend to have lower fee rates so there will be probably some degree of mix issue that's working a little bit against the higher fee. The flows that are -- that we have been getting into EMEA and U.S. retail, have been a little bit more subdued, and so that was -- it can be a driver of fee rate mix and so I'd say that's going to be a little bit of a question mark, particularly as we get through the whole Brexit thing and understanding what happened in the U.K., that may have some impact we don't know. It hasn't had any impact on flows per se that we could identify yet, but it could have some impact on flows. Based on our modeling and our thinking, we expect to see the fee rate drive up further each quarter as we move through the course of the year. And so again, I think the positive elements generally around mix still exist and I wouldn’t say that on the institutional pipeline, even despite what I said around fixed income coming in. Overall, the fee rate on the products that are coming in far exceed the fee rate on the products that would be leaving. So again, a positive element on the fee rate. FX will also have a big impact too and I think we saw a pretty big impact on FX in the quarter, 0.7 basis points. And so that was with U.K. down 5% quarter-over-quarter, the pound. So again just to understand that those dynamics are probably one of the big drivers of fee rate issues. And hopefully, that does recover as we get through Brexit and we get stabilization of the pound."

Generally, our real estate business has been growing well and so that will, as a team, help allow that line item to grow.

And so that is going to be sort of a U.S., non-U.S. mix. But we think outside the U.S. is a huge opportunity for the real estate business and still has a lot of opportunity to grow at a faster rate, even in the U.S. side. The UIT business, we would hope to see that grow. It's been a very competitive market and particularly in -- because it's somewhat transactional, when people decide to roll their UITs, if you do get volatility, they're just going to wait and see. And so we would want to see sort of a market stabilization, which would allow our ability to roll those things more rapidly and generate more other revenues as well.

It's definitely slowed down the quarter. That said, we just feel very well positioned. We look to continue to gain market share. With regard to performance, somewhat of a similar story that some of the U.S. portfolios I mentioned, there's some of the exposure in some of the European portfolios were in financials and some energy. And so there was that little bit of a drag for a period. But again, they're very, very good managers, excellent and highly regarded.

With regard to the flows, I think what you have to look at is how narrow the flows were within the factor base ETFs. And probably from September through the end of February, it's about as narrow as you've ever seen. And what we're now seeing, as Loren was talking about, why are the flows picking up the way that they are. We're seeing a broadening of interest in the range of capabilities that we have.

What is tied -- I'm sorry, billion so $1.455 billion. What's tied up in the U.K. subgroup as we've talked about from a regulatory perspective is $651 million. And so sort of the free and clear is that $804 million. Q1 is always a very heavy cash-need quarter because of taxes and bonus payments, so we fell below sort of our self-imposed sort of target of $1 billion, but we're not concerned about that. We're still going to continue to be targeting a very healthy capital return in terms of dividends and buybacks as a percentage of our operating cash flow to shareholders. So in terms of our Q1 buyback, which we talked, I mean, that was up 63% versus what we did in Q1 in 2015, so quite a bit of step up, $125 million. But down a little bit versus the fourth quarter due to just generally, the lower operating cash that we are generating now because our asset levels are more affected by what happens in the market. But in terms of the percentage payout, we're sort of in line with what we were thinking about in terms of last year as a percentage of cash flow. But because our overall operating levels have been impacted by markets, the total levels may be somewhat smaller. So again, I think if you look at what we paid out, I mean, it's probably more in line with an $80 million quarter run rate, which gets us at that same payout rate that you’ve seen in the past. But with that said, we're going to continue to be very opportunistic as we see further impact on stock price, which we think is unwarranted. If we get through some of the Brexit and understand the dynamics there, we may feel more able to commit more capital. So again, it's one of these things that we feel very well positioned to return capital, but we are being a little bit cautious, just given the volatility in the market right now."

So from that point of view, we're very well placed. The issue is if it is an outvote, it is going to be -- the stated time is mid-'18 that they’d still be a part of the EU. I'd say most people that are very involved in this would tell you the likelihood of trade agreements and the likelihood it takes longer than that.

So there's nothing that stopped us from generating very strong operating leverage on the plus side if we have positive markets, plus FX, plus organic growth working in our favor."

And so again, we'll have to see it one by one and so I would say they're going to come, but I'd say they'll hopefully get to places that are workable, and will get to a relatively good spot. I will say again though, back to some of the earlier conversations, this does continue to put pressure on -- all it does is drive up compliance costs and in a difficult market, it's just very difficult for institutions to -- these are not optional expenses, right? And so you do compliance costs in cyber and I think that just being a larger money manager and you're much more -- in a better place to be able to deal with those.

And as we typically do, I'll give an overview of the business results for the second quarter. Loren will go into greater detail on the financials and then, importantly, we'll open up to Q&A.
So let me begin by highlighting the firm's operating results for the quarter, which you'll find on Slide 4 of the deck. Long-term investment performance remain stronger in the quarter. 68% to 73% of actively managed assets were ahead of peers on a 3- and 5-year -- 3 and 5 years, respectively. Strong investment performance from our continued progress in meeting client needs overcame the impact of volatile markets during the quarter. Strong client demand help drive passive and institutional close, which led to long-term inflows of $4.5 billion during the quarter.
The adjusted operating margin was 38.6%, an improvement over the prior quarter. And during the quarter, we've returned $318 million to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.
Assets under management were $779 billion [ph] at the end of the second quarter, up from $771 billion [ph] in the first quarter. Adjusted operating income was $330 million in the quarter, up considerably from $307 million in the prior quarter.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.56 versus $0.49 in the prior quarter. Also noted the during the quarter, we've raised our quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share, and we also repurchased $200 million of stock during the quarter.
Before I go through the details on the company's financials, let me take a few minutes to talk about the investment performance during the quarter.
Turning to Slide 7 now. Our commitment to investment excellence and our work to build and maintain so investment quarter helped us deliver solid long-term investment performance across the enterprise during the quarter.
Looking at the firm as whole, 68% of assets were in the top half on a 3-year basis and 73% on a top half on a 5-year basis.
On Page 8, you'll see the flows into Passive capabilities were quite strong, while close into active capabilities were flat with $4.5 billion in although long-term inflows. Flows into Passive capabilities were driven by strong demand from Invesco's PowerShares capabilities. This was the second best quarter in Invesco PowerShares history with roughly $3.8 billion in net new assets and the strong flows are helping us to continue to gain ETF market share. This reflects longevity of the breadth of the PowerShares operating as well as our continued focus on meeting client needs. We are well positioned in the current market environment to our low volatility suite, commodity suite, Fixed Income and bank loan ETF's. As you're probably aware, smart beta strategies are going to nearly twice the pace of the overall ETF market. Although this prompted a wave of fund launches by competitors, our expertise at smart beta, in fact, are investing and continue to differentiate us in the market and help us gain share. Although, long-term flows are flat on the active side, we saw solid demand for our alternatives, including real estate, multi-asset capabilities as well as Fixed Income.
Asia Pacific demonstrated continued strength across retail and institutional, with tremendous momentum continuing into the third quarter. A continued focus on delivering strong investment performance and bringing our broad range of capabilities to clients contribute to the very positive results in the region.
Globally, we also saw strong institutional flows during the quarter, which reflects our continued focus on this channel and results in a series of positive institutional flows going back 2 years. 
Client demand trends remain consistent with particularly strong interest in Fixed Income, multi-asset, real estate and our institutional pipeline remains very strong. So at the end of June, the one but not funded pipeline is up 15% on assets under management versus the prior quarter and the prior year.
Retail flows were flat this quarter as investors weigh their options during some of the late quarter volatility. That said, we continue to see strength in Fixed Income, U.S. dividend strategies as well as retail alternative capabilities, specifically GTR and real estate.
Now let me take a moment and highlight the business in EMEA. Our number one position, UK's retail, our strong cross-border retail business and our robust it is a solid pipeline across EMEA, all positions us extremely well ahead of a potential Brexit. We position our business over many years to serve clients who are located in a variety of countries across the region. Our people, in summary, organize to meet those global needs. We are well diversified across channels with the U.K. retailer, cross-border and institutional, each comprising roughly 1/3 of our businesses in the region. We're also diversified across asset class with assets spread across equity bonds and multi-asset capabilities. Lastly, with more than 1,300 people in the region, we are well placed across the region with strong business in both the U.K. and on the continent. Now level diversification and our construct positions us extremely well to deliver for our clients in EMEA.
Investors across Europe, we acted thoughtfully to the market volatility that occurred at the time around vote. Since then, clients have taken advantage of the market movements by utilizing the full range of Invesco's comprehensive fund range to achieve their long-term investment objectives. As an example, we have seen strong movement in the capabilities such as our highly-regarded Global Targeted Returns fund as client seek to manage risk in their portfolios.
With regard to flows, our business in EMEA has demonstrated good resiliency through the Brexit topic. Close to proving more compared to the prior quarter, pre the announcement of the results of the U.K. referendum on June 23. For the month of June, up to the date of the Brexit vote, we saw daily average outflows approximately $78 million. Since the referendum, those outflows have subsided to a daily average of $13 million. Although it's still early days, we feel good about the momentum in our EMEA business. Going forward, we're focused on same clients, managing our core business and executing our strategy while adopting to any changes that might be brought about by Brexit.
Before I hand the call over the Loren, let me say a few words about the new deal of our fiduciary group. We're actively engaged with clients as they work to understand the impact of deal on their business. Now for the past couple of years, our discussions with clients have intensified moving from clarification, interpretations to practical application. We are in discussions with them regarding product applications, share those possibilities, how best to leverage global solutions such as Jemstep.
Based on our early discussions, we continue to believe our comprehensive range of capabilities positions us very well to help our clients as the DOL rule is implemented. Additionally, given Invesco's tremendous expertise and experience partnering with clients to address regularly topics, for example, our work on RDR in the U.K., we view this as an opportunity to further deepen our relationships, provide new capabilities to enhance our business overall.
With that, I will now turn it over to Loren to review the financials in more detail"

We also saw the acquisition of our India joint venture gets completed, and that brought in $2.4 billion. We saw inflows from money market of $2 billion. These factors are offset by negative FX translation of $7.7 billion, and we also saw outflows from Q2 Q's [ph] of $3.8 billion.
Our average AUM for the second quarter was $784.5 billion, that was up 4.9% versus Q1. Our net revenue yields came in at 43.7 basis points, which is 0.1 basis point lower than the prior quarter. Although this was a small change, there were a variety of factors, which impacted our yield in Q2. These included AUM mix and lower performance fees, which reduced the yield by 0.7 basis points and 0.4 basis points, respectively. These factors were offset by 1 more day in the period, which increased the yield by 0.4 basis points. In addition, currency mix and the increase in other revenue, each cultivated 0.3 basis points to a net revenue yield in the quarter.
Next, let's turn to the operating results, Page 13. Before I begin, I'd like to point out that we've evaluated and taken on board the SEC's new guidance on non-GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, you have already noticed the changes that we have made in the format of our second quarter earnings press release, which now focuses primarily on the U.S. GAAP results. In addition, the U.S. GAAP period-over-period variances are now set out in detail in our earnings release. Both our earnings release and this investment presentation contains details of reconciliations between our U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP and importantly, there's no change to how we calculated our non-GAAP measures relative to prior quarters. And since we've already provided the U.S. GAAP [indiscernible] our earnings press release, my comments today, consistent with the past practice, will focus exclusively on the variances related to our non-GAAP adjusted measures.
So actually, let's turn to the next page entitled non-GAAP operating results. You'll see net revenues increased by $38.5 million or 4.7% quarter-over-quarter to $856.6 million, which included a positive FX rate impact of $6.4 million. Within the net revenue number, you'll see that adjusted investment management fees increased by $32.6 million or 3.5% to $962.9 million, this reflects higher average AUM for the quarter, foreign exchange increase adjusted investment management fees by $7.7 million. Our adjusted service and distribution revenues increased by $5.7 million or 2.9%, reflecting higher average AUM for retail products.
Foreign exchange increased adjusted service and distribution revenue by $0.5 million. Adjusted performance fees came in at $9.3 million in Q2 and were earned from a variety of different investment capabilities, including $5.5 million from our bank loan products. Foreign exchange increased these fees by $0.1 million.
Our adjusted other revenues in the first quarter were $31.7 million, and that was an increase of $7.7 million from the prior quarter, and that was a result of increased transaction fees from real estate. Foreign exchange increased its revenues by $0.4 million.Third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, increased $1.3 million or 0.4%. This movement was in line with the higher revenues derived from our retail AUM and FX increase, these expenses by $2.3 million.
Moving further on down the slide, You'll see that adjusted operating expenses at $526.2 million, increased by $15.2 million, or 3% relative to Q1. Foreign exchange increase adjusted operating expenses by $4.1 million during the quarter.
Our adjusted employee compensation came in at $347.9 million, an increase of $7.6 million or 2.2%. This increase was driven by higher sales commissions and variable compensation costs, a full quarter of higher base salaries effective from March 1, and an increase in deferred compensation expenses for the awards granted in the first quarter. This was offset by a decline in the seasonal payroll taxes. FX increased our adjusted compensation by $2.8 million in the quarter.
Adjusted marketing expenses increased by $3.6 million or 14.2% to $29 million, reflecting the seasonal increase in client events. FX increased adjusted marketing expense by $0.3 million in the quarter.
Our adjusted property office and technology expenses were $82.8 million in the quarter, an increase of $1.7 million versus Q1, driven by higher technology costs. FX increased these expenses by $0.5 million.
Adjusted G&A expense at $66.5 million, increased $2.3 million or 3.6%, and this was driven by professional services expenses when compared to the prior quarter and FX increased G&A by $0.5 billion.
Going on for that on the page, you'll see that adjusted nonoperating income increased $15 million compared to Q1, and this difference was largely driven by higher equity and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates in the second quarter but also, the $7.1 million FX loss recognized in the prior quarter.
In terms of effective tax rate on pretax adjusted net income in Q2, was consistent with the prior quarter at 26.5%, which brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.56, and adjusted net operating margin of 38.6%.
And so finally, before I turn things over to Marty, I just want to provide a quick update on our capital management activities in the quarter. As you'll recall from our recent announcement, in addition to our ongoing share repurchase activity during the quarter, we entered into a $150 million accelerated share repurchase program on June 30. And as a result of this, our end-of-period share Canada declined by approximately 1.7% quarter-over-quarter to $413.1 million shares.
And with that, turn it back to Marty"

So I think our expectation, even with markets being flat, which is the way we normally forecast anyway, and even with the pound being down where it is for the last half of the year, we would expect margins to be on an upward trajectory as we continue to grow organically and continue to work hard on the optimization work around cost. So the firm has done, I think, a really great job of creating capacity for investment without having to add to costs, really true, using, as we talked about in the past. Greater use of our shared service centers, being able to leverage technology more effectively, streamlining, simplifying a lot about processes. So that work is now going on as you know and so we're on track with respect to the optimization, which we discussed provide some expensive release of roughly $30 million to $45 million by the end of the year. And so that run rate, which is actually a beginning to flow through our numbers is something that's been very helpful. And just remind people, we handled acquisition that came on board, Jemstep and Melgar, and those expenses are being offset through this optimization whereas the revenues are showing up in the revenue line items. So we do think that that's going to help further drive margin expansion. Our mental margin continues to be at a very high level. And with that sort of 50% to -- 55% to 60% incrementally margin and our fee rate, because of the mix that's coming and particularly, around institutional social being the higher fee rate than what's going out, will continue to benefit from that. So I think all those factors to us say that we can continue to see margins increase and get up to the levels that we've seen in the past without too much stretching. Clearly, it's a factor of the market, of course, and what [indiscernible]."

So that's why it is -- you almost have to look at that net number to really understand the dynamic of that shifting mix. But in terms of the trends around what's driving our management fee, so feel that it's quite stable. Maybe, I mean, to the extent that Europe is a little bit slower than it's been in the past, it's 1 engine that was driving that fee rate, which is probably not something you will necessarily look to be driving forward, but we are seeing continued engines around Asia alternatives which is helping us continue to see that fee rate increase as well as institutional mix generally being better. So I'd say the net revenue yield x-performance fees quarter, next quarter going forward, is kind of flattish for this quarter. And so that would be -- if I'm even with FX, so I think with FX down, obviously, like the negative impact but because of mix, it's positive, it's probably offsetting it. So fully that's helpful in terms of the modeling on the fee rate. A lot of dynamics underneath clearly, have had some impact but generally, we expect to see that trend in terms of improving fee rate to continue to maybe get a somewhat slower [indiscernible]"

The more likely than not is Brexit is going to happen, and that you're going to end up with trade agreements between the continent and the U.K. that are mutually beneficial. It's going to take time to get there. That said, let's get down to our business. Our business, as I was trying to highlight, we are already structured for a post-Brexit environment. Very strong U.K. business, very strong continental business, and we don't see any changes there for all the major reasons. And the impact on the business is going to be largely driven by the economic environment. And there is a scenario where it's less negative than everything that you have heard. I mean, with the pound depreciating, that's actually the x-quarters in the U.K. are actually doing very, very well. So I think the reality is going to be very hard at a political level but I would say, our business is a business that is structured for the change and there is a need for asset management services and we just really don't see this industry being hurt to a degree that some other businesses might be [indiscernible] going to have to move people to different parts of -- out of the U.K., out of the continent and vice versa.

The derivatives will again, it's -- is, I would say, the first notion of it was it would've gotten the way of a number of products for the industry in particular, for us. At a retail level, GTR, probably would have been very, very challenge in the proposed rules. We're sensing that we're going to end up with a better outcome, which will not get in the way of a number of our products. I don't want to be so definitive yet because it's not there. But I'd say very good progress in being very thoughtful on really trying to help the SEC get to what they need. And so the dialogue has been constructive. And so again, you will see ultimate comes out, but at the moment, I'd say it's trending to commonsensical, good outcomes on both levels."

So we look at smart beta as a subset of factor investing. And again, I think very importantly, I'm repeating myself but one of very, very few firms that have factor base capability that benefits its 35 years and the fundamental investing that we have. And so the combination of those around the world for us that put us in a unique position. So factor investing outside of the United States is much more an institutional business. And it's growing in demand, [indiscernible] continent. Loren mentioned that if we're looking to do some things in the U.K. at the retail level, there in AsiaPac, it's actually growing the demand. In the United States, it tends to be a retail focus and express the smart beta through ETFs. And where we look at our strategic positioning, i think very importantly, differently than a mutual fund where you can have 200 of the same XYZ funds completing is very hard to see beyond, really 3 ETF are sort of the same color to be successful just because of the nature of the ETF with market makers and the like. So first mover advantage matters a lot. The other thing that really matters to is the longevity of I think length of track record. And if you look at the PowerShares lineup of smart beta, any number of funds are 10 years old. And we are so -- when people are looking to invest or looking at the length of capability, also looking at the liquidity within it. And so those are very different dynamics that we could have on the mutual fund. So the good news is people are coming in sort of, it confirms the attractiveness of smart beta.

But active management, you'll actually able to thrive, I think those individuals calling [indiscernible] debt asset class making a mistake.

And as was just mentioned, Loren Starr, Invesco's CFO is on call with me, and we'll be speaking to the presentation that's available on our website if you're so inclined to follow along. And as we typically do, I'll give an overview of the business results for the second quarter. Loren will go into greater detail on the financials and then, importantly, we'll open up to Q&A.
So let me begin by highlighting the firm's operating results for the quarter, which you'll find on Slide 4 of the deck. Long-term investment performance remained strong during the quarter. 68% to 73% of actively managed assets were ahead of peers on a 3- and 5-year -- 3 and 5 years, respectively. Strong investment performance and our continued focus on meeting client needs overcame the impact of volatile markets during the quarter. Strong client demand helped drive passive and institutional flows, which led to long-term inflows of $4.5 billion during the quarter.
The adjusted operating margin was 38.6%, an improvement over the prior quarter. And during the quarter, we returned $318 million to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.
Assets under management were $779 billion at the end of the second quarter, up from $771 billion in the first quarter. Adjusted operating income was $330 million in the quarter, up considerably from $307 million in the prior quarter.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.56 versus $0.49 in the prior quarter. Also noted the during the quarter, we've raised our quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share, and we also repurchased $200 million of stock during the quarter.
Before Loren goes into details on the company's financials, let me take a few minutes to talk about investment performance and flows during the quarter.
Turning to Slide 7 now. Our commitment to investment excellence and our work to build and maintain strong investment culture helped us deliver solid long-term investment performance across the enterprise during the quarter.
Looking at the firm as whole, 68% of assets were in the top half on a 3-year basis, and 73% were in the top half on a 5-year basis.
On Page 8, you'll see the flows into passive capabilities were quite strong, while flows into active capabilities were flat with $4.5 billion in total long-term inflows. Flows into passive capabilities were driven by strong demand from Invesco's PowerShares capabilities. This was the second best quarter in Invesco PowerShares history, with roughly $3.8 billion in net new assets, and the strong flows are helping us to continue to gain ETF market share. This reflects the longevity and the breadth of the PowerShares operating as well as our continued focus on meeting client needs. We are well positioned in the current market environment through our low volatility suite, commodity suite, Fixed Income and bank loan ETFs. As you're probably aware, smart beta strategies are growing at nearly twice the pace of the overall ETF market. Although this is prompting a wave of fund launches by competitors, our expertise in smart beta and factor investing continue to differentiate us in the market and help us gain share. Although long-term flows were flat on the active side, we saw solid demand for alternatives including real estate, multi-asset capabilities as well as Fixed Income.
Asia Pacific demonstrated continued strength across retail and institutional, with tremendous momentum continuing into the third quarter. A continued focus on delivering strong investment performance and bringing our broad range of capabilities to clients contribute to the very positive results in the region.
Globally, we also saw strong institutional flows during the quarter, which reflects our continued focus on this channel and results in a series of positive institutional flows going back 2 years. 
Client demand trends remain consistent, with particularly strong interest in Fixed Income, multi-asset, real estate, and our institutional pipeline remains very strong. So at the end of June, the won but not funded pipeline is up 15% on assets under management versus the prior quarter and the prior year.
Retail flows were flat this quarter as investors weighed their options during some of the late quarter volatility. That said, we continue to see strength in Fixed Income, U.S. dividend strategies as well as retail alternative capabilities, specifically GTR and real estate.
Now let me take a moment and highlight the business in EMEA. Our #1 position, U.K. retail, our strong cross-border retail business and our robust institutional pipeline across EMEA all position us extremely well ahead of a potential Brexit. We position our business over many years to serve clients who are located in a variety of countries across the region. Our people in fund ranges are organized to meet those local needs. We are well diversified across channel, with U.K. retail, cross-border and institutional each comprising roughly 1/3 of our business in the region. We're also diversified across asset class, with assets spread across equity, bond and multi-asset capabilities. Lastly, with more than 1,300 people in the region, we are well placed across the region with strong business in both the U.K. and on the continent. And our level of diversification and our construct position us extremely well to deliver for our clients in EMEA.
Investors across Europe reacted thoughtfully to the market volatility that occurred at the time around the vote. Since then, clients have taken advantage of the market movements by utilizing the full range of Invesco's comprehensive fund range to achieve their long-term investment objectives. As an example, we've seen strong movement in the capabilities such as our highly regarded Global Targeted Returns fund as clients seek to manage risk in their portfolios.
With regard to flows, our business in EMEA has demonstrated good resiliency through the Brexit topic, with flows improving when compared to the prior quarter, pre the announcement of the results of the U.K. referendum on June 23. For the month of June, up to the date of the Brexit vote, we saw daily average outflows of approximately $78 million. Since the referendum vote, outflows have subsided to a daily average of $13 million. Although it's still early days, we feel good about the momentum in our EMEA business. Going forward, we're focused on staying close to our clients, managing our core business and executing our strategy, while adapting to any changes that might be brought about by Brexit.
Before I hand the call over the Loren, let me say a few words about the new DOL fiduciary rule. We're actively engaged with clients as they work to understand the impact of the DOL rule on their business. For the past couple of years, our discussions with clients have intensified, moving from clarification, interpretation to practical application. We are in discussions with them regarding product implications, share class possibilities and how best to leverage robo solutions such as Jemstep.
Based on our early discussions, we continue to believe our comprehensive range of capability positions us very well to help our clients as the DOL rule is implemented. Additionally, given Invesco's tremendous expertise and experience partnering with clients to address regularly topics, for example, our work on RDR in the U.K., we view this as an opportunity to further deepen our relationships, provide new capabilities and enhance our business overall.
With that, I will now turn it over to Loren to review the financials in more detail."

So quarter-over-quarter, you saw our total AUM increased by $8.1 billion or 1%. This was driven by positive market returns of $10.7 billion. We also saw long-term net inflows of $4.5 billion. I should note, of this $4.5 billion, $0.9",966,"Thanks, Marty. Okay. So quarter-over-quarter, you saw our total AUM increased by $8.1 billion or 1%. This was driven by positive market returns of $10.7 billion. We also saw long-term net inflows of $4.5 billion. I should note, of this $4.5 billion, $0.9 billion came from IDR leverage, which is classified as our institutional and passive Fixed Income. We also saw the acquisition of our India joint venture get completed, and that brought in $2.4 billion. We saw inflows from money market of $2 billion. These factors were offset by negative FX translation of $7.7 billion, and we also saw outflows from the QQQs of $3.8 billion.
Our average AUM for the second quarter was $784.5 billion. That was up 4.9% versus Q1. Our net revenue yield came in at 43.7 basis points, which is 0.1 basis points lower than the prior quarter. Although this was a small change, there were a variety of factors which impacted our yield in Q2. These included AUM mix and lower performance fees, which reduced the yield by 0.7 basis points and 0.4 basis points, respectively. These factors were offset by one more day in the period, which increased the yield by 0.4 basis points. In addition, currency mix and the increase in other revenue each contributed 0.3 basis points to net revenue yield in the quarter.
Next let's turn to the operating results, Page 13. Before I begin, I'd like to point out that we've evaluated and taken onboard the SEC's new guidance on non-GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, you'll have already noticed the changes that we made in the format of our second quarter earnings press release, which now focuses primarily on the U.S. GAAP results. In addition, the U.S. GAAP period-over-period variances are now set out in detail in our earnings release. Both our earnings release and this investor presentation contain detailed reconciliations between our U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP and, importantly, there's no change to how we've calculated our non-GAAP measures relative to prior quarters. So since we've already provided the U.S. GAAP narrative in the earnings press release, my comments today, consistent with the past practice, will focus exclusively on the variances related to our non-GAAP adjusted measures.
So actually, let's turn to the next page titled Non-GAAP Operating Results. You'll see net revenues increased by $38.5 million or 4.7% quarter-over-quarter to $856.6 million, which included a positive FX rate impact of $6.4 million. Within the net revenue number, you'll see that adjusted investment management fees increased by $32.6 million or 3.5% to $962.9 million. This reflects higher average AUM for the quarter. Foreign exchange increase adjusted investment management fees by $7.7 million. Our adjusted service and distribution revenues increased by $5.7 million or 2.9%, reflecting higher average AUM for retail products. Foreign exchange increased adjusted service and distribution revenue by $0.5 million.
Our adjusted performance fees came in at $9.3 million in Q2 and were earned from a variety of different investment capabilities, including $5.5 million from our bank loan products. Foreign exchange increased these fees by $0.1 million.
Our adjusted other revenues in the first quarter were $31.7 million, and that was an increase of $7.7 million from the prior quarter, and that was a result of increased transaction fees from real estate. Foreign exchange increased these revenues by $0.4 million. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, increased $1.3 million or 0.4%. This movement was in line with the higher revenue derived from our retail AUM, and FX increased these expenses by $2.3 million.
Moving further on down the slide, you'll see that adjusted operating expenses at $526.2 million increased by $15.2 million or 3% relative to Q1. Foreign exchange increased adjusted operating expenses by $4.1 million during the quarter.
Our adjusted employee compensation came in at $347.9 million, an increase of $7.6 million or 2.2%. This increase was driven by higher sales commissions and variable compensation costs, a full quarter of higher base salaries effective from March 1 and an increase in deferred compensation expenses for the awards granted in the first quarter. This was offset by a decline in the seasonal payroll taxes. FX increased our adjusted compensation by $2.8 million in the quarter.
Adjusted marketing expenses increased by $3.6 million or 14.2% to $29 million, reflecting the seasonal increase in client events. FX increased adjusted marketing expense by $0.3 million in the quarter.
Our adjusted property, office and technology expenses were $82.8 million in the quarter, an increase of $1.7 million versus Q1, driven by higher technology costs. FX increased these expenses by $0.5 million.
Adjusted G&A expense, at $66.5 million, increased $2.3 million or 3.6%, and this was driven by professional services expenses when compared to the prior quarter. And FX increased G&A by $0.5 million.
Going on further down the page, you'll see that adjusted nonoperating income increased $15 million compared to Q1, and this difference was largely driven by higher equity and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates in the second quarter but also the $7.1 million FX loss recognized in the prior quarter.
The firm's effective tax rate on pretax adjusted net income in Q2 was consistent with the prior quarter at 26.5%, which brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.56 and adjusted net operating margin of 38.6%.
And so finally, before I turn things over to Marty, I just want to provide a quick update on our capital management activities in the quarter. As you'll recall from our recent announcement, in addition to our ongoing share repurchase activity during the quarter, we entered into a $150 million accelerated share repurchase program on June 30. And as a result of this, our end-of-period share count declined by approximately 1.7% quarter-over-quarter to $413.1 million shares.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Marty."

Let me just make a couple of summary comments before we get to Q&A. We believe our ability to produce strong long-term net flows this quarter reflects the fundamental strength of our firm, our expertise across a broad range of fundamental and factor-based capabilities and our focus on helping retail and institutional clients achieve their investment objectives. We feel good about the momentum in our business, and flows were strong across the quarter as we helped clients manage through the volatility we saw in June.
Strong flows have continued into July, with more than $8 billion of long-term net inflows across a variety of capabilities and regions. This $8 billion includes $6.5 billion that is related to the 529 mandate, which was recently funded. As noted during our Investor Day event earlier this year, we are very well positioned to help clients to be successful, which in turn will enhance our market relevance, drive growth and strengthen shareholder value over the long term.

So it is early days, but everything we see -- I, frankly, think it's ultimately going to be an opportunity for a firm like us. We are positioned very strongly, structurally, for a Brexit.

So I think our expectation, even with markets being flat, which is the way we normally forecast anyway, and even with the pound being down where it is for the last half of the year, we would expect margins to be on an upward trajectory as we continue to grow organically and continue to work hard on the optimization work around cost. So the firm has done, I think, a really great job of creating capacity for investment without having to add to costs, really, through using, as we talked about in the past, greater use of our shared service centers, being able to leverage technology more effectively, streamlining, simplifying a lot of our processes. So that work is now going on, as you know, and so we're on track with respect to the optimization, which we've discussed, to provide some expense relief of roughly $30 million to $45 million by the end of the year. And so that run rate, which is actually now beginning to flow through our numbers, is something that's been very helpful. And just to remind people, we had those acquisitions that came on board, Jemstep and Religare. And those expenses are being offset through this optimization, whereas the revenues are showing up in the revenue line item. So we do think that that's going to help further drive margin expansion. Our incremental margin continues to be at a very high level. And with that sort of 50% to -- 55% to 60% incremental margin and our fee rate, because of the mix that's coming in, particularly around institutional being the higher fee rate than what's going out, we'll continue to benefit from that. So I think all those factors, to us, say that we can continue to see margins increase and get up to the level that we've seen in the past without too much stretching.

And we saw the management fee rate decline quarter-over-quarter. I know that you guys often speak to the revenue yield, but just hoping, if it's possible to ask a question cutting out some of the other noise and just speaking specifically to the investment management fees divided by AUM. What drove that? Was it mix? And if so, should we think about that as being sustainable? And I think last quarter, you had given some indication saying that you expect the fee rate to improve throughout the year. And is that still your expectation?"

So, obviously, the management fee rate does have -- is impacted by FX, and so there are some factors there as well as overall equity component versus non-equity. And so when the market declines, you'll see some of that change. There is another element around our gross management fee rate, which people should be aware of. It's the RDR impact, right? As we sort of continue to bleed out the old fee rate and replace it with a net fee rate, that has an impact on the gross management fee yields. And so I'd say that is sort of permanent and sustained as we go forward. But doesn't have an impact on the net revenue yield, because commensurately, our -- what we're paying away goes away, too. So that's why it is -- you almost have to look at that net number to really understand the dynamic of that shifting mix. But there -- in terms of the trends around what's driving our management fee, still feel that it is quite stable. Maybe, I mean, to the extent that Europe is a little bit slower than it's been in the past, it's one engine that was driving that fee rate, which is probably not something we would necessarily look to be driving forward, but we are seeing continued engines around Asia alternatives, which is helping us continue to see that fee rate increase as well as the institutional mix generally being better. So I'd say the net revenue yield x performance fees quarter -- next quarter and going forward is kind of flattish to this quarter. And so that would be -- if with FX. So I think with FX down, obviously, that has a negative impact, but because the mix is positive, it's probably offsetting it. So hopefully that's helpful in terms of the modeling on the fee rate. A lot of dynamics underneath clearly have some impact. But generally, we expect to see that trend in terms of improving fee rate continue but maybe at a somewhat slower pace."

The more likely than not is Brexit is going to happen and that you're going to end up with trade agreements between the continent and the U.K. that are mutually beneficial. It's going to take time to get there. That said, let's get down to our business. Our business, as I was trying to highlight, we are already structured for a post-Brexit environment, very strong U.K. business, very strong continental business, and we don't see any changes there for all -- a range of reasons. And the impact on the business is going to be largely driven by the economic environment. And there is a scenario where it's less negative than everything that you heard. I mean, with the pound depreciating, that's actually -- the exporters in the U.K. are actually doing very, very well. So I think the reality is it's going to be very hard at a political level, but I would say our business is a business that is structured for the change, and there is a need for asset management services. And we just really don't see this industry being hurt to the degree that some other businesses might be, where they're literally going to have to move people to different parts of -- out of the U.K., out of the continent and vice versa. It is just not part of what's going to happen to us as asset managers. Now there are some asset management firms that are not structured like we are, and they're going to have to do some work to get positioned to be continually successful. But again, we're trying very hard to point out, looking at the elements we talked about earlier, it's a huge part of the world. It's a strong part of the world. They're clearly going through some changes. But I think it's a total mistake to think that the region will not continue to be important and that it will not continue to be an important part of our business."

At a retail level, GTR, probably would have been very, very challenged in the proposed rules. We're sensing that we're going to end up with a better outcome, which will not get in the way of a number of our products. I don't want to be so definitive yet, because it's not there. But I'd say very good progress and being very thoughtful on really trying to help the SEC get to what they need. And so the dialogue has been constructive.

So we look at smart beta as a subset of factor investing. And again, I think very importantly -- I'm repeating myself, but we're one of very, very few firms that have a factor-based capability that's been in business 35 years and the fundamental investing that we have. And so the combination of those around the world for us that put us in a unique position. So factor investing outside of the United States is much more an institutional business. And it's growing in demand, whether it be on the continent. Loren mentioned that we're looking to do some things in the U.K. at the retail level. Actually there and Asia Pac, it's actually growing in demand. In the United States, it tends to be a retail focus and express the smart beta through ETFs. And where we look at our strategic positioning, and I think very importantly than -- differently than a mutual fund where you can have 200 of the same XYZ funds competing is very hard to see beyond, really, 3 ETFs of sort of the same color be successful just because of the nature of the ETF with market makers and the like. So first-mover advantage matters a lot. The other thing that really matters too is the longevity of -- so think length of track record. And if you look at the PowerShares lineup of smart beta, any number of funds are 10 years old. And so when people are looking to invest or looking at the length of capability, also looking at the liquidity within it. And so those are very different dynamics than you would have with a mutual fund. So the good news is people are coming in, so it sort of -- it confirms the attractiveness of smart beta. That said, it's going to -- it's a very, very competitive space to enter into, to say nothing of how do you work in conjunction with active management within your organization. So we think we're in a pretty good position."

I would be in a camp, consistent with others, that it does seem very different this time. And I -- one of it you could look at it as a maturing industry, but when you talk about active management, my view is you go in cycles, and we've had this beta run from '09 on with government intervention, which aligned the stars with cap-weighted indexes. That's not sustainable. So I think that's been overdone. That said, it's here to stay. I think you're going to see greater growth of factor investing, as we've said. But active management will actually -- it will thrive. I think those individuals that are calling it debt [ph] asset class are making a mistake. So that said, I think the other element that's really driving the notion of consolidation, it's the regulatory landscape. It is so costly to keep up with all of these, to say nothing in cyberspace. So it's rising costs in the competitive environment. And I think those are the dynamics that are going to also be changing -- be forces to drive consolidation. And luckily, we're fortunate enough to be positioned extremely well, as we've just been talking about on this call. I would say the business here has never been stronger. It's seemingly getting -- all engines are kicking in quite nicely and matched against the trends that are in place. And I think the people that try to catch up with the trends, it's going to be very hard. You need to have started them 3 years ago, 5 years ago, 7 years ago, honestly. That said, we don't see a lot of gaps, but we will continue to pay attention to the marketplace. And as we have in the past, selectively, as things can -- if we can become a stronger organization by teaming up with another organization, we'll continue to do that.

So that's been our experience, so maybe we just have it wrong, but that's our experience. With regard to different wrappers, I -- if you look at next shares, it's interesting, but it can be 100% achieved by a share class in a mutual fund. And if you use an R6 share class, you get the exact outcome, via without the challenge of a different vehicle trying to get launched within a channel. And although it's creative, I think that's really been the headwind for it. So it could ultimately be successful. But again, I think there's an easier way to get there. And you really need to do it in conjunction with your clients, i.e., think distribution partners. So things will continue to evolve. I personally think that the area that will continue to grow the most and probably be most additive is smart beta, because it is -- you get better outcomes with smart beta than you do with cap-weighted indexes. So I think that's really going to be where the gravitational pull is when you look at these ranges of capabilities that you just highlighted. So that's our view.

If you look at the value capabilities, I feel really, really good about the teams and how they're managing. What tends to be in those are energy and financials, which have been hurt here again in the volatility. So my basic view is that we continue to ensure that we have high quality teams that can deliver over a market cycle. And I think that's really the important thing. You can't look quarter-to-quarter, year by year. Calendars don't matter. Market cycles matter. And you're going to get excess returns with some strong asset management. And I think when the psychological environment moves, I think that's where you're going to really see the gross -- the net flows actually pick up in those active capabilities.

Long-term investment performance remained strong during the quarter. 68% to 73% of actively managed assets were ahead of peers on a 3- and 5-year -- 3 and 5 years, respectively. Strong investment performance and our continued focus on meeting clients' needs overcame the impact of volatile markets during the quarter. Strong client demand helped drive passive and institutional flows, which led to long-term inflows of $4.5 billion during the quarter.
The adjusted operating margin was 38.6%, an improvement over the prior quarter. And during the quarter, we returned $318 million to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.
Assets under management were $779 billion at the end of the second quarter, up from $771 billion in the first quarter. Adjusted operating income was $330 million in the quarter, up considerably from $307 million in the prior quarter.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.56 versus $0.49 in the prior quarter. Also noted during the quarter, we've raised our quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share, and we also repurchased $200 million of stock during the quarter.
Before Loren goes into details on the company's financials, let me take a few minutes to talk about investment performance and flows during the quarter.
Turning to Slide 7 now. Our commitment to investment excellence and our work to build and maintain strong investment culture helped us deliver solid long-term investment performance across the enterprise during the quarter.
Looking at the firm as whole, 68% of assets were in the top half on a 3-year basis, and 73% were in the top half on a 5-year basis.
On Page 8, you'll see that flows into passive capabilities were quite strong, while flows into active capabilities were flat with $4.5 billion in total long-term inflows. Flows into passive capabilities were driven by strong demand from Invesco's PowerShares capabilities. This was the second best quarter in Invesco PowerShares' history, with roughly $3.8 billion in net new assets, and the strong flows are helping us to continue to gain ETF market share. This reflects the longevity and the breadth of the PowerShares offering as well as our continued focus on meeting client needs. We are well positioned in the current market environment through our low volatility suite, commodity suite, Fixed Income and bank loan ETFs. As you're probably aware, smart beta strategies are growing at nearly twice the pace of the overall ETF market. Although this is prompting a wave of fund launches by competitors, our expertise in smart beta and factor investing continue to differentiate us in the market and help us gain share. Although long-term flows were flat on the active side, we saw solid demand for alternatives including real estate, multi-asset capabilities as well as Fixed Income.
Asia Pacific demonstrated continued strength across retail and institutional, with tremendous momentum continuing into the third quarter. A continued focus on delivering strong investment performance and bringing our broad range of capabilities to clients contribute to the very positive results in the region.
Globally, we also saw strong institutional flows during the quarter, which reflects our continued focus on this channel and results in a series of positive institutional flows going back 2 years. 
Client demand trends remain consistent, with particularly strong interest in Fixed Income, multi-asset, real estate, and our institutional pipeline remains very strong. So at the end of June, the won but not funded pipeline is up 15% on assets under management versus the prior quarter and the prior year.
Retail flows were flat this quarter as investors weighed their options during some of the late quarter volatility. That said, we continue to see strength in Fixed Income, U.S. dividend strategies as well as retail alternative capabilities, specifically GTR and real estate.
Now let me take a moment and highlight the business in EMEA. Our #1 position, U.K. retail, our strong cross-border retail business and our robust institutional pipeline across EMEA all position us extremely well ahead of a potential Brexit. We've positioned our business over many years to serve clients who are located in a variety of countries across the region. Our people in fund ranges are organized to meet those local needs. We are well diversified across channel, with U.K. retail, cross-border and institutional each comprising roughly 1/3 of our business in the region. We are also diversified across asset class, with assets spread across equity, bond and multi-asset capabilities. Lastly, with more than 1,300 people in the region, we are well placed across the region with strong business in both the U.K. and on the continent. And our level of diversification and our construct positions us extremely well to deliver for our clients in EMEA.
Investors across Europe reacted thoughtfully to the market volatility that occurred at the time around the vote. Since then, clients have taken advantage of the market movements by utilizing the full range of Invesco's comprehensive fund range to achieve their long-term investment objectives. As an example, we've seen strong movement in the capabilities such as our highly regarded Global Targeted Returns fund as clients seek to manage risk in their portfolios.
With regard to flows, our business in EMEA has demonstrated good resiliency through the Brexit topic, with flows improving when compared to the prior quarter, pre the announcement of the results of the U.K. referendum on June 23. For the month of June, up to the date of the Brexit vote, we saw daily average outflows of approximately $78 million. Since the referendum vote, outflows have subsided to a daily average of $13 million. Although it's still early days, we feel good about the momentum in our EMEA business. Going forward, we're focused on staying close to our clients, managing our core business and executing our strategy, while adapting to any changes that might be brought about by Brexit.
Before I hand the call over to Loren, let me say a few words about the new DOL fiduciary rule. We're actively engaged with clients as they work to understand the impact of the DOL rule on their business. For the past couple of years, our discussions with clients have intensified, moving from clarification, interpretation to practical application. We are in discussions with them regarding product implications, share class possibilities and how best to leverage robo solutions such as Jemstep.
Based on our early discussions, we continue to believe our comprehensive range of capability positions us very well to help our clients as the DOL rule is implemented. Additionally, given Invesco's tremendous expertise and experience partnering with clients to address regulatory topics, for example, our work on RDR in the U.K., we view this as an opportunity to further deepen our relationships, provide new capabilities and enhance our business overall.
With that, I will now turn it over to Loren to review the financials in more detail."
384779,373806894,1016348,"Invesco Ltd., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Invesco Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Marty. Okay. So quarter-over-quarter, you saw our total AUM increased by $8.1 billion or 1%. This was driven by positive market returns of $10.7 billion. We also saw long-term net inflows of $4.5 billion. I should note, of this $4.5 billion, $0.9",967,"Thanks, Marty. Okay. So quarter-over-quarter, you saw our total AUM increased by $8.1 billion or 1%. This was driven by positive market returns of $10.7 billion. We also saw long-term net inflows of $4.5 billion. I should note, of this $4.5 billion, $0.9 billion came from IDR leverage, which is classified as our institutional and passive Fixed Income. We also saw the acquisition of our India joint venture get completed, and that brought in $2.4 billion. We saw inflows from money market of $2 billion. These factors were offset by negative FX translation of $7.7 billion, and we also saw outflows from the QQQs of $3.8 billion.
Our average AUM for the second quarter was $784.5 billion. That was up 4.9% versus Q1. Our net revenue yield came in at 43.7 basis points, which is 0.1 basis points lower than the prior quarter. Although this was a small change, there were a variety of factors which impacted our yield in Q2. These included AUM mix and lower performance fees, which reduced the yield by 0.7 basis points and 0.4 basis points, respectively. These factors were offset by one more day in the period, which increased the yield by 0.4 basis points. In addition, currency mix and the increase in other revenue each contributed 0.3 basis points to net revenue yield in the quarter.
Next let's turn to the operating results, Page 13. Before I begin, I'd like to point out that we've evaluated and taken onboard the SEC's new guidance on non-GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, you'll have already noticed the changes that we made in the format of our second quarter earnings press release, which now focuses primarily on the U.S. GAAP results. In addition, the U.S. GAAP period-over-period variances are now set out in detail in our earnings release. Both our earnings release and this investor presentation contain detailed reconciliations between our U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP and, importantly, there's no change to how we've calculated our non-GAAP measures relative to prior quarters. So since we've already provided the U.S. GAAP narrative in the earnings press release, my comments today, consistent with the past practice, will focus exclusively on the variances related to our non-GAAP adjusted measures.
So actually, let's turn to the next page that's titled Non-GAAP Operating Results. You'll see net revenues increased by $38.5 million or 4.7% quarter-over-quarter to $856.6 million, which included a positive FX rate impact of $6.4 million. Within the net revenue number, you'll see that adjusted investment management fees increased by $32.6 million or 3.5% to $962.9 million. This reflects higher average AUM for the quarter. Foreign exchange increase adjusted investment management fees by $7.7 million. Our adjusted service and distribution revenues increased by $5.7 million or 2.9%, reflecting higher average AUM for retail products. Foreign exchange increased adjusted service and distribution revenue by $0.5 million.
Our adjusted performance fees came in at $9.3 million in Q2 and were earned from a variety of different investment capabilities, including $5.5 million from our bank loan products. Foreign exchange increased these fees by $0.1 million.
Our adjusted other revenues in the first quarter were $31.7 million, and that was an increase of $7.7 million from the prior quarter, and that was a result of increased transaction fees from real estate. Foreign exchange increased these revenues by $0.4 million. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, increased $1.3 million or 0.4%. This movement was in line with the higher revenue derived from our retail AUM, and FX increased these expenses by $2.3 million.
Moving further on down the slide, you'll see that adjusted operating expenses at $526.2 million increased by $15.2 million or 3% relative to Q1. Foreign exchange increased adjusted operating expenses by $4.1 million during the quarter.
Our adjusted employee compensation came in at $347.9 million, an increase of $7.6 million or 2.2%. This increase was driven by higher sales commissions and variable compensation costs, a full quarter of higher base salaries effective from March 1 and an increase in deferred compensation expenses for the awards granted in the first quarter. This was offset by a decline in the seasonal payroll taxes. FX increased our adjusted compensation by $2.8 million in the quarter.
Adjusted marketing expenses increased by $3.6 million or 14.2% to $29 million, reflecting the seasonal increase in client events. FX increased adjusted marketing expense by $0.3 million in the quarter.
Our adjusted property, office and technology expenses were $82.8 million in the quarter, an increase of $1.7 million versus Q1, driven by higher technology costs. FX increased these expenses by $0.5 million.
Adjusted G&A expense, at $66.5 million, increased $2.3 million or 3.6%, and this was driven by professional services expenses when compared to the prior quarter. And FX increased G&A by $0.5 million.
Going on further down the page, you'll see that adjusted nonoperating income increased $15 million compared to Q1, and this difference was largely driven by higher equity and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates in the second quarter but also the $7.1 million FX loss recognized in the prior quarter.
The firm's effective tax rate on pretax adjusted net income in Q2 was consistent with the prior quarter at 26.5%, which brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.56 and adjusted net operating margin of 38.6%.
And so finally, before I turn things over to Marty, I just want to provide a quick update on our capital management activities in the quarter. As you'll recall from our recent announcement, in addition to our ongoing share repurchase activity during the quarter, we entered into a $150 million accelerated share repurchase program on June 30. And as a result of this, our end-of-period share count declined by approximately 1.7% quarter-over-quarter to $413.1 million shares.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Marty."

Let me just make a couple of summary comments before we get to Q&A. We believe our ability to produce strong long-term net flows this quarter reflects the fundamental strength of our firm, our expertise across a broad range of fundamental and factor-based capabilities and our focus on helping retail and institutional clients achieve their investment objectives. We feel good about the momentum in our business, and flows were strong across the quarter as we helped clients manage through the volatility we saw in June.
Strong flows have continued into July, with more than $8 billion of long-term net inflows across a variety of capabilities and regions. This $8 billion includes $6.5 billion that is related to the 529 mandate, which was recently funded. As noted during our Investor Day event earlier this year, we are very well positioned to help clients be successful, which in turn will enhance our market relevance, drive growth and strengthen shareholder value over the long term.
And with that, Loren and I would like to take any questions you all have."

And we are also seeing retail investors making decisions on where to put their assets. And again, we point out, GTR has been a real beneficiary of that. And so people are looking to just relook at their asset allocation capabilities. The good news is the breadth of our capabilities put us in a position that we can be helpful to them in any which way. So it is early days, but everything we see -- I, frankly, think it's ultimately going to be an opportunity for a firm like us. We are positioned very strongly, structurally, for a Brexit. So that means we're not distracted by trying to having to revamp product lines or anything along that way, and we can just be really, really focused on clients.

So I think our expectation, even with markets being flat, which is the way we normally forecast anyway, and even with the pound being down where it is for the last half of the year, we would expect margins to be on an upward trajectory as we continue to grow organically and continue to work hard on the optimization work around cost. So the firm has done, I think, a really great job of creating capacity for investment without having to add to costs, really, through using, as we talked about in the past, greater use of our shared service centers, being able to leverage technology more effectively, streamlining, simplifying a lot of our processes. So that work is now going on, as you know, and so we're on track with respect to the optimization, which we've discussed, to provide some expense relief of roughly $30 million to $45 million by the end of the year. And so that run rate, which is actually now beginning to flow through our numbers, is something that's been very helpful. And just to remind people, we had those acquisitions that came on board, Jemstep and Religare. And those expenses are being offset through this optimization, whereas the revenues are showing up in the revenue line item. So we do think that, that's going to help further drive margin expansion. Our incremental margin continues to be at a very high level. And with that sort of 50% to -- 55% to 60% incremental margin and our fee rate, because of the mix that's coming in, particularly around institutional being the higher fee rate than what's going out, we'll continue to benefit from that. So I think all those factors, to us, say that we can continue to see margins increase and get up to the level that we've seen in the past without too much stretching. Clearly, it's a factor of the market, of course, and what continues there."

You're starting to see an institutional factor base, smart beta solutions. And so our debate internally is, what is the wise move of investing in these to get the returns versus being very cautious. And again, it's something we do all the time. But it's really that market relevance expansion of the business that's sitting right in front of us. And it's a very exciting time, quite frankly, for us."

So, obviously, the management fee rate does have -- is impacted by FX, and so there are some factors there as well as overall equity component versus non-equity. And so when the market declines, you'll see some of that change. There is another element around our gross management fee rate, which people should be aware of. It's the RDR impact, right? As we sort of continue to bleed out the old fee rate and replace it with a net fee rate, that has an impact on the gross management fee yields. And so I'd say that is sort of permanent and sustained as we go forward. But it doesn't have any impact on the net revenue yield, because commensurately, our -- what we're paying away goes away, too. So that's why it is -- you almost have to look at that net number to really understand the dynamic of that shifting mix. But there -- in terms of the trends around what's driving our management fee, still feel that it is quite stable. Maybe, I mean, to the extent that Europe is a little bit slower than it's been in the past, it's one engine that was driving that fee rate, which is probably not something we would necessarily look to be driving forward, but we are seeing continued engines around Asia alternatives, which is helping us continue to see that fee rate increase as well as the institutional mix generally being better. So I'd say the net revenue yield x performance fees quarter -- next quarter and going forward is kind of flattish to this quarter. And so that would be even with FX. So I think with FX down, obviously, that has a negative impact, but because the mix is positive, it's probably offsetting it. So hopefully that's helpful in terms of the modeling on the fee rate. A lot of dynamics underneath clearly have an impact. But generally, we expect to see that trend in terms of improving fee rate continue but maybe at a somewhat slower pace."

The more likely than not is Brexit is going to happen and that you're going to end up with trade agreements between the continent and the U.K. that are mutually beneficial. It's going to take time to get there. That said, let's get down to our business. Our business, as I was trying to highlight, we are already structured for a post-Brexit environment, very strong U.K. business, very strong continental business, and we don't see any changes there for all -- a range of reasons. And the impact on the business is going to be largely driven by the economic environment. And there is a scenario where it's less negative than everything that you've heard. I mean, with the pound depreciating, that's actually -- the exporters in the U.K. are actually doing very, very well. So I think the reality is it's going to be very hard at a political level, but I would say our business is a business that is structured for the change, and there is a need for asset management services. And we just really don't see this industry being hurt to the degree that some other businesses might be, where they're literally going to have to move people to different parts of -- out of the U.K., out of the continent and vice versa. It is just not part of what's going to happen to us as asset managers. Now there are some asset management firms that are not structured like we are, and they're going to have to do some work to get positioned to be continually successful. But again, we're trying very hard to point out, looking at the elements we talked about earlier, it's a huge part of the world. It's a strong part of the world. They're clearly going through some changes.

So we look at smart beta as a subset of factor investing. And again, I think very importantly -- I'm repeating myself, but we're one of very, very few firms that have a factor-based capability that's been in business 35 years and the fundamental investing that we have. And so it's that combination of those around the world for us that put us in a unique position. So factor investing outside of the United States is much more an institutional business. And it's growing in demand, whether it be on the continent. Loren mentioned that we're looking to do some things in the U.K. at the retail level. Actually there and Asia Pac, it's actually growing in demand. In the United States, it tends to be a retail focus and express the smart beta through ETFs. And where we look at our strategic positioning, and I think very importantly than -- differently than a mutual fund where you can have 200 of the same XYZ funds competing is very hard to see beyond, really, 3 ETFs of sort of the same color be successful just because of the nature of the ETF with market makers and the like. So first-mover advantage matters a lot. The other thing that really matters too is the longevity of -- so think length of track record. And if you look at the PowerShares lineup of smart beta, any number of funds are 10 years old. And so when people are looking to invest or looking at the length of capability, also looking at the liquidity within it. And so those are very different dynamics than you would have with a mutual fund. So the good news is people are coming in, so it sort of -- it confirms the attractiveness of smart beta. That said, it's going to -- it's a very, very competitive space to enter into, to say nothing of how do you work in conjunction with active management within your organization. So we think we're in a pretty good position."

I would be in a camp, consistent with others, that it does seem very different this time. And I -- one of it you could look at it as a maturing industry, but when you talk about active management, my view is you go in cycles, and we've had this beta run from '09 on with government intervention, which aligned the stars with cap-weighted indexes. That's not sustainable. So I think that's been overdone. That said, it's here to stay. I think you're going to see greater growth of factor investing, as we've said. But active management will actually -- it will thrive. I think those individuals that are calling it dead asset class are making a mistake. So that said, I think the other element that's really driving the notion of consolidation, it's the regulatory landscape. It is so costly to keep up with all of these, to say nothing in cyberspace. So it's rising costs in the competitive environment. And I think those are the dynamics that are going to also be changing -- be forces to drive consolidation. And luckily, we're fortunate enough to be positioned extremely well, as we've just been talking about on this call. I would say the business here has never been stronger. It's seemingly getting -- all engines are kicking in quite nicely and matched against the trends that are in place. And I think the people that try to catch up with the trends, it's going to be very hard. You need to have started them 3 years ago, 5 years ago, 7 years ago, honestly. That said, we don't see a lot of gaps, but we will continue to pay attention to the marketplace. And as we have in the past, selectively, as things can -- if we can become a stronger organization by teaming up with another organization, we'll continue to do that.

With regard to different wrappers, I -- if you look at next shares, it's interesting, but it can be 100% achieved by a share class in a mutual fund. And if you use an R6 share class, you get the exact outcome, via without the challenge of a different vehicle trying to get launched within a channel. And although it's creative, I think that's really been the headwind for it. So it could ultimately be successful. But again, I think there's an easier way to get there. And you really need to do it in conjunction with your clients, i.e., think distribution partners. So things will continue to evolve. I personally think that the area that will continue to grow the most and probably be most additive is smart beta, because it is -- you get better outcomes with smart beta than you do with cap-weighted indexes.

If you look at the value capabilities, I feel really, really good about the teams and how they're managing. What tends to be in those are energy and financials, which have been hurt here again in the volatility. So my basic view is that we continue to ensure that we have high quality teams that can deliver over a market cycle. And I think that's really the important thing. You can't look quarter-to-quarter, year by year. Calendars don't matter. Market cycles matter. And you're going to get excess returns with some strong asset management. And I think when the psychological environment moves, I think that's where you're going to really see the gross -- the net flows actually pick up in those active capabilities.

And as was just mentioned, Loren Starr, Invesco's CFO, is on call with me, and we'll be speaking to the presentation that's available on our website if you're so inclined to follow along. And as we typically do, I'll give an overview of the business results for the second quarter. Loren will go into greater detail on the financials and then, importantly, we'll open up to Q&A.
So let me begin by highlighting the firm's operating results for the quarter, which you'll find on Slide 4 of the deck. Long-term investment performance remained strong during the quarter. 68% to 73% of actively managed assets were ahead of peers on a 3- and 5-year -- 3 and 5 years, respectively. Strong investment performance and our continued focus on meeting clients' needs overcame the impact of volatile markets during the quarter. Strong client demand helped drive passive and institutional flows, which led to long-term inflows of $4.5 billion during the quarter.
The adjusted operating margin was 38.6%, an improvement over the prior quarter. And during the quarter, we returned $318 million to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.
Assets under management were $779 billion at the end of the second quarter, up from $771 billion in the first quarter. Adjusted operating income was $330 million in the quarter, up considerably from $307 million in the prior quarter.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.56 versus $0.49 in the prior quarter. Also noted during the quarter, we've raised our quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share, and we also repurchased $200 million of stock during the quarter.
Before Loren goes into details on the company's financials, let me take a few minutes to talk about investment performance and flows during the quarter.
Turning to Slide 7 now. Our commitment to investment excellence and our work to build and maintain strong investment culture helped us deliver solid long-term investment performance across the enterprise during the quarter.
Looking at the firm as whole, 68% of assets were in the top half on a 3-year basis, and 73% were in the top half on a 5-year basis.
On Page 8, you'll see that flows into passive capabilities were quite strong, while flows into active capabilities were flat with $4.5 billion in total long-term inflows. Flows into passive capabilities were driven by strong demand from Invesco's PowerShares capabilities. This was the second best quarter in Invesco PowerShares' history, with roughly $3.8 billion in net new assets, and the strong flows are helping us to continue to gain ETF market share. This reflects the longevity and the breadth of the PowerShares offering as well as our continued focus on meeting client needs. We are well positioned in the current market environment through our low volatility suite, commodity suite, Fixed Income and bank loan ETFs. As you're probably aware, smart beta strategies are growing at nearly twice the pace of the overall ETF market. Although this is prompting a wave of fund launches by competitors, our expertise in smart beta and factor investing continue to differentiate us in the market and help us gain share. Although long-term flows were flat on the active side, we saw solid demand for alternatives including real estate, multi-asset capabilities as well as Fixed Income.
Asia Pacific demonstrated continued strength across retail and institutional, with tremendous momentum continuing into the third quarter. A continued focus on delivering strong investment performance and bringing our broad range of capabilities to clients contribute to the very positive results in the region.
Globally, we also saw strong institutional flows during the quarter, which reflects our continued focus on this channel and results in a series of positive institutional flows going back 2 years. 
Client demand trends remain consistent, with particularly strong interest in Fixed Income, multi-asset, real estate, and our institutional pipeline remains very strong. So at the end of June, the won but not funded pipeline is up 15% on assets under management versus the prior quarter and the prior year.
Retail flows were flat this quarter as investors weighed their options during some of the late quarter volatility. That said, we continue to see strength in Fixed Income, U.S. dividend strategies as well as retail alternative capabilities, specifically GTR and real estate.
Now let me take a moment and highlight the business in EMEA. Our #1 position, U.K. retail, our strong cross-border retail business and our robust institutional pipeline across EMEA all position us extremely well ahead of a potential Brexit. We've positioned our business over many years to serve clients who are located in a variety of countries across the region. Our people in fund ranges are organized to meet those local needs. We are well diversified across channel, with U.K. retail, cross-border and institutional each comprising roughly 1/3 of our business in the region. We are also diversified across asset class, with assets spread across equity, bond and multi-asset capabilities. Lastly, with more than 1,300 people in the region, we are well placed across the region with strong business in both the U.K. and on the continent. And our level of diversification and our construct positions us extremely well to deliver for our clients in EMEA.
Investors across Europe reacted thoughtfully to the market volatility that occurred at the time around the vote. Since then, clients have taken advantage of the market movements by utilizing the full range of Invesco's comprehensive fund range to achieve their long-term investment objectives. As an example, we've seen strong movement in the capabilities such as our highly regarded Global Targeted Returns fund as clients seek to manage risk in their portfolios.
With regard to flows, our business in EMEA has demonstrated good resiliency through the Brexit topic, with flows improving when compared to the prior quarter, pre the announcement of the results of the U.K. referendum on June 23. For the month of June, up to the date of the Brexit vote, we saw daily average outflows of approximately $78 million. Since the referendum vote, outflows have subsided to a daily average of $13 million. Although it's still early days, we feel good about the momentum in our EMEA business. Going forward, we're focused on staying close to our clients, managing our core business and executing our strategy, while adapting to any changes that might be brought about by Brexit.
Before I hand the call over to Loren, let me say a few words about the new DOL fiduciary rule. We're actively engaged with clients as they work to understand the impact of the DOL rule on their business. For the past couple of years, our discussions with clients have intensified, moving from clarification, interpretation to practical application. We are in discussions with them regarding product implications, share class possibilities and how best to leverage robo solutions such as Jemstep.
Based on our early discussions, we continue to believe our comprehensive range of capability positions us very well to help our clients as the DOL rule is implemented. Additionally, given Invesco's tremendous expertise and experience partnering with clients to address regulatory topics, for example, our work on RDR in the U.K., we view this as an opportunity to further deepen our relationships, provide new capabilities and enhance our business overall.
With that, I will now turn it over to Loren to review the financials in more detail."
384779,373806894,1016762,"Invesco Ltd., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Invesco Ltd.","Executives","Thanks, Marty. Okay. So quarter-over-quarter, you saw our total AUM increased by $8.1 billion or 1%. This was driven by positive market returns of $10.7 billion. We also saw long-term net inflows of $4.5 billion. I should note, of this $4.5 billion, $0.9",967,"Thanks, Marty. Okay. So quarter-over-quarter, you saw our total AUM increased by $8.1 billion or 1%. This was driven by positive market returns of $10.7 billion. We also saw long-term net inflows of $4.5 billion. I should note, of this $4.5 billion, $0.9 billion came from IDR leverage, which is classified as our institutional and passive Fixed Income. We also saw the acquisition of our India joint venture get completed, and that brought in $2.4 billion. We saw inflows from money market of $2 billion. These factors were offset by negative FX translation of $7.7 billion, and we also saw outflows from the QQQs of $3.8 billion.
Our average AUM for the second quarter was $784.5 billion. That was up 4.9% versus Q1. Our net revenue yield came in at 43.7 basis points, which is 0.1 basis points lower than the prior quarter. Although this was a small change, there were a variety of factors which impacted our yield in Q2. These included AUM mix and lower performance fees, which reduced the yield by 0.7 basis points and 0.4 basis points, respectively. These factors were offset by one more day in the period, which increased the yield by 0.4 basis points. In addition, currency mix and the increase in other revenue each contributed 0.3 basis points to net revenue yield in the quarter.
Next let's turn to the operating results, Page 13. Before I begin, I'd like to point out that we've evaluated and taken onboard the SEC's new guidance on non-GAAP financial measures. Accordingly, you'll have already noticed the changes that we made in the format of our second quarter earnings press release, which now focuses primarily on the U.S. GAAP results. In addition, the U.S. GAAP period-over-period variances are now set out in detail in our earnings release. Both our earnings release and this investor presentation contain detailed reconciliations between our U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP and, importantly, there's no change to how we've calculated our non-GAAP measures relative to prior quarters. So since we've already provided the U.S. GAAP narrative in the earnings press release, my comments today, consistent with the past practice, will focus exclusively on the variances related to our non-GAAP adjusted measures.
So actually, let's turn to the next page that's titled Non-GAAP Operating Results. You'll see net revenues increased by $38.5 million or 4.7% quarter-over-quarter to $856.6 million, which included a positive FX rate impact of $6.4 million. Within the net revenue number, you'll see that adjusted investment management fees increased by $32.6 million or 3.5% to $962.9 million. This reflects higher average AUM for the quarter. Foreign exchange increase adjusted investment management fees by $7.7 million. Our adjusted service and distribution revenues increased by $5.7 million or 2.9%, reflecting higher average AUM for retail products. Foreign exchange increased adjusted service and distribution revenue by $0.5 million.
Our adjusted performance fees came in at $9.3 million in Q2 and were earned from a variety of different investment capabilities, including $5.5 million from our bank loan products. Foreign exchange increased these fees by $0.1 million.
Our adjusted other revenues in the first quarter were $31.7 million, and that was an increase of $7.7 million from the prior quarter, and that was a result of increased transaction fees from real estate. Foreign exchange increased these revenues by $0.4 million. Third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, increased $1.3 million or 0.4%. This movement was in line with the higher revenue derived from our retail AUM, and FX increased these expenses by $2.3 million.
Moving further on down the slide, you'll see that adjusted operating expenses at $526.2 million increased by $15.2 million or 3% relative to Q1. Foreign exchange increased adjusted operating expenses by $4.1 million during the quarter.
Our adjusted employee compensation came in at $347.9 million, an increase of $7.6 million or 2.2%. This increase was driven by higher sales commissions and variable compensation costs, a full quarter of higher base salaries effective from March 1 and an increase in deferred compensation expenses for the awards granted in the first quarter. This was offset by a decline in the seasonal payroll taxes. FX increased our adjusted compensation by $2.8 million in the quarter.
Adjusted marketing expenses increased by $3.6 million or 14.2% to $29 million, reflecting the seasonal increase in client events. FX increased adjusted marketing expense by $0.3 million in the quarter.
Our adjusted property, office and technology expenses were $82.8 million in the quarter, an increase of $1.7 million versus Q1, driven by higher technology costs. FX increased these expenses by $0.5 million.
Adjusted G&A expense, at $66.5 million, increased $2.3 million or 3.6%, and this was driven by professional services expenses when compared to the prior quarter. And FX increased G&A by $0.5 million.
Going on further down the page, you'll see that adjusted nonoperating income increased $15 million compared to Q1, and this difference was largely driven by higher equity and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates in the second quarter but also the $7.1 million FX loss recognized in the prior quarter.
The firm's effective tax rate on pretax adjusted net income in Q2 was consistent with the prior quarter at 26.5%, which brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.56 and adjusted net operating margin of 38.6%.
And so finally, before I turn things over to Marty, I just want to provide a quick update on our capital management activities in the quarter. As you'll recall from our recent announcement, in addition to our ongoing share repurchase activity during the quarter, we entered into a $150 million accelerated share repurchase program on June 30. And as a result of this, our end-of-period share count declined by approximately 1.7% quarter-over-quarter to $413.1 million shares.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Marty."

Strong flows have continued into July, with more than $8 billion of long-term net inflows across a variety of capabilities and regions. This $8 billion includes $6.5 billion that is related to the 529 mandate, which was recently funded. As noted during our Investor Day event earlier this year, we are very well positioned to help clients be successful, which in turn will enhance our market relevance, drive growth and strengthen shareholder value over the long term.

And we are also seeing retail investors making decisions on where to put their assets. And again, we point out, GTR has been a real beneficiary of that. And so people are looking to just relook at their asset allocation capabilities. The good news is the breadth of our capabilities put us in a position that we can be helpful to them in any which way. So it is early days, but everything we see -- I, frankly, think it's ultimately going to be an opportunity for a firm like us. We are positioned very strongly, structurally, for a Brexit. So that means we're not distracted by trying to having to revamp product lines or anything along that way, and we can just be really, really focused on clients.

So I would view that as a little bit one-off-ish with respect to kind of the equity -- active equity  outflow. The other elements are sort of somewhat consistent with past -- what you've seen in the past. So I don't think there's anything that's sort of accelerating outflow relative to that category other than that one element."

So if we were to see a more range-bound market, which obviously feels like a big if right now, but under that scenario, how should we think about the trajectory of the margin for the rest of the year?

So I think our expectation, even with markets being flat, which is the way we normally forecast anyway, and even with the pound being down where it is for the last half of the year, we would expect margins to be on an upward trajectory as we continue to grow organically and continue to work hard on the optimization work around cost. So the firm has done, I think, a really great job of creating capacity for investment without having to add to costs, really, through using, as we talked about in the past, greater use of our shared service centers, being able to leverage technology more effectively, streamlining, simplifying a lot of our processes. So that work is now going on, as you know, and so we're on track with respect to the optimization, which we've discussed, to provide some expense relief of roughly $30 million to $45 million by the end of the year. And so that run rate, which is actually now beginning to flow through our numbers, is something that's been very helpful. And just to remind people, we had those acquisitions that came on board, Jemstep and Religare. And those expenses are being offset through this optimization, whereas the revenues are showing up in the revenue line item. So we do think that, that's going to help further drive margin expansion. Our incremental margin continues to be at a very high level. And with that sort of 50% to -- 55% to 60% incremental margin and our fee rate, because of the mix that's coming in, particularly around institutional being the higher fee rate than what's going out, we'll continue to benefit from that. So I think all those factors, to us, say that we can continue to see margins increase and get up to the level that we've seen in the past without too much stretching. Clearly, it's a factor of the market, of course, and what continues there."

You're starting to see an institutional factor base, smart beta solutions. And so our debate internally is, what is the wise move of investing in these to get the returns versus being very cautious. And again, it's something we do all the time. But it's really that market relevance expansion of the business that's sitting right in front of us.

So, obviously, the management fee rate does have -- is impacted by FX, and so there are some factors there as well as overall equity component versus non-equity. And so when the market declines, you'll see some of that change. There is another element around our gross management fee rate, which people should be aware of. It's the RDR impact, right? As we sort of continue to bleed out the old fee rate and replace it with a net fee rate, that has an impact on the gross management fee yields. And so I'd say that is sort of permanent and sustained as we go forward. But it doesn't have any impact on the net revenue yield, because commensurately, our -- what we're paying away goes away, too. So that's why it is -- you almost have to look at that net number to really understand the dynamic of that shifting mix. But there -- in terms of the trends around what's driving our management fee, still feel that it is quite stable. Maybe, I mean, to the extent that Europe is a little bit slower than it's been in the past, it's one engine that was driving that fee rate, which is probably not something we would necessarily look to be driving forward, but we are seeing continued engines around Asia alternatives, which is helping us continue to see that fee rate increase as well as the institutional mix generally being better. So I'd say the net revenue yield x performance fees quarter -- next quarter and going forward is kind of flattish to this quarter. And so that would be even with FX. So I think with FX down, obviously, that has a negative impact, but because the mix is positive, it's probably offsetting it. So hopefully that's helpful in terms of the modeling on the fee rate. A lot of dynamics underneath clearly have an impact. But generally, we expect to see that trend in terms of improving fee rate continue but maybe at a somewhat slower pace."

It's going to take time to get there. That said, let's get down to our business. Our business, as I was trying to highlight, we are already structured for a post-Brexit environment, very strong U.K. business, very strong continental business, and we don't see any changes there for all -- a range of reasons. And the impact on the business is going to be largely driven by the economic environment. And there is a scenario where it's less negative than everything that you've heard. I mean, with the pound depreciating, that's actually -- the exporters in the U.K. are actually doing very, very well. So I think the reality is it's going to be very hard at a political level, but I would say our business is a business that is structured for the change, and there is a need for asset management services. And we just really don't see this industry being hurt to the degree that some other businesses might be, where they're literally going to have to move people to different parts of -- out of the U.K., out of the continent and vice versa. It is just not part of what's going to happen to us as asset managers. Now there are some asset management firms that are not structured like we are, and they're going to have to do some work to get positioned to be continually successful.

In terms of our non-GAAP disclosure, what we've done is we've backed out that mark-to-market, and we are only bringing in what has been actually realized. And so this quarter, that was a very small amount of money in terms of the impact for next couple of quarters. Just based on the current rate, that's probably close to $0.01 in EPS for each of the quarters going forward. So in terms of what we would do if we were going to roll it, because we have it out through to Q1, I think we're going to be patient and think about whether we need to or want to, but obviously, again, have to look at the cost. For us to sort of lock in right now at current rates or at discount to current rates, because we've been using out-of-the-money puts, I'm not sure if anybody would be too excited about a hedge, 1.25 or something like that. So it is something that we're going to continue to look at and evaluate as to whether we continue to roll this thing. But certainly, we're going to hold on to what we've got right now and continue to benefit, at least from a cash flow and EPS perspective from the protection it's providing us."

So we look at smart beta as a subset of factor investing. And again, I think very importantly -- I'm repeating myself, but we're one of very, very few firms that have a factor-based capability that's been in business 35 years and the fundamental investing that we have. And so it's that combination of those around the world for us that put us in a unique position. So factor investing outside of the United States is much more an institutional business. And it's growing in demand, whether it be on the continent. Loren mentioned that we're looking to do some things in the U.K. at the retail level. Actually there and Asia Pac, it's actually growing in demand. In the United States, it tends to be a retail focus and express the smart beta through ETFs. And where we look at our strategic positioning, and I think very importantly than -- differently than a mutual fund where you can have 200 of the same XYZ funds competing is very hard to see beyond, really, 3 ETFs of sort of the same color be successful just because of the nature of the ETF with market makers and the like. So first-mover advantage matters a lot. The other thing that really matters too is the longevity of -- so think length of track record. And if you look at the PowerShares lineup of smart beta, any number of funds are 10 years old. And so when people are looking to invest or looking at the length of capability, also looking at the liquidity within it. And so those are very different dynamics than you would have with a mutual fund. So the good news is people are coming in, so it sort of -- it confirms the attractiveness of smart beta. That said, it's going to -- it's a very, very competitive space to enter into, to say nothing of how do you work in conjunction with active management within your organization. So we think we're in a pretty good position."

I would be in a camp, consistent with others, that it does seem very different this time. And I -- one of it you could look at it as a maturing industry, but when you talk about active management, my view is you go in cycles, and we've had this beta run from '09 on with government intervention, which aligned the stars with cap-weighted indexes. That's not sustainable. So I think that's been overdone. That said, it's here to stay. I think you're going to see greater growth of factor investing, as we've said. But active management will actually -- it will thrive. I think those individuals that are calling it dead asset class are making a mistake. So that said, I think the other element that's really driving the notion of consolidation, it's the regulatory landscape. It is so costly to keep up with all of these, to say nothing in cyberspace. So it's rising costs in the competitive environment. And I think those are the dynamics that are going to also be changing -- be forces to drive consolidation. And luckily, we're fortunate enough to be positioned extremely well, as we've just been talking about on this call. I would say the business here has never been stronger. It's seemingly getting -- all engines are kicking in quite nicely and matched against the trends that are in place. And I think the people that try to catch up with the trends, it's going to be very hard. You need to have started them 3 years ago, 5 years ago, 7 years ago, honestly. That said, we don't see a lot of gaps, but we will continue to pay attention to the marketplace. And as we have in the past, selectively, as things can -- if we can become a stronger organization by teaming up with another organization, we'll continue to do that.

So we have the capability to do it, we keep analyzing it. We've just not seen that as a big -- a lot of demand for it. Now if you read the papers, you would think that's all anybody cares about. So that's been our experience, so maybe we just have it wrong, but that's our experience. With regard to different wrappers, I -- if you look at next shares, it's interesting, but it can be 100% achieved by a share class in a mutual fund. And if you use an R6 share class, you get the exact outcome, via without the challenge of a different vehicle trying to get launched within a channel. And although it's creative, I think that's really been the headwind for it. So it could ultimately be successful. But again, I think there's an easier way to get there. And you really need to do it in conjunction with your clients, i.e., think distribution partners. So things will continue to evolve. I personally think that the area that will continue to grow the most and probably be most additive is smart beta, because it is -- you get better outcomes with smart beta than you do with cap-weighted indexes. So I think that's really going to be where the gravitational pull is when you look at these ranges of capabilities that you just highlighted. So that's our view. We could be wrong, but that's what we're thinking right now."

If you look at the value capabilities, I feel really, really good about the teams and how they're managing. What tends to be in those are energy and financials, which have been hurt here again in the volatility. So my basic view is that we continue to ensure that we have high quality teams that can deliver over a market cycle. And I think that's really the important thing. You can't look quarter-to-quarter, year by year. Calendars don't matter. Market cycles matter. And you're going to get excess returns with some strong asset management. And I think when the psychological environment moves, I think that's where you're going to really see the gross -- the net flows actually pick up in those active capabilities.

As is our practice, I will review the business results for the third quarter and then Loren will go into greater details about the financials and then we'll open up to Q&A after that. 
So let me begin by highlighting the firm's operating results for the quarter, and you'll find this on Slide 4, if you happen to be following the presentation, which is available on our website. 
Long-term investment performance remained -- continue to be very strong. 68% to 79% of actively managed assets were ahead of peers on a 3 and 5-year basis, respectively. 
Our continued focus on leveraging overbroad investment capabilities provide meaningful solutions to clients contributed solid operating results during the quarter and what I think all of us would describe as a difficult business environment for money managers. 
Growing investment funds helped drive robust long-term net flows of $1.2 billion during the quarter, reflecting solid retail and institutional demand across both active and passive capabilities, and total flows during the quarter were just over $19 billion. 
The adjusted operating margin was 39.7%, an improvement over the prior quarter that reflects our continued focus on running a disciplined business. 
We also returned $176 million to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks during the quarter. 
Assets under management were $820 billion at the end of the quarter, up from $779 billion in the second quarter. Adjusted operating income was $339 billion in the quarter, up from $330 million in the prior quarter. 
Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.60 this quarter versus $0.56 in the prior quarter. 
And as noted earlier in the year, we raised our quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share nearly 4% prior year. We also continued out stock program during the quarter. 
And before Loren goes into detail on the financials, let me take a moment to review the investment performance inflows for the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 7 now. Our commitment to investment excellence and our work to build and maintain strong -- a strong investment culture helped us to deliver strong solid long-term investment performance across the enterprise during the quarter. 
Looking at the firm as a whole, 68% of assets were in the top half on a 3-year basis, 79% were in the top half on a 5-year basis. 
On Page 8, you'll see the quarterly long-term flows of $12.2 billion were quite strong across both active and passive capabilities. Flows from the passive capabilities were driven by strong demand from Invesco PowerShares capability, which has an all weather lineup that was well-positioned to meet client demand in any type of market. This was the second best quarter for in Invesco PowerShares in its history, with roughly $4 billion in net flows, and strong flows are helping us continue to gain ETF market share. 
As we noted during our recent Investor Day, strong passing flows reflected our longevity in the ETF market. Our deep experience are comprehensive range of factor in smart beta capabilities and our significant track record of innovation. 
Results on the active side were equally as impressive, with solid demand and multi-asset, dividend income capabilities, Fixed Income and other capabilities such as real estate. 
Our focus on delivering strong investment performance and bringing our broad range of capabilities to clients contribute positive results in Asia Pacific, with strengths across both retail and institutional channels. 
Globally, we saw institutional flows during the quarter, which continues a series of positive institutional flows going back more than 2 years now. 
Client demand trends remain consistent with particular interest in Fixed Income, multi-asset, real estate and are won but not funded and qualified opportunities are in all-time high. 
Retail flows also were strong as gross sales rebounded nicely and redemptions moderated during the quarter. This includes a $6.5 billion Rhode Island 529 mandate. 
Before I hand the call over to Loren, let me say a few words about how Invesco's positioned against the changes being brought by the DOL fudiciary rule. We're actively engaged with clients that work to align the platforms to the demands of the fiduciary rule. As we've made clear since the rule's approval, the key decisions reside with the discretion platforms, but we are actively supportive them. The market has gotten an early from Edward Jones, Merrill Lynch and [indiscernible] Morgan Stanley, but I believe we are still in a very dynamic period with regard to how it will play out. 
It's clear each distributor has a different business mix and will implement the rule in a manner that will be meet its clients' needs. 
Based on the discussions we're having with clients, we could be to believe there are comprehensive range of capabilities are distribution expertise and market leadership all positions us extremely well to help our clients, adjusted business with the provisions of the DOL rule. 
If the ship [indiscernible] passive as some believe, our decade of ETF experience or comprehensive of range of factors smart beta capabilities are scale are significant track record of innovation, all put us in a very competitive position. 
As we mentioned during the Investor Day, there are no barriers to entry, but very high hurdles to success in the ETF business that will make it difficult for late comers to do well. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Loren to review the financials."

Quarter-over-quarter, our total assets under management increased $40.6 [ph] billion or 5.2%. This was driven by positive market returns of $23.6 billion. We also saw long-term net inflows of $12.2 billion, which included, as yo",1164,"Thanks very much, Marty. 
Quarter-over-quarter, our total assets under management increased $40.6 [ph] billion or 5.2%. This was driven by positive market returns of $23.6 billion. We also saw long-term net inflows of $12.2 billion, which included, as you know, $6.5 billion related to Invesco's Rhode Island 529 plan win. 
We also saw inflows from money market in QQQs of $5.9 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. These were offset by negative FX translation, which amounted to $2.2 billion. 
Our average AUM for the third quarter was $814.1 billion. That was up 3.8% versus the second quarter. Our annualized long-term growth rate in Q3 was 7.1%, and that was up from 2.6% in second quarter. This measure represents our long-term flows in the quarter divided by the beginning of period long-term AUM, which excludes the institutional money market assets and the QQQ assets. 
Our net revenue yield came in at 42 basis points, which was 1.7 basis points lower than the prior quarter. The change in mix, largely driven by currency, reduced the yield by 1.1 basis points. This was primarily resulted the declining pound sterling rate, which was 8.4% lower on average during the third quarter compared to the second quarter. 
Also, we saw a decrease in other revenues, which reduced the yield by 0.7 basis points and lower performance fees in the quarter further depressed the yield by 0.3 basis points. These factors were offset by one more day in the period, which increased the yield by 0.4 basis points. 
A little bit of guidance here. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we would expect our net revenue yield to be roughly in line with the third quarter levels at 42 basis points, assuming consistent markets and FX levels in line with today. 
So moving on to Slide 12. As we've done before, we provide a U.S. GAAP operating results for the quarter. My comments today, however, will focus exclusively on the variances related to our non-GAAP adjusted measures, which can be found on Slide 13. 
Slide 13, you'll see net revenues decreased by $1.9 million or 0.2% quarter-over-quarter to $854.7 million, which includes a negative FX rate impact of $18.5 million. 
Within the net revenue number, you'll see that adjusted investment management fees increased by $19.8 million or 2.1% to $982.7 million. This reflects higher average AUM for the quarter, partially offset by the impact of currency on our AUM mix. 
FX decreased adjusted investment management fees by $23 million. 
Adjusted service and distribution revenues increased by $10 million or 4.9%, reflecting higher average AUM for retail products. FX decreased adjusted service and distribution revenues by $0.1 million. 
Adjusted performance fees came in at $3.8 million in Q3 and were earned from a variety of different investment capabilities, including $2.3 million from bank loan products. Foreign exchange decreased these fees by $0.1 million. 
Again, some guidance here. In Q4, we'd expect performance fee to be in line with our historical guidance at $5 million in the quarter. 
Adjusted other revenues in the third quarter were $19.3 million, and that was a decrease of $12.4 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to an decrease of $7.3 million in transaction fees from real estate and a $2 million decrease in transactional sales charges from our UIT products. 
Foreign exchange decreased these revenues by $0.1 million. 
The guidance here, looking forward to Q4, we would expect to see this number increase in the range of $23 million to $25 million. 
Third-party distribution services and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, increased by $13.8 [ph] million or 3.9%, and this movement was in line with higher revenues derived from our retail assets under management. FX decrease these expenses by $4.8 million. 
Moving on down the slide, you'll see that adjusted operating expenses at $515.4 [ph] million decreased by $10.8 million or 2.1%. Relative to the second quarter, foreign exchange reduced adjusted operating expenses by $8.2 million during the quarter. 
Our adjusted employee compensation came in at $339.1 million, a drop of $8.8 million or 2.5%, and this was due to lower variable compensation on performance fees. 
Foreign exchange decreased adjusted compensation by $5.1 million. Adjusted marketing expenses fell by $2.2 million or 7.6%, $26.8 million reflecting fewer client events held in the quarter, FX decreased adjusted marketing expense by $0.3 million in the quarter. 
Our adjusted property office and tech expenses were $82.1 million in the quarter, a decrease of $0.7 million over the second quarter, and FX decreased these expenses by $1.2 million. 
And then adjusted G&A expenses at $67.4 [ph] million increased $0.9 million or 1.4%, and this was driven by costs associated with several new product introductions, foreign exchange decreased adjusted G&A by $1.6 million. 
Again, some guidance for Q4. We would expect to see these expense line items roughly flat with the third quarter other than marketing. We expect marketing to -- marketing spend to increase in the range of $32 million to $35 million, which is seasonally consistent with prior years. 
Continuing on down the page, you'll see that our adjusted nonoperating income increased $9 million compared to the second quarter. This was primarily driven by a $4.9 million gain realized on our pound sterling U.S. dollar hedge as well as due to mark-to-market gains on our seed money investments in the third quarter. 
Firm's effective tax rate on pretax adjusted net income in Q3 came in at 26.5%, consistent with the prior quarter. The guidance here looking forward to the fourth quarter, we believe our tax rate will increase slightly to 27%, largely due to the currency impact on the mix of our earnings. 
And this brings us our adjusted EPS of $0.60 [ph] and adjusted net operating margin of 39.7%. 
I would say just generally as you probably would expect that foreign exchange has had a real impact on our operating results as reported in U.S. dollars, just to quantify that for you. When we look at our Q3 versus Q2 results, EPS was -- our operating EPS was resulted 1.8 cents lower as a result of foreign exchange as well as our margin being impacted by 0.3%. 
Looking at year-over-year, Q3 to Q3, the numbers are larger, obviously. EPS is down 3.4 cents due to currency and our margin is down 0.7% as a result of FX only. 
So with that, before I turn it over to Marty, I'd also like to provide a quick update on the business optimization work that we implemented in Q4 of last year. We made very good progress on our optimization efforts and have generated approximately $14 [ph] million in annual run rate savings by the end of the third quarter. Some of the bigger opportunities are ahead of us, however, but we are confident that we'll be able to achieve the targeted run rate savings number, as we discussed, of $30 million to $45 million in 2017. 
And with that, I'd like to turn it back to Marty."

You had that the Brexit [indiscernible] and some of the challenges on the challenges on the [indiscernible] generally, and it's lower than what we had seen previously. But the U.K. has really come back from that sort of the Brexit low. But again, nothing robust. That inflow as we saw a year ago. But again, I think we feel we're on track. In the States, with regard to the DOL rule, it's hard to point to the behavior with anything to do with the DOL. I think it's still more the active, passive debate that's probably driving the behavior more than anything right now is will it going forward? It will definitely put an awful lot of money in motion in the U.S. retail channel [indiscernible] my mind as people never changes from brokers to advisory and as brokers narrow the platforms of money managers.

In Asia PAC, we're seeing significant flows coming in, particularly into Japan [indiscernible] has been a big winner there.

In Continental Europe, net flows continue to really be a little bit mixed, but our GTR product in particular just every quarter continues to grow both in the U.K. and in Continental Europe. So that's a continued trend and we're very excited about some of the new product introductions, FYI, in terms of the income-oriented product that is similar to the GTR product. In the U.S., it's been sort of a mix of things. We're seeing very strong take on on products like our diversified dividend product. Our core bond plus fund is doing very well. And then certainly ETFs very strong flows into senior loan products and other fixed income products. I think we're deferred most successful ETF provider and Fixed Income year-to-date in the U.S. So that's a trend. And then some of that in the U.S. there have been some outflows in some of the other products that are more value-oriented that have seen performance tick down a little bit.

And I put the third element into it, where again is different firm by firm, but those firms can take the capabilities, will it be a mutual fund or an ETF vehicle and help create solutions for clients, and this is even at the broker level, are going to do well. The other element that people are talking about, I think, and I think we have to all get in the right context, the price sensitivity, it is real. The way the financial advisers gonna to meet that need is really a combination of active and passive capabilities that will drive down the overall effective CIP rate for the plans, which is a good thing. And again, I think specifically vehicle by vehicle, you need to be competitively priced. If you are selling at a -- if you're at a premium price and if you have very strong performance, you probably hopefully can keep it there, but there's going to be real pressure there. If you're at a premium price, you're not performing or you're in a lot of trouble. So -- and we do believe that the platforms, they will be narrowed and again, each firms would be different. And we look at ourselves as being at the right side of those outcomes."

And so by now, there's been this declaration of massive consolidation for a couple of decades. I would say the reality is the the environment we're in now would support that notion more than ever before. And I'd say much has been driven by the regulatory environment principally and just the ever-increasing costs. You then add things like cybersecurities, there is -- we'll spend a lot of money where we never did before. And then the extended period of the active, passive movement, which, again, I would also say it's -- when you read about in the paper every day, it's probably gone too far, right? It's not going back to where it was, but it will moderate. And I do believe there will be a very strong place for active capabilities, too. And again, we're in a position of the think the answer is active and passive. So we're well placed regardless. So I think what you're going to have happen on the M&A front is if you were a firm without scale, I think you're going to need to do something. And so I think you're going to see the likelihood of combinations of undersized firms that's probably higher than it's ever been before. And the other point, though, is somebody has to be willing buyer and not everybody is going to be a willing buyer of some of those firms. So I think what you'll see is organic growth coming from firms that really in a [indiscernible] position in this environment."

And then certainly, when there is more volatility, uncertainty in the markets, you can see that, that number either [indiscernible] up or slow down. There's the component of our UIT sales that have slowed down just in line or in respect to the DOL uncertainties. And so I think that is something that should hopefully begin to be more clear as to whether that's a true run rate or whether it can come back. But I think for right now, we're looking quarter-to-quarter on that line item. So that's it. In terms of expenses, is there more to be done? I mean, there's always more to be done. We're continuing to look beyond some of the things that we identified in the optimization to see if there are other sort of larger opportunities that can be realized into 2017. As we all know, when we get into our -- looking out 3 years and understanding the need for our incremental margins to be where we want them to be, we have to continue to look and find ways to organize ourselves in a way that would provide those net outcomes. So I would say there is more to come on that to the extent that we can identify them. But certainly, in the near-term in terms of the optimization, we're eagerly going after those opportunities."

So we feel, again, we're uniquely placed with the capabilities we have that it would be stupid of us not to continue to invest and grow the ETF business or the institutional business or the solutions business.

So we'd continue to see the institutional pipeline at a much higher revenue yield coming in then what's coming out in terms of the mix generally of the products on the retail side, Asia, China, very positive relative to the overall fee rate for the firm. So that -- which would make you think why the fee rate must be going up has been offset obviously due to the FX impacts because, obviously, the pound has declined even further from where we were in the third quarter, and that's why it's in the flattish kind of range. But again, the trends that have been there for a long time are still there in terms of the types of products that we're offering more alternatives, things that it do support a higher fee rate are absolutely still there.

Now again, I'd come back in -- to in this environment, what are -- there's some awful a lot of work to comply with the DOL. And so it's firms like us that have the depth of capability through wholesalers and Invesco consulting that can help make the move because they are real moves that -- with the client base. So again, we have the resources, we have the capabilities and we can help them make those changes. I think the biggest concern that I think everybody has heard over more recently was real concern that there was going to be a large proliferation of share classes because each distributor wanting to serve the clients in a different way. And I know there's no great insights, but it seems to be then the industry coalescing probably on a couple of share of classes, which would be there's some costs associated with it, but I mean, that's very doable and I think it's much our outcome for both [indiscernible] clients. So again, I think what I'd do is go back to the firms that have resources and capabilities to support their clients through this change are going to be in a better position than those that don't.

The nature of the support is going to be very different. And the field support, if you want call it that, will be much more of individual's focus on solutions, how the -- and is their working on their asset allocation, how do you help them build a portfolio range of different investment capabilities, range of different vehicles that would meet their needs. So it would be a very different type of support. So what you can't size right now is does it stay the same, but just different skill sets or is there a sort of size issue that you're talking about? And I'd say it's too early to conclude whether or not there are cost savings there. And my instincts would be the demand for the support is going to be both is going to be different.

As is our practice, I'll review the business results for the third quarter and then Loren will go into greater details about the financials, and then we'll open up to Q&A after that.
So let me begin by highlighting the firm's operating results for the quarter. And you'll find this on Slide 4, if you happen to be following the presentation which is available on our website.
Long-term investment performance remained -- continued to be very strong. 68% and 79% of actively managed assets were ahead of peers on a 3- and 5-year basis, respectively. Our continued focus on leveraging our broad investment capabilities to provide meaningful solutions to clients contributed solid operating results during the quarter in what I think all of us would describe as a difficult business environment for money managers. Strong investment forms helped drive robust long-term net flows of $1.2 billion (sic) [ $ 12.2 billion ] during the quarter, reflecting solid retail and institutional demand across both active and passive capabilities. And total flows during the quarter were just over $19 billion. Adjusted -- the adjusted operating margin was 39.7%, an improvement over the prior quarter that reflects our continued focus on running a disciplined business.
We also returned $176 million to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks during the quarter.
Assets under management were $820 billion at the end of the quarter, up from $779 billion in the second quarter. Adjusted operating income was $339 billion (sic) [ $339 million ] in the quarter, up from $330 million in the prior quarter.
Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.60 this quarter versus $0.56 in the prior quarter. And as noted, earlier in the year, we raised our quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share. It was up nearly 4% from the prior year. We also continued our stock programs during the quarter.
And before Loren goes into detail on the financials, let me take a moment and review the investment performance and flows for the quarter.
Turning to Slide 7 now. Our commitment to investment excellence and our work to build and maintain strong -- a strong investment culture helped us deliver solid long-term investment performance across the enterprise during the quarter. Looking at the firm as a whole, 68% of assets were in the top half on a 3-year basis. 79% were in the top half on a 5-year basis. On Page 8, you'll see the quarterly long-term flows of $12.2 billion were quite strong across both active and passive capabilities. Flows from the passive capabilities were driven by strong demand for Invesco PowerShares capabilities, which has an all-weather lineup that's well positioned to meet client demand in any type of market. This was the second best quarter for Invesco PowerShares in its  history with roughly $4 billion in net flows. And strong flows are helping us continue to gain ETF market share. As we noted during our recent Investor Day, strong passive flows reflected our longevity in the ETF market, our deep experience, our comprehensive range of factor and smart beta capabilities and our significant track record of innovation.
Results on the active side were equally as impressive with solid demand in multi-assets [indiscernible] dividend income capabilities, fixed income and other capabilities such as real estate. Our focus on delivering strong investment performance and bringing our broad range of capabilities to clients contribute to positive results in Asia Pacific, with strengths across both retail and institutional channels. Globally, we saw institutional flows during the quarter, which continues a series of positive institutional flows going back more than 2 years now. Client demand trends remain consistent, with particular interest in fixed income, multi-asset and real estate. And ""won but not funded"" and qualified opportunities are in all-time high. Retail flows also were strong, as gross sales rebounded nicely and redemptions moderated during the quarter. This includes a $6.5 billion Rhode Island 529 mandate.
Before I hand the call over to Loren, let me say a few words about how Invesco is positioned against the changes being brought by the DOL fiduciary rule. We are actively engaged with clients as they work to align their platforms to the demands of the fiduciary rule. As we've made clear since the rule's approval, the key decisions reside with the distribution platforms, but we are actively supporting them. The market has gotten an early steer from Edward Jones; Merrill Lynch; and [indiscernible], Morgan Stanley, but I believe we are still in a very dynamic period with regard to how it will play out. It's clear each distributor has a different business mix and will implement the rule in a manner that will meet its clients' needs.
Based on the discussions we're having with clients, we continue to believe that our comprehensive range of capabilities, our distribution expertise and market leadership all positions us extremely well to help our clients as they adjust their business to the provisions of the DOL rule. If this shifts us towards passive, as some believe, our decade of ETF experience, our comprehensive range of factor and smart beta capabilities, our scale, our significant track record of innovation all put us in a very competitive position. As we mentioned during the Investor Day, there are no barriers to entry but very high hurdles to success in the ETF business that will make it difficult for latecomers to do well.
Now I'll turn the call over to Loren, and you can review the financials."
384779,404686861,1063465,"Invesco Ltd., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Invesco Ltd.","Executives","Thanks very much, Marty.Quarter-over-quarter, our total assets under management increased $40.6 billion or 5.2%. This was driven by positive market returns of $23.6 billion. We also saw long-term net inflows of $12.2 billion, which included as you know",1159,"Thanks very much, Marty.
Quarter-over-quarter, our total assets under management increased $40.6 billion or 5.2%. This was driven by positive market returns of $23.6 billion. We also saw long-term net inflows of $12.2 billion, which included as you know $6.5 billion related to Invesco's Rhode Island 529 plan win. We also saw inflows from money market and QQQs of $5.9 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. These were offset by negative FX translation which amounted to $2.2 billion. Our average AUM for the third quarter was $814.1 billion. That was up 3.8% versus the second quarter. Our annualized long-term growth rate in Q3 was 7.1%, and that was up from 2.6% in the second quarter. This measure represents our long-term flows in the quarter divided by the beginning-of-period long-term AUM which excludes the institutional money market assets and the QQQ assets.
Our net revenue yield came in at 42 basis points, which was 1.7 basis points lower than the prior quarter. The change in mix largely driven by currency reduced the yield by 1.1 basis points. This was primarily a result of the declining pound sterling rate, which was 8.4% lower on average during the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Also, we saw a decrease in other revenues, which reduced the yield by 0.7 basis points. And lower performance fees in the quarter further depressed the yields by 0.3 basis points. These factors were offset by 1 more day in the period, which increased the yield by 0.4 basis points. A little bit of guidance here: Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we would expect our net revenue yield to be roughly in line with the third quarter levels at 42 basis points, assuming consistent market and FX levels in line with today.
So moving on to Slide 12. As we've done before, we provide the U.S. GAAP operating results for the quarter. My comments today, however, will focus exclusively on the variances related to our non-GAAP adjusted measures, which can be found on Slide 13. Slide 13, you'll see net revenues decrease by $1.9 million or 0.2% quarter-over-quarter to $854.7 million, which includes a negative FX rate impact of $18.5 million.
Within the net revenue number, you'll see that adjusted investment management fees increased by $19.8 million or 2.1% to $982.7 million. This reflects higher average AUM for the quarter, partially offset by the impact of currency on our AUM mix. FX decreased adjusted investment management fees by $23 million. Adjusted service and distribution revenues increased by $10 million or 4.9%, reflecting higher average AUM for retail products. FX decreased adjusted service and distribution revenues by $0.1 million. Adjusted performance fees came in at $3.8 million in Q3; and were earned from a variety of different investment capabilities, including $2.3 million from bank loan products. Foreign exchange decreased these fees by $0.1 million. Again some guidance here: In Q4, we'd expect performance fees to be in line with our historical guidance at $5 million in the quarter.
Adjusted other revenues in the third quarter were $19.3 million. And that was a decrease of $12.4 million from the prior quarter primarily due to a decrease of $7.3 million in transaction fees from real estate and a $2 million decrease in transactional sales charges from our UIT products. Foreign exchange decreased these revenues by $0.1 million. Some guidance here, looking forward to Q4, we would expect to see this number increase in the range of $23 million to $25 million. Third-party distribution, services and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, increased by $13.8 million or 3.9%, and this movement was in line with higher revenues derived from our retail assets under management. FX decrease these expenses by $4.8 million.
Moving on down the slide, you'll see that adjusted operating expenses at $515.4 million decreased by $10.8 million or 2.1% relative to the second quarter. Foreign exchange reduced adjusted operating expenses by $8.2 million during the quarter. Our adjusted employee compensation came in at $339.1 million, a drop of $8.8 million or 2.5%, and this was due to lower variable compensation on performance fees. Foreign exchange decreased adjusted compensation by $5.1 million. Adjusted marketing expenses fell by $2.2 million or 7.6%, $26.8 million, reflecting fewer client events held in the quarter. FX decreased adjusted marketing expense by $0.3 million in the quarter. Our adjusted property, office and tech expenses were $82.1 million in the quarter, a decrease of $0.7 million over the second quarter. And FX decreased these expenses by $1.2 million. And then adjusted G&A expenses at $67.4 million increased $0.9 million or 1.4%, and this was driven by costs associated with several new product introductions. Foreign exchange decreased adjusted G&A by $1.6 million. Again, some guidance: For Q4, we would expect to see these expense line items roughly flat with the third quarter, other than marketing. We expect marketing to -- marketing spend to increase in a range of $32 million to $35 million, which is seasonally consistent with prior years.
Continuing on down the page, you'll see that our adjusted nonoperating (sic) [ operating ] income increased $9 million  compared to the second quarter. This was primarily driven by a $4.9 million gain realized on our pound sterling-U.S. dollar hedge as well as due to mark-to-market gains on our seed money investments in the third quarter.
Firm's effective tax rate on pretax adjusted net income in Q3 came in at 26.5%, consistent with prior quarter. Some guidance: Here looking forward to the fourth quarter, we believe our tax rate will increase slightly to 27% largely due to the currency impact on the mix of our earnings.
And this brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.60 and adjusted net operating margin of 39.7%. I would say just generally, as you probably would expect, that foreign exchanges had a real impact on our operating results as reported in U.S. dollars. Just to quantify that for you: When we look at our Q3 versus Q2 results, EPS was -- our operating EPS was resulted $0.018 lower as a result of foreign exchange, as well as our margin being impacted by 0.3%. Looking at year-over-year Q3 to Q3, the numbers are larger, obviously. EPS is down $0.034 due to currency, and our margin is down 0.7% as a result of FX only.
So with that, before I turn it over to Marty, I'd also like to provide a quick update on the business optimization work that we implemented in Q4 of last year. We've made very good progress on our optimization efforts and have generated approximately $14 million in annual run rate savings by the end of the third quarter. Some of the bigger opportunities are ahead of us, however, but we are confident that we'll be able to achieve the targeted run rate savings number, as we discussed, of $30 million to $45 million in 2017.
And with that, I'd like to turn it back to Marty."

We've -- you've had that, the Brexit hit and some of the challenges on the comp. And just generally, it's lower than what we had seen previously, but the U.K. would -- has really come back from that sort of the Brexit low but again not robust net inflows as we saw a year ago. But again, I think we feel we're on track. In the States, with regard to the DOL rule, it's hard to point to the behavior with anything to do with the DOL. I think it's still more the active-passive debate that's really probably driving the behavior more than anything right now. As -- will it change going forward? It will definitely put an awful lot of money in motion in the U.S. retail channel. [indiscernible] as people make their changes from brokers to advisory and as brokers narrow the platforms of money managers. And so with that said, [indiscernible] there will definitely be winners and losers. And again, I think those firms with the breadth of capabilities and both active and passive capabilities are going to be the ones that do well out of it. But why don't you add on to it, Loren, yes [ph]?"

I mean in Asia Pac we're seeing significant flows coming in, particularly into Japan. Shinko REIT has been a big winner there. We're also seeing China mutual fund flows and our joint venture providing a good lift, and that's been pretty consistent. In Continental Europe, net flows continue to really be a little bit mixed, but our GTR product in particular just every quarter continues to grow both in the U.K. and in Continental Europe. So that's a continued trend. And we're very excited about some of the new product introductions, FYI [ph], in terms of the income-oriented product that is similar to the GTR product. In the U.S., it's been sort of a mix of things. We're seeing very strong take-on on products like our diversified dividend product. Our core bond plus [ph] fund is doing very well. And then certainly, ETFs, very strong flows into -- or senior loan products and other fixed-income products. I think we're the third most successful ETF provider in fixed income year-to-date in the U.S. So that's a trend. And then some of that in the U.S. So there's been some outflows in some of the other products that are more value oriented that have seen performance tick down a little bit. So hopefully, that gives you some good color."

It does seem -- and it's going to be different firm by firm. So I think that's the first point. I think, so often when we have these conversations, we think it's going to be a generic outcome, and it's not. And as I said, if you just look at where Merrill Lynch is going, where Edward Jones seems to be going and where now Morgan Stanley seems to be going, with all the public information now you can see that they're taking different approaches to it. That said, the firms that are going to do well, which we've been suspecting, and again it seems that we're getting early confirmation, are those firms with broad ranges of capabilities that are strongly performing. They're going to -- they'll do fine in this. We will put ourselves in that category. Those firms that actually have ETFs, a long track record of ETFs, they'll also do well. Those are capabilities that are a need. And I'd put a third element into it, where again it's different firm by firm, but those firms that can take the capabilities, whether that'll be a mutual fund or an ETF vehicle; and help create solutions for clients, and this is even at the broker level, are going to do well. The other element that people are talking about, I think, and I think we have to all get in the right context, the price sensitivity. It is real. The way that the financial adviser is going to meet that need is really a combination of active and passive capabilities that will drive down the overall effective fee rate for their clients, which is a good thing. And again, I think specifically, vehicle by vehicle, you need to be competitively priced. If you are selling at a -- if you're at a premium price and if you have very strong performance, you probably, hopefully, can keep it there, but there's going to be real pressure there. If you're at a premium price and you're not performing, well, you're in a lot of trouble. So -- and we do believe that, the platforms, some will -- they will be narrowed. And there'll be -- and again, each firm is going to be different, and we look at ourselves as being on the right side of those outcomes."

And so by now, there's been this declaration of massive consolidation for a couple decades. I would say the reality is the environment we're in now would support that notion more than ever before. And I'd say much of this is being driven by the regulatory environment principally and just the ever-increasing costs. You then add things like cyber securities. There is real -- we'll all spend a lot of money where we never did before. And then the extended period of the active, passive movement, which again I would also say it's -- when you read about it in the paper every day, it's probably gone too far, right? It's not going back to where it was, but it will moderate. And I do believe there will be a very strong place for active capabilities too. And again, we're in a position of we think the answer is active and passive, so we're well placed regardless. So I think what you're going to have happen on the M&A front is, if you are a firm without scale, I think you're going to need to do something. And so I think you're going to see the likelihood of combinations of undersized firms. That's probably higher than it's ever been before. And the other point, though, is somebody has to be a willing buyer. And not everybody is going to be a willing buyer of some of those firms, so I think what you'll see is organic growth coming from firms that really are not well positioned in this environment."

Just in terms of transactions happening, they can lump up in a particular quarter or be a little bit absent in the quarter. And then certainly when there is more volatility and uncertainty in the markets, you can see that, that number either speed up or slow down. There's the component of our UIT sales that have slowed down just in line of -- or in respect to the DOL uncertainties. And so I think that is something that should, hopefully, begin to be more clear as to whether that's a true run rate or whether it can come back, but I think, for right now, we're looking quarter-to-quarter on that line item. So that's it. In terms of expenses, is there more to be done? I mean there's always more that can be done. We're continuing to look beyond some of the things that we identified and optimization to see if there are other sort of larger opportunities that can be realized into 2017. As we all know, when we get into our looking out 3 years and understanding the need for our incremental margins to be where we want them to be, we have to continue to look and find ways to organize ourselves in a way that would provide those net outcomes. So I would say there is more to come on that to the extent that we can identify them, but certainly in the near term, in terms of the optimization we're eagerly going after those opportunities."

That was really more an environment -- we thought it was competitive 5 years ago and 10 years ago, but it's nothing like today. And not just competitive, but the market shift. So we feel, again, we're uniquely placed with the capabilities we have that it would be stupid of us not to continue to invest and grow the ETF business or -- and the institutional business or the solutions business. And I think, to your point earlier, the most dangerous thing you can be doing if you are a narrowly focused firm challenged right now is to be not investing in the future.

And that's why it's in this flattish kind of range. But again, the trends that have been there for a long time are still there in terms of the types of products that we're offering, more alternatives.

And so it's firms like us that have the depth of capability through wholesalers and Invesco Consulting that can help make the move because they are real moves that -- with their client bases. So again, we have the resources. We have the capabilities, and we can help them make those changes. I think the biggest concern that I think everybody has heard over more recently was a real concern that there was going to be a large proliferation of share classes because each distributor wanting to serve their clients in a different way. And I know there's no great insights, but it seems to be the industry is coalescing probably on a couple share classes, which would be there are some costs associated with it, but I mean that's very doable. And I think it's much better outcome for both [indiscernible] clients.

Can you give us a broad sense or even a range of how much you expect that the wealth management product shelf could end up shrinking for commission accounts?"

But ultimately, beyond near term, this is probably going to lead to some pretty substantial differences in distribution dynamics. You guys do tend to have a pretty large wholesaler team. And so when you think about how those, the selling dynamics into this channel, might change, what kind of expense-cut opportunity could that lead to if we end up seeing a channel that is more focused on home office and less on the field? Can you help us try to frame what kind of opportunity ultimately that might lead to from an expense-cutting perspective?"

I think the answer is more along this line: I don't think the demand for support is going to go down. It will probably only go up, but it will be different. You'll end up -- so if you go back, I think, pick, 10 years ago, if the role of a wholesaler was to, ""Here is a great fund, and here is why you should put it in our portfolio. It's great, long-term track record,"" isn't that great? The nature of the support is going to be very different. And the field support, if you want to call it that, will be much more of an individual's focus on solutions. I mean how deep -- is their work working on their asset allocation? How do you help them build a portfolio range of different investment capabilities, a range of different vehicles that would meet their needs? So it will be a very different type of support. So what you can't size right now is does it stay the same but just -- but different skill sets? Or is there a sort of a size issue that you're talking about? And then I'd say it's too early to conclude whether or not there are cost savings there. And my instincts would be the demand for the support is going to be there, but it's going to be different. So the cost savings opportunity might not necessarily be there, which then gets you back to the prior questions that again, if you're not a firm with resources and capabilities to support the client, you're extremely disadvantaged in this environment going forward."

And no one needs to take that risk when you have a broad range of capabilities. The other element that again we've talked about and others have talked about is the total cost of ownership of those ETFs, and it's just not the fee. It's the liquidity. And those firms that have a presence, they're going to get the backing to create the liquidity which is going to drive down the total cost of ownership also.

As is our practice, I'll review the business results for the third quarter and then Loren will go into greater details about the financials, and then we'll open up to Q&A after that.
So let me begin by highlighting the firm's operating results for the quarter. And you'll find this on Slide 4, if you happen to be following the presentation which is available on our website.
Long-term investment performance remained -- continued to be very strong. 68% and 79% of actively managed assets were ahead of peers on a 3- and 5-year basis, respectively. Our continued focus on leveraging our broad investment capabilities to provide meaningful solutions to clients contributed solid operating results during the quarter in what I think all of us would describe as a difficult business environment for money managers. Strong investment forms helped drive robust long-term net flows of $1.2 billion (sic) [ $ 12.2 billion ] during the quarter, reflecting solid retail and institutional demand across both active and passive capabilities. And total flows during the quarter were net just over $19 billion. Adjusted -- the adjusted operating margin was 39.7%, an improvement over the prior quarter that reflects our continued focus on running a disciplined business.
We also returned $176 million to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks during the quarter.
Assets under management were $820 billion at the end of the quarter, up from $779 billion in the second quarter. Adjusted operating income was $339 billion (sic) [ $339 million ] in the quarter, up from $330 million in the prior quarter.
Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.60 this quarter versus $0.56 in the prior quarter. And as noted, earlier in the year, we raised our quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share. It was up nearly 4% from the prior year. We also continued our stock programs during the quarter.
And before Loren goes into detail on the financials, let me take a moment and review the investment performance and flows for the quarter.
Turning to Slide 7 now. Our commitment to investment excellence and our work to build and maintain strong -- a strong investment culture helped us deliver solid long-term investment performance across the enterprise during the quarter. Looking at the firm as a whole, 68% of assets were in the top half on a 3-year basis. 79% were in the top half on a 5-year basis. On Page 8, you'll see the quarterly long-term flows of $12.2 billion were quite strong across both active and passive capabilities. Flows from the passive capabilities were driven by strong demand for Invesco PowerShares capabilities, which has an all-weather lineup that's well positioned to meet client demand in any type of market. This was the second best quarter for Invesco PowerShares in its  history with roughly $4 billion in net flows. And strong flows are helping us continue to gain ETF market share. As we noted during our recent Investor Day, strong passive flows reflected our longevity in the ETF market, our deep experience, our comprehensive range of factor and smart beta capabilities and our significant track record of innovation.
Results on the active side were equally as impressive with solid demand in multi-assets [indiscernible] dividend income capabilities, fixed income and other capabilities such as real estate. Our focus on delivering strong investment performance and bringing our broad range of capabilities to clients contribute to positive results in Asia Pacific, with strengths across both retail and institutional channels. Globally, we saw institutional flows during the quarter, which continues a series of positive institutional flows going back more than 2 years now. Client demand trends remain consistent, with particular interest in fixed income, multi-asset and real estate. And ""won but not funded"" and qualified opportunities are in all-time high. Retail flows also were strong, as gross sales rebounded nicely and redemptions moderated during the quarter. This includes a $6.5 billion Rhode Island 529 mandate.
Before I hand the call over to Loren, let me say a few words about how Invesco is positioned against the changes being brought by the DOL fiduciary rule. We are actively engaged with clients as they work to align their platforms to the demands of the fiduciary rule. As we've made clear since the rule's approval, the key decisions reside with the distribution platforms, but we are actively supporting them. The market has gotten an early steer from Edward Jones; Merrill Lynch; and [indiscernible], Morgan Stanley, but I believe we are still in a very dynamic period with regard to how it will play out. It's clear each distributor has a different business mix and will implement the rule in a manner that will meet its clients' needs.
Based on the discussions we're having with clients, we continue to believe that our comprehensive range of capabilities, our distribution expertise and market leadership all positions us extremely well to help our clients as they adjust their business to the provisions of the DOL rule. If this shifts us towards passive, as some believe, our decade of ETF experience, our comprehensive range of factor and smart beta capabilities, our scale, our significant track record of innovation all put us in a very competitive position. As we mentioned during the Investor Day, there are low barriers to entry but very high hurdles to success in the ETF business that will make it difficult for latecomers to do well.
Now I'll turn the call over to Loren, and you can review the financials."

We also saw inflows from money market and QQQs of $5.9 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. These were offset by negative FX translation which amounted to $2.2 billion. Our average AUM for the third quarter was $814.1 billion. That was up 3.8% versus the second quarter. Our annualized long-term growth rate in Q3 was 7.1%, and that was up from 2.6% in the second quarter.

Our net revenue yield came in at 42 basis points, which was 1.7 basis points lower than the prior quarter. The change in mix largely driven by currency reduced the yield by 1.1 basis points. This was primarily a result of the declining pound sterling rate, which was 8.4% lower on average during the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Also, we saw a decrease in other revenues, which reduced the yield by 0.7 basis points. And lower performance fees in the quarter further depressed the yields by 0.3 basis points. These factors were offset by 1 more day in the period, which increased the yield by 0.4 basis points. A little bit of guidance here: Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we would expect our net revenue yield to be roughly in line with the third quarter levels at 42 basis points, assuming consistent market and FX level in line with today.
So moving on to Slide 12. As we've done before, we provide the U.S. GAAP operating results for the quarter. My comments today, however, will focus exclusively on the variances related to our non-GAAP adjusted measures, which can be found on Slide 13. Slide 13, you'll see net revenues decreased by $1.9 million or 0.2% quarter-over-quarter to $854.7 million, which includes a negative FX rate impact of $18.5 million.
Within the net revenue number, you'll see that adjusted investment management fees increased by $19.8 million or 2.1% to $982.7 million. This reflects higher average AUM for the quarter, partially offset by the impact of currency on our AUM mix. FX decreased adjusted investment management fees by $23 million. Adjusted service and distribution revenues increased by $10 million or 4.9%, reflecting higher average AUM for retail products. FX decreased adjusted service and distribution revenues by $0.1 million. Adjusted performance fees came in at $3.8 million in Q3; and were earned from a variety of different investment capabilities, including $2.3 million from bank loan products. Foreign exchange decreased these fees by $0.1 million. Again some guidance here: In Q4, we'd expect performance fees to be in line with our historical guidance at $5 million in the quarter.
Adjusted other revenues in the third quarter were $19.3 million. And that was a decrease of $12.4 million from the prior quarter primarily due to a decrease of $7.3 million in transaction fees from real estate and a $2 million decrease in transactional sales charges from our UIT products. Foreign exchange decreased these revenues by $0.1 million. Some guidance here, looking forward to Q4, we would expect to see this number increase in the range of $23 million to $25 million. Third-party distribution, services and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, increased by $13.8 million or 3.9%, and this movement was in line with higher revenues derived from our retail assets under management. FX decrease these expenses by $4.8 million.
Moving on down the slide, you'll see that adjusted operating expenses at $515.4 million decreased by $10.8 million or 2.1% relative to the second quarter. Foreign exchange reduced adjusted operating expenses by $8.2 million during the quarter. Our adjusted employee compensation came in at $339.1 million, a drop of $8.8 million or 2.5%, and this was due to lower variable compensation on performance fees. Foreign exchange decreased adjusted compensation by $5.1 million. Adjusted marketing expenses fell by $2.2 million or 7.6%, $26.8 million, reflecting fewer client events held in the quarter. FX decreased adjusted marketing expense by $0.3 million in the quarter. Our adjusted property, office and tech expenses were $82.1 million in the quarter, a decrease of $0.7 million over the second quarter. And FX decreased these expenses by $1.2 million. And then adjusted G&A expenses at $67.4 million increased $0.9 million or 1.4%, and this was driven by costs associated with several new product introductions. Foreign exchange decreased adjusted G&A by $1.6 million. Again, some guidance: For Q4, we would expect to see these expense line items roughly flat with the third quarter, other than marketing. We expect marketing to -- marketing spend to increase in a range of $32 million to $35 million, which is seasonally consistent with prior years.
Continuing on down the page, you'll see that our adjusted nonoperating (sic) [ operating ] income increased $9 million  compared to the second quarter. This was primarily driven by a $4.9 million gain realized on our pound sterling-U.S. dollar hedge as well as due to mark-to-market gains on our seed money investments in the third quarter.
Firm's effective tax rate on pretax adjusted net income in Q3 came in at 26.5%, consistent with prior quarter. Some guidance: Here looking forward to the fourth quarter, we believe our tax rate will increase slightly to 27% largely due to the currency impact on the mix of our earnings.
And this brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.60 and adjusted net operating margin of 39.7%. I would say just generally, as you probably would expect, that foreign exchanges had a real impact on our operating results as reported in U.S. dollars. Just to quantify that for you: When we look at our Q3 versus Q2 results, EPS was -- our operating EPS was resulted $0.018 lower as a result of foreign exchange, as well as our margin being impacted by 0.3%. Looking at year-over-year Q3 to Q3, the numbers are larger, obviously. EPS is down $0.034 due to currency, and our margin is down 0.7% as a result of FX only.
So with that, before I turn it over to Marty, I'd also like to provide a quick update on the business optimization work that we implemented in Q4 of last year. We've made very good progress on our optimization efforts and have generated approximately $14 million in annual run rate savings by the end of the third quarter. Some of the bigger opportunities are ahead of us, however, but we are confident that we'll be able to achieve the targeted run rate savings number, as we discussed, of $30 million to $45 million in 2017.
And with that, I'd like to turn it back to Marty."

And just generally, it's lower than what we had seen previously, but the U.K. would -- has really come back from that sort of the Brexit low but again not robust net inflows as we saw a year ago. But again, I think we feel we're on track. In the States, with regard to the DOL rule, it's hard to point to the behavior with anything to do with the DOL. I think it's still more the active-passive debate that's really probably driving the behavior more than anything right now. As -- will it change going forward? It will definitely put an awful lot of money in motion in the U.S. retail channel [indiscernible] as people make their changes from brokers to advisory and as brokers narrow the platforms of money managers. And so with that said, [indiscernible] there will definitely be winners and losers.

In Continental Europe, net flows continue to really be a little bit mixed, but our GTR product in particular just every quarter continues to grow both in the U.K. and in Continental Europe. So that's a continued trend. And we're very excited about some of the new product introductions, FYI, in terms of the income-oriented product that is similar to the GTR product. In the U.S., it's been sort of a mix of things. We're seeing very strong take-on on products like our diversified dividend product. Our core bond plus fund is doing very well. And then certainly, ETFs, very strong flows into -- or senior loan products and other fixed-income products. I think we're the third most successful ETF provider in fixed income year-to-date in the U.S. So that's a trend. And then some of that in the U.S. So there's been some outflows in some of the other products that are more value oriented that have seen performance tick down a little bit. So hopefully, that gives you some good color."

It does seem -- and it's going to be different firm by firm. So I think that's the first point. I think, so often when we have these conversations, we think it's going to be a generic outcome, and it's not. And as I said, if you just look at where Merrill Lynch is going, where Edward Jones seems to be going and where now Morgan Stanley seems to be going, with all the public information now you can see that they're taking different approaches to it. That said, the firms that are going to do well, which we've been suspecting, and again it seems that we're getting early confirmation, are those firms with broad ranges of capabilities that are strongly performing. They're going to -- they'll do fine in this. We will put ourselves in that category. Those firms that actually have ETFs, a long track record of ETFs, they'll also do well. Those are capabilities that are a need. And I'd put a third element into it, where again it's different firm by firm, but those firms that can take the capabilities, whether that'll be a mutual fund or an ETF vehicle; and help create solutions for clients, and this is even at the broker level, are going to do well. The other element that people are talking about, I think, and I think we have to all get in the right context, the price sensitivity. It is real. The way that the financial adviser is going to meet that need is really a combination of active and passive capabilities that will drive down the overall effective fee rate for their clients, which is a good thing. And again, I think specifically, vehicle by vehicle, you need to be competitively priced. If you are selling at a -- if you're at a premium price and if you have very strong performance, you probably, hopefully, can keep it there, but there's going to be real pressure there. If you're at a premium price and you're not performing, well, you're in a lot of trouble. So -- and we do believe that, the platforms, some will -- they will be narrowed. And there'll be -- and again, each firm is going to be different, and we look at ourselves as being on the right side of those outcomes."

And so by now, there's been this declaration of massive consolidation for a couple decades. I would say the reality is the environment we're in now would support that notion more than ever before. And I'd say much of this is being driven by the regulatory environment principally and just the ever-increasing costs. You then add things like cyber securities. There is where we'll all spend a lot of money where we never did before. And then the extended period of the active, passive movement, which again I would also say it's -- when you read about it in the paper every day, it's probably gone too far, right? It's not going back to where it was, but it will moderate. And I do believe there will be a very strong place for active capabilities too. And again, we're in a position of we think the answer is active and passive, so we're well placed regardless. So I think what you're going to have happen on the M&A front is, if you are a firm without scale, I think you're going to need to do something. And so I think you're going to see the likelihood of combinations of undersized firms. That's probably higher than it's ever been before. And the other point, though, is somebody has to be a willing buyer. And not everybody is going to be a willing buyer of some of those firms, so I think what you'll see is organic growth coming from firms that really are not well positioned in this environment."

And I know you've got the efficiency program in place to lower the run rate, but if we were -- continue to be in this environment, is there any other levers you can pull on the expense side?

We don't think it's really a trend. Obviously, it moves around. It's hard to predict. And we've seen that line can be somewhat volatile based on timing. Just in terms of transactions happening, they can lump up in a particular quarter or be a little bit absent in the quarter. And then certainly when there is more volatility and uncertainty in the markets, you can see that, that number either speed up or slow down. There's the component of our UIT sales that have slowed down just in line of -- or in respect to the DOL uncertainties. And so I think that is something that should, hopefully, begin to be more clear as to whether that's a true run rate or whether it can come back, but I think, for right now, we're looking quarter-to-quarter on that line item. So that's it. In terms of expenses, is there more to be done? I mean there's always more that can be done. We're continuing to look beyond some of the things that we identified in the optimization to see if there are other sort of larger opportunities that can be realized into 2017. As we all know, when we get into our looking out 3 years and understanding the need for our incremental margins to be where we want them to be, we have to continue to look and find ways to organize ourselves in a way that would provide those net outcomes. So I would say there is more to come on that to the extent that we can identify them, but certainly in the near term, in terms of the optimization we're eagerly going after those opportunities."

I mean the traditional playbook was market pullback,you'll focus on -- you're cutting the expenses where we can do that with an eye to making sure that you don't disadvantage the firm. That was really more an environment -- we thought it was competitive 5 years ago and 10 years ago, but it's nothing like today. And not just competitive, but the market shift. So we feel, again, we're uniquely placed with the capabilities we have that it would be stupid of us not to continue to invest and grow the ETF business or -- and the institutional business or the solutions business. And I think, to your point earlier, the most dangerous thing you can be doing if you are a narrowly focused firm challenged right now is to be not investing in the future. And I think that's what a lot of firms are finding themselves having to do. And I think that's you're confirming the bad outcomes, as far as I'm concerned, but you have to be disciplined, right?

I mean it's all positive. So we'll continue to see the institutional pipeline at a much higher revenue yield coming in than what's coming out in terms of the mix generally of the products on the retail side; Asia, China very positive relative to the overall fee rate for the firm. So that, which would make you think, well, the fee rate must be going up, has been offset obviously due to the FX impacts because obviously the pound has declined even further from where we were in the third quarter. And that's why it's in this flattish kind of range. But again, the trends that have been there for a long time are still there in terms of the types of products that we're offering, more alternatives. Things that do support a higher fee rate are absolutely still there, and so we feel that it's not necessarily a situation at all where we're going to see the mix being anything but a positive for us, other than the FX which we can't control. And certainly in our operating results, you're seeing that, and so people shouldn't read too much into the U.S. dollar numbers."

So at one level, there is no change from the standpoint of those firms that have always had a brokerage business and an advisory business. And their movement to advisory has been a trend and a desire of the broker but -- and the distributors for a number of years. So the industry is already set up to serve that way. Now again I'd come back to, in this environment, what are -- it is there's an awful lot of work for -- to comply with the DOL. And so it's firms like us that have the depth of capability through wholesalers and Invesco Consulting that can help make the move because they are real moves that -- with their client bases. So again, we have the resources. We have the capabilities, and we can help them make those changes. I think the biggest concern that I think everybody has heard over more recently was a real concern that there was going to be a large proliferation of share classes because each distributor wanting to be able to serve their clients in a different way. And I know there's no great insights, but it seems to be the industry is coalescing probably on a couple share classes, which would be there are some costs associated with it, but I mean that's very doable. And I think it's much better outcome for both media [ph] and clients. So again, I think it -- what I'd do is look, go back to the firms that have resources and capabilities to support their clients through this change are going to be in a better position than those that don't. And again this goes back to the prior questions about scale and M&A. I mean, if you can't support your clients beyond just an investment capability, you're at a disadvantage."

But ultimately, beyond near term, this is probably going to lead to some pretty substantial differences in distribution dynamics. You guys do tend to have a pretty large wholesaler team.

Can you help us try to frame what kind of opportunity ultimately that might lead to from an expense-cutting perspective?"

It's great, long-term track record,"" isn't that great? The nature of the support is going to be very different. And the field support, if you want to call it that, will be much more of an individual's focus on solutions. I mean how deep -- is their work working on their asset allocation? How do you help them build a portfolio range of different investment capabilities, a range of different vehicles that would meet their needs? So it will be a very different type of support. So what you can't size right now is does it stay the same but just -- but different skill sets? Or is there a sort of a size issue that you're talking about? And then I'd say it's too early to conclude whether or not there are cost savings there. And my instincts would be the demand for the support is going to be there, but it's going to be different. So the cost savings opportunity might not necessarily be there, which then gets you back to the prior questions that again, if you're not a firm with resources and capabilities to support the client, you're extremely disadvantaged in this environment going forward."

So there is an inherent limitation right there. And the other thing is you're looking at real track records with these factor-based ETFs that have long track, as opposed to extrapolating, back-testing type of experiences. And no one needs to take that risk when you have a broad range of capabilities. The other element that again we've talked about and others have talked about is the total cost of ownership of those ETFs, and it's just not the fee. It's the liquidity. And those firms that have a presence, they're going to get the backing to create the liquidity which is going to drive down the total cost of ownership also. So we have found it to be a realism that the breadth of product, first-mover advantage but, by the way, the long track records really matter a lot.

As is our practice, I'll review the business results for the third quarter and then Loren will go into greater details about the financials, and then we'll open up to Q&A after that.
So let me begin by highlighting the firm's operating results for the quarter. And you'll find this on Slide 4, if you happen to be following the presentation which is available on our website.
Long-term investment performance remained -- continued to be very strong. 68% and 79% of actively managed assets were ahead of peers on a 3- and 5-year basis, respectively. Our continued focus on leveraging our broad investment capabilities to provide meaningful solutions to clients contributed solid operating results during the quarter in what I think all of us would describe as a difficult business environment for money managers. Strong investment forms helped drive robust long-term net flows of $1.2 billion (sic) [ $ 12.2 billion ] during the quarter, reflecting solid retail and institutional demand across both active and passive capabilities. And total flows during the quarter were net just over $19 billion. Adjusted -- the adjusted operating margin was 39.7%, an improvement over the prior quarter that reflects our continued focus on running a disciplined business.
We also returned $176 million to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks during the quarter.
Assets under management were $820 billion at the end of the quarter, up from $779 billion in the second quarter. Adjusted operating income was $339 billion (sic) [ $339 million ] in the quarter, up from $330 million in the prior quarter.
Adjusted diluted EPS was $0.60 this quarter versus $0.56 in the prior quarter. And as noted, earlier in the year, we raised our quarterly dividend to $0.28 per share. It was up nearly 4% from the prior year. We also continued our stock programs during the quarter.
And before Loren goes into detail on the financials, let me take a moment and review the investment performance and flows for the quarter.
Turning to Slide 7 now. Our commitment to investment excellence and our work to build and maintain strong -- a strong investment culture helped us deliver solid long-term investment performance across the enterprise during the quarter. Looking at the firm as a whole, 68% of assets were in the top half on a 3-year basis. 79% were in the top half on a 5-year basis. On Page 8, you'll see the quarterly long-term flows of $12.2 billion were quite strong across both active and passive capabilities. Flows from the passive capabilities were driven by strong demand for Invesco PowerShares capabilities, which has an all-weather lineup that's well positioned to meet client demand in any type of market. This was the second best quarter for Invesco PowerShares in its  history with roughly $4 billion in net flows. And strong flows are helping us continue to gain ETF market share. As we noted during our recent Investor Day, strong passive flows reflected our longevity in the ETF market, our deep experience, our comprehensive range of factor and smart beta capabilities and our significant track record of innovation.
Results on the active side were equally as impressive with solid demand in multi-assets [indiscernible] dividend income capabilities, fixed income and other capabilities such as real estate. Our focus on delivering strong investment performance and bringing our broad range of capabilities to clients contribute to positive results in Asia Pacific, with strengths across both retail and institutional channels. Globally, we saw institutional flows during the quarter, which continues a series of positive institutional flows going back more than 2 years now. Client demand trends remain consistent, with particular interest in fixed income, multi-asset and real estate. And ""won but not funded"" and qualified opportunities are in all-time high. Retail flows also were strong, as gross sales rebounded nicely and redemptions moderated during the quarter. This includes a $6.5 billion Rhode Island 529 mandate.
Before I hand the call over to Loren, let me say a few words about how Invesco is positioned against the changes being brought by the DOL fiduciary rule. We are actively engaged with clients as they work to align their platforms to the demands of the fiduciary rule. As we've made clear since the rule's approval, the key decisions reside with the distribution platforms, but we are actively supporting them. The market has gotten an early steer from Edward Jones; Merrill Lynch; and [indiscernible], Morgan Stanley, but I believe we are still in a very dynamic period with regard to how it will play out. It's clear each distributor has a different business mix and will implement the rule in a manner that will meet its clients' needs.
Based on the discussions we're having with clients, we continue to believe that our comprehensive range of capabilities, our distribution expertise and market leadership all positions us extremely well to help our clients as they adjust their business to the provisions of the DOL rule. If this shifts us towards passive, as some believe, our decade of ETF experience, our comprehensive range of factor and smart beta capabilities, our scale, our significant track record of innovation all put us in a very competitive position. As we mentioned during the Investor Day, there are low barriers to entry but very high hurdles to success in the ETF business that will make it difficult for latecomers to do well.
Now I'll turn the call over to Loren, and you can review the financials."
384779,404686861,1064734,"Invesco Ltd., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Invesco Ltd.","Executives","Thanks very much, Marty.Quarter-over-quarter, our total assets under management increased $40.6 billion or 5.2%. This was driven by positive market returns of $23.6 billion. We also saw long-term net inflows of $12.2 billion, which included as you know",1159,"Thanks very much, Marty.
Quarter-over-quarter, our total assets under management increased $40.6 billion or 5.2%. This was driven by positive market returns of $23.6 billion. We also saw long-term net inflows of $12.2 billion, which included as you know $6.5 billion related to Invesco's Rhode Island 529 plan win. We also saw inflows from money market and QQQs of $5.9 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. These were offset by negative FX translation which amounted to $2.2 billion. Our average AUM for the third quarter was $814.1 billion. That was up 3.8% versus the second quarter. Our annualized long-term growth rate in Q3 was 7.1%, and that was up from 2.6% in the second quarter. This measure represents our long-term flows in the quarter divided by the beginning-of-period long-term AUM which excludes the institutional money market assets and the QQQ assets.
Our net revenue yield came in at 42 basis points, which was 1.7 basis points lower than the prior quarter. The change in mix largely driven by currency reduced the yield by 1.1 basis points. This was primarily a result of the declining pound sterling rate, which was 8.4% lower on average during the third quarter compared to the second quarter. Also, we saw a decrease in other revenues, which reduced the yield by 0.7 basis points. And lower performance fees in the quarter further depressed the yields by 0.3 basis points. These factors were offset by 1 more day in the period, which increased the yield by 0.4 basis points. A little bit of guidance here: Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we would expect our net revenue yield to be roughly in line with the third quarter levels at 42 basis points, assuming consistent market and FX level in line with today.
So moving on to Slide 12. As we've done before, we provide the U.S. GAAP operating results for the quarter. My comments today, however, will focus exclusively on the variances related to our non-GAAP adjusted measures, which can be found on Slide 13. Slide 13, you'll see net revenues decreased by $1.9 million or 0.2% quarter-over-quarter to $854.7 million, which includes a negative FX rate impact of $18.5 million.
Within the net revenue number, you'll see that adjusted investment management fees increased by $19.8 million or 2.1% to $982.7 million. This reflects higher average AUM for the quarter, partially offset by the impact of currency on our AUM mix. FX decreased adjusted investment management fees by $23 million. Adjusted service and distribution revenues increased by $10 million or 4.9%, reflecting higher average AUM for retail products. FX decreased adjusted service and distribution revenues by $0.1 million. Adjusted performance fees came in at $3.8 million in Q3; and were earned from a variety of different investment capabilities, including $2.3 million from bank loan products. Foreign exchange decreased these fees by $0.1 million. Again some guidance here: In Q4, we'd expect performance fees to be in line with our historical guidance at $5 million in the quarter.
Adjusted other revenues in the third quarter were $19.3 million. And that was a decrease of $12.4 million from the prior quarter primarily due to a decrease of $7.3 million in transaction fees from real estate and a $2 million decrease in transactional sales charges from our UIT products. Foreign exchange decreased these revenues by $0.1 million. Some guidance here, looking forward to Q4, we would expect to see this number increase in the range of $23 million to $25 million. Third-party distribution, services and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, increased by $13.8 million or 3.9%, and this movement was in line with higher revenues derived from our retail assets under management. FX decrease these expenses by $4.8 million.
Moving on down the slide, you'll see that adjusted operating expenses at $515.4 million decreased by $10.8 million or 2.1% relative to the second quarter. Foreign exchange reduced adjusted operating expenses by $8.2 million during the quarter. Our adjusted employee compensation came in at $339.1 million, a drop of $8.8 million or 2.5%, and this was due to lower variable compensation on performance fees. Foreign exchange decreased adjusted compensation by $5.1 million. Adjusted marketing expenses fell by $2.2 million or 7.6%, $26.8 million, reflecting fewer client events held in the quarter. FX decreased adjusted marketing expense by $0.3 million in the quarter. Our adjusted property, office and tech expenses were $82.1 million in the quarter, a decrease of $0.7 million over the second quarter. And FX decreased these expenses by $1.2 million. And then adjusted G&A expenses at $67.4 million increased $0.9 million or 1.4%, and this was driven by costs associated with several new product introductions. Foreign exchange decreased adjusted G&A by $1.6 million. Again, some guidance: For Q4, we would expect to see these expense line items roughly flat with the third quarter, other than marketing. We expect marketing to -- marketing spend to increase in a range of $32 million to $35 million, which is seasonally consistent with prior years.
Continuing on down the page, you'll see that our adjusted nonoperating (sic) [ operating ] income increased $9 million  compared to the second quarter. This was primarily driven by a $4.9 million gain realized on our pound sterling-U.S. dollar hedge as well as due to mark-to-market gains on our seed money investments in the third quarter.
Firm's effective tax rate on pretax adjusted net income in Q3 came in at 26.5%, consistent with prior quarter. Some guidance: Here looking forward to the fourth quarter, we believe our tax rate will increase slightly to 27% largely due to the currency impact on the mix of our earnings.
And this brings us to our adjusted EPS of $0.60 and adjusted net operating margin of 39.7%. I would say just generally, as you probably would expect, that foreign exchanges had a real impact on our operating results as reported in U.S. dollars. Just to quantify that for you: When we look at our Q3 versus Q2 results, EPS was -- our operating EPS was resulted $0.018 lower as a result of foreign exchange, as well as our margin being impacted by 0.3%. Looking at year-over-year Q3 to Q3, the numbers are larger, obviously. EPS is down $0.034 due to currency, and our margin is down 0.7% as a result of FX only.
So with that, before I turn it over to Marty, I'd also like to provide a quick update on the business optimization work that we implemented in Q4 of last year. We've made very good progress on our optimization efforts and have generated approximately $14 million in annual run rate savings by the end of the third quarter. Some of the bigger opportunities are ahead of us, however, but we are confident that we'll be able to achieve the targeted run rate savings number, as we discussed, of $30 million to $45 million in 2017.
And with that, I'd like to turn it back to Marty."

So Asia Pacific in particular is having a tremendous year, both retail and institutional. And it's also very broad based there. EMEA continues to be strong for us. We've -- you've had that, the Brexit hit and some of the challenges on the comp. And just generally, it's lower than what we had seen previously, but the U.K. would -- has really come back from that sort of the Brexit low but again not robust net inflows as we saw a year ago. But again, I think we feel we're on track. In the States, with regard to the DOL rule, it's hard to point to the behavior with anything to do with the DOL. I think it's still more the active-passive debate that's really probably driving the behavior more than anything right now. As -- will it change going forward? It will definitely put an awful lot of money in motion in the U.S. retail channel [indiscernible] as people make their changes from brokers to advisory and as brokers narrow the platforms of money managers. And so with that said, [indiscernible] there will definitely be winners and losers. And again, I think those firms with the breadth of capabilities and both active and passive capabilities are going to be the ones that do well out of it. But why don't you add on to it, Loren, yes?"

I mean in Asia Pac we're seeing significant flows coming in, particularly into Japan. Shinko REIT has been a big winner there. We're also seeing China mutual fund flows in our joint venture providing a good lift, and that's been pretty consistent. In Continental Europe, net flows continue to really be a little bit mixed, but our GTR product in particular just every quarter continues to grow both in the U.K. and in Continental Europe. So that's a continued trend. And we're very excited about some of the new product introductions, FYI, in terms of the income-oriented product that is similar to the GTR product. In the U.S., it's been sort of a mix of things. We're seeing very strong take-on on products like our diversified dividend product. Our core bond plus fund is doing very well. And then certainly, ETFs, very strong flows into -- or senior loan products and other fixed-income products. I think we're the third most successful ETF provider in fixed income year-to-date in the U.S. So that's a trend. And then some of that in the U.S. So there's been some outflows in some of the other products that are more value oriented that have seen performance tick down a little bit. So hopefully, that gives you some good color."

It does seem -- and it's going to be different firm by firm. So I think that's the first point. I think, so often when we have these conversations, we think it's going to be a generic outcome, and it's not. And as I said, if you just look at where Merrill Lynch is going, where Edward Jones seems to be going and where now Morgan Stanley seems to be going, with all the public information now you can see that they're taking different approaches to it. That said, the firms that are going to do well, which we've been suspecting, and again it seems that we're getting early confirmation, are those firms with broad ranges of capabilities that are strongly performing. They're going to -- they'll do fine in this. We will put ourselves in that category. Those firms that actually have ETFs, a long track record of ETFs, they'll also do well. Those are capabilities that are a need. And I'd put a third element into it, where again it's different firm by firm, but those firms that can take the capabilities, whether that'll be a mutual fund or an ETF vehicle; and help create solutions for clients, and this is even at the broker level, are going to do well. The other element that people are talking about, I think, and I think we have to all get in the right context, the price sensitivity. It is real. The way that the financial adviser is going to meet that need is really a combination of active and passive capabilities that will drive down the overall effective fee rate for their clients, which is a good thing. And again, I think specifically, vehicle by vehicle, you need to be competitively priced. If you are selling at a -- if you're at a premium price and if you have very strong performance, you probably, hopefully, can keep it there, but there's going to be real pressure there. If you're at a premium price and you're not performing, well, you're in a lot of trouble. So -- and we do believe that, the platforms, some will -- they will be narrowed. And there'll be -- and again, each firm is going to be different, and we look at ourselves as being on the right side of those outcomes."

It's not going back to where it was, but it will moderate. And I do believe there will be a very strong place for active capabilities too. And again, we're in a position of we think the answer is active and passive, so we're well placed regardless. So I think what you're going to have happen on the M&A front is, if you are a firm without scale, I think you're going to need to do something. And so I think you're going to see the likelihood of combinations of undersized firms. That's probably higher than it's ever been before. And the other point, though, is somebody has to be a willing buyer. And not everybody is going to be a willing buyer of some of those firms, so I think what you'll see is organic growth coming from firms that really are not well positioned in this environment."

And I know you've got the efficiency program in place to lower the run rate, but if we were -- continue to be in this environment, is there any other levers you can pull on the expense side?

We don't think it's really a trend. Obviously, it moves around. It's hard to predict. And we've seen that line can be somewhat volatile based on timing. Just in terms of transactions happening, they can lump up in a particular quarter or be a little bit absent in the quarter. And then certainly when there is more volatility and uncertainty in the markets, you can see that, that number either speed up or slow down. There's the component of our UIT sales that have slowed down just in line of -- or in respect to the DOL uncertainties. And so I think that is something that should, hopefully, begin to be more clear as to whether that's a true run rate or whether it can come back, but I think, for right now, we're looking quarter-to-quarter on that line item. So that's it. In terms of expenses, is there more to be done? I mean there's always more that can be done. We're continuing to look beyond some of the things that we identified in the optimization to see if there are other sort of larger opportunities that can be realized into 2017. As we all know, when we get into our looking out 3 years and understanding the need for our incremental margins to be where we want them to be, we have to continue to look and find ways to organize ourselves in a way that would provide those net outcomes. So I would say there is more to come on that to the extent that we can identify them, but certainly in the near term, in terms of the optimization we're eagerly going after those opportunities."

So we feel, again, we're uniquely placed with the capabilities we have that it would be stupid of us not to continue to invest and grow the ETF business or -- and the institutional business or the solutions business.

So that, which would make you think, well, the fee rate must be going up, has been offset obviously due to the FX impacts because obviously the pound has declined even further from where we were in the third quarter. And that's why it's in this flattish kind of range. But again, the trends that have been there for a long time are still there in terms of the types of products that we're offering, more alternatives. Things that do support a higher fee rate are absolutely still there, and so we feel that it's not necessarily a situation at all where we're going to see the mix being anything but a positive for us, other than the FX which we can't control.

So at one level, there is no change from the standpoint of those firms that have always had a brokerage business and an advisory business.

Now again I'd come back to, in this environment, what are -- it is there's an awful lot of work for -- to comply with the DOL. And so it's firms like us that have the depth of capability through wholesalers and Invesco Consulting that can help make the move because they are real moves that -- with their client bases. So again, we have the resources. We have the capabilities, and we can help them make those changes. I think the biggest concern that I think everybody has heard over more recently was a real concern that there was going to be a large proliferation of share classes because each distributor wanting to be able to serve their clients in a different way. And I know there's no great insights, but it seems to be the industry is coalescing probably on a couple share classes, which would be there are some costs associated with it, but I mean that's very doable. And I think it's much better outcome for both media [ph] and clients. So again, I think it -- what I'd do is look, go back to the firms that have resources and capabilities to support their clients through this change are going to be in a better position than those that don't. And again this goes back to the prior questions about scale and M&A. I mean, if you can't support your clients beyond just an investment capability, you're at a disadvantage."

It's great, long-term track record,"" isn't that great? The nature of the support is going to be very different. And the field support, if you want to call it that, will be much more of an individual's focus on solutions. I mean how deep -- is their work working on their asset allocation? How do you help them build a portfolio range of different investment capabilities, a range of different vehicles that would meet their needs? So it will be a very different type of support. So what you can't size right now is does it stay the same but just -- but different skill sets? Or is there a sort of a size issue that you're talking about? And then I'd say it's too early to conclude whether or not there are cost savings there. And my instincts would be the demand for the support is going to be there, but it's going to be different. So the cost savings opportunity might not necessarily be there, which then gets you back to the prior questions that again, if you're not a firm with resources and capabilities to support the client, you're extremely disadvantaged in this environment going forward."

And the other thing is you're looking at real track records with these factor-based ETFs that have long track, as opposed to extrapolating, back-testing type of experiences. And no one needs to take that risk when you have a broad range of capabilities. The other element that again we've talked about and others have talked about is the total cost of ownership of those ETFs, and it's just not the fee. It's the liquidity. And those firms that have a presence, they're going to get the backing to create the liquidity which is going to drive down the total cost of ownership also.

Just curious how Invesco is planning to deal with that over the next few years, particularly as DOL goes into effect. It just seems like just more money shifting into passive and lower-fee products. Just how do you think about competitively pricing active management and the elasticity of demand? And then just the second point there is just, given your scale, how do you think about the opportunity to be more aggressive?"

It's hard to answer a broad question like that because it gets very specific, so how I would answer it is we look at where we are priced. Our prices are very competitive. And they tend to be very competitive with, again, those firms that have a certain size and have very competitively priced products and that -- and with solid, reasonably good performance. You're going to continue pretty well. I don't know how to answer it other than that. I think what you could see probably in the future is I do think that the stronger only gets stronger. More money is going to go towards those firms. With more money, more break points, fees will drop, but again that will be a continuation of what we've had in the past. Again, I just think it's the smaller firms that are under a lot of pressure."

Actually, Loren does bring up a very good point. I don't know how much attention has been paid on it, but part of it in a sort of low return environments, this active, passive movement that we've talked about and have seen dramatically is active managers and packaged products have been at a real disadvantage just because of the expense ratio, where frankly it's a pass-through for a lot of expenses, whether they'll be 12b-1, sub TA. And you're probably on average -- at a disadvantage, an average fund of on -- kind of probably about 45 basis points every year. And as these pure share classes come out, that's going to be a benefit for active management also and the competitive returns vis-à-vis passive funds."
