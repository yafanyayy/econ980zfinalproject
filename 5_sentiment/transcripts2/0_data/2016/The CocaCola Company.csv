In late 2014, we announced a clear 5-point plan to reinvigorate our growth and increase profitability. We committed to transform the company to one that is focused on our core value-creation model of building strong brands, enhancing customer relationships and leading our franchise system with a goal of becoming a leaner, higher-margin, higher-return and more focused company. And I'm pleased to say that we made significant progress against our initiatives, including the very important announcement this morning about accelerating our refranchising. Importantly, our progress against these initiatives is leading to an improving performance even in a very challenging macro environment. 
Let's start with our key announcements today. One of our 5 strategic initiatives has been to refocus on our core brands of building brands and leading our system of bottling partners. As part of this, we've continued to advance our global refranchising initiatives. With the success of our efforts in Europe and North America, we have the confidence to accelerate our plans. In North America, we learned a significant amount from our initial territory transition efforts. Including the additional territories announced this morning, to date, we've signed agreements or transferred territories representing over 40% of U.S. bottle/can volume. At the same time, the performance of our North America business has continued to improve throughout this process, delivering the highest revenue growth in 3 years while we executed this important transformation. Based on our success and the knowledge we gained through the transitions, we're now ready to accelerate the pace. 
Today, we announced we are committed to refranchising 100% of our bottling territories, including Coke coproduction by the end of 2017. This is a critical step for our entire system in North America. It will not be easy and will require the hard work and dedicated efforts of our entire team and close collaboration with our bottling partners. But we have a clear plan in place and are confident that this is essential for our future success. 
Moving on to China. Our bottling system in this dynamic country has evolved to the point where refranchising is the next logical step. Today, we are the bottler for roughly 1/3 of our dynamic China business. We have now entered into a nonbinding measure of intent to refranchise our bottling operations to our existing partners, COFCO and Swire. These bottlers have been excellent partners, demonstrating their willingness and capability to grow the China business for the long term. Therefore, we believe they are ready to take on additional territory and look forward to strengthening our partnerships with them.
These new announcements, combined with the pending creation of Coca-Cola European Partners and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa as well as our investment in our Indonesian bottler, will strengthen our global bottling system for the coming decades. To put it in perspective, adjusting for these transactions, the percent of our 2015 volumes sold through company-owned bottlers would have decreased from 18% to 3%. None of this would have been possible without the continuous investment and hard work of our Bottling Investment Group. When we are finished, our Bottling Investment Group will be smaller, more focused but will remain a critical, strategic growth enabler for our company. 
Taking a step back, I'm proud of the progress we've made over the past 18 months and look forward to completing the next critical phase of our journey. When we complete these refranchising efforts by the end of 2017, we will look at very -- we will look very different than we do today, as we return to a company that is focused on our core strengths of building strong, sustainable and valuable brands, creating value for our customers and partners and continuing to drive system capabilities. As a result, we will become less capital-intensive, with significantly higher margins and returns, which will enable our core strengths even further. 
Another of our 5 strategic initiatives is targeting disciplined brand and growth investments. While much of this discussion has been about increasing the quantity of our marketing, we know that improving the quality of our marketing is just as critical for success. That is why I am particularly pleased by Coca-Cola's new global marketing campaign. Actually, this is not just a new global campaign but a new business approach. While we've added a lot of choices to the trademark Coca-Cola portfolio over the years, drinks with calories, without calories, with caffeine or without, this is our first campaign ever to cover all the refreshing brands within our Coca-Cola trademark portfolio. 
As the most valuable beverage brand in the world, people continue to love our brand, but we recognize consumers want to enjoy Coca-Cola in different ways. Regardless, of which one they want, they want a Coca-Cola brand with great taste and uplifting refreshment. Our one-brand strategy transitions us to a single iconic brand campaign that celebrates both the product as well as the brand. Importantly, this campaign gets back to our roots, featuring the product at the heart of the creative and celebrating the experience and simple pleasures of drinking a Coca-Cola, any Coca-Cola. This campaign is also an example of how we are transforming the way we work to be faster with reduced costs. This campaign was built end-to-end from the start with -- from consumer through to shopper, digital and music and was developed to support the entire globe. This helped us reduce a number of agencies and better leverage production cost as well. This discipline, combined with the inspiration of our talented marketing teams, is what will continue to fuel our growth. 
While trademark Coca-Cola is the oxygen for our company, we have the leading portfolio of strong, valuable brands across multiple categories, and this portfolio continues to grow with $20 billion brands and a strong pipeline of growing regional brands. This year, we gained global value share across the core sparkling, packaged water, juice and juice drinks, energy drinks and ready-to-drink tea categories. In addition to internal innovation, we look externally for bolt-on opportunities to expand our still beverage portfolio and capabilities. Just last week, we announced an investment in Chi Limited [ph], Nigeria's leading value-added dairy and juice company. This adds to our other recent investments, including Monster, Suja and Fairlife, expanding our presence in the energy, juice and value-added dairy categories. 
Last quarter, we also announced our intention to sell our shares in conjunction with JAB Holding's pending acquisition of Keurig Green Mountain. We will recover our initial investment when that transaction closes while continuing to drive our Keurig KOLD opportunity in the marketplace. 
In summary, we recognize we still have much work to do, but we have a clear plan, clear path to transform the company, becoming more focused on our core business of building brands and leading our system of bottling partners, thereby giving us even greater confidence to achieve our long-term growth targets. 
I will now hand the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, James Quincey, who will provide you with a more detailed look at our operating performance in 2015."
26642,321967000,928925,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2016",2016-02-09,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone.

So as Muhtar mentioned, let me spend a few minutes reviewing our 2015 operational performance before handing the call over to Kathy. 
In 2015, we delivered our plan for our transition year despite challenging macroeconomic environments. We gained value share in any RTD, sparkling and still beverages, an important metric for us as we've managed the business, especially during periods of slower economic growth and volatility. 
For the full year, organic growth of revenues was 4%, and importantly, we delivered 2% global price/mix. This was stronger price realization than we have generated in several years, reflecting our segment revenue growth management strategies and enabled by our increased investments in media. 
Unit case volume grew 2% for the year. We're pleased with his volume performance, given our focus on improving price realization during a time when consumer spending was pressured in many markets. 
And I'm also pleased to confirm that globally, we captured over $600 million in productivity, ahead of the target we set for ourselves at the beginning of the year. So structurally adjusted, comparable currency-neutral income before tax grew 6% for the year, as we benefited from the productivity efforts and favorable commodities, although partially offset by our increased media investments.
During the year, we saw a slowing environment in China and challenges in several key emerging markets, including Brazil and Russia. This was offset by solid performance in North America and many of our Latin American markets. North America itself delivered its strongest performance in 3 years, delivery 4% organic revenue growth, with 3 points of price realization, supported by our increased marketing efforts and a disciplined approach to volume, price and mix management. Consistent with this strategic focus, our act of driving consumption small packages could be seen across North America. We grew purchased transactions 3%, outpacing the 1% unit case volume growth, as consumers increasingly reach for the mini cans, the smaller PET, the 8-ounce [ph] glass bottle as well as our premium aluminum bottles, all of which drive more value for occasion than our traditional packages. Hopefully, many of you also saw an example of this strategic focus on Sunday night during the Super Bowl when we aired our latest commercial focusing exclusively on the mini can package. 
Our performance in 2015 gives us confidence that our strategies are working and that our underlying performance will be within our long-term targets in 2016. However, let me be clear, the global economy remains challenged and is not improving rapidly. We do see slightly better GDP growth rates to 2016 as compared to 2015, but to be fair, forecasts continue to be revised downward, and there is still much uncertainty. 
Notable, our Brazil and Russia continuing to deteriorate, while China's growth rate does also slow, putting pressure across many of the emerging and developing markets. 
Now while helpful to consumers, the lower price of oil is also causing volatility in the Middle East and other oil-driven export economies with further implications of those nations. So given the erratic nature of the global economy, we will continue to focus on what we can control in order to deliver our plan. We will continue to build on the fundamental strategy for long-term success while delivering solid revenue growth and strong underlying operating margin expansion through the effective continued management of our portfolio, price/mix and productivity efforts. 
With that, I'm going to hand off to Kathy who will give the additional detail on North American productivity programs and walk through the 2016 outlook."
26642,321967000,928925,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2016",2016-02-09,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. In the interest of time this morning, I intend to cover just 3 topics: North America refranchising, our updated productivity targets and our outlook for 2016. Let me start with our refranchising efforts in N",1451,"Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. In the interest of time this morning, I intend to cover just 3 topics: North America refranchising, our updated productivity targets and our outlook for 2016. 
Let me start with our refranchising efforts in North America. As we accelerated our refranchising, we are returning to our core business of brand building, driving consumer value and leading the system. At the same time, the refranchising causes a lot of complexity in our North America P&L. Therefore, in order for management to view the underlying performance of our core business in North America separately, we made the decision to adjust our operating segments such that starting in 2016, CCR will be reported within our Bottling Investments Group. Going forward, the vast majority of any structural impacts to our business will now be reported within a single operating segment. We believe this will also be helpful for our investors for the same reason of assessing the continued underlying performance our core business. We understand that the accelerated refranchising, coupled with the shift in reporting segment, will likely result in a lot of modeling questions. So we will provide the revised operating segment financial information reflecting this change before the end of the quarter.
With regards to modeling, we are providing detailed structural guidance for 2016, the majority of which is related to the North America refranchising efforts. The remainder of the territory will transfer by the end of 2017, but the P&L impact will depend on the timing of transfer. We will share more with you at the appropriate time on the expected impact in 2017. 
As we transition territories, we are committed to eliminating the temporary residual costs we have referenced in the past as quickly as possible, and we anticipate the majority of these will be removed in 2017. With that said, there could be a portion of residual costs remaining in 2018 as we wind down the final support of these operations. But this amount will be relatively small and would be eliminated by the end of 2018. 
Our productivity program is also evolving due to the accelerated refranchising. Approximately half of our $3 billion productivity program was expected to come from supply chain savings. And a significant a portion of those savings were expected to come from North America due to the size and finished goods nature of the business. 
Now that we are accelerating our refranchising, we will no longer be able to capture a portion of the identified supply chain savings prior to divestiture. However, we have built a disciplined process and capabilities that have allowed us to exceed our goal to date and identify incremental opportunities within cost of goods sold, operating expenses and marketing to replace the supply chain savings being refranchised, thus enabling us to maintain our $3 billion target. 
As we've communicated to you in the past, we said we will continue to look at every layer of spending as we move through their productivity work, and we have done just that. 
Coupled with the success we've seen so far, we have the confidence to effectively raise our level of targeted savings across our remaining spend base. With the incremental savings identified in our core business and the fact that our addressable cost base will substantially reduce post-2017, it should be even more evident that our $3 billion program represents a sizable opportunity. We look forward to providing further details at CAGNY next week. 
Turning to outlook. Despite challenging macro environment in many key markets around the world, our focus on revenue and disciplined brand investment continues to improve our topline growth. Also we are seeing productivity flow through our P&L. While much of this was obscured by currency and structural changes, we saw solid underlying margin expansion last year even while we grew marketing expenses at a faster rate than gross profits. For those reasons, in 2016, we expect to be back on our long-term growth algorithm, prior to any structural changes, which are primarily driven by our accelerated pace of refranchising. 
Organic revenue is expected to grow 4% to 5%, in line with our long-term target, as our marketing investments continue to pay off. Given the current macro environment and lacking better comps in 2015, we believe this is a solid target. We expect the commodity environment to be benign, but considering that we hedge our exposure to many commodities, we may not see the full benefit you would expect when looking at today's spot prices. 
Given the general weak macroeconomic environment and the associated pressure on top line growth, we are focused on capturing more than $600 million of productivity in order to deliver our profit target. We will do this even as we continue to increase the investments in media behind our brand and step up R&D investment in 2016. 
Finally, we anticipate interest cost to increase in 2016 due to higher interest rates as well as our decision to shift some of our debt from commercial paper to longer-term maturities that carry slightly higher interest rates. After considering all these factors, we expect comparable currency-neutral usual income before tax, structurally adjusted, to grow 6% to 8% in 2016, in line with our long-term target, as strong operating profit growth is partially offset by net interest expense. 
As Muhtar mentioned earlier, there will be significant structural impact to our business as we accelerate our refranchising efforts in North America; complete the mergers of Coca-Cola European Partners and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa; and cycle a half year impact from the Monster Beverage transaction, which closed in mid-2015. We currently expect both Coca-Cola European Partners and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa to close during the second quarter. Taken together, we expect the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures to be a 4- to 5-point headwind to net revenue. 
Because of the nature of the structural changes, we also anticipate that the impact would be slightly higher on cost of goods sold and SG&A. We expect the benefit of equity income from Monster, Coca-Cola Beverage Africa and Coca-Cola European Partners to approximately offset that impact at operating income, resulting in a 3- to 4-point negative structural impact to income before tax. 
Our underlying effective tax rate is expected to remain at 22.5% for 2016. Finally, we approximately -- we expect approximately $2 billion to $2.5 billion in net share purchases for 2016. 
We therefore expect comparable currency-neutral EPS growth of 4% to 6%, inclusive of a 3- to 4-point structural headwind income before tax. 
As you well know, many of the world's currencies have continued to depreciate versus the U.S. dollar. Since we operate at over 200 markets, we are not immune to this effect. In addition, we will be cycling the euro debt remeasurement gain we recorded in other income during the first 2 quarters of 2015. 
Based on current spot rates, hedging activity and what we are cycling, we expect a 4-point headwind to net revenue and a 9-point headwind to income before tax. 
However, the currency headwind to operating income will be lower as we cycle the gain I just mentioned. 
In terms of coverage, we are fully hedged on the euro, yen and sterling for 2016. We also have near-term coverage in place across several other major currencies. 
Finally, we expect to spend $2.5 billion to $3 billion on CapEx as we continue to maintain our facilities in advance of transitioning territories and production assets. By the end of 2017, our capital needs will decrease significantly as we refranchise healthy businesses in North America and China. 
As you model the first quarter, please remember that due to our reporting calendar cycle, there will be 1 less day in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015. Based on current spot rates, hedging activity and what we are cycling, we expect that currency will be a 5-point headwind on net revenues and a 12-point headwind on income before tax in the first quarter of 2016. 
We expect the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures to be a slight headwind on net revenue and structural items to be a 2-point headwind on income before tax. 
In summary, our financial performance for 2015 was slightly better than our expectations, and we exceeded our 5-point plan effectively. And we are already working diligently to deliver our commitments for 2016. We continue to focus on our core capabilities of building brands, driving customer value and leading the system so that when we compete our refranchising, we will be a lower-risk, higher-return business with even greater confidence to achieve our long-term growth targets. 
We look forward to sharing more with you at CAGNY. Operator, we are now ready for questions."

So when you think about it, now we've been able to prove to ourselves that we can accelerate the business in North America. We've had the best year in 2015. You saw the results from the quarter. And these results show that our strategic focus on driving consumption of smaller package size is continuing to pay off. Transactions are growing. Price mix is healthy. And so we're bringing those 2 things together, the goal of going back, returning to our core model, which we have always emphasized. Even the first time we announced the purchase of CCE's U.S. operations, we said there'd be a role for partnerships going forward. And I've gone as soon as we put some things right. We have cut the 3 legs of the stool in place, the customer governance, production governance and the IT platforms. And so we feel very confident. We've proven to ourselves that we can do it, and we feel very confident that this is the time, the new model is established, bottling performance is improving. We have a new structure to last us until the next number of decades. And we've put the bottlers, we're putting our bottlers in the right hand. As Kathy said, the bottlers are very healthy, but thanks to the great leadership capability of our Bottling Investment Group. And so yes, we are now going to the core, and this is the time that we feel very confident that we can do the 2 things together, accelerate momentum and bring the franchising to a book and that really we feel is going to be very beneficial both to our company, our shareholders as well as to leading to better customer service and better value creation on the bottler side.

And the capability that has been put into place in all of our expanding bottlers everywhere is really giving us the confidence. And also just look at the momentum of the business. Our revenue growth was a priority. We've got it back -- we got it up to the 4 to 5 range. And increased marketing is working clearly. And now better marketing was even going to enhance that. And at the same time, we feel that every time the territory has transitioned, it's actually continued to do well, continued to gain share, continued to drive momentum, continued to drive incremental transactions. And from that, if any of the territories in the last 4 or 5 quarters that have been transitioned, we've seen, without exception that to be holding true. And so -- and if you look at all these bottlers that we've refranchised, look at the results, look at the performance of our German bottler. It's really -- has the greatest momentum in the continent of Europe right now. So all of these bottlers are going into a system, to a structure, to an architecture, to a geography that will continue to the even better when you combine it and when you create the synergies with the combination. And so we feel confident. And then what took a little while to get right was the governance model around production in the United States, the governance model around the IT platform, the governance model around the customer service. All those are in place and working well. So I'll just hand over to James to add some flavor to that in more details, and then Kathy can comment also on your questions related to the financial aspect of the cash."

So I just want to get an update on your market share performance. Obviously, you're gaining share, but have you seen a relative change in terms of incremental market share performance and what level of payback you're getting on the higher marketing? And as you look out to 2016, 4% to 5% organic sales growth, is it fairly tight range? So how much visibility do you think you have around that?

So Daryl, let me just give you a quick rundown around the world in terms of share. I mean, firstly, on overall global basis, perhaps consistent with our strong fourth quarter, we gained a little more share in the fourth quarter than we had in the whole year, so a better performance at the tail end. And in terms of how that played out across the world, you see, again in line with the volume performance strong, strong results in North America. We gained share in sparkling, we gained share in stills and we gained share overall in the quarter ended the year. So good momentum in North America coming through in share. In Europe, we're gaining share in sparkling and in stills. Given our different starting points, that's netting out to kind of being flat overall. We got a strong growth in Europe as we build our stills business. Latin America, this is a long-term track record of success, so small gains there, building on a long history of building a great position. Eurasia, despite some of the volatility in that part of the world, we gained share in both sparkling and stills and overall, pretty strong momentum there in terms of share. And then in Asia Pacific, we've focused more on restaging and reenergizing the sparkling businesses where we're gaining share. We lost a little bit in stills and overall flat. So I think wherever you look around the world, we're largely flat to gaining. And so inconsistent with our volume growth, which is broad-based and across the world, we're also largely winning across the world. So in terms of -- which one, marketing payback? So I think what you're seeing is there is results from the marketing payback. I mean, our revenue in '15, our organic revenue growth in '15 was better than '14. We're guiding for a good number that's ahead of '15 and '16. So we see the marketing payout beginning to build the momentum globally. And I think if you double down on that one and look under that, North America was one of the first places we started with incremental marketing, and that's self-evidently building momentum. So we see the underlying business results coming through in revenue, very much tied to where the extra media money is going. And then in terms of macro outlook and risk to top line, I think that we feel that we've got underlying structural momentum in the business. Now when I said the macro, we're planning on the macros slightly better in '16, and I really do mean slightly, and I wouldn't be surprised if that was the same growth rate in '15. But we think we have the right portfolio and the right optionality to be able to deliver our financial numbers in that environment."

Thanks, Muhtar. I think, firstly, it's important to remember, starting with Europe, that our price positioning in Europe, we have, over time, substantially taken a lot of rate and mix in Europe such that we are more premium-priced compared to our competitors than we are in North America. So less runway in that sense. Now having said that, we continue to focus on smaller packages, more premium offerings in terms of the brand portfolio such that despite what is a pretty deflationary retail environment in a number of Western European markets, we're getting price/mix in Europe, both in the quarter and for the full year. So I think going out, one should not expect the same sort of levels the U.S. has been able to develop, especially given the macro environment in Europe at the moment. In terms of Japan, we are very focused on rebuilding our ability to get positive price/mix in Japan. We've recently been able to get some. Again, very focused on leveraging both packaging options and the brand portfolio to reshape it to allow us to drive a positive mix. Again, I don't think you will see in Japan the same source of levels as the U.S. as much as anything to do with the deflationary pressures in Japan. But we are starting to see chances of a better pricing environment in Japan."

Let me start with the price/mix in Asia Pacific. I think the most important thing to note here is because the different geographies in the Asia Pacific group have quite different pricing and constant freight shipments can be lumpy, you do get some erratic price/mix numbers on a quarterly basis, not exactly what you're seeing in the fourth quarter in Asia Pacific. So there were more shipments to somewhere like India than Japan. We can actually see the flip side of this in the Eurasia group where we got very strong price/mix in the fourth quarter, which was the flip side. We had more shipments to places like South Africa than the Middle East. So this is all about country mix. I think it's important for a particularly those 2 groups, Asia Pacific and Eurasia, to look at some longer-term, 4-quarter trend line on price/mix, given the very impactful country mix issue and the lumpiness of constant freight shipments. That's the key thing there. And then in terms of China. Clearly, not as much as we would have liked to grow in China in the first quarter. I think that the environment in China is clearly having a slowdown. But we think we had a strong momentum over the last couple of years coming back into China. We are looking to do better in 2016, but we don't actually provide a country-based forecast. What I would say, however, is we're continuing to do very strongly in terms of share, particularly in sparkling as we've reenergized that business."

So related to juice and hot fill and stills, stills continue to perform well in North America for us.

So given those aspects, we intend that for the future to not change the structure related to both hot-fill as well as to juice and our foodservice business. All will remain as integrated in that respect. And they're doing very well, and we feel that they add value to the overall structure of North America. And they're an important strategic part of how we move forward and continue to increase momentum in North America. India, look, you saw that number. Given all these changes we're announcing basically, if you brought it back to 2015, the total bottling assets that we would have under our management and under -- and on our balance sheet would actually go down from 18% of the total mix globally to about 3%. So yes, India, there are opportunities in other parts of the world remaining, but it's a very small template based on where we are. And we'll look at opportunities.

We've gone from about 10% of the portfolio being stills to roughly 25% of the portfolio being stills. I think mathematically, the stills will grow as a percent of the total portfolio. And I would know, just Muhtar commented earlier, I think we need to break out the stills and not just look at the one thing. Look at it in terms of the individual categories. And we gained share in packaged juice and juice drinks. We gained share in energy, and we gained share in ready-to-drink tea. So we think we can do well in each of the categories that represent nonalcoholic ready-to-drink. And in particular, we can still grow sparkling, and that growth of sparkling into the future is not just in aggregate. But I think, over the long term, we'll see increased growth of low, no and reduced calorie variance, and that's not the case yet in the North America, but globally, in our international business, those drinks outgrow the regular drinks within sparkling and are fueling our growth, broad-based growth."

So it's clear dilution right now than 2016 Q4 [ph] and then probably 2017. But what.we'll be able to grow over that dilution given that kind of better margin top line growth, et cetera. And then kind of the core question is that you mentioned your goal was by North America bottling, that you have to -- you still have to be able to accelerate momentum for sold the perfect. And I agree you kind of dumb that go into smaller pack sizes, increasing prices, closing some plants, increasing media spend, improving IT. But I guess I'm still confused why you had to buy the bottlers or a one consolidated bottler, I guess, in North America, to do a lot of those changes. And why do have to spend the dollars [ph] to push these changes whether or not it more efficient for shareholders way to do it? And I guess, in that context, how do you give investors confidence, because I get this question a lot, I'll begin investors, 5, 10 years down the line, you won't and have to buy these bottlers back again in North America?"

First, when we announced the acquisition of CCE, it was essentially kind of a 25-year-old problem, and that we said it would take a while to basically course-correct them. The level of investment was not where it was needed. And also the level of customer service was not where it was needed. And essentially, we believe that having more than just one bottler essentially having that big a territory was a better way, scalable size, bottlers, right ownership values, right structure and right capability. And that's what we have today in North America. And so we feel very good that this is a model that is going to stay where it is and continue to add value. It's not going to require any further -- of course, all the time, there'll be a tweaking necessary, but not the scale that was needed when we did the transaction back at the end of 2010. And so that was a core decision that was needed. There was a major surgery that was needed, and that's really what took place. As far as the juice business is concerned. As I said before, is an integrated business. It basically performs well as an integrated business similar to other juice businesses that we have around the world. It's a very different model. It's a very different production. It's a very different growth to table model and requires a different way of -- in terms of its distribution, especially when it's chilled. And that's really where a lot of the growth is and value-added dairy. And that's what you see whether it's in fair line for that's what you see whether it's in juice. And it's a very distinct production model, very different as well as the hot-fill is also the same. So same with Innocent in Europe, the same with many parts of the world. So it is also very similar in terms of the way it's produced. And that is just a needed aspect for success and for performance in the hot-fill and juice business, very different.

In late 2014, we announced a clear 5-point plan to reinvigorate our growth and increase profitability. We committed to transform the company to one that is focused on our core value-creation model of building strong brands, enhancing customer relationships and leading our franchise system with a goal of becoming a leaner, higher-margin, higher-return and more focused company. And I'm pleased to say that we made significant progress against our initiatives, including the very important announcement this morning about accelerating our refranchising. Importantly, our progress against these initiatives is leading to improving performance even in a very challenging macro environment. 
Let's start with our key announcements today. One of our 5 strategic initiatives has been to refocus on our core business of building brands and leading our system of bottling partners. As part of this, we've continued to advance our global refranchising initiatives. With the success of our efforts in Europe and North America, we have the confidence to accelerate our plans. In North America, we learned a significant amount from our initial territory transition efforts. Including the additional territories announced this morning, to date, we've signed agreements or transferred territories representing over 40% of U.S. bottle/can volume. At the same time, the performance of our North America business has continued to improve throughout this process, delivering the highest revenue growth in 3 years while we executed this important transformation. 
Based on our success and the knowledge we gained through the transitions, we are now ready to accelerate the pace.  Today, we announced we are committed to refranchising 100% of our bottling territories, including Coke coproduction, by the end of 2017. This is a critical step for our entire system in North America. It will not be easy and will require the hard work and dedicated efforts of our entire team and close collaboration with our bottling partners, but we have a clear plan in place and are confident that this is essential for our future success. 
Moving on to China. Our bottling system in this dynamic country has evolved to the point where refranchising is the next logical step. Today, we are the bottler for roughly 1/3 of our dynamic China business. We have now entered into a nonbinding letter of intent to refranchise our bottling operations to our existing partners, COFCO and Swire. These bottlers have been excellent partners, demonstrating their willingness and capability to grow the China business for the long term. Therefore, we believe they are ready to take on additional territory and look forward to strengthening our partnerships with them.
These new announcements, combined with the pending creation of Coca-Cola European Partners and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, as well as our investment in our Indonesian bottler, will strengthen our global bottling system for the coming decades. 
To put it in perspective, adjusting for these transactions, the percent of our 2015 volumes sold through company-owned bottlers would have decreased from 18% to 3%. None of this would have been possible without the continuous investment and hard work of our Bottling Investment Group. When we are finished, our Bottling Investment Group will be smaller, more focused, but will remain a critical, strategic growth-enabler for our company. 
Taking a step back, I'm proud of the progress we've made over the past 18 months and look forward to completing the next critical phase of our journey. When we complete these refranchising efforts by the end of 2017, we will look at very -- we will look very different than we do today, as we return to a company that is focused on our core strengths of building strong, sustainable and valuable brands, creating value for our customers and partners and continuing to drive system capabilities. As a result, we will become less capital-intensive, with significantly higher margins and returns, which will enable our core strengths even further. 
Another of our 5 strategic initiatives is targeting disciplined brand and growth investments. While much of this discussion has been about increasing the quantity of our marketing, we know that improving the quality of our marketing is just as critical for success. That is why I am particularly pleased by Coca-Cola's new global marketing campaign. Actually, this is not just a new global campaign but a new business approach. While we've added a lot of choices to the trademark Coca-Cola portfolio over the years, drinks with calories, without calories, with caffeine or without, this is our first campaign ever to cover all the refreshing brands within our Coca-Cola trademark portfolio. 
As the most valuable beverage brand in the world, people continue to love our brand, but we recognize consumers want to enjoy Coca-Cola in different ways. Regardless of which one they want, they want a Coca-Cola brand with great taste and uplifting refreshment. Our one-brand strategy transitions us to a single iconic brand campaign that celebrates both the product as well as the brand. Importantly, this campaign gets back to our roots, featuring the product at the heart of the creative and celebrating the experience and simple pleasures of drinking a Coca-Cola, any Coca-Cola. This campaign is also an example of how we are transforming the way we work to be faster with reduced costs. This campaign was built end-to-end from the start with -- from consumer through to shopper, digital and music and was developed to support the entire globe. This helped us reduce the number of agencies and better leverage production cost as well. This discipline, combined with the inspiration of our talented marketing teams, is what will continue to fuel our growth. 
While trademark Coca-Cola is the oxygen for our company, we have the leading portfolio of strong, valuable brands across multiple categories, and this portfolio continues to grow with $20 billion brands and a strong pipeline of growing regional brands. This year, we gained global value share across the core sparkling, packaged water, juice and juice drinks, energy drinks and ready-to-drink tea categories. In addition to internal innovation, we look externally for bolt-on opportunities to expand our still beverage portfolio and capabilities.  Just last week, we announced an investment in Chi Ltd., Nigeria's leading value-added dairy and juice company. This adds to our other recent investments, including Monster, Suja and fairlife, expanding our presence in the energy, juice and value-added dairy categories. 
Last quarter, we also announced our intention to sell our shares in conjunction with JAB Holding's pending acquisition of Keurig Green Mountain. We will recover our initial investment when that transaction closes while continuing to drive our Keurig KOLD opportunity in the marketplace. 
In summary, we recognize we still have much work to do, but we have a clear plan, clear path to transform the company, becoming more focused on our core business of building brands and leading our system of bottling partners, thereby giving us even greater confidence to achieve our long-term growth targets. 
I will now hand the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, James Quincey, who will provide you with a more detailed look at our operating performance in 2015."

So as Muhtar mentioned, let me spend a few minutes reviewing our 2015 operational performance before handing the call over to Kathy. 
In 2015, we delivered our plan for our transition year despite challenging macroeconomic environments. We gained value share in NARTD, sparkling and still beverages, an important metric for us as we've managed the business, especially during periods of slower economic growth and volatility. 
For the full year, organic growth of revenues was 4%, and importantly, we delivered 2% global price/mix. This was stronger price realization than we have generated in several years, reflecting our segmented revenue growth management strategies and enabled by our increased investments in media. 
Unit case volume grew 2% for the year. We're pleased with this volume performance, given our focus on improving price realization during a time when consumer spending was pressured in many markets. 
And I'm also pleased to confirm that globally, we captured over $600 million in productivity, ahead of the target we set for ourselves at the beginning of the year. So structurally adjusted, comparable currency-neutral income before tax grew 6% for the year, as we benefited from the productivity efforts and favorable commodities, although partially offset by our increased media investments.
During the year, we saw a slowing environment in China and challenges in several key emerging markets, including Brazil and Russia. This was offset by solid performance in North America and many of our Latin American markets. North America itself delivered its strongest performance in 3 years, delivering 4% organic revenue growth with 3 points of price realization, supported by our increased marketing efforts and a disciplined approach to volume, price and mix management. Consistent with this strategic focus are at driving of consumption of small packages could be seen across North America. We grew purchased transactions 3%, outpacing the 1% unit case volume growth as consumers increasingly reach for the mini cans, the smaller PET, the 8-ounce glass bottle, as well as our premium aluminum bottles, all of which drive more value per occasion than our traditional packages. Hopefully, many of you also saw an example of this strategic focus on Sunday night during the Super Bowl when we aired our latest commercial focusing exclusively on the mini can package. 
Our performance in 2015 gives us confidence that our strategies are working and that our underlying performance will be within our long-term targets in 2016. However, let me be clear, the global economy remains challenged and is not improving rapidly. We do see slightly better GDP growth rates to 2016 as compared to 2015, but to be fair, forecast continue to be revised downwards and there's still much uncertainty.  Notable are Brazil and Russia continuing to deteriorate, while China's growth rate does also slow, putting pressure across many of the emerging and developing markets. 
Now while helpful to consumers, the lower price of oil is also causing volatility in the Middle East and other oil-driven export economies with further implications for those nations. So given the erratic nature of the global economy, we will continue to focus on what we can control in order to deliver our plan. We will continue to build on the fundamentals of our strategy for long-term success while delivering solid revenue growth and strong underlying operating margin expansion through the effective continued management of our portfolio, price/mix and productivity efforts. 
With that, I'm going to hand off to Kathy who will give you additional detail on North American productivity programs and walk through the 2016 article -- outlook."

In the interest of time this morning, I intend to cover just 3 topics: North America refranchising, our updated productivity targets and our outlook for 2016.  Let me start with our refranchising efforts in North America. 
As we accelerate our refranchising, we are returning to our core business of brand building, driving consumer value and leading the system. At the same time, the refranchising causes a lot of complexity in our North America P&L. Therefore, in order for management to view the underlying performance of our core business in North America separately, we made the decision to adjust our operating segments such that starting in 2016, CCR will be reported within our Bottling Investments Group. Going forward, the vast majority of any structural impacts to our business will now be reported within a single operating segment. We believe this will also be helpful to our investors for the same reason of assessing the continued underlying performance our core business. We understand that the accelerated refranchising, coupled with the shift in reporting segment, will likely result in a lot of modeling questions. So we will provide the revised operating segment financial information reflecting this change before the end of the quarter.
With regards to modeling, we are providing detailed structural guidance for 2016, the majority of which is related to the North America refranchising efforts. The remainder of the territories will transfer by the end of 2017, but the P&L impact will depend on the timing of transfer. We will share more with you at the appropriate time on the expected impact in 2017. 
As we transition territories, we are committed to eliminating the temporary residual costs we have referenced in the past as quickly as possible, and we anticipate the majority of these will be removed in 2017. With that said, there could be a portion of residual costs remaining in 2018 as we wind down the final support of these operations, but this amount would be relatively small and would be eliminated by the end of 2018. 
Our productivity program is also evolving due to the accelerated refranchising. Approximately half of our $3 billion productivity program was expected to come from supply chain savings. And a significant portion of those savings were expected to come from North America due to the size and finished goods nature of the business.  Now that we are accelerating our refranchising, we will no longer be able to capture a portion of the identified supply chain savings prior to divestiture. However, we have built a disciplined process and capabilities that have allowed us to exceed our goal to date and identify incremental opportunities within cost of goods sold, operating expenses and marketing to replace the supply chain savings being refranchised, thus enabling us to maintain our $3 billion target.  As we've communicated to you in the past, we said we will continue to look at every layer of spending as we move through their productivity work, and we have done just that. 
Coupled with the success we've seen so far, we have the confidence to effectively raise our level of targeted savings across our remaining spend base. With the incremental savings identified in our core business and the fact that our addressable cost base will substantially reduce post 2017, it should be even more evident that our $3 billion program represents a sizable opportunity. We look forward to providing further details at CAGNY next week. 
Turning to outlook. Despite challenging macro environment in many key markets around the world, our focus on revenue and disciplined brand investment continues to improve our top line growth. Also we are seeing productivity flow through our P&L. While much of this was obscured by currency and structural changes, we saw solid underlying margin expansion last year even while we grew marketing expenses at a faster rate than gross profits. For those reasons, in 2016, we expect to be back on our long-term growth algorithm prior to any structural changes, which are primarily driven by our accelerated pace of refranchising. 
Organic revenue is expected to grow 4% to 5%, in line with our long-term target, as our marketing investments continue to pay off. Given the current macro environment and lasting better comps in 2015, we believe this is a solid target. We expect the commodity environment to be benign, but considering that we hedge our exposure to many commodities, we may not see the full benefit you would expect when looking at today's spot prices. 
Given the general weak macroeconomic environment and the associated pressure on top line growth, we are focused on capturing more than $600 million of productivity in order to deliver our profit target. We will do this even as we continue to increase the investments in media behind our brand and step up R&D investment in 2016. 
Finally, we anticipate interest cost to increase in 2016 due to higher interest rates, as well as our decision to shift some of our debt from commercial paper to longer-term maturities that carry slightly higher interest rates. After considering all of these factors, we expect comparable currency-neutral usual income before tax structurally adjusted to grow 6% to 8% in 2016, in line with our long-term targets, as strong operating profit growth is partially offset by net interest expense. 
As Muhtar mentioned earlier, there will be a significant structural impact to our business as we accelerate our refranchising efforts in North America; complete the mergers of Coca-Cola European Partners and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa; and cycle a half-year impact from the Monster Beverage transaction which closed in mid-2015. We currently expect both Coca-Cola European Partners and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa to close during the second quarter. Taken together, we expect the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures to be a 4- to 5-point headwind to net revenue. 
Because of the nature of the structural changes, we also anticipate that the impact would be slightly higher on cost of goods sold and SG&A. We expect the benefit to equity income from Monster, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa and Coca-Cola European Partners to partially offset that impact by operating income, resulting in a 3- to 4-point negative structural impact to income before tax.  Our underlying effective tax rate is expected to remain at 22.5% for 2016.  
Finally, we approximately -- we expect approximately $2 billion to $2.5 billion in net share purchases for 2016.  We therefore expect comparable currency-neutral EPS growth of 4% to 6%, inclusive of a 3- to 4-point structural headwind income before tax. 
As you all know, many of the world's currencies have continued to depreciate versus the U.S. dollar. Since we operate in over 200 markets, we are not immune to this effect. In addition, we will be cycling the euro debt remeasurement gain we recorded in other income during the first 2 quarters of 2015.  Based on current spot rates, hedging activity and what we are cycling, we expect a 4-point headwind to net revenue and a 9-point headwind to income before tax.  However, the currency headwind to operating income will be lower as we cycle the gain I just mentioned. 
In terms of coverage, we are fully hedged on the euro, yen and sterling for 2016. We also have near-term coverage in place across several other major currencies. 
Finally, we expect to spend $2.5 billion to $3 billion on CapEx as we continue to maintain our facilities in advance of transitioning territories and production assets. By the end of 2017, our capital needs will decrease significantly as we refranchise healthy businesses in North America and China. 
As you model the first quarter, please remember that due to our reporting calendar cycle, there will be 1 less day in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015. Based on current spot rates, hedging activity and what we are cycling, we expect that currency will be a 5-point headwind on net revenues and a 12-point headwind on income before tax in the first quarter of 2016. 
We expect the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures to be a slight headwind on net revenue and structural items to be a 2-point headwind on income before tax. 
In summary, our financial performance for 2015 was slightly better than our expectations, and we executed our 5-point plan effectively. And we are already working diligently to deliver our commitments for 2016. We continue to focus on our core capabilities of building brands, driving customer value and leading the system so that when we complete our refranchising, we will be a lower-risk, higher-return business with even greater confidence to achieve our long-term growth targets.  We look forward to sharing more with you at CAGNY.

Ever since I took over as CEO, I've always emphasized the importance of our franchise model, and one of my clear priorities was to accelerate growth in our biggest profit pool, the United States. And we bought the business of CCE U.S. operations with that goal in mind. So when you think about it now, we've been able to prove to ourselves that we can accelerate the business in North America. We've had the best year in 2015. You saw the results from the quarter. And these results show that our strategic focus on driving consumption of smaller package size is continuing to pay off, transactions are growing, price mix is healthy. And so bringing those 2 things together, both the goal of going back -- returning to our core model, which we've always emphasized. Even the first time we announced the purchase of CCE's U.S. operations, we said there'll be a role for partnerships going forward as long as -- as soon as we can put some things right. We have got the 3 legs of the stool in place, the customer governance, production governance and the IT platforms. And so we feel very confident. We've proven to ourselves that we can do it, and we feel very confident that this is the time. The new model is established. Bottler performance is improving. We have a new structure to last us the next number of decades. And we've put the bottlers -- we're putting our bottlers in the right hands. As Kathy said, the bottlers are very healthy, but -- and thanks to the great leadership capability of our Bottling Investment Group. And so yes, we are now going to the core, and this is the time. And we feel very confident that we can do the 2 things together, accelerate momentum and bring the franchising to a book end that, really, we feel is going to be very beneficial both to our company, our share owners, as well as to leading to better customer service and better value creation on the bottler side. So it's really a win-win from all those perspectives, Bill."

And the capability that has been put into place in all our expanding bottlers, everywhere, is really giving us the confidence. And also just look at the momentum of the business. Our revenue growth was a priority. We've got it back -- we got it up to the 4 to 5 range and increased marketing is working clearly. And now, better marketing was even going to enhance that. And at the same time, we feel that every time the territory has transitioned, it's actually continued to do well, continued to gain share, continued to drive momentum, continued to drive incremental transactions. And from that, if any of the territories in the last 4, 5 quarters that have been transitioned, we've seen, without exception, that to be holding true. And so -- and if you look at all these bottlers that we've refranchised, look at the results -- look at the performance of our German bottler. It's really -- has the greatest momentum in the continent of Europe right now. So all of these bottlers are going into a system, to a structure, to an architecture, to a geography that will continue to do even better when you combine it and when you create the synergies with the combination. And so we feel confident. And then what took a little while to get right was the governance model around production in the United States, the governance model around the IT platform, the governance model around the customer service. All those are in place and working well. So I'll just hand over to James to add some flavor to that in more details, and then Kathy can comment also on your questions related to the financial aspect of the cash."

I mean firstly, on overall global basis, perhaps consistent with our strong fourth quarter, we gained a little more share in the fourth quarter than we had",482,"Yes. Thanks, Muhtar. So Dara, let me just give you a quick run around the world in terms of share. I mean firstly, on overall global basis, perhaps consistent with our strong fourth quarter, we gained a little more share in the fourth quarter than we had in the whole year, so a better performance at the tail end. And in terms of how that played out across the world, you see, again, in line with the volume performance, strong results in North America. We gained share in sparkling. We gained share in stills. And we gained share overall in the quarter and in year. So good momentum in North America coming through in share. In Europe, we're gaining share in sparkling and in stills. Given our different starting points, that's netting out to kind of being flat overall. But we're -- we got a strong growth in Europe as we build our stills business. Latin America, this is a long-term track record of success, so small gains there, building on a long history of building a great position. Eurasia, despite some of the volatility in that part of the world, we gained share in both sparkling and stills and overall. Pretty strong momentum there in terms of share. And then in Asia Pacific, we've been focused more on restaging and reenergizing the sparkling businesses where we're gaining share. We lost a little bit in stills, and overall, flat. So I think wherever you look around the world, we're largely flat to gaining. And so inconsistent with our volume growth, which is broad-based and across the world, we're also largely winning across the world. So in terms of -- which one do you want me to do? Marketing payback? So I think what you're seeing is there is results from the marketing payback. I mean, our revenue in '15, our organic revenue growth in '15, was better than '14. We're guiding for a good number that's ahead of '15 in '16, so we see the marketing payout beginning to build the momentum globally. And I think if you double down on that one and look under that, North America was one of the first places we started with the incremental marketing, and that's self-evidently building momentum. So we see the underlying business results coming through in revenue, very much tied to where the extra media money is going. And then in terms of macro outlook and risk to top line, I think we feel that we got underlying structural momentum in the business. Now when I said the macro -- we're planning on the macros slightly better in '16, and I really do mean slightly, and I wouldn't be surprised if that was the same growth rate in '15. But we think we have the right portfolio and the right optionality to be able to deliver our financial numbers in that environment."

Thanks, Muhtar. I think, firstly, it's important to remember, starting with Europe, that our price positioning in Europe, we have, over time, substantially taken a lot of rate and mix in Europe such that we are more premium-priced compared to our competitors than we are in North America. So less runway in that sense. Now having said that, we continue to focus on smaller packages, more premium offerings in terms of the brand portfolio, such that despite what is a pretty deflationary retail environment in a number of Western European markets, we're getting price/mix in Europe, both in the quarter and for the full year. So I think going out, one should not expect the same sort of levels the U.S. has been able to develop, especially given the macro environment in Europe at the moment. In terms of Japan, we are very focused on rebuilding our ability to get positive price/mix in Japan. We've recently been able to get some. Again, very focused on leveraging both packaging options and the brand portfolio to reshape it to allow us to drive a positive mix.

Let me start with the price/mix in Asia Pacific. I think the most important thing to note here is because the different geographies in the Asia Pacific group have some quite different pricing and concentrate shipments can be lumpy, you do get some erratic price/mix numbers on a quarterly basis, and that's exactly what you're seeing in the fourth quarter in Asia Pacific. So there were more shipments to somewhere like India than Japan. You can actually see the flip side of this in the Eurasia group where we got very strong price/mix in the fourth quarter, which was the flip side. We had more shipments to places like South Africa than the Middle East. So this is all about country mix. I think it's important to, particularly those 2 groups, Asia Pacific and Eurasia, to look at some longer-term, 4-quarter trend line on price/mix, given the very impactful country mix issue and the lumpiness of concentrate shipments. That's the key thing there. And then in terms of China, clearly, not as much as we would have liked to grow in China in the first quarter. I think that the environment in China is clearly -- pretty clearly having a slowdown. But we think we had a strong momentum over the last couple of years coming back into China. We're looking to do better in 2016, but we don't actually provide a country-based forecast. What I would say, however, is we're continuing to do very strongly in terms of share, particularly in sparkling as we've reenergized that business."

And how much, if any, you expect to spend incrementally on A&P [ph] in order to achieve what amounts to underlying acceleration? And then finally, James -- sorry for all the questions. We debated this a little while back, and I'm just wondering if you've got additional thoughts in terms of your longer-term growth. How much do you expect the portfolio to lean on stills versus sparkling? And do you think you have the right balance of demand-building support against each of that in order to achieve your long-term goals?"

So related to juice and hot-fill and stills, stills continues to perform well in North America for us. And the template for stills production is completely different in terms of how it's configured to cold-fill. And therefore -- and juice is an integrated business. So given those aspects, we intend that for the future, to not change the structure related to both hot-fill as well as to juice and our foodservice business. All will remain as integrated in that respect. And they're doing very well and we feel that they add value to the overall structure of North America. And they're an important strategic part of how we move forward and continue to increase momentum in North America. India, look, you saw that number. Given all these changes we're announcing, basically, if you brought it back to 2015, the total bottling assets that we would have under our management and under -- on our balance sheet would actually go down from 18% of the total mix globally to about 3%. So yes, India, there are opportunities in other parts of the world remaining, but it's a very small template based on where we are. And we'll look at opportunities. As James said earlier, one of the litmus tests -- I've always said one of the great sort of litmus tests for the health of The Coca-Cola business is the desire of our investors and our franchise partners to have more territories that's at an all-time high remains that -- and we expect that to remain high, and therefore, there may be other opportunities in the remaining geographies, but I can't comment on that any further right now. And then I'll pass it over to James to take you through the longer-term question and portfolio, stills versus sparkling. And then Kathy, the question on 4% to 5% organic growth volume versus price.

Now I think in the total portfolio sense, much that in the same way has happened over the last decade or so. We've gone from about 10% of the portfolio being stills to roughly 25% of the portfolio being stills. I think mathematically, the stills will grow as a percent of the total portfolio. And I would note, as Muhtar commented earlier, I think we need to break out the stills and not just look at them as one thing, but look at them in terms of their individual categories. And we gained share in packaged [indiscernible] and juice drinks, we gained share in energy, and we gained share in ready-to-drink tea. So we think we can do well in each of the categories that represent nonalcoholic ready-to-drink. And in particular, we can still grow sparkling, and that growth of sparkling into the future is not just in aggregate. But I think, over the long term, we'll see increased growth of low, no and reduced calorie variance. I know that's not the case yet in the North America. But globally, in our international business, those drinks outgrow the regular drinks within sparkling and are fueling our growth. So broad-based growth."

I'm not quite there on hot-fills, so if you can elaborate on that, that will be helpful. Trying to get a better sense, secondarily, about when you think you will actually able to grow out of the dilution. So there's clearly dilution right now, and then 2016 through to 4 and then probably 2017. But at what point will we be able to grow out of that dilution given kind of better margin top line growth, et cetera. And then kind of the core question is that you mentioned your goal was, by buying North America bottling, that you'd have to -- you'd be able to accelerate momentum for sales and profitability. And I agree you've kind of done that, going to smaller pack sizes, increasing prices, closing some plants, increasing media spend, improving IT. But I guess I'm still confused why you had to buy the bottlers or one consolidated bottler, I guess, in North America, to do a lot of those changes. I mean, why do have to spend billions of dollars to push these changes through? Was there not a more efficient-for-shareholders way to do it? And I guess, in that context, how do you give investors confidence -- because I get this question a lot. How do you get investors -- give investors confidence that 5, 10 years down the line, you won't have to buy these bottlers back again in North America?"

First, when we announced the acquisition of CCE, it was essentially kind of a 25-year-old problem and that we said it would take a while to basically course-correct them. The level of investment was not where it was needed. And also, the level of customer service was not where it was needed. And essentially, we believe that having more than just one bottler, essentially, having that big a territory was a better way, scalable size, bottlers, the right ownership values, right structure and right capability, and that's what we have today in North America. And so we feel very good that this is a model that is going to stay where it is and continue to add value. It's not going to require any further -- of course, all the time, there'll be a tweaking necessary, but not the scale that was needed when we did the transaction back at the end of 2010. And so that was a core decision that was needed. There was a major surgery that was needed, and that's really what took place. As far as the juice business is concerned, as I said before, it's an integrated business. It basically performs well as an integrated business, similar to other juice businesses that we have around the world that's -- it's a very different model. It's a very different production. It's a very different growth-to-table model and requires a different way of -- in terms of its distribution, especially when it's chilled. And that's really where a lot of the growth is, and value-added dairy. And that's what you see whether it's in fairlife, or that's what you see whether it's in juice. And it's a very distinct production model, very different. As well as the hot-fill is also the same. So same with Innocent in Europe, the same with many parts of the world. And so[indiscernible]  Is also very similar in terms of the way it's produced, and that is just a needed aspect for success and for performance in the hot-fill and juice business. Very different.

In late 2014, we announced a clear 5-point plan to reinvigorate our growth and increase profitability. We committed to transform the company to one that is focused on our core value-creation model of building strong brands, enhancing customer relationships and leading our franchise system with a goal of becoming a leaner, higher-margin, higher-return and more focused company. And I'm pleased to say that we made significant progress against our initiatives, including the very important announcement this morning about accelerating our refranchising. Importantly, our progress against these initiatives is leading to improving performance even in a very challenging macro environment. 
Let's start with our key announcements today. One of our 5 strategic initiatives has been to refocus on our core business of building brands and leading our system of bottling partners. As part of this, we've continued to advance our global refranchising initiatives. With the success of our efforts in Europe and North America, we have the confidence to accelerate our plans. In North America, we learned a significant amount from our initial territory transition efforts. Including the additional territories announced this morning, to date, we've signed agreements or transferred territories representing over 40% of U.S. bottle/can volume. At the same time, the performance of our North America business has continued to improve throughout this process, delivering the highest revenue growth in 3 years while we executed this important transformation. 
Based on our success and the knowledge we gained through the transitions, we are now ready to accelerate the pace.  Today, we announced we are committed to refranchising 100% of our bottling territories, including Coke coproduction, by the end of 2017. This is a critical step for our entire system in North America. It will not be easy, and will require the hard work and dedicated efforts of our entire team and close collaboration with our bottling partners, but we have a clear plan in place and are confident that this is essential for our future success. 
Moving on to China. Our bottling system in this dynamic country has evolved to the point where refranchising is the next logical step. Today, we are the bottler for roughly 1/3 of our dynamic China business. We have now entered into a nonbinding letter of intent to refranchise our bottling operations to our existing partners, COFCO and Swire. These bottlers have been excellent partners, demonstrating their willingness and capability to grow the China business for the long term. Therefore, we believe they are ready to take on additional territory and look forward to strengthening our partnerships with them.
These new announcements, combined with the pending creation of Coca-Cola European Partners and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa, as well as our investment in our Indonesian bottler, will strengthen our global bottling system for the coming decades. 
To put it in perspective, adjusting for these transactions, the percent of our 2015 volumes sold through company-owned bottlers would have decreased from 18% to 3%. None of this would have been possible without the continuous investment and hard work of our Bottling Investment Group. When we are finished, our Bottling Investment Group will be smaller, more focused, but will remain a critical, strategic growth-enabler for our company. 
Taking a step back, I'm proud of the progress we've made over the past 18 months and look forward to completing the next critical phase of our journey. When we complete these refranchising efforts by the end of 2017, we will look at very -- we will look very different than we do today, as we return to a company that is focused on our core strengths of building strong, sustainable and valuable brands, creating value for our customers and partners and continuing to drive system capabilities. As a result, we will become less capital-intensive, with significantly higher margins and returns, which will enable our core strengths even further. 
Another of our 5 strategic initiatives is targeting disciplined brand and growth investments. While much of this discussion has been about increasing the quantity of our marketing, we know that improving the quality of our marketing is just as critical for success. That is why I am particularly pleased by Coca-Cola's new global marketing campaign. Actually, this is not just a new global campaign but a new business approach. While we've added a lot of choices to the trademark Coca-Cola portfolio over the years, drinks with calories, without calories, with caffeine or without, this is our first campaign ever to cover all the refreshing brands within our Coca-Cola trademark portfolio. 
As the most valuable beverage brand in the world, people continue to love our brand, but we recognize consumers want to enjoy Coca-Cola in different ways. Regardless of which one they want, they want a Coca-Cola brand with great taste and uplifting refreshment. Our one-brand strategy transitions us to a single iconic brand campaign that celebrates both the product as well as the brand. Importantly, this campaign gets back to our roots, featuring the product at the heart of the creative and celebrating the experience and simple pleasures of drinking a Coca-Cola, any Coca-Cola. This campaign is also an example of how we are transforming the way we work to be faster with reduced costs. This campaign was built end-to-end from the start with -- from consumer through to shopper, digital and music and was developed to support the entire globe. This helped us reduce the number of agencies and better leverage production cost as well. This discipline, combined with the inspiration of our talented marketing teams, is what will continue to fuel our growth. 
While trademark Coca-Cola is the oxygen for our company, we have the leading portfolio of strong, valuable brands across multiple categories, and this portfolio continues to grow with $20 billion brands and a strong pipeline of growing regional brands. This year, we gained global value share across the core sparkling, packaged water, juice and juice drinks, energy drinks and ready-to-drink tea categories. In addition to internal innovation, we look externally for bolt-on opportunities to expand our still beverage portfolio and capabilities.  Just last week, we announced an investment in Chi Ltd., Nigeria's leading value-added dairy and juice company. This adds to our other recent investments, including Monster, Suja and fairlife, expanding our presence in the energy, juice and value-added dairy categories. 
Last quarter, we also announced our intention to sell our shares in conjunction with JAB Holding's pending acquisition of Keurig Green Mountain. We will recover our initial investment when that transaction closes, while continuing to drive our Keurig KOLD opportunity in the marketplace. 
In summary, we recognize we still have much work to do, but we have a clear plan, clear path to transform the company, becoming more focused on our core business of building brands and leading our system of bottling partners, thereby giving us even greater confidence to achieve our long-term growth targets. 
I will now hand the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, James Quincey, who will provide you with a more detailed look at our operating performance in 2015."
26642,321967000,929392,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2016",2016-02-09,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone.

So as Muhtar mentioned, let me spend a few minutes reviewing our 2015 operational performance before handing the call over to Kathy. 
In 2015, we delivered our plan for our transition year despite challenging macroeconomic environments. We gained value share in NARTD, sparkling and still beverages, an important metric for us as we've managed the business, especially during periods of slower economic growth and volatility. 
For the full year, organic growth of revenues was 4%, and importantly, we delivered 2% global price/mix. This was stronger price realization than we have generated in several years, reflecting our segmented revenue growth management strategies and enabled by our increased investments in media. 
Unit case volume grew 2% for the year. We're pleased with this volume performance, given our focus on improving price realization during a time when consumer spending was pressured in many markets. 
And I'm also pleased to confirm that globally, we captured over $600 million in productivity, ahead of the target we set for ourselves at the beginning of the year. So structurally adjusted, comparable currency-neutral income before tax grew 6% for the year, as we benefited from the productivity efforts and favorable commodities, although partially offset by our increased media investments.
During the year, we saw a slowing environment in China and challenges in several key emerging markets, including Brazil and Russia. This was offset by solid performance in North America and many of our Latin American markets. North America itself delivered its strongest performance in 3 years, delivering 4% organic revenue growth with 3 points of price realization, supported by our increased marketing efforts and a disciplined approach to volume, price and mix management. Consistent with this strategic focus at driving of consumption of small packages could be seen across North America. We grew purchased transactions 3%, outpacing the 1% unit case volume growth as consumers increasingly reach for the mini cans, the smaller PET, the 8-ounce glass bottle as well as our premium aluminum bottles, all of which drive more value per occasion than our traditional packages. Hopefully, many of you also saw an example of this strategic focus on Sunday night during the Super Bowl when we aired our latest commercial focusing exclusively on the mini can package. 
Our performance in 2015 gives us confidence that our strategies are working and that our underlying performance will be within our long-term targets in 2016. However, let me be clear, the global economy remains challenged and is not improving rapidly. We do see slightly better GDP growth rates for 2016 as compared to 2015, but to be fair, forecasts continue to be revised downwards, and there's still much uncertainty.  Notable are Brazil and Russia continuing to deteriorate, while China's growth rate does also slow, putting pressure across many of the emerging and developing markets. 
Now while helpful to consumers, the lower price of oil is also causing volatility in the Middle East and other oil-driven export economies with further implications for those nations. So given the erratic nature of the global economy, we will continue to focus on what we can control in order to deliver our plan. We will continue to build on the fundamentals of our strategy for long-term success, while delivering solid revenue growth and strong underlying operating margin expansion through the effective continued management of our portfolio, price/mix and productivity efforts. 
With that, I'm going to hand off to Kathy, who will give you additional detail on North America and  productivity programs and walk through the 2016 article -- outlook."

In the interest of time this morning, I intend to cover just 3 topics: North America refranchising, our updated productivity targets and our outlook for 2016.  Let me start with our refranchising efforts in No",1450,"Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. In the interest of time this morning, I intend to cover just 3 topics: North America refranchising, our updated productivity targets and our outlook for 2016.  Let me start with our refranchising efforts in North America. 
As we accelerate our refranchising, we are returning to our core business of brand building, driving customer value and leading the system. At the same time, the refranchising causes a lot of complexity in our North America P&L. Therefore, in order for management to view the underlying performance of our core business in North America separately, we made the decision to adjust our operating segments such that starting in 2016, CCR will be reported within our Bottling Investments Group. Going forward, the vast majority of any structural impacts to our business will now be reported within a single operating segment. We believe this will also be helpful to our investors for the same reason of assessing the continued underlying performance our core business. We understand that the accelerated refranchising, coupled with the shift in reporting segment, will likely result in a lot of modeling questions. So we will provide the revised operating segment financial information reflecting this change before the end of the quarter.
With regards to modeling, we are providing detailed structural guidance for 2016, the majority of which is related to the North America refranchising efforts. The remainder of the territories will transfer by the end of 2017, but the P&L impact will depend on the timing of transfer. We will share more with you at the appropriate time on the expected impact in 2017. 
As we transition territories, we are committed to eliminating the temporary residual costs we have referenced in the past as quickly as possible, and we anticipate the majority of these will be removed in 2017. With that said, there could be a portion of residual costs remaining in 2018 as we wind down the final support of these operations, but this amount would be relatively small and would be eliminated by the end of 2018. 
Our productivity program is also evolving due to the accelerated refranchising. Approximately half of our $3 billion productivity program was expected to come from supply chain savings. And a significant portion of those savings were expected to come from North America due to the size and finished goods nature of the business.  Now that we are accelerating our refranchising, we will no longer be able to capture a portion of the identified supply chain savings prior to divestiture. However, we have built a disciplined process and capabilities that have allowed us to exceed our goal to date and identify incremental opportunities within cost of goods sold, operating expenses and marketing to replace the supply chain savings being refranchised, thus enabling us to maintain our $3 billion target.  As we've communicated to you in the past, we said we would continue to look at every layer of spending as we move through the productivity work, and we have done just that. 
Coupled with the success we've seen so far, we have the confidence to effectively raise our level of targeted savings across our remaining spend base. With the incremental savings identified in our core business and the fact that our addressable cost base will substantially reduce post 2017, it should be even more evident that our $3 billion program represents a sizable opportunity. We look forward to providing further details at CAGNY next week. 
Turning to outlook. Despite challenging macro environments in many key markets around the world, our focus on revenue and disciplined brand investment continues to improve our top line growth. Also, we are seeing productivity flow through our P&L. While much of this was obscured by currency and structural changes, we saw solid underlying margin expansion last year, even while we grew marketing expenses at a faster rate than gross profits. For those reasons, in 2016, we expect to be back on our long-term growth algorithm prior to any structural changes, which are primarily driven by our accelerated pace of refranchising. 
Organic revenue is expected to grow 4% to 5%, in line with our long-term target, as our marketing investments continue to pay off. Given the current macro environment and lapping better comps in 2015, we believe this is a solid target. We expect the commodity environment to be benign, but considering that we hedge our exposure to many commodities, we may not see the full benefit you would expect when looking at today's spot prices. 
Given the general weak macroeconomic environment and the associated pressure on top line growth, we are focused on capturing more than $600 million of productivity in order to deliver our profit targets. We will do this even as we continue to increase the investments in media behind our brand and step up R&D investment in 2016. 
Finally, we anticipate interest costs to increase in 2016 due to higher interest rates as well as our decision to shift some of our debt from commercial paper to longer-term maturities that carry slightly higher interest rates. After considering all of these factors, we expect comparable currency-neutral income before tax structurally adjusted to grow 6% to 8% in 2016, in line with our long-term targets, as strong operating profit growth is partially offset by net interest expense. 
As Muhtar mentioned earlier, there will be a significant structural impact to our business as we accelerate our refranchising efforts in North America; complete the mergers of Coca-Cola European Partners and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa; and cycle a half-year impact from the Monster Beverage transaction, which closed in mid-2015. We currently expect both Coca-Cola European Partners and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa to close during the second quarter. Taken together, we expect the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures to be a 4- to 5-point headwind to net revenue. 
Because of the nature of the structural changes, we also anticipate that the impact would be slightly higher on cost of goods sold and SG&A. We expect the benefit to equity income from Monster, Coca-Cola Beverages Africa and Coca-Cola European Partners to partially offset that impact at operating income, resulting in a 3- to 4-point negative structural impact to income before tax.  Our underlying effective tax rate is expected to remain at 22.5% for 2016.  
Finally, we expect approximately $2 billion to $2.5 billion in net share repurchases for 2016.  We therefore expect comparable currency-neutral EPS growth of 4% to 6%, inclusive of the 3- to 4-point structural headwind to income before tax. 
As you well know, many of the world's currencies have continued to depreciate versus the U.S. dollar. Since we operate in over 200 markets, we are not immune to this effect. In addition, we will be cycling the euro debt remeasurement gain we recorded in other income during the first 2 quarters of 2015.  Based on current spot rates, hedging activity and what we are cycling, we expect a 4-point headwind to net revenue and a 9-point headwind to income before tax.  However, the currency headwind to operating income will be lower as we cycle the gain I just mentioned. 
In terms of coverage, we are fully hedged on the euro, yen and sterling for 2016. We also have near-term coverage in place across several other major currencies. 
Finally, we expect to spend $2.5 billion to $3 billion on CapEx as we continue to maintain our facilities in advance of transitioning territories and production assets. By the end of 2017, our capital needs will decrease significantly as we refranchise healthy businesses in North America and China. 
As you model the first quarter, please remember that due to our reporting calendar cycle, there will be 1 less day in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015. Based on current spot rates, hedging activity and what we are cycling, we expect that currency will be a 5-point headwind on net revenues and a 12-point headwind on income before tax in the first quarter of 2016. 
We expect the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures to be a slight headwind on net revenue and structural items to be a 2-point headwind on income before tax. 
In summary, our financial performance for 2015 was slightly better than our expectations, and we executed our 5-point plan effectively. And we are already working diligently to deliver our commitments for 2016. We continue to focus on our core capabilities of building brands, driving customer value and leading the system so that when we complete our refranchising, we will be a lower-risk, higher-return business with even greater confidence to achieve our long-term growth targets.  We look forward to sharing more with you at CAGNY.

We've had the best year in 2015. You saw the results from the quarter. And these results show that our strategic focus on driving consumption of smaller package size is continuing to pay off, transactions are growing, price mix is healthy. And so we're bringing those 2 things together, both the goal of going back -- returning to our core model, which we've always emphasized. Even the first time we announced the purchase of CCE's U.S. operations, we said there'll be a role for partnerships going forward as long as -- as soon as we can put some things right. We have got the 3 legs of the stool in place: the customer governance, production governance and the IT platforms. And so we feel very confident. We've proven to ourselves that we can do it, and we feel very confident that this is the time. The new model is established. Bottler performance is improving. We have a new structure to last us the next number of decades. And we've put the bottlers -- we're putting our bottlers in the right hands. As Kathy said, the bottlers are very healthy, but -- and thanks to the great leadership and capability of our Bottling Investment Group. And so yes, we are now going to the core, and this is the time. And we feel very confident that we can do the 2 things together, accelerate momentum and bring the franchising to a book end that, really, we feel is going to be very beneficial both to our company, our share owners, as well as to leading to better customer service and better value creation on the bottler side.

And the capability that has been put into place in all our expanding bottlers, everywhere, is really giving us the confidence. And also just look at the momentum of the business. Our revenue growth was a priority. We've got it back -- we got it up to the 4 to 5 range, and the increased marketing is working clearly. And now, better marketing was even going to enhance that. And at the same time, we feel that every time the territory has transitioned, it's actually continued to do well, continued to gain share, continued to drive momentum, continued to drive incremental transactions. And from that, if -- any of the territories in the last 4, 5 quarters that have been transitioned, we've seen, without exception, that to be holding true. And so -- and if you look at all these bottlers that we've refranchised, look at the results -- look at the performance of our German bottler. It's really -- has the greatest momentum in the continent of Europe right now. So all of these bottlers are going into a system, to a structure, to an architecture, to a geography that will continue to do even better when you combine it and when you create the synergies with the combination. And so we feel confident. And then what took a little while to get right was the governance model around production in the United States, the governance model around the IT platform, the governance model around the customer service. All those are in place and working well. So I'll just hand over to James to add some flavor to that in more details, and then Kathy can comment also on your questions related to the financial aspect of the cash."

Our existing partners want more territories and new people who aren't in the system want to get into the system. So they're seeing that we've fixed the business and we've built momentum, and so there's a lot of heightened interest in being part of a growing Coke system, particularly in North America."

So for 2016, we gave you the impacts. And then for 2017, we are doing several things because we know you all have a lot of questions about 2017. So we are going to provide revised operating segment financial information later in the quarter. And then at CAGNY, we're going to give you a look at kind of what to anticipate the business will look like after everything is finished in 2018. Because the actual dilution kind of depends really on the timing of these transactions, so the best way we can give it -- give you some indication of that is really to kind of help you understand what our business will look like when everything is said and done in 2018 and beyond, which is what we're going to try to do at CAGNY. So I would ask you to just hold off on that and more to come on that. And then on the question about cash, we -- so the cash will basically go into basically our capital structure and be part of it. And at this point, no board-level decisions have been made, so we anticipate that these proceeds will be used to strengthen our balance sheet."

So I just wanted to get an update on your market share performance. Obviously, you're gaining share. But have you seen a relative change in terms of incremental market share performance? And what level of payback you're getting on the higher marketing? And as you look out to 2016, 4% to 5% organic sales growth is a fairly tight range.

So Dara, let me just give you a quick run around the world in terms of share. I mean firstly, on an overall global basis, perhaps consistent with our strong fourth quarter, we gained a little more share in the fourth quarter than we had in the whole year, so a better performance at the tail end. And in terms of how that played out across the world, you see, again, in line with the volume performance, strong results in North America. We gained share in sparkling. We gained share in stills, and we gained share overall in the quarter and in year. So good momentum in North America coming through in share. In Europe, we're gaining share in sparkling and in stills. Given our different starting points, that's netting out to kind of being flat overall. But we're -- we got a strong growth in Europe as we build our stills business. Latin America, this is a long-term track record of success, so small gains there, building on a long history of building a great position. Eurasia, despite some of the volatility in that part of the world, we gained share in both sparkling and stills and overall. Pretty strong momentum there in terms of share. And then in Asia Pacific, we've been focused more on restaging and reenergizing the sparkling business where we're gaining share. We lost a little bit in stills, and overall, flat. So I think wherever you look around the world, we're largely flat to gaining. And so inconsistent with our volume growth, which is broad-based and across the world, we're also largely winning across the world. So in terms of -- which one do you want me to do? Marketing payback? So I think what you're seeing is there is results from the marketing payback. I mean, our revenue in '15, our organic revenue growth in '15, was better than '14. We're guiding for a good number that's ahead of '15 in '16, so we see the marketing payout beginning to build the momentum globally. And I think if you double down on that one and look under that, North America was one of the first places we started with the incremental marketing, and that's self-evidently building momentum. So we see the underlying business results coming through in revenue, very much tied to where the extra media money is going. And then in terms of macro outlook and risk to top line, I think we feel that we got underlying structural momentum in the business. Now when I said the macro, we're planning on the macros slightly better in '16, and I really do mean slightly, and I wouldn't be surprised if that was the same growth rate in '15. But we think we have the right portfolio and the right optionality to be able to deliver our financial numbers in that environment."

Thanks, Muhtar. I think, firstly, it's important to remember, starting with Europe, that our price positioning in Europe, we have, over time, substantially taken a lot of rate and mix in Europe such that we are more premium-priced compared to our competitors than we are in North America. So less runway in that sense. Now having said that, we continue to focus on smaller packages, more premium offerings in terms of the brand portfolio, such that despite what is a pretty deflationary retail environment in a number of Western European markets, we're getting price/mix in Europe, both in the quarter and for the full year. So I think going out, one should not expect the same sort of levels the U.S. has been able to develop, especially given the macro environment in Europe at the moment. In terms of Japan, we are very focused on rebuilding our ability to get positive price/mix in Japan. We've recently been able to get some. Again, very focused on leveraging both packaging options and the brand portfolio to reshape it to allow us to drive a positive mix. Again, I don't think you will see in Japan the same sorts of levels as the U.S. as much as anything to do with the deflationary pressures in Japan.

Let me start with the price/mix in Asia Pacific. I think the most important thing to note here is because the different geographies in the Asia Pacific group have some quite different pricing and concentrate shipments can be lumpy, you do get some erratic price/mix numbers on a quarterly basis, and that's exactly what you're seeing in the fourth quarter in Asia Pacific. So there were more shipments to somewhere like India than Japan. You can actually see the flip side of this in the Eurasia group where we got very strong price/mix in the fourth quarter, which was the flip side. We had more shipments to places like South Africa than the Middle East. So this is all about country mix. I think it's important for particularly those 2 groups, Asia Pacific and Eurasia, to look at some longer-term, 4-quarter trend line on price/mix, given the very impactful country mix issue and the lumpiness of concentrate shipments. That's the key thing there. And then in terms of China, clearly, not as much as we would have liked to grow in China in the first quarter. I think that the environment in China is clearly -- pretty clearly having a slowdown. But we think we had a strong momentum over the last couple of years coming back into China. We're looking to do better in 2016, but we don't actually provide a country-based forecast.

So yes, India, there are opportunities in other parts of the world remaining, but it's a very small template based on where we are. And we'll look at opportunities. As James said earlier, one of the litmus tests -- I've always said one of the great sort of litmus tests for the health of The Coca-Cola business is the desire of investors and our franchise partners to have more territories. That's at an all-time high. It remains that -- and we expect that to remain high, and therefore, there may be other opportunities in the remaining geographies, but I can't comment on that any further right now. And then I'll pass it over to James to take you through the longer-term question and portfolio, stills versus sparkling. And then Kathy, the question on 4% to 5% organic growth, volume versus price. So James?"

Look, I think our aspiration is to have both of them growing, both sparkling and stills, and that's what we achieved in the fourth quarter and in the full year of 2015. Now I think in the total portfolio sense, much of that -- in the same way it has happened over the last decade or so, we've gone from about 10% of the portfolio being stills to roughly 25% of the portfolio being stills. I think, mathematically, the stills will grow as a percent of the total portfolio. And I would note, as Muhtar commented earlier, I think we need to break out the stills and not just look at them as one thing, but look at them in terms of their individual categories. And we gained share in packaged water [ph] and juice drinks, we gained share in energy, and we gained share in ready-to-drink tea. So we think we can do well in each of the categories that represent nonalcoholic ready-to-drink. And in particular, we can still grow sparkling, and that growth of sparkling into the future is not just in aggregate. But I think, over the long term, we'll see increased growth of low-, no- and reduced-calorie variants. I know that's not the case yet in the North America. But globally, in our international business, those drinks outgrow the regular drinks within sparkling and in fueling our growth. So broad-based growth."

So we do anticipate that, that strategy will continue, and that will be a balance between both the volume -- and we will achieve a balance between both volume and price. As advertising and promotions, in 2014, we announced this program. We said $800 million to $1 billion that we would invest. We are still going to invest, continuing to invest behind our brand. So -- on that program, although we're also going to start investing in R&D. So basically, we're still on our program that we announced back in 2014. So we will continue -- you will continue to see investments in marketing, kind of in light of slightly above gross profits."

I'm not quite there on hot-fills, so if you can elaborate on that, that would be helpful. Trying to get a better sense, secondarily, about when you think you will actually able to grow out of the dilution. So there's clearly dilution right now, and then 2016 through to 4 and then probably 2017. But at what point will you be able to grow out of that dilution given kind of better margin top line growth, et cetera? And then kind of the core question is that you mentioned your goal was, by buying North America bottling, that you'd have to -- you'd be able to accelerate momentum for sales and profitability. And I agree you've kind of done that, going to smaller pack sizes, increasing prices, closing some plants, increasing media spend, improving IT. But I guess I'm still confused why you had to buy the bottlers or one consolidated bottler, I guess, in North America, to do a lot of those changes. I mean, why do have to spend billions of dollars to push these changes through? Was there not a more efficient-for-shareholders way to do it? And I guess, in that context, how do you give investors confidence -- because I get this question a lot. How do you get investors -- give investors confidence that 5, 10 years down the line, you won't have to buy these bottlers back again in North America?"

First, when we announced the acquisition of CCE, it was essentially kind of a 25-year-old problem and that we said it would take a while to basically course-correct them. The level of investment was not where it was needed. And also, the level of customer service was not where it was needed. And essentially, we believe that having more than just one bottler, essentially, having that big a territory was a better way, scalable size, bottlers, the right ownership values, right structure and right capability, and that's what we have today in North America. And so we feel very good that this is a model that is going to stay where it is and continue to add value. It's not going to require any further -- of course, all the time, there'll be a tweaking necessary, but not the scale that was needed when we did the transaction back at the end of 2010. And so that was a core decision that was needed. There was a major surgery that was needed, and that's really what took place. As far as the juice business is concerned, as I said before, it's an integrated business. It basically performs well as an integrated business, similar to other juice businesses that we have around the world. That's -- it's a very different model. It's a very different production. It's a very different growth-to-table model and requires a different way of -- in terms of its distribution, especially when it's chilled. And that's really where a lot of the growth is, and value-added dairy. And that's what you see whether it's in fairlife, or that's what you see whether it's in juice. And it's a very distinct production model, very different as well as -- the hot-fill is also the same. So same with Innocent in Europe, the same with many parts of the world. And so Jugos de Valle is also very similar in terms of the way it's produced, and that is just a needed aspect for success and for performance in the hot-fill and juice business. Very different.

In February, we reported a successful transition year in 2015, where we made tangible progress on our plan and delivered the full year expectations we laid out. I'm pleased to report that in the quarter -- first quarter of 2016, we took another positive step in the macro environment that continues to be challenging. Today, I will touch briefly on a few key highlights in the quarter before handing off to James to provide a more detailed review of our operational performance.
We're in the midst of transforming The Coca-Cola Company to one that is even more focused on our core value creation model of building and supporting strong brands, enhancing customer value and leading our franchise system. During the first quarter, our continued focus on our 5 strategic initiatives enabled us to gain value share and deliver positive topline growth with underlying margin expansion. With the first quarter behind us, we see the challenging global environment continuing, but we remained committed to our full year targets we laid out in February for both the top and bottom line performance.
From a highlights perspective, we continued to execute our strategic initiatives. In the first quarter, we unveiled our new global one brand marketing strategy for Trademark Coca-Cola under the Taste the Feeling campaign, which is elevating system engagement with our employees, bottling partners and customers. The initial consumer response is encouraging and positive.
Additionally, we added to our portfolio of fast-growing still beverages. We closed our Chinese plant-based protein acquisition of [indiscernible] in March. We also invested in Chi, the leading juice and value-added dairy company in Nigeria, Africa's largest economy. Both transactions are further proof points of how we are strengthening our leading stills position, effectively responding to evolving consumer preferences. 
Finally, we're accelerating our global refranchising efforts. In North America, we continued to make progress against our stated goal of refranchising 100% of our bottling operations by the end of 2017. Including the territories announced this morning, we have transferred or signed agreements on almost 2/3 of the U.S. territories we originally acquired from CCE. 
Looking outside of North America to Western Europe, our Coca-Cola European partners transaction remains on track to close by the end of the second quarter.
In Africa, the regulatory approval process continues. The South Africa Competition Commission has recommended for the Competition Tribunal to approve The Coca-Cola Beverages Africa merger with certain conditions. The tribunal is set to meet in May review the pending transaction.
In summary, we recognize that we still have much work to do, but we have defined a clear path to transform the company, and we are making consistent progress to create long-term value for our share owners.
The Coca-Cola Company is becoming stronger, more efficient and more focused on our core strengths of marketing and brand building, customer value creation and leading our franchise bottling system. We're making progress implementing our disciplined global revenue growth management strategy. We're also building a new -- building new growth opportunities with still and sparkling brands that we develop internally, we acquire from the outside and we invest in through partnerships.
And our franchise bottling system is also getting stronger, faster, more nimble and more closely aligned. In short, my colleagues and I are getting up every single day with a fresh passion for doing the things that will create long-term, sustainable value. 
I'll now hand the call over to James, who's going to provided with a more detailed look at our operating performance in the first quarter."

From an industry perspective, we gained global value share in NARTD beverages in the quarter, with increases in both sparkling and still beverages worldwide.We gained value share in all the one of the subca",1297,"Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. From an industry perspective, we gained global value share in NARTD beverages in the quarter, with increases in both sparkling and still beverages worldwide.
We gained value share in all the one of the subcategories in stills, where there we maintained value share. 
We delivered 2% unit case volume growth, a solid performance in many of our developed markets, was partially offset by challenging -- challenges in emerging markets suffering from the worst of the macro slowdown. This had a disproportionate effect on sparkling volume growth, as the nonalcoholic beverage industry in many of these markets is more weighted towards sparkling beverages.
Consolidated price/mix grew 1%, cycling 3%, as solid underlying pricing was partially offset by 1 point of segment mix. We accelerated our price/mix across every operating segments, except Asia Pacific, versus the first quarter last year. Even the geographic footprint of our own bottling investment group, our consolidated price/mix was lower.
Given the scale of our pending refranchising, as you consider the sustainability of our disciplined pricing strategy, I think it's helpful to exclude BIG and focus instead on our core business, which delivered 2 points of global price realization. 
Results were also impacted by 1 less day in our fiscal quarter compared to the same period last year, which reduced organic revenue growth by roughly 1 point. As a result, we delivered 2% organic revenue growth, including 1 point headwind from 1 less day.
In the quarter, structurally adjusted comparable currency-neutral income before tax grew a solid 9%, with the underlying margin expansion reflecting our focus on productivity as well as the timing of operating expenses. Notably, this expansion occurred in alongside the continued growth in our marketing investments. 
Now to describe more clearly our operating performance, let me briefly describe our results in 3 groupings of our markets. First, in markets where our strategies are in place and being executed very well, we are seeing strong results. This cluster is led by North America, Latin America, also includes Japan and India. Here, strong marketing, disciplined revenue management and improving execution are driving results. For example, specifically North America, we delivered 2% organic revenue growth with 1 less day, 3 points of price realization, led by 3% sparkling price/mix and good operating leverage in the quarter. North America also grew value share again this quarter and continued to successfully implement its accelerated refranchising program. 
Latin America delivered double-digit organic revenue growth due to a strong focus on consumer and customer segmentation despite worsening conditions in Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina. In Mexico, brand investments, including new products such as [indiscernible], a sparkling fruit drank, as well as [indiscernible] Mineral Water and [indiscernible] Flavored Water, helped increase unit volume by 5%, with growth across all major categories.
Our Japan business unit had a very strong start to the year supported by several recent innovations such as I love Peach, an extension of our premium water brand, and a premium price Georgia coffee bottle can. We also leveraged innovation from China launching Lemon Plus C, which is seeing strong, early results. These products enabled our value share to outperform volume share, as they skew higher -- to higher revenue, singleserve packaging.
And finally, India. Here, we delivered strong performance in the quarter due to the rapid scaling of a new price pack architecture across sparkling and juice segments, coupled with brand marketing and execution efforts. In addition, we expanded our still beverage portfolio in India with the launch of [indiscernible]its, our latest value-added dairy beverage.
These positive results give us confidence our strategies are working. While we are making progress in these markets, we also recognize there's more to be done, and the opportunity for improvement in these good performing markets continues to be significant.
The second group is comprised of markets, where we are taking action to positively transform our business to the future. Here, I would include Europe, where we continue to make progress to the establishment of our newly integrated Western European bottler. And here, several key markets performed very well, led by Spain, up 3%; Germany, up 1%; and in the Central and Southern European business unit, we grew volumes 2%. We look forward to improving performance in Europe as the year progresses.
A second transition market is our African business, where we are taking steps to strengthen our bottling business through the creation of new Coca-Cola Beverages Africa Bottler. As Muhtar mentioned, we're also taking steps to diversify brand portfolio through our investment in Chi, and we continue to improve our execution in key markets on the continent, as exemplified by improving performance in South Africa and Nigeria, where we grew unit case volume 7% and 13%, respectively.
And the final bunch of markets where we face clear macro headwinds in 2016, Russia and Brazil continue to be challenging. China's transition to a consumer-led economy is putting pressure on commodity-dependent emerging and developing markets. The lower oil price continues to wail the Middle East and other oil-driven economies. And while Argentina is taking the right steps to secure the recovery, short-term results are challenging. 
So let me refer to a few of these markets.
In China, we are adjusting our plan reflect these realities. China's macro environment was challenging in 2015, and that continued to be so in the first quarter. While the economic slowdown is not new, the degree to which the NARTD industry was impacted this past quarter was worse than expected. Key success factors going forward require focusing on both affordability and premiumization through segmented growth strategies.
The more premium segments continue to grow in China, as consumers who purchase these products are relatively insulated from broader economic issues. We are working to increase our premium offerings like sleek cans and Schweppes Plessy in high-value channels. At the same time, however, we continue to evolve our price pack architecture to deliver affordable options in both singleserve and multi-serve packages to ensure we can capture key occasions and recruit new consumers.
While the top line has been challenging, our initiatives have enabled us to gain both value and volume share in China in the quarter. 
Turning to Brazil. Here, we are segmenting our prize pack architecture to provide packages at key affordable price points while delivering and driving pricing to cover inflation. This strategy enables us to gain volume share during the quarter. 
And finally, in Brazil -- in Russia. We gained value share, driven by good marketing and promotional activities with a focus on premium, sparkling beverages and juice. 
Given the volatility in these markets, we are proactively managing our investments, keeping an eye towards the long term but ensuring our near-term investments have the right payback.
The challenging macro environment is also a key reason why productivity is critical. We remain on track to deliver more than $600 million in productivity savings this year, enabling us to fund our brand and growth investments while covering cost inflation and driving margin expansion.
 
We are delivering these savings through a disciplined process that involves our entire leadership team and associates. Also building a culture that is focused on getting better every day whilst also improving the employee experience.
This quarter, the results are ongoing efforts were evident in supporting the underlying strong operating margin expansion. 
Before I hand over to Kathy, let me conclude by saying we are resolutely focused on evolving our growth strategies and transforming our business to deliver sustainable shareholder value. With the challenges around the world, we will focus on what we can control in order to deliver solid revenue growth and strong underlying operating margin expansion through the effective management of our portfolio, price mix and productivity efforts.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Kathy."

I'd like to touch upon a few areas of our financing performance in the quarter before providing our full year outlook.Starting at the top line. As James mentioned, our 2% organic revenue growth was impacted",1081,"Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to touch upon a few areas of our financing performance in the quarter before providing our full year outlook.
Starting at the top line. As James mentioned, our 2% organic revenue growth was impacted by 1 less day in the quarter as well as by our segment mix, as our Bottling Investments Group grew at a slightly slower rate than our core business.
Let me take a moment to explain what we mean by segment mix and what the impact will be more pronounced in 2016 and 2017 until we are finished have ability announced refranchising actions.
Starting in the first quarter, we revised our opening segment so that our company-owned bottling operations in North America are now reported within our Bottling Investments Group. This greatly increases the relative size of the bottling segment for the rest of our geographic segments.
Since our bottling operates earned significantly higher revenue per case than concentrate operations, slower growth among our company-owned bottling operations results in negative pressure on our consolidated price/mix regardless of the underlying pricing in either the bottling operations or our core business.
However, due to the relatively lower profitability of our bottling business, slower growth among our bottling operations has an opposite effect on our consolidated margins. 
At gross profit, our comparable margin declined, as we were impacted by currency headwinds, the effects of North America refranchising and the sale of our legacy brands to Moscow. Excluding the year-over-year effect of these items, we would have seen growth margin expansion, driven by benign cost environment, benefits from productivity and segment mix.
As you think about the downhill, keep in mind that the cost environment becomes more difficult to cycle in the second quarter and beyond due to the timing of when commodity prices eased last year.
Our comparable operating margin improved about 25 basis points on a consolidated basis. Similar to gross profit -- gross margin, currency headwinds, North America refranchising and the sale of our legacy energy brands to Monster, impacted our operating margin. Comparable currency-neutral operating margins increased 140 basis points in the quarter.
Excluding these effects, we achieved strong operating leverage in the quarter, driven by the benefits of our productivity initiatives, the timing of certain expenses and segment mix.
Looking at our productivity initiatives. The first quarter benefited from the timing of when certain productivity initiatives were implemented last year. For example, the majority of the headcount reductions began in April, with Europe's implementation closer to the mid-year. So the associated expense savings began in the second quarter. 
As you think about the remainder of this year, while we expect solid currency-neutral ex structural operating leverage, we expect some of these drivers to moderate, as we began to cycle more difficult comparisons. This was reflected in our previously provided full year guidance. 
Let me stop here and touch briefly on an ongoing structural impact to provide additional clarity based on some of the questions I have received from you.
At CAGNY, we noted that by the time we complete our refranchising, we will see significant increases in both growth and operating margin. While that is the case, I want to remind you that until we begin to increase the transfer of our production operations in North America, the existing refranchising of the distribution business actually has a dilutive effect to both growth and operating margins. 
Given that we do not expect the sale of production assets to significantly increase until 2017, our margins will continue to be affected by this dynamic this year.
Moving to cash flow. We generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations before making a nearly $0.5 billion contribution to our pension plans. 
Looking ahead through the remainder of the year, we expect our cash flow growth rate to be more in line with our earnings growth rate.
For 2016, we increased our annual dividend by 6% to $1.40 per share, our 54th consecutive annual dividend increase. Our net share repurchases during the quarter totaled approximately $150 million. For the full year, we expect to achieve the $2 billion to $2.5 billion range that we communicated during our last earnings call.
Turning to outlook. The first quarter reflected more challenging operating environment in markets like China and Brazil. We see that our strategies are working, however, in key markets like North America, Japan and India.
Further, our strategies allow us the scenario plan to adjust to market dynamics. Therefore, we are maintaining our currency-neutral outlook we previously provided. 
However, we are updating the expected impact from currency. We expect organic revenue growth of 4% to 5% and comparable currency-neutral EPS growth of 4% to 6%, inclusive of a 3- to 4-point structural headwind to income before tax.
Moving to currency. While current spot rates have improved since our fourth quarter call, these rates have been extremely volatile as well. Therefore, I will caveat our currency outlook knowing that it is definitely subject to change. We will update you accordingly as we move through the year. 
Based on current spot rates, hedging activity and what we are cycling, we now expect the full year impact of currency to be a 2- to 3-point headwind on net revenue versus our previous expectation of 4 points.
Relative to income before tax, we now expect an 8- to 9-point headwind as compared to our previous expectation of a 9-point headwind.
As we model the second quarter, there are a couple of items to consider. We expect the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items to be a 2- to 3-point headwind on net revenues and a 3-point headwind on income before tax. Based on current spot rates, hedging activity and what we are cycling, we expect that currency will be a 2- to 3-point headwind on net revenue and a 6-point headwind on operating income. In addition, we will be cycling the euro debt remeasurement gain we recorded in other income during the second quarter of 2015.
For this reason, we expect an 11-point currency headwind on income before tax as we cycle this gain.
In closing, we are working diligently to deliver our commitment for 2016. We continue to focus on our core capabilities of building brands, driving customer value and leading the system so that when we complete our refranchising, we will be a lower-risk, higher-return business, with even greater confidence to achieve our long-term growth target.
Operator, we are now ready for questions."

So there's a kind of an ongoing mechanical effect that creates a negative price/mix for this group, which you can see over the years in Asia Pacific. So in '13 full year, it was minus 4. In '14, it was minus 2. In '15, it was minus 2. In the first quarter of '16, obviously, it was minus 5. And it was cycling a very atypical plus 3 in the first quarter of last year.

So you can go to around the world. There were places which were struggling in '14 and maybe even in '15. As we've been executing, the strategy, the momentum is come back to those countries and it's starting to build over time. So I think, as Muhtar said, the first quarter was kind of within the envelope of expectation for our guidance. And we can see, based on what we're doing within our control, within a reasonable target of macros, we will stay within that corridor for the rest of the year. But in the end, I guess only results will answer the question."

We have a long-standing game plan of what to do in countries that are in crisis, focusing on really gaining a lot of share to set ourselves up profitably for the long term.

In other words, we executed in stores all the variants of Coca-Cola together as one big block, has a much greater store impact, visual impact, engagement with people who are shopping the stores. I think slightly more strategically, and back to Muhtar's point, this is an implementation of a strategic idea. I'm sure we'll evolve it. I'm sure we'll make it better. But it's the strategic idea that's important. It's not just about the efficiency in advertising. It's about helping consumers join and stay in the Coca-Cola franchise whatever the ingredients they want to manage, including their management of added sugars, whether that's in drinks or any other categories that have added sugar in. There's a number of benefits that are going to play out strategically, and we'll keep improving the execution."

Clearly, North America has had a lot of traction in pushing forward smaller packages away from the traditional 2-liter and multipack of cans. It is worth noting that some of those packages our premium packages, and some of those are intended to create affordability or low price point entry points for the category, whether it be the mini cans. And that combination does generally help price/mix. You can see that size roll out across other parts of the world. I think Latin America has traditionally been very good at that. You do see more of it coming into Asia Pacific and Eurasia on a global basis. The immediate consumption packages outpaced general volume growth. So it is part of that strategy to push more into smaller packages. Just this last month, India launched a new technology, a very small package with a special technology that allows a much longer shelf life in ambient environments of rural India. So it'll be out to go to many more places. So a lot of innovation in the technology, a lot of innovation in the package and the sizes and the occasions and the channels so that we can bring down the price points, the affordability, take advantage of premiumization and also offer people the right amount of any beverage that they want to actually consume."

So in a way, the United States, in the last 4 or 5 years, particularly the last 2.5 years, has moved very rapidly to the 12-ounce glass today to the 8-ounce glass to the 7.5-ounce can to the 8.5 ounce aluminum bottle. And that has really worked, and those are all growing double digits in the United States because of 2 -- the consumer and customer preferences and also benefiting our system because they have a higher price per liter. And so that's, in a way, playing out from what was already prevailing in many parts of the world in the past."

So I think a lot of the programs are going in later this year. Obviously, the execution is there. So we would expect to see better performance in Trademark Coca-Cola going into the downhill. I would make one other note, which is the relative change in where global growth is coming from or industry growth is coming from, a little more in developed and developing a little less in emerging, tends to create a kind of a portfolio effect that weighs a little more against sparkling and therefore, Coca-Cola, because Those emerging markets tends to be more sparkling orientated.

In February, we reported a successful transition year in 2015, where we made tangible progress on our plans and delivered the full year expectations we laid out. I'm pleased to report that in the quarter -- first quarter of 2016, we took another positive step in the macro environment that continues to be challenging. Today, I will touch briefly on a few key highlights in the quarter before handing off to James to provide a more detailed review of our operational performance.
We're in the midst of transforming The Coca-Cola Company to one that it's even more focused on our core value creation model of building and supporting strong brands, enhancing customer value and leading our franchise system. 
During the first quarter, our continued focus on our 5 strategic initiatives enabled us to gain value share and deliver positive top line growth with underlying margin expansion. With the first quarter behind us, we see the challenging global environment continuing, but we remained committed to our full year targets, we laid out in February, for both the top and bottom line performance.
From a highlights perspective, we continued to execute our strategic initiatives. In the first quarter, we unveiled our new global one brand marketing strategy for trademark Coca-Cola under the Taste the Feeling campaign, which is elevating system engagement with our employees, bottling partners and customers. The initial consumer response is encouraging and positive.
Additionally, we added to our portfolio of fast-growing still beverages. We closed our Chinese plant-based protein acquisition of Culiangwang in March. We also invested in Chi, the leading juice and value-added dairy company in Nigeria, Africa's largest economy. Both transactions are further proof points of how we are strengthening our leading stills position, effectively responding to evolving consumer preferences.
Finally, we're accelerating our global refranchising efforts. In North America, we continued to make progress against our stated goal of refranchising 100% of our bottling operations by the end of 2017. Including the territories announced this morning, we have transferred or signed agreements on almost 2/3 of the U.S. territories we originally acquired from CCE.
Looking outside of North America to Western Europe, our Coca-Cola European partners' transaction remains on track to close by the end of the second quarter.
In Africa, the regulatory approval process continues. The South Africa Competition Commission has recommended for the Competition Tribunal to approve The Coca-Cola Beverages Africa merger with certain conditions. The tribunal is set to meet in May to review the pending transaction.
In summary, we recognize that we still have much work to do, but we have defined a clear path to transform the company, and we are making consistent progress to create long-term value for our share owners.
The Coca-Cola Company is becoming stronger, more efficient and more focused on our core strengths of marketing and brand building, customer value creation and leading our franchise bottling system. We're making progress implementing our disciplined global revenue growth management strategy. We're also building a new -- building new growth opportunities with still and sparkling brands that we develop internally, we acquire from the outside and we invest in through partnerships.
And our franchise bottling system is also getting stronger, faster, more nimble and more closely aligned. In short, my colleagues and I are getting up every single day with a fresh passion for doing the things that will create long-term, sustainable value.
I'll now hand the call over to James, who's going to provide you with a more detailed look at our operating performance in the first quarter."

From an industry perspective, we gained global value share in NARTD beverages in the quarter, with increases in both sparkling and still beverages worldwide.
We gained value share in all but one of the subcategories in stills, where there we maintained value share.
We delivered 2% unit case volume growth, a solid performance in many of our developed markets, was partially offset by challenging -- challenges in emerging markets suffering from the worst of the macro slowdown. This had a disproportionate effect on sparkling volume growth, as the nonalcoholic beverage industry in many of these markets is more weighted towards sparkling beverages.
Consolidated price/mix grew 1%, cycling 3%, as solid underlying pricing was partially offset by 1 point of segment mix. We accelerated our price/mix across every operating segment, except Asia Pacific, versus the first quarter last year. Even the geographic footprint of our own bottling investment group, our consolidated price/mix was lower.
Given the scale of our pending refranchising, as you consider the sustainability of our disciplined pricing strategy, I think it's helpful to exclude BIG and focus instead on our core business, which delivered 2 points of global price realization.
Results were also impacted by 1 less day in our fiscal quarter compared to the same period last year, which reduced organic revenue growth by roughly 1 point. As a result, we delivered 2% organic revenue growth, including 1 point headwind from 1 less day.
In the quarter, structurally adjusted, comparable currency-neutral income before tax grew a solid 9%, with the underlying margin expansion reflecting our focus on productivity as well as the timing of operating expenses. Notably, this expansion occurred alongside the continued growth in our marketing investments.
Now to describe more clearly our operating performance, let me briefly describe our results in 3 groupings of our markets. First, in markets where our strategies are in place and being executed fairly well, we are seeing strong results. This cluster is led by North America, Latin America, also includes Japan and India. Here, strong marketing, disciplined revenue management and improving execution are driving results. For example, specifically in North America, we delivered 2% organic revenue growth with 1 less day, 3 points of price realization, led by 3% sparkling price/mix and good operating leverage in the quarter. North America also grew value share again this quarter and continued to successfully implement its accelerated refranchising program.
Latin America delivered double-digit organic revenue growth due to a strong focus on consumer and customer segmentation despite worsening conditions in Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina.
In Mexico, brand investments, including new products such as Del Valle Néctar, a sparkling fruit drink, as well as Ciel mineral water and Ciel flavored water, helped to increase unit volume by 5%, with growth across all major categories.
Our Japan business unit had a very strong start to the year supported by several recent innovations, such as I LOHAS Peach, an extension of our premium water brand, and a premium priced Georgia coffee bottle can. We also leveraged innovation from China launching lemon +C, which is seeing strong, early results. These products enabled our value share to outperform volume share, as they skew higher -- to higher revenue, single-serve packaging.
And finally, India. Here, we delivered strong performance in the quarter due to the rapid scaling of a new price pack architecture across sparkling and juice segments, coupled with brand marketing and execution efforts. In addition, we expanded our still beverage portfolio in India with the launch of VIO, our latest value-added dairy beverage.
These positive results give us confidence, our strategies are working. While we are making progress in these markets, we also recognize there's more to be done, and the opportunity for improvement in these good performing markets continues to be significant.
The second group is comprised of markets, where we are taking action to positively transform our business for the future. Here, I would include Europe, where we continue to make progress to the establishment of our newly integrated Western European bottler. And here, several key markets performed very well, led by Spain, up 3%; Germany, up 1%; and in the Central and Southern European business unit, we grew volumes 2%. We look forward to improving performance in Europe as the year progresses.
A second transition market is our African business, where we are taking steps to strengthen our bottling business through the creation of new Coca-Cola Beverages Africa Bottler. As Muhtar mentioned, we're also taking steps to diversify brand portfolio through our investment in Chi, and we continue to improve our execution in key markets on the continent, as exemplified by improving performance in South Africa and Nigeria, where we grew unit case volume 7% and 13%, respectively.
And the final bunch of markets where we face clear macro headwinds in 2016, Russia and Brazil continue to be challenging. China's transition to a consumer-led economy is putting pressure on commodity-dependent emerging and developing markets. The lower oil price continues to wail on the Middle East and other oil-driven economies. And while Argentina is taking the right steps to secure the economic recovery, short-term results are challenging.
So let me refer to a few of these markets.
In China, we are adjusting our plan to reflect these realities. China's macro environment was challenging in 2015, and that continued to be so in the first quarter. While the economic slowdown is not new, the degree to which the NARTD industry was impacted this past quarter was worse than expected. Key success factors going forward require focusing on both affordability and premiumization through segmented growth strategies.
The more premium segments continue to grow in China, as consumers who purchase these products are relatively insulated from broader economic issues. We are working to increase our premium offerings like sleek cans and Schweppes +C in high-value channels. At the same time, however, we continue to evolve our price/pack architecture to deliver affordable options in both single-serve and multi-serve packages to ensure we can capture key occasions and recruit new consumers.
While the top line has been challenging, our initiatives have enabled us to gain both value and volume share in China in the quarter.
Turning to Brazil. Here, we are segmenting our price/pack architecture to provide packages at key affordable price points while delivering and driving pricing to cover inflation. This strategy enables us to gain volume share during the quarter.
And finally, in Brazil -- in Russia. We gained value share, driven by good marketing and promotional activities with a focus on premium, sparkling beverages and juice.
Given the volatility in these markets, we are proactively managing our investments, keeping an eye towards the long term but ensuring our near-term investments have the right payback.
The challenging macro environment is also a key reason why productivity is critical. We remain on track to deliver more than $600 million in productivity savings this year, enabling us to fund our brand and growth investments while covering cost inflation and driving margin expansion.
We are delivering these savings through a disciplined process that involves our entire leadership team and associates. Ultimately, it's about building a culture that is focused on getting better every day whilst also improving the employee experience.
This quarter, the results from our ongoing efforts were evident in supporting the underlying strong operating margin expansion.
Before I hand over to Kathy, let me conclude by saying we are resolutely focused on evolving our growth strategies and transforming our business to deliver sustainable shareholder value. With the challenges around the world, we will focus on what we can control in order to deliver solid revenue growth and strong underlying operating margin expansion through the effective management of our portfolio, price mix and productivity efforts.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Kathy."
26642,328880679,959956,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 20, 2016",2016-04-20,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to touch upon a few areas of our financing performance in the quarter before providing our full year outlook.Starting at the top line. As James mentioned, our 2% organic revenue growth was impacted",1086,"Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to touch upon a few areas of our financing performance in the quarter before providing our full year outlook.
Starting at the top line. As James mentioned, our 2% organic revenue growth was impacted by 1 less day in the quarter as well as by our segment mix, as our Bottling Investments Group grew at a slightly slower rate than our core business.
Let me take a moment to explain what we mean by segment mix, and why the impact will be more pronounced in 2016 and 2017, until we have finished our previously announced refranchising actions.
Starting in the first quarter, we revised our operating segment so that our company-owned bottling operations in North America are now reported within our Bottling Investments Group. This greatly increases the relative size of the bottling segment for the rest of our geographic segments.
Since our bottling operates earned significantly higher revenue per case than concentrate operations, slower growth among our company-owned bottling operations results in negative pressure on our consolidated price/mix, regardless of the underlying pricing in either the bottling operations or our core business.
However, due to the relatively low -- lower profitability of our bottling business, slower growth among our bottling operations has an opposite effect on our consolidated margins.
At gross profit, our comparable margin declined, as we were impacted by currency headwinds, the effects of North America refranchising and the sale of our legacy energy brands to Monster. Excluding the year-over-year effect of these items, we would have seen growth margin expansions, driven by benign cost environment, benefits from productivity and segment mix.
As you think about the downhill, keep in mind that the cost environment becomes more difficult to cycle in the second quarter and beyond due to the timing of when commodity prices eased last year.
Our comparable operating margin improved about 25 basis points on a consolidated basis. Similar to gross profits -- to gross margins, currency headwinds, the North America refranchising and the sale of our legacy energy brands to Monster, impacted our operating margins. Comparable currency-neutral operating margins increased 140 basis points in the quarter.
Excluding these effects, we achieved strong operating leverage in the quarter, driven by the benefits of our productivity initiatives, the timing of certain expenses and segment mix.
Looking at our productivity initiatives. The first quarter benefited from the timing of when certain productivity initiatives were implemented last year. For example, the majority of the headcount reductions began in April, with Europe's implementation closer to the mid-year. So the associated expense savings began in the second quarter.
As you think about the remainder of this year, while we expect solid currency-neutral ex structural operating leverage, we expect some of these drivers to moderate, as we began to cycle more difficult comparisons. This was reflected in our previously provided full year guidance.
Let me stop here and touch briefly on an ongoing structural impact to provide additional clarity based on some of the questions I have received from you.
At CAGNY, we noted that by the time we complete our refranchising, we will see significant increases in both growth and operating margins. While that is the case, I want to remind you that until we begin to increase the transfer of our production operations in North America, the existing refranchising of the distribution business actually has a dilutive effect to both growth and operating margins.
Given that we do not expect the sale of production assets to significantly increase until 2017, our margins will continue to be affected by this dynamic this year.
Moving to cash flow. We generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations before making a nearly $0.5 billion contribution to our pension plans.
Looking ahead through the remainder of the year, we expect our cash flow growth rate to be more in line with our earnings growth rate.
For 2016, we increased our annual dividend by 6% to $1.40 per share, our 54th consecutive annual dividend increase. Our net share repurchases during the quarter totaled approximately $150 million. For the full year, we expect to achieve the $2 billion to $2.5 billion range that we communicated during our last earnings call.
Turning to outlook. The first quarter reflected more challenging operating environments in markets like China and Brazil. We see that our strategies are working, however, in key markets like North America, Japan and India.
Further, our strategies allow us the scenario plan to adjust to market dynamics. Therefore, we are maintaining our currency-neutral outlook, we previously provided.
However, we are updating the expected impact from currency. We expect organic revenue growth of 4% to 5% and comparable currency-neutral EPS growth of 4% to 6%, inclusive of a 3- to 4-point structural headwind to income before tax.
Moving to currency. While current spot rates have improved since our fourth quarter call, these rates have been extremely volatile as well. Therefore, I will caveat our currency outlook knowing that it is definitely subject to change. We will update you accordingly as we move through the year. 
Based on current spot rates, hedging activity and what we are cycling, we now expect the full year impact of currency to be a 2- to 3-point headwind on net revenue versus our previous expectation of 4 points.
Relative to income before tax, we now expect an 8- to 9-point headwind as compared to our previous expectation of a 9-point headwind.
As we model the second quarter, there are a couple of items to consider. We expect the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items to be a 2- to 3-point headwind on net revenues and a 3-point headwind on income before tax. Based on current spot rates, hedging activity and what we are cycling, we expect that currency will be a 2- to 3-point headwind on net revenue and a 6-point headwind on operating income. In addition, we will be cycling the euro debt remeasurement gain we recorded in other income during the second quarter of 2015.
For this reason, we expect an 11-point currency headwind on income before tax as we cycle this gain.
In closing, we are working diligently to deliver our commitments for 2016. We continue to focus on our core capabilities of building brands, driving customer values and leading the system so that when we complete our refranchising, we will be a lower-risk, higher-return business, with even greater confidence to achieve our long-term growth target.
Operator, we are now ready for questions."

James here. Let me -- I'll come to the numerical piece. Let me start off with -- the Asia Pacific price/mix is always a little bit of an oddity because they've got group that brings together Japan and Australia, which are very high-revenue markets but don't grow as quickly, along with a lot of emerging markets, not just China, but India, Indonesia and the Philippines, which grow much faster. So there's a kind of an ongoing mechanical effect that creates a negative price/mix for this group, which you can see over the years in Asia Pacific. So in '13 full year, it was minus 4%. In '14, it was minus 2%. In '15, it was minus 2%. In the first quarter of '16, obviously, it was minus 5%, but it was cycling a very atypical plus 3% in the first quarter of last year. So I think what you will see is in the future quarters, it is a little volatile and bumpy, but the long-term trend is for a negative price/mix in Asia because of the dynamic of the fast growth of the emerging markets versus Japan and Australia."

I mean, clearly, whether it's a 3% or 4%, you've kind of delivered a 3% in some sense this quarter, so you're below pace. So maybe in that, you can tackle kind of what you expect Eurasia, Africa to get to, why do you expect it to get better. Europe, you mentioned, you're going to invest more and you hope that to get better, but we sometimes heard that before. So why is it going to be better in Europe? And then maybe as a jumping off point as well, you can talk about what you're learning in North America because that seems to be doing better, for sure. And footnote, I'm not quite sure you grow organically in North America because you want that 3 points back for concentrate sales up to unit case sales. That's for 1 day missing.

I think you can see the macros influencing the industry in the sense that the -- saw a number of the emerging markets, particularly the commodity ones, where we've had the slowdown, and that's clearly flowing through in the industry. I think what I would highlight is we're going to focus on what we can control. We have a long-standing game plan of what to do in countries that are in crisis, focusing on really gaining a lot of share to set ourselves up profitably for the long term. It's worked in a lot of countries in the past, and it seems to be working now as we gain share in the Chinas and the Russias and the Brazils. It'll pay off in the end. I think the visibility -- look, we're managing to our corridors at the top and the bottom line. We feel that this corridor was within the envelope.

In other words, we execute in stores all the variants of Coca-Cola together as one big block, has a much greater store impact, visual impact, engagement with people who are shopping the stores. I think slightly more strategically, and back to Muhtar's point, this is an implementation of a strategic idea. I'm sure we'll evolve it. I'm sure we'll make it better. But it's the strategic idea that's important. It's not just about the efficiency in advertising. It's about helping consumers join and stay in the Coca-Cola franchise whatever the ingredients they want to manage, including their management of added sugars, whether that's in drinks or any other categories that have added sugar in.

Yes, clearly, North America has had a lot of traction in pushing forward smaller packages away from the traditional 2-liter and multipack of cans. It is worth noting that some of those packages are premium packages and some of those are intended to create affordability or low price point entry points for the category, whether it be the multi -- the mini cans. And that combination does generally help price/mix. You can see that size roll out across other parts of the world. I think Latin America has traditionally been very good at that. You do see more of it coming into Asia Pacific and Eurasia on a global basis. The immediate consumption packages outpaced general volume growth. So it is part of that strategy to push more into smaller packages. Just this last month, India launched a new technology, very small package with a special technology that allows a much longer shelf life in ambient environment of rural India. So it'll be out to get to many more places. So lot of innovation in the technology, a lot of innovation in the package and the sizes and the occasions and the channels so that we can bring down the price points for affordability, take advantage of premiumization and also offer people the right amount of any beverage that they want to actually consume."

And that has really worked, and those are all growing double digits in the United States because of 2 -- consumer -- customer preferences and also benefiting our system because they have a higher price per liter.

I would make one other note, which is the relative change in where global growth is coming from or industry growth is coming from, a little more in developed and developing a little less in emerging, tends to create a kind of a portfolio effect that weighs a little more against sparkling, and therefore, Coca-Cola, because those emerging markets tends to be more sparkling-orientated. And so you see North America, Latin America, Japan with stronger stills growth. So we do expect to see growth. We would expect to see it coming back.

In February, we reported a successful transition year in 2015, where we made tangible progress on our plan and delivered the full year expectations we laid out. I'm pleased to report that in the quarter -- first quarter of 2016, we took another positive step in the macro environment that continues to be challenging. Today, I will touch briefly on a few key highlights in the quarter before handing off to James to provide a more detailed review of our operational performance.
We're in the midst of transforming The Coca-Cola Company to one that is even more focused on our core value creation model of building and supporting strong brands, enhancing customer value and leading our franchise system. During the first quarter, our continued focus on our 5 strategic initiatives enabled us to gain value share and deliver positive top line growth with underlying margin expansion. With the first quarter behind us, we see the challenging global environment continuing, but we remained committed to our full year targets we laid out in February for both the top and bottom line performance.
From a highlights perspective, we continued to execute our strategic initiatives. In the first quarter, we unveiled our new global one brand marketing strategy for trademark Coca-Cola under the Taste the Feeling campaign, which is elevating system engagement with our employees, bottling partners and customers. The initial consumer response is encouraging and positive. Additionally, we added to our portfolio of fast-growing still beverages. We closed our Chinese plant-based protein acquisition of Culiangwang in March. We also invested in Chi, the leading juice and value-added dairy company in Nigeria, Africa's largest economy. Both transactions are further proof points of how we are strengthening our leading stills position, effectively responding to evolving consumer preferences.
Finally, we're accelerating our global refranchising efforts. In North America, we continued to make progress against our stated goal of refranchising 100% of our bottling operations by the end of 2017. Including the territories announced this morning, we have transferred or signed agreements on almost 2/3 of the U.S. territories we originally acquired from CCE. Looking outside of North America to Western Europe, our Coca-Cola European partners' transaction remains on track to close by the end of the second quarter. In Africa, the regulatory approval process continues. The South Africa Competition Commission has recommended for the Competition Tribunal to approve The Coca-Cola Beverages Africa merger with certain conditions. The tribunal is set to meet in May to review the pending transaction.
In summary, we recognize that we still have much work to do, but we have defined a clear path to transform the company, and we are making consistent progress to create long-term value for our share owners. The Coca-Cola Company is becoming stronger, more efficient and more focused on our core strengths of marketing and brand building, customer value creation and leading our franchise bottling system. We're making progress implementing our disciplined global revenue growth management strategy. We're also building a new -- building new growth opportunities with still and sparkling brands that we develop internally, we acquire from the outside and we invest in through partnerships. And our franchise bottling system is also getting stronger, faster, more nimble and more closely aligned. In short, my colleagues and I are getting up every single day with a fresh passion for doing the things that will create long-term, sustainable value.
I'll now hand the call over to James, who's going to provide you with a more detailed look at our operating performance in the first quarter."

From an industry perspective, we gained global value share in NARTD beverages in the quarter, with increases in both sparkling and still beverages worldwide.
We gained value share in all but one of the subcategories in stills, where there we maintained value share. We delivered 2% unit case volume growth, a solid performance in many of our developed markets, was partially offset by challenging -- challenges in emerging markets suffering from the worst of the macro slowdown. This had a disproportionate effect on sparkling volume growth, as the nonalcoholic beverage industry in many of these markets is more weighted towards sparkling beverages. Consolidated price/mix grew 1%, cycling 3%, as solid underlying pricing was partially offset by 1 point of segment mix. We accelerated our price/mix across every operating segment, except Asia Pacific, versus the first quarter last year. Even the geographic footprint of our own bottling investment group, our consolidated price/mix was lower. Given the scale of our pending refranchising, as you consider the sustainability of our disciplined pricing strategy, I think it's helpful to exclude BIG and focus instead on our core business, which delivered 2 points of global price realization. 
Results were also impacted by 1 less day in our fiscal quarter compared to the same period last year, which reduced organic revenue growth by roughly 1 point. As a result, we delivered 2% organic revenue growth, including 1 point headwind from 1 less day. In the quarter, structurally adjusted, comparable currency-neutral income before tax grew a solid 9%, with the underlying margin expansion reflecting our focus on productivity as well as the timing of operating expenses. Notably, this expansion occurred alongside the continued growth in our marketing investments.
Now to describe more clearly our operating performance, let me briefly describe our results in 3 groupings of our markets. First, in markets where our strategies are in place and being executed fairly well, we are seeing strong results. This cluster is led by North America, Latin America, also includes Japan and India. Here, strong marketing, disciplined revenue management and improving execution are driving results. For example, specifically in North America, we delivered 2% organic revenue growth with 1 less day, 3 points of price realization, led by 3% sparkling price/mix and good operating leverage in the quarter. North America also grew value share again this quarter and continued to successfully implement its accelerated refranchising program.
Latin America delivered double-digit organic revenue growth due to a strong focus on consumer and customer segmentation despite worsening conditions in Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina. In Mexico, brand investments, including new products such as Del Valle Néctar, a sparkling fruit drink, as well as Ciel mineral water and Ciel flavored water, helped to increase unit volume by 5%, with growth across all major categories.  Our Japan business unit had a very strong start to the year supported by several recent innovations, such as I LOHAS Peach, an extension of our premium water brand, and a premium priced Georgia coffee bottle can. We also leveraged innovation from China launching lemon +C, which is seeing strong early results. These products enabled our value share to outperform volume share, as they skew higher -- to higher revenue, single-serve packaging. And finally, India. Here, we delivered strong performance in the quarter due to the rapid scaling of a new price pack architecture across sparkling and juice segments, coupled with brand marketing and execution efforts. In addition, we expanded our still beverage portfolio in India with the launch of VIO, our latest value-added dairy beverage. These positive results give us confidence, our strategies are working. While we are making progress in these markets, we also recognize there's more work to be done, and the opportunity for improvement in these good performing markets continues to be significant.
The second group is comprised of markets, where we are taking action to positively transform our business for the future. Here, I would include Europe, where we continue to make progress to the establishment of our newly integrated Western European bottler. And here, several key markets performed very well, led by Spain, up 3%; Germany, up 1%; and in the Central and Southern European business unit, we grew volumes 2%. We look forward to improving performance in Europe as the year progresses.
A second transition market is our African business, where we are taking steps to strengthen our bottling business through the creation of new Coca-Cola Beverages Africa Bottler. As Muhtar mentioned, we are also taking steps to diversify brand portfolio through our investment in Chi, and we continue to improve our execution in key markets on the continent, as exemplified by improving performance in South Africa and Nigeria, where we grew unit case volume 7% and 13%, respectively.
And the final bunch of markets where we face clear macro headwinds in 2016, Russia and Brazil continue to be challenging. China's transition to a consumer-led economy is putting pressure on commodity-dependent emerging and developing markets. The lower oil price continues to weight on the Middle East and other oil-driven economies. And while Argentina is taking the right steps to secure the economic recovery, short-term results are challenging.
So let me refer to a few of these markets. In China, we are adjusting our plan to reflect these realities. China's macro environment was challenging in 2015, and that continued to be so in the first quarter. While the economic slowdown is not new, the degree to which the NARTD industry was impacted this past quarter was worse than expected. Key success factors going forward require focusing on both affordability and premiumization through segmented growth strategies.
The more premium segments continue to grow in China, as consumers who purchase these products are relatively insulated from broader economic issues. We are working to increase our premium offerings like sleek cans and Schweppes +C in high-value channels. At the same time, however, we continue to evolve our price/pack architecture to deliver affordable options in both single-serve and multi-serve packages to ensure we can capture key occasions and recruit new consumers. While the top line has been challenging, our initiatives have enabled us to gain both value and volume share in China in the quarter.
Turning to Brazil. Here, we are segmenting our price/pack architecture to provide packages at key affordable price points while delivering and driving pricing to cover inflation. This strategy enabled us to gain volume share during the quarter. And finally, in Brazil -- in Russia. We gained value share, driven by good marketing and promotional activities with a focus on premium, sparkling beverages and juice. Given the volatility in these markets, we are proactively managing our investments, keeping an eye towards the long term but ensuring our near-term investments have the right payback.
The challenging macro environment is also a key reason why productivity is critical. We remain on track to deliver more than $600 million in productivity savings this year, enabling us to fund our brand and growth investments while covering cost inflation and driving margin expansion. We are delivering these savings through a disciplined process that involves our entire leadership team and associates. Ultimately, it's about building a culture that is focused on getting better every day whilst also improving the employee experience. This quarter, the results from our ongoing efforts were evident in supporting the underlying strong operating margin expansion.
Before I hand over to Kathy, let me conclude by saying we are resolutely focused on evolving our growth strategies and transforming our business to deliver sustainable shareholder value. With the challenges around the world, we will focus on what we can control in order to deliver solid revenue growth and strong underlying operating margin expansion through the effective management of our portfolio, price mix and productivity efforts.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Kathy."

I'd like to touch upon a few areas of our financing performance in the quarter before providing our full year outlook.Starting at the top line. As James mentioned, our 2% organic revenue growth was impacted",1084,"Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to touch upon a few areas of our financing performance in the quarter before providing our full year outlook.
Starting at the top line. As James mentioned, our 2% organic revenue growth was impacted by 1 less day in the quarter as well as by our segment mix, as our Bottling Investments Group grew at a slightly slower rate than our core business. Let me take a moment to explain what we mean by segment mix, and why the impact will be more pronounced in 2016 and 2017, until we have finished our previously announced refranchising actions.
Starting in the first quarter, we revised our operating segment so that our company-owned bottling operations in North America are now reported within our Bottling Investments Group. This greatly increases the relative size of the bottling segment to the rest of our geographic segments. Since our bottling operates earned significantly higher revenue per case than concentrate operations, slower growth among our company-owned bottling operations results in negative pressure on our consolidated price/mix, regardless of the underlying pricing in either the bottling operations or our core business. However, due to the relatively lower profitability of our bottling business, slower growth among our bottling operations has an opposite effect on our consolidated margins.
At gross profit, our comparable margin declined, as we were impacted by currency headwinds, the effects of North America refranchising and the sale of our legacy energy brands to Monster. Excluding the year-over-year effect of these items, we would have seen growth margin expansions, driven by benign cost environment, benefits from productivity and segment mix. As you think about the downhill, keep in mind that the cost environment becomes more difficult to cycle in the second quarter and beyond due to the timing of when commodity prices eased last year.
Our comparable operating margin improved about 25 basis points on a consolidated basis. Similar to gross profits -- to gross margins, currency headwinds, the North America refranchising and the sale of our legacy energy brands to Monster, impacted our operating margins. Comparable currency-neutral operating margins increased 140 basis points in the quarter. Excluding these effects, we achieved strong operating leverage in the quarter, driven by the benefits of our productivity initiatives, the timing of certain expenses and segment mix.
Looking at our productivity initiatives. The first quarter benefited from the timing of when certain productivity initiatives were implemented last year. For example, the majority of the headcount reductions began in April, with Europe's implementation closer to the mid-year. So the associated expense savings began in the second quarter. As you think about the remainder of this year, while we expect solid currency-neutral ex structural operating leverage, we expect some of these drivers to moderate, as we began to cycle more difficult comparisons. This was reflected in our previously provided full year guidance.
Let me stop here and touch briefly on an ongoing structural impact to provide additional clarity based on some of the questions I have received from you. At CAGNY, we noted that by the time we complete our refranchising, we will see significant increases in both growth and operating margins. While that is the case, I want to remind you that until we begin to increase the transfer of our production operations in North America, the existing refranchising of the distribution business actually has a dilutive effect to both growth and operating margins. Given that we do not expect the sale of production assets to significantly increase until 2017, our margins will continue to be affected by this dynamic this year.
Moving to cash flow. We generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations before making a nearly $0.5 billion contribution to our pension plans. Looking ahead through the remainder of the year, we expect our cash flow growth rate to be more in line with our earnings growth rate. For 2016, we increased our annual dividend by 6% to $1.40 per share, our 54th consecutive annual dividend increase. Our net share repurchases during the quarter totaled approximately $150 million. For the full year, we expect to achieve the $2 billion to $2.5 billion range that we communicated during our last earnings call.
Turning to outlook. The first quarter reflected more challenging operating environments in markets like China and Brazil. We see that our strategies are working, however, in key markets like North America, Japan and India. Further, our strategies allow us the scenario plan to adjust to market dynamics. Therefore, we are maintaining our currency-neutral outlook, we previously provided. However, we are updating the expected impact from currency. We expect organic revenue growth of 4% to 5% and comparable currency-neutral EPS growth of 4% to 6%, inclusive of a 3- to 4-point structural headwind to income before tax.
Moving to currency. While current spot rates have improved since our fourth quarter call, these rates have been extremely volatile as well. Therefore, I will caveat our currency outlook knowing that it is definitely subject to change. We will update you accordingly as we move through the year. Based on current spot rates, hedging activity and what we are cycling, we now expect the full year impact of currency to be a 2- to 3-point headwind on net revenue versus our previous expectation of 4 points. Relative to income before tax, we now expect an 8- to 9-point headwind as compared to our previous expectation of a 9-point headwind.
As we model the second quarter, there are a couple of items to consider. We expect the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items to be a 2- to 3-point headwind on net revenues and a 3-point headwind on income before tax. Based on current spot rates, hedging activity and what we are cycling, we expect that currency will be a 2- to 3-point headwind on net revenue and a 6-point headwind on operating income. In addition, we will be cycling the euro debt remeasurement gain we recorded in other income during the second quarter of 2015. For this reason, we expect an 11-point currency headwind on income before tax as we cycle this gain.
In closing, we are working diligently to deliver our commitment for 2016. We continue to focus on our core capabilities of building brands, driving customer values and leading the system so that when we complete our refranchising, we will be a lower-risk, higher-return business, with even greater confidence to achieve our long-term growth target.

Let me start off with -- the Asia Pacific price/mix is always a little bit of an oddity because they've got group that brings together Japan and Australia, which are very high-revenue markets but don't grow as quickly, along with a lot of emerging markets, not just China, but India, Indonesia and the Philippines, which grow much faster. So there's a kind of an ongoing mechanical effect that creates a negative price/mix for this group, which you can see over the years in Asia Pacific. So in '13 full year, it was minus 4%. In '14, it was minus 2%. In '15, it was minus 2%. In the first quarter of '16, obviously, it was minus 5%, but it was cycling a very atypical plus 3% in the first quarter of last year. So I think what you will see is in the future quarters, it is a little volatile and bumpy, but the long-term trend is for a negative price/mix in Asia because of the dynamic of the fast growth of the emerging markets versus Japan and Australia."

So maybe in that, you can tackle kind of what you expect Eurasia, Africa to get to, why do you expect it to get better. Europe, you mentioned, you're going to invest more and you hope that to get better, but we sometimes heard that before. So why is it going to be better in Europe? And then maybe as a jumping off point as well, you can talk about what you're learning in North America because that seems to be doing better, for sure. And footnote, I'm not quite sure you grow organically in North America because you want that 3 points back for concentrate sales up to unit case sales. That's for 1 day missing.

I think you can see the macros influencing the industry in the sense that the -- saw a number of the emerging markets, particularly the commodity ones, where we've had the slowdown, and that's clearly flowing through into the industry. I think what I would highlight is we're going to focus on what we can control. We have a long-standing game plan of what to do in countries that are in crisis, focusing on really gaining a lot of share to set ourselves up profitably for the long term.

I think slightly more strategically, and back to Muhtar's point, this is an implementation of a strategic idea. I'm sure we'll evolve it. I'm sure we'll make it better. But it's the strategic idea that's important. It's not just about the efficiency in advertising. It's about helping consumers join and stay in the Coca-Cola franchise whatever the ingredients they want to manage, including their management of added sugars, whether that's in drinks or any other categories that have added sugar in.

Yes, clearly, North America has had a lot of traction in pushing forward smaller packages away from the traditional 2-liter and multipack of cans. It is worth noting that some of those packages are premium packages and some of those are intended to create affordability or low price point entry points for the category, whether it be the multi -- the mini cans. And that combination does generally help price/mix. You can see that starting to roll out across other parts of the world. I think Latin America has traditionally been very good at that. You do see more of it coming into Asia Pacific and Eurasia on a global basis. The immediate consumption packages outpaced general volume growth. So it is part of that strategy to push more into smaller packages. Just this last month, India launched a new technology, a very small package with a special technology that allows a much longer shelf life in ambient environment of rural India. So it'll be out to get to many more places.

So in a way, the United States in the last 4 or 5 years, but particularly the last 2.5 years, has moved very rapidly to the 12-ounce glass to the 8-ounce glass to the 7.5-ounce can to the 8.5-ounce aluminum bottle.

So I think a lot of the programs are going in later this year. The -- obviously, the execution is there. So we would expect to see better performance in trademark Coca-Cola going into the downhill. I would make one other note, which is the relative change in where global growth is coming from or industry growth is coming from, a little more in developed and developing a little less in emerging, tends to create a kind of a portfolio effect that weighs a little more against sparkling, and therefore, Coca-Cola, because those emerging markets tends to be more sparkling-orientated. And so you see North America, Latin America, Japan with stronger stills growth. So we do expect to see growth. We would expect to see it coming back.

Today, I will touch briefly on a few key highlights in the quarter before handing off to James to provide a more detailed review of our operational performance. 
During the quarter, we continued our progress towards transforming our company to a higher margin and return business focused on our core value-creation model of building strong brands, enhancing customer value and leading our franchise system. Our continued focus on our 5 strategic initiatives enabled us to deliver another quarter of global value share gains while delivering 3% organic revenue growth in a worsening macroeconomic environment. Importantly, our segmented revenue growth strategy drove 3 points of price/mix in the quarter. Further, our strong focus on productivity was instrumental in expanding operating profit margins and delivering our profit target.
While we are pleased with -- we accelerated our price/mix from 1% last quarter to 3% this quarter, our volumes and topline results still fell short of our expectations. This was largely due to a weakening demand in certain large emerging and developing markets, which also impacted our company-owned bottling operations revenue growth. 
Within our bottling investment segment, positive pricing at our North American bottler was offset by challenges in our China bottling operations, resulting in even organic revenues for our company-owned bottling operations globally. However, our core franchise operations continued to perform well, growing organic revenues a full point ahead of our consolidated organic revenues and in line with our long-term targets. Despite weaker conditions in several emerging and developing markets, we continued to see a positive return on our marketing investments, with solid performance in key markets such as the United States, Japan and Mexico, which James will touch more in more detail. 
While the macroeconomic headwinds we are facing in these emerging and developing markets are cyclical in nature and not secular downturns, we're not expecting a material improvement in the remainder of the year, given the continuing volatility in the global economy. This outlook, coupled with where we are year-to-date, will make achieving our previous 4 to 5 organic revenue growth rate very challenging. Therefore, we are lowering our outlook for full year consolidated organic revenue growth. James and Kathy will discuss this in greater detail later on the call. With that being said, we remain fully committed and confident in achieving our underlying profit target despite this challenging environment. We're also confident that our core organic revenue growth will continue to perform our consolidated organic revenues -- continue to outperform our consolidated organic revenue growth by a full point. 
Finally, we remain on track with our refranchising efforts, and we are confident we will complete those efforts by the end of 2017.
Over the past few months, we successfully completed The Coca-Cola European Partners and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa transactions announced the transfer of certain territories in the United States to Arco Continental United venture and reached a new understanding with Coca-Cola regarding joint value creation in Mexico and certain territorial expansion opportunities for company-owned bottling operations, which was announced just this morning. 
As we work through the comprehensive refranchising and near macro -- near-term macro challenges, we will emerge a much stronger company with higher margins and returns a better positioned to deliver on our long-term growth targets. 
I will now hand the call over to James, who will provide you with a more detailed look at our operating performance."
26642,369430152,1013224,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. As Muhtar said, our consolidated volume and revenue results came in below our expectations. So let me first talk about where, why and what we're doing about that.Our volume deceleration from the first quarter",1050,"Thank you, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. 
As Muhtar said, our consolidated volume and revenue results came in below our expectations. So let me first talk about where, why and what we're doing about that.
Our volume deceleration from the first quarter was concentrated in a number -- a few number of markets facing specific macroeconomic challenges. Firstly, China, but also Argentina and Venezuela. The slowdown in our consolidated organic revenue versus our core organic revenue, which grew 4%, the consolidated slowdown was due to our bottling investment slowdown -- segment slowdown. It's the mechanical effect of owning both bottling operations as well as concentrate operations in certain challenged markets. BIG slowdown was principally driven by the challenges the industry -- the broad industry is facing in China. So let's start with China. And what are we doing about it? 
There are 3 factors impacting our performance in China. First, no question, the overall consumer environment is weakening due to the economies, economic transition. Secondly, as this is occurring, wholesalers are adjusting to lower expected sales growth and bringing down inventory levels, which has a whiplash effect on our bottler sales. Third, there are some category mix shifts occurring as different consumer segments respond to these new circumstances. For example, juice and juice drinks category is the weakest performing, whereas premium water is stronger and positive. So there's an opportunity here to both innovate with more premium products positioned for the higher income, new mainstream consumer segment as well as opportunities to address strong affordability needs across the rural and blue collar areas.
So I guess, importantly, perhaps most importantly, what are we doing about it? Firstly, we got a number of new premiumizing offers across multiple categories we compete in being launched. We're also focusing on better execution, particularly in the second tier and rural areas, where they serve more of the mass consumer segment and upping the game in terms of affordable offerings. We are also rebasing the way we approach trade incentives to drive better performance with wholesaler and from our own distributors.
Now despite these actions to improve our business, we still expect the China operation to be under pressure for the remainder of the year. This is a key factor driving the organic revenue outlook, particularly the difference between consolidated and core. But I think it is worth finally making a note that we are keeping a long-term perspective with regard to China. We always knew that for a country as large as China transitioning to a consumer-led economy was going to have its challenges. Those may have turned out to be more than what we expected in the short term. However, we absolutely believe in the long-term opportunity of this market of 1.4 billion consumers, with relatively low beverage per capita compared to the global average. 
Okay, so that's China. Let's move for a second to our core business. The core business, understood as the concentrate and the franchising business, this is where we grew organic revenues 4% for the first half of the year, as segmented revenue growth strategies continue to drive positive results. Yes, some markets are tough, but others are doing very well. Let me start, perhaps, with the more challenging markets. 
I've already touched on China, so let me move to a couple of the other ones I name checked earlier. 
Argentina. We believe that the Argentinian government is taking the right steps to secure its economic recovery, but this is resulting in a contraction in the near term that accelerated in the second quarter, therefore, impacting our business. 
In Venezuela, severe shortages in certain raw materials resulted in us temporarily suspending production at the bottling partner's plants during the quarter, clearly impacting the results. 
Additionally, Brazil. The challenges there are well-understood and, we think, will continue for the remainder of the year. However, we are focusing on key affordability packages and activating a strong Olympic marketing campaign in the coming weeks and months.
We have lived through downturns before in emerging and developing markets and understand how to manage the business in these circumstances. It requires a disciplined approach to pricing relative to inflation and, of course, where necessary, aggressively moving to address consumer dynamics through adjusting the portfolio, both in terms of affordability and product innovation. But as I said earlier, not every market is under pressure. In markets with relatively stable economies, we are executing our strategies and seeing strong results. For example, in North America, we grew organic revenues 4% in the quarter, reflecting continued pricing initiatives for our sparkling business as well as the ongoing strength of our still portfolio. 
In Mexico and Japan, we're delivering strong performance across our portfolio, driven heavily by innovation. 
And turning to some of the emerging markets in Southeast Asia. We are growing volume double-digit year today to behind strong integrated marketing and commercial initiatives across the core brands and key entry-level packaging.
Taken together, these results give us confidence that in stable markets where we increased our investments in marketing innovation, combined with improving market execution, we can continue to deliver strong performance. 
Ultimately, we operate in over 200 countries, and there will always be some markets with macro challenges. Our ability to grow doesn't require macro perfection. In fact, even with this current broader macro adjustment phase in a good number of emerging markets, our segmented revenue growth strategies are enabling us to capture solid pricing of 3% year-to-date for our core operations on top of 1% volume growth. And we are using the productivity to prudently fund marketing where there is momentum and where we see a solid payback, but we're also holding on and making sure that we can use it to deliver strong underlying margin expansion. These actions have enabled us to grow underlying profit before tax, in line with our expectations for the first half of the year and despite more challenging conditions than we initially expected. 
So let me conclude by saying we are confident in our growth strategies. We continue to push in markets where we see success and proactively address those markets that are more challenged, of course, while always keeping aligned on the long term. 
So with that, let me hand over to Kathy to take you through the numbers."
26642,369430152,1013224,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to touch quickly on our financial performance in the quarter before providing our full year outlook. Starting at the top line. Our organic revenue growth was impacted about a point by our segment",587,"Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. 
I'd like to touch quickly on our financial performance in the quarter before providing our full year outlook. 
Starting at the top line. Our organic revenue growth was impacted about a point by our segment mix, as our bottling investment segment grew slower than our core business. At gross profit, our comparable margin declined 20 basis points due to currency and structural headwind. Excluding the effects of these items, our underlying gross margin expanded over 100 basis points, driven by solid pricing, a slightly favorable cost environment, productivity and segment mix. Our comparable operating margin improved about 50 basis points. Similar to gross margins, currency and structural headwinds impacted our operating margins. Excluding the effect of these items, our underlying operating margin increased about 180 basis points in the quarter due to gross margin expansion as well as the timing of productivity savings and certain expenses. 
Now turning to outlook. As Muhtar mentioned, we are revising our full year top line target. For the full year, we now expect 3% organic revenue growth. With that said, we are confident our strategy will deliver strong organic growth for our core business. And we are maintaining our full year underlying profit target as we continue to manage our business. Therefore, we expect to deliver comparable currency-neutral ex structural income before tax growth of 6% to 8%, in line with our long-term target.
Through the first half of the year, we generated strong underlying operating leverage. Consistent with our previously provided guidance, we expect this to moderate as we begin to cycle more difficult comparisons in the back half of this year.
Coca-Cola European Partners closed about a month earlier than we estimated in our previous structural guidance, and we continue to move faster with our refranchising efforts in North America. Therefore, we are updating our full year structural outlook. We now expect a 6- to 7-point structural headwind on net revenue and a 4-point headwind on income before tax. Our currency outlook remains the same, as our previous guidance, a 2- to 3-point headwind on net revenue and an 8- to 9-point headwind on income before tax. So taking all of this into consideration, we expect full year comparable EPS to decline 4% to 7%.
There are a few phasing items to consider when constructing your models. Our fourth quarter has 2 additional days as compared to last year, which will result in stronger top line growth in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. In addition, the 2 additional days in the fourth quarter, coupled with what we are cycling in SG&A in the third quarter of last year, means operating leverage will skew strongly into the fourth quarter. Therefore, we expect virtually all of our growth in comparable currency-neutral ex structural income before tax to come in the fourth quarter. We expect structural items to be a 9-point headwind on net revenue and a 3-point headwind on income before tax in the third quarter. Finally, we expect currency to be a 2-point headwind on net revenue and a 2- to 3-point headwind on income before tax in the third quarter.
In closing, our strategies are working in key markets. We are on track to deliver over $600 million in productivity this year. And we continue to accelerate our refranchising efforts. While our expectations for top line growth have softened, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our profit target this year.

And I'm guessing it cost you roughly a point of unit case volume in the quarter as well. So first, is that right? But more importantly, is there a way to parse how much of the adverse impact is tied to the macro slowing, which I think is more likely to persist versus supply chain corrections and wholesaler inventory destockings, which might hopefully be more transitory? I guess, I'm really trying to assess just how much of a headwind China was in Q2 and then how severe you expect the ongoing headwind to be acknowledging the improvement initiatives that you called out. And then finally, do the issues facing BIG in China impede, at all, your ability to refranchise that market on time and on favorable terms?"

Steve, okay, let me try and get the China, and let me start from the top and work downwards, if I may. I mean, firstly, it's clear that when you look at the Coke company, almost half our revenue comes from bottling versus the other half comes from concentrate and franchise. But given, as you all know, that the bottling business comes with 4 to 5x more revenue per drink sold and the accompanying costs. Any effect on our revenue of the bottler is going to have a magnified impact on revenue and much less on profits, which is part of this dynamic. So in China, it's our largest international bottling operation. We are bottlers that are roughly 20% of the global business, but the biggest one outside the U.S. is China. So that's where it's coming from, and it's a mechanical impact of being hit in China where we own about 1/3 of the system, thus creating that whole difference between the 3% and the 4%. And what we've assumed in our outlook, just to be more confident, clear in our confidence going forward, is we have not really assumed that China is going to get better in the rest of the year. So if it did, that'd be great, but we are assuming it's not in terms of our outlook and guidance. But obviously, we are working through the time to make a better. Now as I said, what's changing in -- as you kind of try to split the difference, what's changing is both the consumer and the supply chain. I think, in round numbers, from a revenue perspective, you've got about half impact coming from the consumer and half coming from the supply chain. What's happening on the consumer, you can see it in the scan Nielsen and and the non scan Nielsen is probably a bit worse than the scan Nielsen in terms of slowdown in sellout to the consumers of all types of FMCG categories. So this is kind of a broad-based consumer slowdown. Within that, from a beverage point of view, you've got juice drinks and juices, which were kind of more the rural areas and blue collar. They are down double digits in terms of revenue from a consumer point of this. Something like Coke is down low single digits, and premium waters is down. There's a shift in the category means going on, which is also actually impacts revenue because juice drink prices tends to be higher than sparkling or water. So that doesn't flow through to profitability. So there's a kind of a rebasing going on in there. But as I said, about half of it's supply chain, the whiplash effect is the destocking by the customers. And that, as you say, is likely to be a much shorter term impact. But again, we are working on it, but we're not including any improvement in that in our outlook, although, clearly, we want to get focused on that and get it to work. I agree with you, the consumer will take a little more time to come back, which is why we're focused on our kind of the game plan we know the works and downturns, where we focus on affordability, on premiumizing for those parts of this country like the premium metro areas and bringing out new products to them. In that way, we believe we can gain value share, which we continue to do in China said that we are set up as the consumer starts recovering. So about half and half, and we believe that the consumer will come back and the supply chain will sort itself out in the relative short term in the rest of this year. Now with regards to the refranchising, obviously, can't really comment on the M&A, but I would say that we and our partners all believe in the long-term potential of the China market. We're very excited. And as I said, because a large about what's happening in the short term is destocking and inventory, everyone's looking past that and looking for the long term. And I think that's still good motivation and animation by everyone to get the deal done. And we'll obviously, from our point of view,  make sure we do it on the right terms ourselves and then we'll be looking for the right comes to them. But we still think it's the right deal for everyone and with a good likelihood of getting done."

I think, perhaps, that's 2 questions in there, second question there, Ali. Let me have a go. In terms of reassessing the action, its both on the places with momentum and the places that are suffering. There are -- there are parts of the business that are growing strongly, whether that's a end of the spectrum like the U.S. and Japan, where we've got good momentum, and the U.S. grew organically 4% in the quarter. Japan is growing well. We are increasing the amount of spend as we see the tailwinds and the effectiveness of the marketing, innovation and the execution. So we're allocating money for the planes that have momentum, and that's only developed end like the U.S. and Japan. It's also on the emerging end like Indonesia or in the Philippines are places like that. So we're going where we see the opportunity to get the biggest bang for the buck. Now we're taking some of the money from those markets that are under the most pressure. And in those places, we're prioritizing, yes, there's still some advertising. But we're doing innovations and we're doing execution and very importantly doing affordability. So the most extreme example perhaps is Venezuela, where there was no sugar, and we've actually double down and really driving Coke with Coke with 0 sugar in Venezuela with kind of a full red one-brand look. So there are places where we are adjusting to the need that is not -- just because you advertise doesn't mean people are going to buy, and it's an affordability problem. I think China is a good example where affordability is in there as well, I think I've talked a bit about China. But the game plan that we've used in those emerging markets under pressure, we're really rolling out. So that reassessing is moving some top line money to those with momentum and doubling down on execution and affordability and innovation in those pressured markets. And that kind of goes a bit to the advertising. Advertising is up this quarter, as we continue to see the value of advertising as part of the marketing, in combination with innovation and execution. Only when you get all of those together that you really get the best returns. So we always look to make sure that all 3 are there. Otherwise, we'll end up wasting our money. So we're out there, and we're pushing ahead with it. And I think what we always have said is that advertising takes some time to work. So for example, the one-brand strategy that we launched, announced in the first quarter, we started the rollout. The latest duration of the graphics went into Mexico a couple of months ago. That's going to -- that sort of marketing innovation takes time to build upon effects. So we'll keep pressing away with the investment and keep assessing it. It's too early to call it a success. We do that towards the end of the year. But we are focused on making that work."

When you take into account the price/mix expansion going from 1% to 3% in the quarter, when you take into account the core business that we have, which is really the company that's emerging out of this very rapid transformation and refranchising, is growing still at a point ahead of the total company currently consolidated number, which is a 4, which is within our sort of long-term growth target that we've espoused to and talked about. I think that's also not maybe a micro metric but certainly an important metric to consider in terms of the payback on also all the activity.

I don't think any of the unit case pressure in the second quarter was due to the reorganization. I think the trends on unit cases, and let me just put out another way of looking at it, are -- have started at the beginning of the year. I think it's probably one of the few times we've seen the developed and our developing countries grow volume and actually seen the emerging markets decline in aggregate. I know we only put out the numbers by groups, but I mean, if you look at developed economies and developing economies, you see volume growth in both those blocks of countries. So in the end, our business, when you take the segmented roles, we've got volume growth and price/mix growth in developed and developing countries, which is very positive in terms of the long-term trajectory of the business. North America has got multi-years of making that work the revenue line. So that's very strong. The volume weakness is all in the emerging markets, and it's all concentrated in a few of the emerging markets. It's big in some of those markets, but it's very concentrated. And the people then on the country levels are all largely still the same and working on these problems. So hopefully that gives you a little inside a very volume weakness is.  I don't think that has anything to do with the reorganization. In fact, I think the reorganization is helping us bring some refreshed views and some experience on what to do in emerging market weakness going forward in the downhill this year and into the future. And then on the price/mix, 3% is a good result. I think we've always talked about our long-term growth model calls for 4% to 6% revenue growth. And we see a balanced split between volume and price/mix into the future. So that gives you a 2 to 3 for price/mix as the component of long-term growth model. 3 is a strong result. Long may it live For the long-term growth model, we're looking for 4 to 6 in a balanced way."

I'm not a big fan of calling out weather as the driver of performance. The weather occurs for good or for bad all around the world. Now in the case of Spain and also France, the kind of that end to the Mediterranean, it was particularly poor in the middle part of the quarter. So that's really what's driving what's going on in the Spanish business, and also it impacted the French business. So we see Europe getting a little bit better. I mean, we had some good results out of Germany and, as you said, some sequential improvement out of GB cycling out of some of the supply chain problems and, I think, that fix that came out of the first quarter. So we see that starting to improve going forward, but I think I hate calling out the weather, but I think that's really the reason in Spain and France. And I think we'll start to see those businesses get better. Now it is worth saying that we got a lot of good programs in Europe, but the recent tragic events in Belgium, in France and recently in Germany do weigh on consumer sentiment and consumer behavior. They go out less. And we have strong on-premise businesses, in fact, particularly in Spain. And that is being dragged down as people respond to some of these tragic events by, perhaps, staying at home a little more. Now hopefully will get better in time as the security situation improves, but I don't want to say -- I don't want to get into weather and global events. I think the business in Europe can get better. We've got a lot of launches coming up, and we got some strong programs. I think Europe can continue to outperform."

All of those emerging markets that used to have better disposable incomes, better macro conditions basically drove some of that. And going forward, certainly, we expect some improvement in that area. So that's number one. Number two, I think important to note that, again, mentioned that developed markets grew and developing markets grew volume and were ahead of the total company number, which was flat and ahead of emerging markets. That, itself, will tell you that, certainly, the price/mix coming from those markets and then the total mix of geographic mix that coupled with that is something that was instrumental in driving our price/mix number and the way it landed in the quarter. So all of those factors and algebras, all the algebra coming together is what made that, the country mix coming out of that, the geographic mix and then the volume, coupled with the pricing that we got. And today, when you look at our U.S. business, with 4% organic revenue growth in North America, that tells you that, that is in the upper -- certainly, in very much in the upper quartile of all large consumer businesses in the country. We are doing very, very well. Japan performed well. Again, Mexico performed very well in terms of the volume and pricing combined, driving the total number. And so -- price/mix.

We're still expecting robust growth in the industry in the long term, driven by the disposable income, the organization of the middle class, innovation. We think we see these things expanding. Now we talked about that being in the 5% sort of ballpark and then probably in the kind of the next 2 [ph] years talked about it being in the 4%. So we do see it coming back over time, but we do see industry growth of slightly moderated in the short term as we talked a little bit about the and some of the previous conferences. Now you did ask the question, we've kind of seen short to mid, I think I would -- give me a second to read on the line. From our point of view, the biggest mechanical impact in the quarter and the year-to-date is this asymmetry between our own bottlers and where it is less than 20% of the volume or about 20% of the volume versus being in 200 countries. I mean, if you parse the bottling side and just look at the core concentrated franchise, we're running organic at 4%, and we're meeting our profit guidance. So we're not kind of trying to say, ""Small ups and downs in the macroeconomy is what should [indiscernible] us every quarter."" We just need to deal with those things. I just think that this one asymmetrical effect at the bottling thing, which is kind of important, which is affecting the number. But I don't want to give the impression we're seeing a massive or trying to signal a deterioration in our outlook for the concentrated franchises. Now with regard to Coke [indiscernible], yes, we talked about looking at some territories on the preferred basis. I'm not going to get into exactly how that means in terms of what preferred means versus exclusive, et cetera. They're our biggest bottling partner. We have a very strong relationship. We have made an agreement on how we're going to create more value together in Mexico and how they will look to participate in some of the refranchising of the bottling owned, the territories we own in bottling. And we're very excited about doing more stuff together."

Today, I will touch briefly on a few key highlights in the quarter before handing off to James to provide a more detailed review of our operational performance. 
During the quarter, we continued our progress towards transforming our company to a higher margin and return business focused on our core value creation model of building strong brands, enhancing customer value and leading our franchise system. Our continued focus on our 5 strategic initiatives enabled us to deliver another quarter of global value share gains while delivering 3% organic revenue growth in a worsening macroeconomic environment. Importantly, our segmented revenue growth strategies drove 3 points of price/mix in the quarter. Further, our strong focus on productivity was instrumental in expanding operating profit margins and delivering our profit target. While we are pleased with -- we accelerated our price/mix from 1% last quarter to 3% this quarter, our volumes and topline results still fell short of our expectations. This was largely due to a weakening demand in certain large emerging and developing markets, which also impacted our company-owned bottling operations revenue growth. 
Within our Bottling Investment segment, positive pricing at our North American bottler was offset by challenges in our China bottling operations, resulting in even organic revenues for our company-owned bottling operations globally. However, our core franchise operations continued to perform well, growing organic revenues a full point ahead of our consolidated organic revenues and in line with our long-term targets. Despite weaker conditions in several emerging and developing markets, we continued to see a positive return on our marketing investments, with solid performance in key markets such as United States, Japan and Mexico, which James will touch on in more detail. While the macroeconomic headwinds we are facing in these emerging and developing markets are cyclical in nature and not secular downturns, we are not expecting a material improvement in the remainder of the year, given the continuing volatility in the global economy. This outlook, coupled with where we are year-to-date, will make achieving our previous 4% to 5% organic revenue growth rate very challenging. Therefore, we are lowering our outlook for full year consolidated organic revenue growth. James and Kathy will discuss this in greater detail later on the call. 
With that being said, we remain fully committed and confident in achieving our underlying profit target despite this challenging environment. We are also confident that our core organic revenue growth will continue to perform our consolidated organic revenue -- continue to outperform our consolidated organic revenue growth by a full point. Finally, we remain on track with our refranchising efforts, and we are confident we will complete those efforts by the end of 2017.
Over the past few months, we successfully completed the Coca-Cola European Partners and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa transactions announced the transfer of certain territories in the United States to Arca Continental UNITED venture and reached a new understanding with Coca-Cola FEMSA regarding joint value creation in Mexico and certain territorial expansion opportunities for company-owned bottling operations, which was announced just this morning. As we work through the comprehensive refranchising and near macro -- near-term macro challenges, we will emerge a much stronger company with higher margins and returns and better positions to deliver on our long-term growth targets. 
I will now hand the call over to James, who'll provide you with a more detailed look at our operating performance."
26642,369430152,1013597,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. As Muhtar said, our consolidated volume and revenue results came in below our expectations. So let me first talk about where, why and what we're doing about that.Our volume deceleration from the first quarter w",1054,"Thank you, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. As Muhtar said, our consolidated volume and revenue results came in below our expectations. So let me first talk about where, why and what we're doing about that.
Our volume deceleration from the first quarter was concentrated in a number -- a few number of markets facing specific macroeconomic challenges. Firstly, China, but also Argentina and Venezuela. The slowdown in our consolidated organic revenue versus our core organic revenue, which grew 4%, the consolidated slowdown was due to our bottling investment slowdown -- segment slowdown. It's the mechanical effect of owning both bottling operations as well as concentrate operations in certain challenged markets. BIG slowdown was principally driven by the challenges the industry -- the broad industry is facing in China. So let's start with China. And what are we doing about it? 
There are 3 factors impacting our performance in China. First, no question, the overall consumer environment is weakening due to the economy's -- economic transition. Secondly, as this is occurring, wholesalers are adjusting to lower expected sales growth and bringing down inventory levels, which has a whiplash effect on our bottler sales. Third, there are some category mix shifts occurring as different consumer segments respond to these new circumstances. For example, juice and juice drinks category is the weakest performing, whereas premium water is stronger and positive. So there is an opportunity here to both innovate with more premium products positioned for the higher income, new mainstream consumer segment as well as opportunities to address strong affordability needs across the rural and blue collar areas.
So I guess, importantly, perhaps most importantly, what are we doing about it? Firstly, we got a number of new premiumizing offers across multiple categories we compete in being launched. We're also focusing on better execution, particularly, in the second tier and rural areas, where they serve more of the mass consumer segment and upping the game in terms of affordable offerings. We are also rebasing the way we approach trade incentives to drive better performance with wholesaler and from our own distributors.
Now despite these actions to improve our business, we still expect that China operation to be under pressure for the remainder of the year. This is a key factor driving the organic revenue outlook, particularly the difference between consolidated and core. But I think it is worth finally making a note that we are keeping a long-term perspective with regard to China. We always knew that for a country as large as China, transitioning to a consumer-led economy was going to have its challenges. Those may have turned out to be more than what we expected in the short term. However, we absolutely believe in the long-term opportunity of this market of 1.4 billion consumers, with relatively low beverage per capita as compared to the global average. 
Okay, so that's China. Let's move for a second to our core business. The core business, understood as the concentrate and the franchising business, this is where we grew organic revenues 4% for the first half of the year, as segmented revenue growth strategies continue to drive positive results. Yes, some markets are tough, but others are doing very well. Let me start, perhaps, with the more challenging markets. I've already touched on China, so let me move to a couple of the other ones I name checked earlier. 
Argentina. We believe that the Argentinian government is taking the right steps to secure its economic recovery, but this is resulting in a contraction in the near term that accelerated in the second quarter, therefore, impacting our business. 
In Venezuela, severe shortages in certain raw materials resulted in us temporarily suspending production at the bottling partner's plants during the quarter, clearly impacting the results. 
Additionally, Brazil, the challenges there are well understood and, we think, will continue for the remainder of the year. However, we are focusing on key affordability packages and activating a strong Olympic marketing campaign in the coming weeks and months.
We have lived through downturns before in emerging and developing markets and understand how to manage the business in these circumstances. It requires a disciplined approach to pricing relative to inflation and, of course, where necessary, aggressively moving to address consumer dynamics through adjusting the portfolio, both in terms of affordability and product innovation. But as I said earlier, not every market is under pressure. In markets with relatively stable economies, we are executing our strategies and seeing strong results. For example, in North America, we grew organic revenues 4% in the quarter, reflecting continued pricing initiatives for our sparkling business as well as the ongoing strength of our stills portfolio. In Mexico and Japan, we're delivering strong performance across our portfolio, driven heavily by innovation. 
And turning to some of the emerging markets. In Southeast Asia, we are growing volume double digits year-to-date behind strong integrated marketing and commercial initiatives across the core brands and key entry-level packaging.
Taken together, these results give us confidence that in stable markets where we increase our investments in marketing innovation, combined with improving market place execution, we can continue to deliver strong performance. 
Ultimately, we operate in over 200 countries, and there will always be some markets with macro challenges. Our ability to grow doesn't require macro perfection. In fact, even with this current broader macro adjustment phase in a good number of emerging markets, our segmented revenue growth strategies are enabling us to capture solid pricing of 3% year-to-date for our core operations on top of 1% volume growth. And we are using the productivity to prudently fund marketing where there is momentum and where we see a solid payback, but we're also holding on and making sure that we can use it to deliver strong underlying margin expansion. These actions have enabled us to grow underlying profit before tax, in line with our expectations for the first half of the year and despite more challenging conditions than we initially expected. 
So let me conclude by saying we are confident in our growth strategies. We continue to push in markets where we see success and proactively address those markets that are more challenged, of course, while always keeping aligned on the long term. 
So with that, let me hand over to Kathy to take you through the numbers."
26642,369430152,1013597,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to touch quickly on our financial performance in the quarter before providing our full year outlook. Starting at the top line. Our organic revenue growth was impacted about 1 point by our segment mi",589,"Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to touch quickly on our financial performance in the quarter before providing our full year outlook. 
Starting at the top line. Our organic revenue growth was impacted about 1 point by our segment mix, as our Bottling Investment segment grew slower than our core business. At gross profit, our comparable margin declined 20 basis points due to currency and structural headwind. Excluding the effect of these items, our underlying gross margin expanded over a 100 basis points, driven by solid pricing, a slightly favorable cost environment, productivity and segment mix. Our comparable operating margin improved about 50 basis points. Similar to gross margins, currency and structural headwinds impacted our operating margins. Excluding the effect of these items, our underlying operating margin increased about 180 basis points in the quarter due to gross margin expansion as well as the timing of productivity savings and certain expenses. 
Now turning to outlook. As Muhtar mentioned, we are revising our full year top line target. For the full year, we now expect 3% organic revenue growth. With that said, we are confident our strategies will deliver strong organic growth for our core business. And we are maintaining our full year underlying profit target as we continue to manage our business. Therefore, we expect to deliver comparable currency neutral ex-structural income before tax growth of 6% to 8%, in line with our long-term target.
Through the first half of the year, we generated strong underlying operating leverage. Consistent with our previously provided guidance, we expect this to moderate as we begin to cycle more difficult comparisons in the back half of this year.
Coca-Cola European Partners closed about a month earlier than we estimated in our previous structural guidance, and we continue to move faster with our refranchising efforts in North America. Therefore, we are updating our full year structural outlook. We now expect a 6- to 7-point structural headwind on net revenue and a 4-point headwind on income before tax. Our currency outlook remains the same, as our previous guidance, a 2- to 3-point headwind on net revenue and an 8- to 9-point headwind on income before tax. So taking all of this into consideration, we expect full year comparable EPS to decline 4% to 7%.
And there are a few phasing items to consider when constructing your models. Our fourth quarter has 2 additional days as compared to last year, which will result in stronger top line growth in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. In addition, the 2 additional days in the fourth quarter, coupled with what we are cycling in SG&A in the third quarter of last year, means operating leverage will skew strongly into the fourth quarter. Therefore, we expect virtually all of our growth in comparable currency neutral ex-structural income before tax to come in the fourth quarter. We expect structural items to be a 9-point headwind on net revenue and a 3-point headwind on income before tax in the third quarter. Finally, we expect currency to be a 2-point headwind on net revenue and a 2- to 3-point headwind on income before tax in the third quarter.
In closing, our strategies are working in key markets. We are on track to deliver over $600 million in productivity this year. And we continue to accelerate our refranchising efforts. While our expectations for top line growth have softened, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our profit target this year.

And I'm guessing it cost you roughly 1 point of unit case volume in the quarter as well. So first, is that right? But more importantly, is there a way to parse how much of the adverse impact is tied to the macro slowing, which I think is more likely to persist versus supply chain corrections and wholesaler inventory destockings, which might hopefully be more transitory? I guess, I'm really trying to assess just how much of a headwind China was in Q2 and then how severe you expect the ongoing headwind to be acknowledging the improvement initiatives that you called out. And then finally, do the issues facing BIG in China impede, at all, your ability to refranchise that market on time and on favorable terms?"

I mean, firstly, it's clear that when you look at the Coke company, almost half our revenue comes from bottling versus the other half comes",760,"Okay, Steve. So -- okay, let me try and get the China, and let me start from the top and work downwards, if I may. I mean, firstly, it's clear that when you look at the Coke company, almost half our revenue comes from bottling versus the other half comes from concentrate and franchise. But given, as you all know that the bottling business comes with 4 to 5 times more revenue per drink sold and the accompanying costs, any effect on the revenue of the bottler is going to have a magnified impact on revenue and much less on profits, which is part of this dynamic. So in China, it's our largest international bottling operation. We own bottlers that are roughly 20% of the global business, but the biggest one outside the U.S. is China. So that's where it's coming from, and it's the mechanical impact of being hit in China where we own about 1/3 of the system, thus creating that whole difference between the 3% and the 4%. And what we've assumed in our outlook, just to be more confident -- clear in our confidence going forward, is we have not really assumed that China is going to get better in the rest of the year. So if it did, that'd be great, but we are assuming it's not in terms of our outlook and guidance, but obviously, we are working to try and make it better. Now as I said, what's changing in -- as you kind of try to split the difference, what's changing is both the consumer and the supply chain. I think, in round numbers, from a revenue perspective, you got about half the impact coming from the consumer and half coming from the supply chain. What's happening on the consumer, you even see it in the scan Nielsen and the nonscan Nielsen is probably a bit worse than the scan Nielsen in terms of slowdown in sellout to the consumers of all types of FMCG category, so it is a kind of a broad-based consumer slowdown. Within that, from a beverage point of view, you got juice drinks and juices, which were kind of more for the rural areas in blue color, they are down double digits in terms of revenue from a consumer point of view. Something like Coke is down low single digits, and premium waters is growing. So there is a shift in the category mix going on, which is also actually impacts revenue because juice drink prices tend to be higher than sparkling or water, so that doesn't flow through to profitability. So there is a kind of a rebasing going on in there. But as I said, about half of it's the supply chain, the whiplash effect is the destocking by the customers. And that, as you say, is likely to be a much shorter term impact. But again, we're working on it, but we're not including any improvement in that in our outlook, although, clearly, we want to get focused on it and get it to work. I agree with you, the consumer will think -- will take a little more time to come back, which is why we're focused on our kind of the game plan we know that works in downturns, where we focus on affordability, on premiumizing for those parts of this country like the premium metro areas and bringing out new products for them, and that way, we believe we can gain value share, which we continue to do in China, so that we are set up as the consumer starts recovering. So about half and half, and we believe that the consumer will come back and the supply chain will sort itself out in the relative short term in the rest of this year. Now with regards to the refranchising, obviously, can't really comment on the M&A, but I would say that we and our partners all believe in the long-term potential of the China market. We're very excited. And as I said, because a large part of what's happening in the short term is destocking in inventory, everyone's looking past that and looking for the long term, and I think there is still good motivation and animation by everyone to get the deal done.

I think, perhaps, that's 2 questions in the second questions there, Ali. Let me have a go. Look, in terms of reassessing the action, that's both on the places with momentum and the places that are suffering. There are -- there are parts of the business that are growing strongly, whether that's a one end of the spectrum like the U.S. and Japan, where we've got good momentum. I mean the U.S. grew organically 4% in the quarter. Japan is growing well. We are increasing the amount of spend as we see the tailwinds and the effectiveness of the marketing, innovation and the execution. So we're allocating money for the planes that have momentum, and that's on the developed end like the U.S. and Japan. It's also on the emerging end like Indonesia, in the Philippines and places like that. So we're going where we see the opportunity to get the biggest bang for the buck. Now we're taking some of the money from those markets that are under most pressure, and in those places, we're prioritizing, yes, there's still some advertising, but we're doing innovations and we're doing execution and very importantly doing affordability. So the most extreme example, perhaps, is Venezuela, where there was no sugar, and then we've actually double down and really driving Coke with -- Coke with 0 sugar in Venezuela with the kind of a full red one-brand look. So there are places where we are adjusting to the need that is not -- just because you advertise, doesn't mean people are going to buy, if it's an affordability problem. And I think China is a good example where affordability is in there as well, I think, I've talked a bit about China. But the game plan that we've used in those emerging markets under pressure, we're really rolling out. So that reassessing is moving some top line money to those with momentum and doubling down on execution and affordability and in innovation in those pressured markets. And that kind of goes a bit to the advertising. Advertising is up this quarter, as we continue to see the value of advertising as part of the marketing mix in combination with innovation and execution. It's only when you get all of those together that you really get the best returns. So we always look to make sure that all 3 are there, otherwise, we'll end up wasting our money. So we're out there, and we're pushing ahead with it, and I think what we always have said is that advertising takes some time to work. So for example, the one-brand strategy that we launched -- announced in the first quarter, we started the rollout. The latest duration of the graphics went into Mexico a couple of months ago. That's going to -- that sort of marketing innovation takes time to build upon effects. So we'll keep pressing away with the investment and keep assessing it. It's too early to call it a success. We do that towards the end of the year, but we are focused on making that work."

I think that's also not maybe a micro metric but certainly an important metric to consider in terms of the payback on also all the activity.

I don't think any of the unit case pressure in the second quarter was due to the reorganization. I think the trends on unit cases, and let me just put out another way of looking at it, are -- have started at the beginning of the year.",357,"Sure. Let me start. I don't think any of the unit case pressure in the second quarter was due to the reorganization. I think the trends on unit cases, and let me just put out another way of looking at it, are -- have started at the beginning of the year. I think it's probably one of the few times we've seen the developed and our developing countries grow volume and actually seen the emerging markets decline in aggregate. I know we only put out the numbers by groups, but I mean, if you look at developed economies and developing economies, you see volume growth in both those blocks of countries. So in the end, our business, when you take the segmented roles, we've got volume growth and price/mix growth in developed and developing countries, which is very positive in terms of the long-term trajectory of the business. North America has got multi-years of making that work with revenue line, so that's very strong. The volume weakness is all in the emerging markets, and it's all concentrated in a few of the emerging markets. It's big in some of those markets, but it's very concentrated. And the people then on the country levels are all largely still the same and working on these problems. So hopefully that gives you a little insight on where the volume weakness is, but I don't think that has anything to do with the reorganization. In fact, I think the reorganization is helping us bring some refreshed views and some experience on what to do in emerging market weakness going forward in the downhill this year and into the future. And then on the price/mix, 3% is a good result. I think we've always talked about our long-term growth model calls for 4% to 6% revenue growth, and we see a balanced split between volume and price/mix into the future. So that gives you a 2% to 3% for price/mix as the component of long-term growth model. So 3% is a strong result. Long may it live. For the long-term growth model, we're looking for 4% to 6% in a balanced way."

I'm not a big fan of calling out weather as the driver of performance. The weather occurs, for good or for bad, all around the world. Now in the case of Spain and also France, the kind of that end of the Mediterranean, it was particularly poor in the middle part of the quarter. So that's really what's driving -- what's going on in the Spanish business, and also it impacted the French business. So we see Europe getting a little bit better. I mean, we have some good results out of Germany and, as you said, some sequential improvement out of GB cycling out of some of the supply chain problems and, I think, as they got fixed that came out of the first quarter. So we see that starting to improve going forward, but I think, I hate calling out the weather, but I think that's really the reason in Spain and France, and I think we'll start to see those businesses get better. Now it is worth saying that we got a lot of good programs in Europe, but the recent tragic events in Belgium, in France and recently in Germany, do weigh on consumer sentiment and consumer behavior. They go out less, and we have strong on-premise businesses, in fact, particularly in Spain. And that is being dragged down as people respond to some of these tragic events by, perhaps, staying at home a little more. Now that hopefully will get better in time as the security situation improves, but I don't want to say -- I don't want to get into weather and global events. I think the business in Europe can get better. We've got a lot of launches coming up, and we got some strong programs. I think Europe can continue to outperform."

All of those emerging markets that use to have better disposable incomes, better macro conditions basically drove some of that. And going forward, certainly, we expect some improvement in that area, so that's number one. Number two, I think important to note that, again, mentioned that developed markets grew and developing markets grew volume and were ahead of the total company number, which was flat and ahead of emerging markets. That, itself, will tell you that, certainly, the price/mix coming from those markets and then the total mix of -- geographic mix that coupled with that is something that was instrumental in driving our price/mix number in the way it landed in the quarter. So all of those factors and algebras, all the algebra coming together is what made that, the country mix coming out of that, the geographic mix and then the volume, coupled with the pricing that we got. And today, when you look at our U.S. business, with 4% organic revenue growth in North America, that tells you that, that is in the upper -- certainly, in very much in the upper quartile of all large consumer businesses in the country. We are doing very, very well. Japan performed well. Again, Mexico performed very well in terms of the volume and pricing combined, driving the total number. And so -- price/mix.

We're still expecting robust growth in the industry in the long term, driven by the disposable income, urbanization in the middle class, innovation. We see -- and we see these things expanding. Now in the -- now that we've talked about that being in the 5% sort of ballpark and then probably in the kind of the next 2 years talked about it being in the 4%. So we do see it coming back over time, but we do see industry growth of slightly moderated in the short term as we talked a little bit about in some of the previous conferences. Now you did ask the question, we've kind of [indiscernible], I think I would -- give me a second to read on the line. From our point of view, the biggest mechanical impact in the quarter and the year-to-date is this asymmetry between our own bottlers and where it is less than 20% of the volume or about 20% of the volume versus being in 200 countries. I mean, if you parse the bottling side and just look at the core concentrated franchise, we're running organic at 4%, and we're meeting our profit guidance. So we're not kind of trying to say, ""Small ups and downs in the macroeconomy is what should buffet us every quarter."" We just need to deal with those things. I just think that this one asymmetrical effect at the bottling thing, which is kind of important, which is affecting the number. But I don't want to give the impression we're seeing a massive or trying to signal a deterioration in our outlook for the concentrated franchise business. Now with regard to Coke FEMSA, yes, we've talked about looking at some territories on a preferred basis. I'm not going to get into exactly how that means in terms of what preferred means versus exclusive, et cetera. but they are our biggest bottling partner. We have a very strong relationship. We've made an agreement on how we're going to create more value together in Mexico and how they can look to participate in some of the refranchising as a bottling owned -- the territories that we own in bottling, and we're very excited about doing more stuff together."

Today, I will touch briefly on a few key highlights in the quarter before handing off to James to provide a more detailed review of our operational performance. 
During the quarter, we continued our progress towards transforming our company to a higher margin and return business, focused on our core value creation model of building strong brands, enhancing customer value and leading our franchise system. Our continued focus on our 5 strategic initiatives enabled us to deliver another quarter of global value share gains while delivering 3% organic revenue growth in a worsening macroeconomic environment. Importantly, our segmented revenue growth strategies drove 3 points of price/mix in the quarter. Further, our strong focus on productivity was instrumental in expanding operating profit margins and delivering our profit target. While we are pleased with -- we accelerated our price/mix from 1% last quarter to 3% this quarter, our volumes and topline results still fell short of our expectations. This was largely due to a weakening demand in certain large emerging and developing markets, which also impacted our company-owned bottling operations revenue growth. 
Within our Bottling Investment segment, positive pricing at our North American bottler was offset by challenges in our China bottling operations, resulting in even organic revenues for our company-owned bottling operations globally. However, our core franchise operations continued to perform well, growing organic revenues a full point ahead of our consolidated organic revenues and in line with our long-term targets. Despite weaker conditions in several emerging and developing markets, we continued to see a positive return on our marketing investments, with solid performance in key markets such as the United States, Japan and Mexico, which James will touch on in more detail. While the macroeconomic headwinds we are facing in these emerging and developing markets are cyclical in nature and not secular downturns, we are not expecting a material improvement in the remainder of the year, given the continuing volatility in the global economy. This outlook, coupled with where we are year-to-date, will make achieving our previous 4% to 5% organic revenue growth rate very challenging. Therefore, we are lowering our outlook for full year consolidated organic revenue growth. James and Kathy will discuss this in greater detail later on the call. 
With that being said, we remain fully committed and confident in achieving our underlying profit target despite this challenging environment. We are also confident that our core organic revenue growth will continue to perform our consolidated organic -- continue to outperform our consolidated organic revenue growth by a full point. Finally, we remain on track with our refranchising efforts, and we are confident we will complete those efforts by the end of 2017.
Over the past few months, we successfully completed the Coca-Cola European Partners and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa transactions announced the transfer of certain territories in the United States to Arca Continental UNITED venture and reached a new understanding with Coca-Cola FEMSA regarding joint value creation in Mexico and certain territorial expansion opportunities for company-owned bottling operations, which was announced just this morning. As we work through the comprehensive refranchising and near macro -- near-term macro challenges, we will emerge a much stronger company with higher margins and returns and better positions to deliver on our long-term growth targets. 
I will now hand the call over to James, who'll provide you with a more detailed look at our operating performance."
26642,369430152,1014060,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. As Muhtar said, our consolidated volume and revenue results came in below our expectations. So let me first talk about where, why and what we're doing about that.Our volume deceleration from the first quarter w",1054,"Thank you, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. As Muhtar said, our consolidated volume and revenue results came in below our expectations. So let me first talk about where, why and what we're doing about that.
Our volume deceleration from the first quarter was concentrated in a number -- a few number of markets facing specific macroeconomic challenges. Firstly, China, but also Argentina and Venezuela. The slowdown in our consolidated organic revenue versus our core organic revenue, which grew 4%, the consolidated slowdown was due to our bottling investment slowdown -- segment slowdown. It's the mechanical effect of owning both bottling operations as well as concentrate operations in certain challenged markets. BIG slowdown was principally driven by the challenges the industry -- the broad industry is facing in China. So let's start with China. And what are we doing about it? 
There are three factors impacting our performance in China. First, no question, the overall consumer environment is weakening due to the economy's -- economic transition. Secondly, as this is occurring, wholesalers are adjusting to lower expected sales growth and bringing down inventory levels, which has a whiplash effect on our bottler sales. Third, there are some category mix shifts occurring as different consumer segments respond to these new circumstances. For example, juice and juice drinks category is the weakest performing, whereas premium water is stronger and positive. So there is an opportunity here to both innovate with more premium products positioned for the higher income, new mainstream consumer segment as well as opportunities to address strong affordability needs across the rural and blue collar areas.
So I guess, importantly, perhaps most importantly, what are we doing about it? Firstly, we've got a number of new premiumizing offers across multiple categories we compete in being launched. We're also focusing on better execution, particularly, in the second tier and rural areas, where they serve more of the mass consumer segment and upping the game in terms of affordable offerings. We are also rebasing the way we approach trade incentives to drive better performance with wholesaler and from our own distributors.
Now despite these actions to improve our business, we still expect our China operation to be under pressure for the remainder of the year. This is a key factor driving the organic revenue outlook, particularly the difference between consolidated and core. But I think it is worth finally making a note that we are keeping a long-term perspective with regard to China. We always knew that for a country as large as China, transitioning to a consumer-led economy was going to have its challenges. Those may have turned out to be more than what we expected in the short term. However, we absolutely believe in the long-term opportunity of this market of 1.4 billion consumers, with relatively low beverage per capita as compared to the global average. 
Okay, so that's China. Let's move for a second to our core business. The core business, understood as the concentrate and the franchising business, this is where we grew organic revenues 4% for the first half of the year, as segmented revenue growth strategies continue to drive positive results. Yes, some markets are tough, but others are doing very well. Let me start, perhaps, with the more challenging markets. I've already touched on China, so let me move to a couple of the other ones I name checked earlier. 
Argentina. We believe that the Argentinean government is taking the right steps to secure its economic recovery, but this is resulting in a contraction in the near term that accelerated in the second quarter, therefore, impacting our business. 
In Venezuela, severe shortages in certain raw materials resulted in us temporarily suspending production at the bottling partner's plants during the quarter, clearly impacting the results. 
Additionally, Brazil, the challenges there are well understood and, we think, will continue for the remainder of the year. However, we are focusing on key affordability packages and activating a strong Olympic marketing campaign in the coming weeks and months.
We have lived through downturns before in emerging and developing markets and understand how to manage the business in these circumstances. It requires a disciplined approach to pricing relative to inflation and, of course, where necessary, aggressively moving to address consumer dynamics through adjusting the portfolio, both in terms of affordability and product innovation. But as I said earlier, not every market is under pressure. In markets with relatively stable economies, we are executing our strategies and seeing strong results. For example, in North America, we grew organic revenues 4% in the quarter, reflecting continued pricing initiatives for our sparkling business as well as the ongoing strength of our stills portfolio. In Mexico and Japan, we're delivering strong performance across our portfolio, driven heavily by innovation. 
And turning to some of the emerging markets. In Southeast Asia, we are growing volume double digits year-to-date behind strong integrated marketing and commercial initiatives across the core brands and key entry-level packaging.
Taken together, these results give us confidence that in stable markets where we increase our investments in marketing innovation, combined with improving marketplace execution, we can continue to deliver strong performance. 
Ultimately, we operate in over 200 countries, and there will always be some markets with macro challenges. Our ability to grow doesn't require macro perfection. In fact, even with this current broader macro adjustment phase in a good number of emerging markets, our segmented revenue growth strategies are enabling us to capture solid pricing of 3% year-to-date for our core operations on top of 1% volume growth. And we are using the productivity to prudently fund marketing where there is momentum and where we see a solid payback, but we're also holding on and making sure that we can use it to deliver strong underlying margin expansion. These actions have enabled us to grow underlying profit before tax, in line with our expectations for the first half of the year and despite more challenging conditions than we initially expected. 
So let me conclude by saying we are confident in our growth strategies. We continue to push in markets where we see success and proactively address those markets that are more challenged, of course, while always keeping an eye on the long term. 
So with that, let me hand over to Kathy to take you through the numbers."
26642,369430152,1014060,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to touch quickly on our financial performance in the quarter before providing our full year outlook. Starting at the top line. Our organic revenue growth was impacted about 1 point by our segment mi",589,"Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to touch quickly on our financial performance in the quarter before providing our full year outlook. 
Starting at the top line. Our organic revenue growth was impacted about 1 point by our segment mix, as our Bottling Investment segment grew slower than our core business. At gross profit, our comparable margin declined 20 basis points due to currency and structural headwind. Excluding the effect of these items, our underlying gross margin expanded over a 100 basis points, driven by solid pricing, a slightly favorable cost environment, productivity and segment mix. Our comparable operating margin improved about 50 basis points. Similar to gross margin, currency and structural headwinds impacted our operating margin. Excluding the effect of these items, our underlying operating margin increased about 180 basis points in the quarter due to gross margin expansion as well as the timing of productivity savings and certain expenses. 
Now turning to outlook. As Muhtar mentioned, we are revising our full year top line target. For the full year, we now expect 3% organic revenue growth. With that said, we are confident our strategies will deliver stronger organic growth for our core business. And we are maintaining our full year underlying profit target as we continue to manage our business. Therefore, we expect to deliver comparable currency neutral ex-structural income before tax growth of 6% to 8%, in line with our long-term target.
Through the first half of the year, we generated strong underlying operating leverage. Consistent with our previously provided guidance, we expect this to moderate as we begin to cycle more difficult comparisons in the back half of this year.
Coca-Cola European Partners closed about a month earlier than we estimated in our previous structural guidance, and we continue to move faster with our refranchising efforts in North America. Therefore, we are updating our full year structural outlook. We now expect a 6- to 7-point structural headwind on net revenue and a 4-point headwind on income before tax. Our currency outlook remains the same, as our previous guidance, a 2- to 3-point headwind on net revenue and an 8- to 9-point headwind on income before tax. So taking all of this into consideration, we expect full year comparable EPS to decline 4% to 7%.
And there are a few phasing items to consider when constructing your models. Our fourth quarter has 2 additional days as compared to last year, which will result in stronger top line growth in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. In addition, the 2 additional days in the fourth quarter, coupled with what we are cycling in SG&A in the third quarter of last year, means operating leverage will skew strongly into the fourth quarter. Therefore, we expect virtually all of our growth in comparable currency neutral ex-structural income before tax to come in the fourth quarter. We expect structural items to be a 9-point headwind on net revenue and a 3-point headwind on income before tax in the third quarter. Finally, we expect currency to be a 2-point headwind on net revenue and a 2- to 3-point headwind on income before tax in the third quarter.
In closing, our strategies are working in key markets. We are on track to deliver over $600 million in productivity this year. And we continue to accelerate our refranchising efforts. While our expectations for top line growth have softened, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our profit target this year.

And I'm guessing it cost you roughly 1 point of unit case volume in the quarter as well. So first, is that right? But more importantly, is there a way to parse how much of the adverse impact is tied to the macro slowing, which I think is more likely to persist versus supply chain corrections and wholesaler inventory destockings, which might hopefully be more transitory? I guess, I'm really trying to assess just how much of a headwind China was in Q2 and then how severe you expect the ongoing headwind to be, acknowledging the improvement initiatives that you called out. And then finally, do the issues facing BIG in China impede, at all, your ability to refranchise that market on time and on favorable terms?"

So -- okay, let me try and get the China, and let me start from the top and work downwards, if I may. I mean, firstly, it's clear that when you look at the Coke company, almost half our revenue comes from bottling versus the other half comes from concentrate and franchise. But given, as you all know that a bottling business comes with 4 to 5 times more revenue per drink sold and the accompanying cost, any effect on the revenue of the bottler is going to have a magnified impact on revenue and much less on profits, which is part of this dynamic. So in China, it's our largest international bottling operation. We own bottlers that are roughly 20% of the global business, but the biggest one outside the U.S. is China. So that's where it's coming from, and it's the mechanical impact of being hit in China where we own about 1/3 of the system, thus creating that whole difference between the 3% and the 4%. And what we've assumed in our outlook, just to be more confident -- clear in our confidence going forward, is we have not really assumed that China is going to get better in the rest of the year. So if it did, that'd be great, but we are assuming it's not in terms of our outlook and guidance, but obviously, we are working to try and make it better. Now as I said, what's changing in -- as you kind of try to split the difference, what's changing is both the consumer and the supply chain. I think, in round numbers, from a revenue perspective, you got about half the impact coming from the consumer and half coming from the supply chain. What's happening on the consumer, you can see it in the scan Nielsen and the nonscan Nielsen is probably a bit worse than the scan Nielsen in terms of slowdown in sellout to the consumers of all types of FMCG categories, so it is a kind of a broad-based consumer slowdown. Within that, from a beverage point of view, you got juice drinks and juices, which were kind of more for the rural areas in blue color, they are down double digits in terms of revenue from a consumer point of view. Something like Coke is down low single digits, and premium waters is growing. So there is a shift in the category mix going on, which is also actually impacts revenue because juice drink prices tend to be higher than sparkling or water, so that doesn't flow through to profitability. So there is a kind of a rebasing going on in there. But as I said, about half of it's the supply chain, the whiplash effect of the destocking by the customers. And that, as you say, is likely to be a much shorter term impact. But again, we're working on it, but we're not including an improvement in that in our outlook, although, clearly, we want to get focused on it and get it to work. I agree with you, the consumer will -- thing will take a little more time to come back, which is why we're focused on our kind of the game plan we know that works in downturns, where we focus on affordability, on premiumizing for those parts of the country like the premium metro areas and bringing out new products for them, and that way, we believe we can gain value share, which we continue to do in China, so that we are set up as the consumer starts recovering. So about half and half, and we believe that the consumer will come back and the supply chain will sort itself out in the relative short term in the rest of this year. Now with regards to the refranchising, obviously, can't really comment on the M&A, but I would say that we and our partners all believe in the long-term potential of the China market. We're very excited. And as I said, because a large part of what's happening in the short term is destocking in inventory, everyone's looking past that and looking to the long term, and I think there is still good motivation and animation by everyone to get the deal done. And we'll obviously, from our point of view,  make sure we do it on the right terms for ourselves and they'll be looking for the right terms for them. But we still think it's the right deal for everyone and with a good likelihood of getting done."

I think, perhaps, that's 2 questions in the second questions there, Ali. Let me have a go. Look, in terms of reassessing the action, that's both on the places with momentum and the places that are suffering. There are -- there are parts of the business that are growing strongly, whether that's at one end of the spectrum like the U.S. and Japan, where we've got good momentum. I mean the U.S. grew organically 4% in the quarter; Japan is growing well. We are increasing the amount of spend as we see the tailwinds and the effectiveness of the marketing, innovation and the execution. So we're reallocating money to the places that have momentum, and that's on the developed end like the U.S. and Japan. It's also on the emerging end like Indonesia, and the Philippines and places like that. So we're going where we see the opportunity to get the biggest bang for the buck. Now we're taking some of the money from those markets that are under most pressure, and in those places, we're prioritizing, yes, there's still some advertising, but we're doing innovations and we're doing execution and very importantly we're doing affordability. So the most extreme example, perhaps, is Venezuela, where there was no sugar, and then we've actually double downed and really driving Coke with -- Coke with 0 sugar in Venezuela with the kind of a full red one-brand look. So there are places where we are adjusting to the need that it's not -- just because you advertise, doesn't mean people are going to buy, if it's an affordability problem. And I think China is a good example where affordability is in there as well, I think, I've talked a bit about China. But the game plan that we've used in those emerging markets under pressure, we're really rolling out. So that reassessing is moving some top line money to those with momentum and doubling down on execution and affordability and innovation in those pressured markets. And that kind of goes a bit to the advertising. Advertising is up this quarter, as we continue to see the value of advertising as part of the marketing mix in combination with innovation and execution. It's only when you get all of those together that you really get the best returns. So we always look to make sure that all 3 are there, otherwise, we'll end up wasting our money. So we're out there, and we're pushing ahead with this, and I think what we always have said is that advertising takes some time to work. So for example, the one-brand strategy that we launched -- announced in the first quarter, we started the rollout. The latest iteration of the graphics went into Mexico a couple of months ago. That's going to -- that sort of marketing innovation takes time to build upon effects. So we'll keep pressing away with the investment and keep assessing it. It's too early to call it a success. We do that towards the end of the year, but we are focused on making that work."

When you take into account the price/mix expansion going from 1% to 3% in the quarter, when you take into account the core business that we have, which is really the company that's emerging out of this very rapid transformation and refranchising, is growing still at a point ahead of the total company currently -- consolidated number; which is at 4%, which is within our sort of long-term growth target that we've espoused to and talked about. I think that's also not -- maybe a micro metric but certainly an important metric to consider in terms of the payback on also all the activity.

I think the trends on unit cases, and let me just put out another way of looking at it, are -- have started at the beginning of the year.",358,"Sure. Let me start. I don't think any of the unit case pressure in the second quarter was due to the reorganization. I think the trends on unit cases, and let me just put out another way of looking at it, are -- have started at the beginning of the year. I think it's probably one of the few times we've seen the developed and our developing countries grow volume and actually seen the emerging markets decline in aggregate. I know we only put out the numbers by groups, but I mean, if you look at developed economies and developing economies, you see volume growth in both those blocks of countries. So in the end, our business, when you take the segmented roles, we've got volume growth and price/mix growth in developed and developing countries, which is very positive in terms of the long-term trajectory of the business. North America has got multi-years of making that work at a revenue line, so that's very strong. The volume weakness is all in the emerging markets, and it's all concentrated in a few of the emerging markets. It's big in some of those markets, but it's very concentrated. And the people then, on the country levels are all largely still the same and working on these problems. So hopefully that gives you a little insight on where the volume weakness is. So I don't think that has anything to do with the reorganization. In fact, I think the reorganization is helping us bring some refreshed views and some experience on what to do in emerging market weakness going forward in the downhill this year and into the future. And then on the price/mix, 3% is a good result. I think we've always talked about our long-term growth model calls for 4% to 6% revenue growth, and we see a balanced split between volume and price/mix into the future. So that gives you a 2% to 3% for price/mix as the component of long-term growth model. So 3% is a strong result. Long may it live. For the long-term growth model, we're looking for 4% to 6% in a balanced way."

I'm not a big fan of calling out weather as the driver of performance. The weather occurs, for good or for bad, all around the world. Now in the case of Spain and also France, the kind of that end of the Mediterranean, it was particularly poor in the middle part of the quarter. So that's really what's driving -- what's going on in the Spanish business, and also it impacted the French business. So we see Europe getting a little bit better. I mean, we had some good results out of Germany and, as you said, some sequential improvement out of GB cycling out of some of the supply chain problems and -- as they got fixed that came out of the first quarter. So we see that starting to improve going forward, but I think -- I hate calling out the weather, but I think that's really the reason in Spain and France, and I think we'll start to see those businesses get better. Now it is worth saying that we got a lot of good programs in Europe, but the recent tragic events in Belgium, in France and recently in Germany, do weigh on consumer sentiment and consumer behavior. They go out less, and we have strong on-premise businesses, in fact, particularly in Spain. And that is being dragged down as people respond to some of these tragic events by, perhaps, staying at home a little more. Now that hopefully will get better in time as the security situation improves, but I don't want to say -- I don't want to get into weather and global events. I think the business in Europe can get better. We've got a lot of launches coming up, and we've got some strong programs. I think Europe can continue to perform."

And going forward, certainly, we expect some improvement in that area, so that's number one. Number two, I think important to note that, again, mentioned that developed markets grew and developing markets grew volume and were ahead of the total company number, which was flat and ahead of emerging markets. That, itself, will tell you that, certainly, the price/mix coming from those markets and then the total mix of -- geographic mix that coupled with that is something that was instrumental in driving our price/mix number in the way it landed in the quarter. So all of those factors and algebras, all the algebra coming together is what made that; the country mix coming out of that, the geographic mix and then the volume, coupled with the pricing that we got. And today, when you look at our U.S. business, with 4% organic revenue growth in North America, that tells you that is in the upper -- certainly, in very much in the upper quartile of all large consumer businesses in the country.

So as James said, pricing of 2% to 3% is what we expect and what we would think would be very good pricing and in line with our segmentation strategy. And we -- even though EAG was probably more than kind of out of its normal range at this point with North America is still -- pricing is still very strong. So we do believe in the segment strategy, and the 2%, 3% should -- is kind of what we expect going forward."

We're still expecting robust growth in the industry in the long term, driven by the disposable income, urbanization in the middle class, innovation. We see -- and we see these things expanding. Now in the -- now that we've talked about that being in the 5% sort of ballpark and then probably in the kind of the next few years talked about it being in the 4%. So we do see it coming back over time, but we do see industry growth slightly moderated in the short term as we talked a little bit about in some of the previous conferences. Now you did ask the question, we've kind of [indiscernible], I think I would -- give me a second to just reunderline from our point of view, the biggest mechanical impact in the quarter and the year-to-date is this asymmetry between our own bottlers and where it is less than 20% of the volume or about 20% of the volume versus being in 200 countries. I mean, if you parse the bottling side and just look at the core concentrator franchise, we're organic running at 4%, and we're meeting our profit guidance. So we're not kind of trying to say, ""Small ups and downs in the macro economy is what should buffet us every quarter."" We just need to deal with those things. I just think that this one asymmetrical effect at the bottling thing, which is kind of important, which is affecting the number. But I don't want to give the impression we're seeing a massive or trying to signal a deterioration in our outlook for the concentrated franchise business. Now with regard to Coke FEMSA, yes, we've talked about looking at some territories on a preferred basis. I'm not going to get into exactly how that means in terms of what preferred means versus exclusive, et cetera. but they are our biggest bottling partner. We have a very strong relationship. We've made an agreement on how we're going to create more value together in Mexico and how they can look to participate in some of the refranchising as a bottling owned -- the territories that we own in bottling, and we're very excited about doing more stuff together."

Today, I will touch briefly on a few key highlights in the quarter before handing off to James to provide a more detailed review of our operational performance. 
During the quarter, we continued our progress towards transforming our company to a higher margin and return business, focused on our core value creation model of building strong brands, enhancing customer value and leading our franchise system. Our continued focus on our 5 strategic initiatives enabled us to deliver another quarter of global value share gains while delivering 3% organic revenue growth in a worsening macroeconomic environment. Importantly, our segmented revenue growth strategies drove 3 points of price/mix in the quarter. Further, our strong focus on productivity was instrumental in expanding operating profit margins and delivering our profit target. While we are pleased with -- we accelerated our price/mix from 1% last quarter to 3% this quarter, our volumes and topline results still fell short of our expectations. This was largely due to a weakening demand in certain large emerging and developing markets, which also impacted our company-owned bottling operations revenue growth. 
Within our Bottling Investment segment, positive pricing at our North American bottler was offset by challenges in our China bottling operations, resulting in even organic revenues for our company-owned bottling operations globally. However, our core franchise operations continued to perform well, growing organic revenues a full point ahead of our consolidated organic revenues and in line with our long-term targets. Despite weaker conditions in several emerging and developing markets, we continued to see a positive return on our marketing investments, with solid performance in key markets such as the United States, Japan and Mexico, which James will touch on in more detail. While the macroeconomic headwinds we are facing in these emerging and developing markets are cyclical in nature and not secular downturns, we are not expecting a material improvement in the remainder of the year, given the continuing volatility in the global economy. This outlook, coupled with where we are year-to-date, will make achieving our previous 4% to 5% organic revenue growth rate very challenging. Therefore, we are lowering our outlook for full year consolidated organic revenue growth. James and Kathy will discuss this in greater detail later on the call. 
With that being said, we remain fully committed and confident in achieving our underlying profit target despite this challenging environment. We are also confident that our core organic revenue growth will continue to perform our consolidated organic -- continue to outperform our consolidated organic revenue growth by a full point. Finally, we remain on track with our refranchising efforts, and we are confident we will complete those efforts by the end of 2017.
Over the past few months, we successfully completed the Coca-Cola European Partners and Coca-Cola Beverages Africa transactions announced the transfer of certain territories in the United States to Arca Continental UNITED venture and reached a new understanding with Coca-Cola FEMSA regarding joint value creation in Mexico and certain territorial expansion opportunities for company-owned bottling operations, which was announced just this morning. As we work through the comprehensive refranchising and near macro -- near-term macro challenges, we will emerge a much stronger company with higher margins and returns and better positions to deliver on our long-term growth targets. 
I will now hand the call over to James, who'll provide you with a more detailed look at our operating performance."
26642,369430152,1014788,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. As Muhtar said, our consolidated volume and revenue results came in below our expectations. So let me first talk about where, why and what we're doing about that.Our volume deceleration from the first quarter w",1054,"Thank you, Muhtar. Good morning, everyone. As Muhtar said, our consolidated volume and revenue results came in below our expectations. So let me first talk about where, why and what we're doing about that.
Our volume deceleration from the first quarter was concentrated in a number -- a few number of markets facing specific macroeconomic challenges. Firstly, China, but also Argentina and Venezuela. The slowdown in our consolidated organic revenue versus our core organic revenue, which grew 4%, the consolidated slowdown was due to our bottling investment slowdown -- segment slowdown. It's the mechanical effect of owning both bottling operations as well as concentrate operations in certain challenged markets. BIG slowdown was principally driven by the challenges the industry -- the broad industry is facing in China. So let's start with China. And what are we doing about it? 
There are 3 factors impacting our performance in China. First, no question, the overall consumer environment is weakening due to the economy's -- economic transition. Secondly, as this is occurring, wholesalers are adjusting to lower expected sales growth and bringing down inventory levels, which has a whiplash effect on our bottler sales. Third, there are some category mix shifts occurring as different consumer segments respond to these new circumstances. For example, juice and juice drinks category is the weakest performing, whereas premium water is stronger and positive. So there is an opportunity here to both innovate with more premium products positioned for the higher income, new mainstream consumer segment as well as opportunities to address strong affordability needs across the rural and blue collar areas.
So I guess, importantly, perhaps most importantly, what are we doing about it? Firstly, we've got a number of new premiumizing offers across multiple categories we compete in being launched. We're also focusing on better execution, particularly, in the second tier and rural areas, where they serve more of the mass consumer segment and upping the game in terms of affordable offerings. We are also rebasing the way we approach trade incentives to drive better performance with wholesaler and from our own distributors.
Now despite these actions to improve our business, we still expect our China operation to be under pressure for the remainder of the year. This is a key factor driving the organic revenue outlook, particularly the difference between consolidated and core. But I think it is worth finally making a note that we are keeping a long-term perspective with regard to China. We always knew that for a country as large as China, transitioning to a consumer-led economy was going to have its challenges. Those may have turned out to be more than what we expected in the short term. However, we absolutely believe in the long-term opportunity of this market of 1.4 billion consumers, with relatively low beverage per capita as compared to the global average. 
Okay, so that's China. Let's move for a second to our core business. The core business, understood as the concentrate and the franchising business, this is where we grew organic revenues 4% for the first half of the year, as segmented revenue growth strategies continue to drive positive results. Yes, some markets are tough, but others are doing very well. Let me start, perhaps, with the more challenging markets. I've already touched on China, so let me move to a couple of the other ones I name checked earlier. 
Argentina. We believe that the Argentinian government is taking the right steps to secure its economic recovery, but this is resulting in a contraction in the near term that accelerated in the second quarter, therefore, impacting our business. 
In Venezuela, severe shortages in certain raw materials resulted in us temporarily suspending production at the bottling partner's plants during the quarter, clearly impacting the results. 
Additionally, Brazil, the challenges there are well understood and, we think, will continue for the remainder of the year. However, we are focusing on key affordability packages and activating a strong Olympic marketing campaign in the coming weeks and months.
We have lived through downturns before in emerging and developing markets and understand how to manage the business in these circumstances. It requires a disciplined approach to pricing relative to inflation and, of course, where necessary, aggressively moving to address consumer dynamics through adjusting the portfolio, both in terms of affordability and product innovation. But as I said earlier, not every market is under pressure. In markets with relatively stable economies, we are executing our strategies and seeing strong results. For example, in North America, we grew organic revenues 4% in the quarter, reflecting continued pricing initiatives for our sparkling business as well as the ongoing strength of our stills portfolio. In Mexico and Japan, we're delivering strong performance across our portfolio, driven heavily by innovation. 
And turning to some of the emerging markets. In Southeast Asia, we are growing volume double digits year-to-date behind strong integrated marketing and commercial initiatives across the core brands and key entry-level packaging.
Taken together, these results give us confidence that in stable markets where we increase our investments in marketing innovation, combined with improving marketplace execution, we can continue to deliver strong performance. 
Ultimately, we operate in over 200 countries, and there will always be some markets with macro challenges. Our ability to grow doesn't require macro perfection. In fact, even with this current broader macro adjustment phase in a good number of emerging markets, our segmented revenue growth strategies are enabling us to capture solid pricing of 3% year-to-date for our core operations on top of 1% volume growth. And we are using the productivity to prudently fund marketing where there is momentum and where we see a solid payback, but we're also holding on and making sure that we can use it to deliver strong underlying margin expansion. These actions have enabled us to grow underlying profit before tax, in line with our expectations for the first half of the year and despite more challenging conditions than we initially expected. 
So let me conclude by saying we are confident in our growth strategies. We continue to push in markets where we see success and proactively address those markets that are more challenged, of course, while always keeping an eye on the long term. 
So with that, let me hand over to Kathy to take you through the numbers."
26642,369430152,1014788,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to touch quickly on our financial performance in the quarter before providing our full year outlook. Starting at the top line. Our organic revenue growth was impacted about 1 point by our segment mi",589,"Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to touch quickly on our financial performance in the quarter before providing our full year outlook. 
Starting at the top line. Our organic revenue growth was impacted about 1 point by our segment mix, as our Bottling Investment segment grew slower than our core business. At gross profit, our comparable margin declined 20 basis points due to currency and structural headwind. Excluding the effect of these items, our underlying gross margin expanded over a 100 basis points, driven by solid pricing, a slightly favorable cost environment, productivity and segment mix. Our comparable operating margin improved about 50 basis points. Similar to gross margin, currency and structural headwinds impacted our operating margin. Excluding the effect of these items, our underlying operating margin increased about 180 basis points in the quarter due to gross margin expansion as well as the timing of productivity savings and certain expenses. 
Now turning to outlook. As Muhtar mentioned, we are revising our full year top line target. For the full year, we now expect 3% organic revenue growth. With that said, we are confident our strategies will deliver stronger organic growth for our core business. And we are maintaining our full year underlying profit target as we continue to manage our business. Therefore, we expect to deliver comparable currency neutral ex-structural income before tax growth of 6% to 8%, in line with our long-term target.
Through the first half of the year, we generated strong underlying operating leverage. Consistent with our previously provided guidance, we expect this to moderate as we begin to cycle more difficult comparisons in the back half of this year.
Coca-Cola European Partners closed about a month earlier than we estimated in our previous structural guidance, and we continue to move faster with our refranchising efforts in North America. Therefore, we are updating our full year structural outlook. We now expect a 6- to 7-point structural headwind on net revenue and a 4-point headwind on income before tax. Our currency outlook remains the same, as our previous guidance, a 2- to 3-point headwind on net revenue and an 8- to 9-point headwind on income before tax. So taking all of this into consideration, we expect full year comparable EPS to decline 4% to 7%.
And there are a few phasing items to consider when constructing your models. Our fourth quarter has 2 additional days as compared to last year, which will result in stronger top line growth in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. In addition, the 2 additional days in the fourth quarter, coupled with what we are cycling in SG&A in the third quarter of last year, means operating leverage will skew strongly into the fourth quarter. Therefore, we expect virtually all of our growth in comparable currency neutral ex-structural income before tax to come in the fourth quarter. We expect structural items to be a 9-point headwind on net revenue and a 3-point headwind on income before tax in the third quarter. Finally, we expect currency to be a 2-point headwind on net revenue and a 2- to 3-point headwind on income before tax in the third quarter.
In closing, our strategies are working in key markets. We are on track to deliver over $600 million in productivity this year. And we continue to accelerate our refranchising efforts. While our expectations for top line growth have softened, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our profit target this year.

And I'm guessing it cost you roughly 1 point of unit case volume in the quarter as well. So first, is that right? But more importantly, is there a way to parse how much of the adverse impact is tied to the macro slowing, which I think is more likely to persist versus supply chain corrections and wholesaler inventory destockings, which might hopefully be more transitory? I guess, I'm really trying to assess just how much of a headwind China was in Q2 and then how severe you expect the ongoing headwind to be, acknowledging the improvement initiatives that you called out. And then finally, do the issues facing BIG in China impede, at all, your ability to refranchise that market on time and on favorable terms?"

So -- okay, let me try and get the China, and let me start from the top and work downwards, if I may. I mean, firstly, it's clear that when you look at the Coke company, almost half our revenue comes from bottling versus the other half comes from concentrate and franchise. But given, as you all know that a bottling business comes with 4 to 5 times more revenue per drink sold and the accompanying cost, any effect on the revenue of the bottler is going to have a magnified impact on revenue and much less on profits, which is part of this dynamic. So in China, it's our largest international bottling operation. We own bottlers that are roughly 20% of the global business, but the biggest one outside the U.S. is China. So that's where it's coming from, and it's the mechanical impact of being hit in China where we own about 1/3 of the system, thus creating that whole difference between the 3% and the 4%. And what we've assumed in our outlook, just to be more confident -- clear in our confidence going forward, is we have not really assumed that China is going to get better in the rest of the year. So if it did, that'd be great, but we are assuming it's not in terms of our outlook and guidance, but obviously, we are working to try and make it better. Now as I said, what's changing in -- as you kind of try to split the difference, what's changing is both the consumer and the supply chain. I think, in round numbers, from a revenue perspective, you got about half the impact coming from the consumer and half coming from the supply chain. What's happening on the consumer, you can see it in the scan Nielsen and the nonscan Nielsen is probably a bit worse than the scan Nielsen in terms of slowdown in sellout to the consumers of all types of FMCG categories, so it is a kind of a broad-based consumer slowdown. Within that, from a beverage point of view, you got juice drinks and juices, which were kind of more for the rural areas in blue color, they are down double digits in terms of revenue from a consumer point of view. Something like Coke is down low single digits, and premium waters is growing. So there is a shift in the category mix going on, which is also actually impacts revenue because juice drink prices tend to be higher than sparkling or water, so that doesn't flow through to profitability. So there is a kind of a rebasing going on in there. But as I said, about half of it's the supply chain, the whiplash effect of the destocking by the customers. And that, as you say, is likely to be a much shorter term impact. But again, we're working on it, but we're not including an improvement in that in our outlook, although, clearly, we want to get focused on it and get it to work. I agree with you, the consumer will -- thing will take a little more time to come back, which is why we're focused on our kind of the game plan we know that works in downturns, where we focus on affordability, on premiumizing for those parts of the country like the premium metro areas and bringing out new products for them, and that way, we believe we can gain value share, which we continue to do in China, so that we are set up as the consumer starts recovering. So about half and half, and we believe that the consumer will come back and the supply chain will sort itself out in the relative short term in the rest of this year. Now with regards to the refranchising, obviously, can't really comment on the M&A, but I would say that we and our partners all believe in the long-term potential of the China market. We're very excited. And as I said, because a large part of what's happening in the short term is destocking in inventory, everyone's looking past that and looking to the long term, and I think there is still good motivation and animation by everyone to get the deal done. And we'll obviously, from our point of view,  make sure we do it on the right terms for ourselves and they'll be looking for the right terms for them. But we still think it's the right deal for everyone and with a good likelihood of getting done."

I think, perhaps, that's 2 questions in the second questions there, Ali. Let me have a go. Look, in terms of reassessing the action, that's both on the places with momentum and the places that are suffering. There are -- there are parts of the business that are growing strongly, whether that's at one end of the spectrum like the U.S. and Japan, where we've got good momentum. I mean the U.S. grew organically 4% in the quarter; Japan is growing well. We are increasing the amount of spend as we see the tailwinds and the effectiveness of the marketing, innovation and the execution. So we're reallocating money to the places that have momentum, and that's on the developed end like the U.S. and Japan. It's also on the emerging end like Indonesia, and the Philippines and places like that. So we're going where we see the opportunity to get the biggest bang for the buck. Now we're taking some of the money from those markets that are under most pressure, and in those places, we're prioritizing, yes, there's still some advertising, but we're doing innovations and we're doing execution and very importantly we're doing affordability. So the most extreme example, perhaps, is Venezuela, where there was no sugar, and then we've actually double downed and really driving Coke with -- Coke with 0 sugar in Venezuela with the kind of a full red one-brand look. So there are places where we are adjusting to the need that it's not -- just because you advertise, doesn't mean people are going to buy, if it's an affordability problem. And I think China is a good example where affordability is in there as well, I think, I've talked a bit about China. But the game plan that we've used in those emerging markets under pressure, we're really rolling out. So that reassessing is moving some top line money to those with momentum and doubling down on execution and affordability and innovation in those pressured markets. And that kind of goes a bit to the advertising. Advertising is up this quarter, as we continue to see the value of advertising as part of the marketing mix in combination with innovation and execution. It's only when you get all of those together that you really get the best returns. So we always look to make sure that all 3 are there, otherwise, we'll end up wasting our money. So we're out there, and we're pushing ahead with this, and I think what we always have said is that advertising takes some time to work. So for example, the one-brand strategy that we launched -- announced in the first quarter, we started the rollout. The latest iteration of the graphics went into Mexico a couple of months ago. That's going to -- that sort of marketing innovation takes time to build upon effects. So we'll keep pressing away with the investment and keep assessing it. It's too early to call it a success. We do that towards the end of the year, but we are focused on making that work."

I think that's also not -- maybe a micro metric but certainly an important metric to consider in terms of the payback on also all the activity.

I don't think any of the unit case pressure in the second quarter was due to the reorganization. I think the trends on unit cases, and let me just put out another way of looking at it, are -- have started at the beginning of the year.",358,"Sure. Let me start. I don't think any of the unit case pressure in the second quarter was due to the reorganization. I think the trends on unit cases, and let me just put out another way of looking at it, are -- have started at the beginning of the year. I think it's probably one of the few times we've seen the developed and our developing countries grow volume and actually seen the emerging markets decline in aggregate. I know we only put out the numbers by groups, but I mean, if you look at developed economies and developing economies, you see volume growth in both those blocks of countries. So in the end, our business, when you take the segmented roles, we've got volume growth and price/mix growth in developed and developing countries, which is very positive in terms of the long-term trajectory of the business. North America has got multi-years of making that work at a revenue line, so that's very strong. The volume weakness is all in the emerging markets, and it's all concentrated in a few of the emerging markets. It's big in some of those markets, but it's very concentrated. And the people then, on the country levels are all largely still the same and working on these problems. So hopefully that gives you a little insight on where the volume weakness is. So I don't think that has anything to do with the reorganization. In fact, I think the reorganization is helping us bring some refreshed views and some experience on what to do in emerging market weakness going forward in the downhill this year and into the future. And then on the price/mix, 3% is a good result. I think we've always talked about our long-term growth model calls for 4% to 6% revenue growth, and we see a balanced split between volume and price/mix into the future. So that gives you a 2% to 3% for price/mix as the component of long-term growth model. So 3% is a strong result. Long may it live. For the long-term growth model, we're looking for 4% to 6% in a balanced way."

I'm not a big fan of calling out weather as the driver of performance. The weather occurs, for good or for bad, all around the world. Now in the case of Spain and also France, the kind of that end of the Mediterranean, it was particularly poor in the middle part of the quarter. So that's really what's driving -- what's going on in the Spanish business, and also it impacted the French business. So we see Europe getting a little bit better. I mean, we had some good results out of Germany and, as you said, some sequential improvement out of GB cycling out of some of the supply chain problems and -- as they got fixed that came out of the first quarter. So we see that starting to improve going forward, but I think -- I hate calling out the weather, but I think that's really the reason in Spain and France, and I think we'll start to see those businesses get better. Now it is worth saying that we got a lot of good programs in Europe, but the recent tragic events in Belgium, in France and recently in Germany, do weigh on consumer sentiment and consumer behavior. They go out less, and we have strong on-premise businesses, in fact, particularly in Spain. And that is being dragged down as people respond to some of these tragic events by, perhaps, staying at home a little more. Now that hopefully will get better in time as the security situation improves, but I don't want to say -- I don't want to get into weather and global events. I think the business in Europe can get better. We've got a lot of launches coming up, and we've got some strong programs. I think Europe can continue to perform."

All of those emerging markets that use to have better disposable incomes, better macro conditions basically drove some of that. And going forward, certainly, we expect some improvement in that area, so that's number one. Number two, I think important to note that, again, mentioned that developed markets grew and developing markets grew volume and were ahead of the total company number, which was flat and ahead of emerging markets. That, itself, will tell you that, certainly, the price/mix coming from those markets and then the total mix of -- geographic mix that coupled with that is something that was instrumental in driving our price/mix number in the way it landed in the quarter. So all of those factors and algebras, all the algebra coming together is what made that; the country mix coming out of that, the geographic mix and then the volume, coupled with the pricing that we got. And today, when you look at our U.S. business, with 4% organic revenue growth in North America, that tells you that is in the upper -- certainly, in very much in the upper quartile of all large consumer businesses in the country. We are doing very, very well. Japan performed well. Again, Mexico performed very well in terms of the volume and pricing combined, driving the total number. And so -- of price/mix.

And we -- even though EAG was probably more than kind of out of its normal range at this point with North America is still -- pricing is still very strong.

We're still expecting robust growth in the industry in the long term, driven by the disposable income, urbanization in the middle class, innovation. We see -- and we see these things expanding. Now in the -- now that we've talked about that being in the 5% sort of ballpark and then probably in the kind of the next few years talked about it being in the 4%. So we do see it coming back over time, but we do see industry growth slightly moderated in the short term as we talked a little bit about in some of the previous conferences. Now you did ask the question, we've kind of [indiscernible], I think I would -- give me a second to just reunderline from our point of view, the biggest mechanical impact in the quarter and the year-to-date is this asymmetry between our own bottlers and where it is less than 20% of the volume or about 20% of the volume versus being in 200 countries. I mean, if you parse the bottling side and just look at the core concentrator franchise, we're organic running at 4%, and we're meeting our profit guidance. So we're not kind of trying to say, ""Small ups and downs in the macro economy is what should buffet us every quarter."" We just need to deal with those things. I just think that this one asymmetrical effect at the bottling thing, which is kind of important, which is affecting the number. But I don't want to give the impression we're seeing a massive or trying to signal a deterioration in our outlook for the concentrated franchise business. Now with regard to Coke FEMSA, yes, we've talked about looking at some territories on a preferred basis. I'm not going to get into exactly how that means in terms of what preferred means versus exclusive, et cetera. but they are our biggest bottling partner. We have a very strong relationship. We've made an agreement on how we're going to create more value together in Mexico and how they can look to participate in some of the refranchising as a bottling owned -- the territories that we own in bottling, and we're very excited about doing more stuff together."

Today, I'll touch briefly on a few key highlights before handing off to James to provide a more detailed operational review of our performance. 
I'm pleased to report that we delivered third quarter results in line with our expectations and we're on track to deliver against our full year expectations. Our continued focus on our 5 strategic initiatives enabled us to report another quarter of global value share gains with 3% organic revenue growth and over 50 basis points of comparable currency-neutral operating margin expansion. 
Our core business continued to perform well, delivering 4% organic revenue growth year-to-date, in line with our long-term target, driven by our segmented revenue growth strategies, improving marketing and portfolio diversification. Within our core business, developed markets performed well, delivering solid revenue results with 2% unit case volume growth year-to-date and a continued focus on price realization. While we continue to see challenges in many emerging and developing markets, we're taking action to improve our performance. Importantly, we're delivering the profit target we laid out at the beginning of the year. Excluding the impact of structural items, comparable currency-neutral income before tax grew 7% year-to-date. And we're confident we will deliver our full year profit outlook of 6% to 8% growth, excluding these same items. 
We continue our journey of transforming our company to a higher-margin and higher-return business focused on building strong brands, enhancing customer value and leading a strong, dedicated, global franchise system. This quarter, we continued to make solid progress to strengthen and evolve our global system. In North America, we signed definitive agreements on 6 territories and closed transactions on 4 territories, thereby remaining on track to complete our refranchising efforts in our flagship market by the end of 2017.
In Japan, our 2 largest bottlers, Coca-Cola West and Coca-Cola East Japan, reached a definitive agreement to merge their operations and create a strong, consolidated bottler representing over 85% of our system volume in Japan. In Latin America, we reached a long-term comprehensive agreement with Arca Continental regarding joint value creation in Mexico, along with a similar agreement with FEMSA in July. Separately, Coca-Cola FEMSA reached agreement to acquire Vonpar, one of the largest privately owned bottlers in the Brazilian Coca-Cola system, increasing its scale and leveraging FEMSA's strong commercial capabilities. 
In Europe, Coca-Cola European Partners finished its full quarter of operations as a combined company and we're executing in the line plan. And finally, in Africa, we recently exercised our call option to acquire ABI's stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa. We have a number of partners who are highly interested in and qualified for these bottling territories, and we intend to implement our long-term strategic plan for these markets. Over the coming months, we will negotiate the terms of the transaction with ABI, followed by a regulatory approval process. Simultaneously, we have commenced discussions with potential partners and plan to complete this important process as soon as feasible. 
When I take a step back and think about the magnitude of change we had implemented over the past couple of years, I am truly encouraged. We have implemented segmented revenue growth strategies for our markets, invested in capabilities and created clear incentives for the entire organization to drive revenue growth rather than volume only. We're shaping our brand portfolio across the full range of sparkling and still beverage categories to meet changing consumer needs through leading marketing, innovation and targeted M&A, which James will discuss in more details.
We launched ""Taste the Feeling"", a new marketing campaign for Trademark Coca-Cola at the beginning of the year and are seeing positive response from our consumers and customers. And through our ongoing $3 billion productivity initiative, we are taking costs out to both reinvest in the business and drive margin expansion. And as I have discussed, we are rearchitecting the bottling system in key geographies and regions to better capture growth. To put it in perspective, these affected regions account for almost half of our global volume. So the actions we're taking today are going to have significant impact on our system's future performance. Through these actions, we are becoming a much stronger company with higher margins and returns and better positioned to deliver on our long-term growth targets. 
I will now hand the call over to James, who will provide you with a more detailed outlook at our operating performance."

As Muhtar said, we continue to implement our 5 strategic actions for growth. And we're making the necessary changes to have the speed, agility and the focused leadership needed to win today and into the future. 
So before I jump into the results, as you know, we made a number of changes to our operating leadership structure during the quarter. I'd like to say these transitions occurred seamlessly, a testament to our leaders and associates. And these new leaders are bringing a fresh perspective and are working diligently to identify opportunities to accelerate our performance around the world.
Now let me turn to the results. I'd like to talk to you about these through 2 lenses: firstly, the traditional operating results in the quarter somewhat seen by geography; and second, how we continue to evolve our brand marketing and portfolio to stay relevant and meet consumer preferences. 
So our performance in the quarter. Our results were in line with our expectations with 3% organic revenue growth and 2% underlying income before tax growth. Our core business grew organic revenue 3% in the quarter. And as we expected, given the strong growth that we're cycling from the third quarter last year, it's important to note that year-to-date, our core operations continue to grow organic revenue 4% and we remain on track to deliver this performance for the full year.
Our company-owned bottling operations grew organic revenue 2% in the quarter, an acceleration from the first half of the year, driven by North American bottling and an improvement in China. Unit case volume grew 1%, cycling a pretty strong 3% from last year and an acceleration from last quarter, due largely in part to the return to growth in China and a stronger performance in our Western European business. It's worth saying that the macro challenges persist in certain emerging markets, particularly, for example, Argentina and Venezuela negatively impacting consolidated unit case volume growth by 1 point.
So turning and looking around the world. We continue to push hard where we have momentum, take actions where needed and manage through some of the difficult operating conditions. So we continue to do well in a number of key markets with momentum, including places like North America, Mexico and Japan, and so seek to further advance our strategies. For example, North America, we grew organic revenue 3% as we continue to successfully implement both our accelerated refranchising program while delivering top-tier growth among FMCG companies in the U.S. The strength and breadth of our full brand portfolio led to value share gains in both sparkling and still beverages. So that actually overall, we captured 40% of NARTD beverage retail sales growth year-to-date. Also as I said, we did well in Japan and Mexico. And both benefited from strong marketing and innovation as the combination of the ""One Brand"" strategy and new product launches drove continued solid performance.
Turning to some of the other key markets. We saw improved performance in the quarter. Our actions are starting to bear fruit, but we still have more to do. In China, we returned to growth, driven by strong activation of our Olympic campaign, improved execution and frankly, better weather. Our system has largely worked through the wholesale inventory issue. And we are continuing to innovate across the business towards the premium segment with examples like the launch of ZICO Coconut Water through the e-commerce channel. But also at the same time, we're paying proper attention to the mass consumer segment. There, we are driving the availability of entry-level small packs, such as the 300-milliliter bottle, to address affordability issues as the economy remains challenging and we expect continued near-term volatility. Another key market that got better, Western Europe. Solid marketing, innovation and commercial plans with the increased alignment with the new CCEP in its first full quarter as a new company and again a little bit of good weather resulted in strong performance in the quarter with our system gaining both value and volume share. 
Now while some markets -- while we're moving quickly in several markets and seeing success, it's true that we still compete in a number of markets with challenging macroeconomic conditions. The economic environment in Russia is improving slightly as the price of oil stabilizes. However, Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela all remain difficult operating environments for consumer products companies. Therefore, we will continue to concentrate on what we can control. In Brazil and Argentina, we are focused on affordability by maintaining key consumer price points while evolving our price pack architecture to protect our market share. And in Venezuela, we are addressing raw material shortages by rapidly scaling the availability of our Zero Sugar portfolio. 
Now as we look at this quarter but also at the future, I'd like to build on what I've shared in the past about our productivity efforts and evolving revenue growth strategies with an update on our growing and evolving brand portfolio. Of course, we recognize that consumer taste and preferences change and are changing. And we are building a strong, diversified brand portfolio across sparkling and the stills categories to meet these needs, including through internal innovation, bolt-on acquisitions and a lift-and-shift geographic expansion model.
If you look at our still portfolio today, it includes 14 of our 20 billion-dollar brands with #1 or #2 positions in juice, coffee, water, tea and sports drinks categories. Year-to-date, our systems sold 5.8 billion incremental servings of our stills brands, capturing over 25% of the value growth in stills globally. This performance has been driven by action around the world to expand our stills businesses. For example, take our Japan business, which has one of our most diversified portfolios. On top of good growth in our sparkling brands, we continue to drive strong performance across multiple categories through innovations like new premium packaging for our GEORGIA Coffee brand, a new line extension of our Ayataka tea brand and new flavors of our premium I LOHAS water brand. 
In the U.S., we extended smartwater into sparkling water. We revamped the packaging graphics on DASANI Sparkling, resulting in retail value growth of over 80% in the quarter for these 2 products. We expanded the Honest Tea trademark into juice drinks with Honest Kids becoming the #1 organic juice drink chosen for kids. We see ready-to-drink coffee as an important growth category in the U.S. Today, we are the global leader in ready-to-drink coffee category with strong positions in Japan and Korea. So we are leveraging on this strength and launching Gold Peak ready-to-drink cold brew coffee and Dunkin' Donuts branded ready-to-drink coffee to begin capturing this opportunity in our flagship market.
In Europe, we're expanding our stills portfolio by lifting our smartwater and Honest Tea brands from the U.S. and shifting them to Europe. We are also leveraging strong existing brands. For example, we are expanding geographically Innocent, our very successful premium juice and smoothie business, into a strong regional brand but also extending VIO, our popular water brand in Germany into juice drinks and sparkling lemonades. This has resulted in strong double-digit volume growth year-to-date for both brands. 
And finally, bolt-on M&A and investments, when available, will continue to be a part of our portfolio expansion strategy, particularly in the value-added dairy and plant protein beverage spaces. We are pleased by the early results of fairlife in the U.S. and Santa Clara in Mexico. And we look forward to closing our acquisition of plant-based brand, AdeS, in Latin America in early 2017.
Now turning to our sparkling business. I'd like to talk a little bit about how we're doing things differently. We are evolving our sparkling portfolio strategy so that we can grow while reducing sugar consumption. Through these actions, we've been able to outpace the category that is growing retail value by 3% for the first 9 months of the year. So let me give you a few examples of how we're doing this. 
First, our ""Taste the Feeling"" marketing campaign is engaging consumers with better advertising around both the extrinsics and intrinsics of the brand. Second, we're also providing more sugar-free options. In several markets around the world, we have launched Coca-Cola Zero Sugar with a new and improved taste as well as a new visual identity system under our ""One Brand"" strategy. And this is contributing high single-digit volume growth for this brand globally in the quarter. Take GB, for example. While we're only 12 weeks in, we've seen a significant expansion in the consumption versus the former Coke Zero product, resulting in strong double-digit volume growth for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar during the quarter. And we are rolling this out, this new and improved product out, across other European markets. 
More broadly, we've been taking multiple actions to shape choice to address changing consumer preferences around added sugar while working proactively with governments to provide positive solutions. We've been driving a systematic reformulation effort across our portfolio to reduce added sugar while delivering superior consumer taste and improving margins. For example, we currently have over 200 reformulation initiatives underway to reduce added sugar. And so an example of where that might take us as a step forward, in GB, for example, we reduced the sugar and the calories in brands such as Sprite and Fanta by 30%. In our Latin Center business unit, we've reduced the sugar content in almost 2/3 of our flavored sparkling beverages.
And then in combination with this reformulation and innovation effort, we have also focused on small pack sizes, a great way to enjoy a drink with less calories. These packs can provide both a premium experience as well as being affordable yet profitable way to bring people into the franchise. In Mexico, for example, small packs, such as our sleek can and 8-ounce glass bottle, are growing rapidly through both increased distribution and higher velocity per outlet. In China, our premium-priced sleek cans of Diet Coke and Coke Zero is growing strongly. And in India, where we recently launched our new lightweight, affordable PET bottle in just a few territories, we have already sold over 20 million servings. These actions and the results we are seeing give us confidence that we can further accelerate our sparkling business. 
So looking forward, we're working to grow by ensuring ongoing relevance and engagement with our existing brands while also expanding our brand portfolio so that we can meet consumer preferences. So as I think about the rest of the year from an operational's perspective, I, like Muhtar, am confident we will achieve our full year outlook. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Kathy to take you through the numbers."
26642,402974184,1061289,"The Coca-Cola Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","The Coca-Cola Company","Executives","Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to talk quickly about our financial performance in the quarter before moving on to our full year outlook.Starting at the top line. Organic revenue growth was driven equally by volume and price/mix.",505,"Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to talk quickly about our financial performance in the quarter before moving on to our full year outlook.
Starting at the top line. Organic revenue growth was driven equally by volume and price/mix. Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven both by rate and product mix initiatives across many of our markets, partially offset by 1 point of segment mix due to slower growth in our Bottling Investments Group than in our core concentrate operations. 
At gross profit, our comparable margin increased about 45 basis points as solid pricing, a slightly favorable cost environment and productivity was partially offset by about an 80 basis point currency headwind. Our North America refranchising roughly offset the benefit from deconsolidating our German and South Africa bottling operations, resulting in a slight structural benefit to margins. Excluding the effect of currency and structural items, our underlying gross margin expanded over 100 basis points. Our comparable operating margin declined about 35 basis points. Similar to gross margins, currency headwinds impacted our operating margins by about 90 basis points while structural items, primarily the deconsolidation of our German and South African bottling operations, positively impacted our operating margins. 
Turning to the cash flow. We continue to exercise strong cash flow management. Year-to-date, we have generated $6.7 billion in cash from operations. And we have returned $5.7 billion to shareowners through a combination of net share repurchases and $4.5 billion of dividends paid year-to-date. And that includes our third quarter dividend that was paid on October 3 right after our quarter closed. Net share repurchases year-to-date were $1.2 billion. And we continue to expect them to be $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the full year, in line with our initial guidance. 
Looking ahead to the remainder of the year with 1 quarter remaining, we continue to expect our full year comparable EPS to decline 4% to 7%, in line with our previously communicated expectations. However, we now expect to spend likely less than $2.5 billion on capital expenditures for the full year, down from our initial expectations of $2.5 billion to $3 billion. 
As you construct your models, there are a few items to consider for the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter has 2 additional days as compared to last year, which will result in stronger top line growth than we saw in the third quarter. We expect structural items to be an 11 point headwind on net revenue and a 6 to 7 point headwind on income before tax in the fourth quarter. And finally, we expect currency to be a 1 to 2 point headwind on net revenue and an 8 to 9 point headwind on income before tax in the fourth quarter.

Look, I think, first, once again, I want to reiterate the scale of what is being done here on a global basis. As I mentioned in my remarks, the geographies and the regions impacted by this refranchising, massive refranchising, is, really, when you aggregate it all, it's roughly around 50% of our -- will impact 50% of our global volumes. So this is really, really big, number one. Number two, the early indications that we have from both the U.S. refranchising efforts, which is the largest one, but also the European restructuring under Coca-Cola European Partners umbrella, is -- which was the biggest refranchising in Europe in history in its structure, essentially have been -- early indications have been positive. In the United States, if you look at it the last 6 quarters, consecutively, we've had volume growth and very encouraging price/mix in the United States continued. And the last sort of year, 4 quarters have been the highest in terms of refranchising activity. So early indications are positive. Europe, the same. James mentioned the positive numbers coming out of the last quarter, yet helped by many other things other than just refranchising. But the impact is that there hasn't been the disruption that's been going on very smoothly. And when you look at it going forward, we've got 4 to 5 quarters of intense refranchising remaining as we bring out the other end of the tunnel, a company that is going to be totally transformed, revitalized in terms of its organizational capability, leadership structure, revitalization of the brands under also with investment in our brands and the new marketing, revitalization of our portfolio, of our bottling system as well as our cost base. So we're encouraged with what we see as they transform Coca-Cola company coming out and also the integrity of the refranchising, as evidenced by the continued good results in North America and in Europe."

That's part of the unknown going forward at this stage and the uncertainty. I think, quite clearly, you see,  as Muhtar commented, a mixed bag. Across the world, you see those markets are doing well, sustained growth. You called out Nigeria, South Africa, the Philippines, other parts of the emerging markets. It's good. But it's a mixed bag, and I think the actions are underway in a number of these countries to stabilize them where they're a little tougher like Brazil, like Argentina, which are called out on the call earlier. And we'll have to see how long it takes to for this to take hold in the countries from a macro view. We don't have a clear sight on that, but what we do know is we need to focus on what we can control in those countries, go back to affordability, go back to execution, go back to the basics and build ourselves a better position with more market share so that when it does turn, and that combines with the growth in developed markets, we can be solidly in growth rates for our long-term model."

We focus on being competitive in each local market, beverage and fast-moving consumer goods industry, and especially when the economies are in tough times, focusing on staying competitive and gaining share for the long term. The net of all that means we're much more likely to follow or be close to local inflation rates rather than adopt the strategy of a full pass-through of the devaluation of the dollar. So obviously, if the exchange rates change, that'll mean different dollar numbers for the corporation, but the local strategy remains stay competitive in the marketplace, and it looks more like local inflation.

I mean, let me start by saying you're approximately right in volume trends on the current split between sparkling and stills, about 70-30. I think it's worth noting that, that split has been moving in the favor of sales by about a point a year. The turn of the century, 10, 15 years ago is a single digit% of the mix. So it's going up at about 1% a year. Now part of that is organic on the things we're doing. Part of that is the net of sum of the bolt-on acquisitions. That's going up about 1% a year of mix. I think, as you look forward, clearly, we -- given that we have 50% of the sparkling industry value share and 15% of the sum of all the stills categories value share, we fully expect to be able to grow faster in the stills categories because it will be the accommodation of the category growth rates, plus our ability to gain share, which then feeds into your third question, which is how are the investments aligned? I feel they're aligned. Obviously, it's an ongoing process. Each year, we look at it in the business planning process, and what we're doing that again this year. But I would not characterize it as we're overinvested in sparkling and underinvested in stills. We're invested behind what's growing. And actually, just to add a little more texture to it, we're doing the right thing in sparkling, and we tend to be pushing more money towards driving zeros, the lights, the smaller packages in the sparkling business. In the stills, it's not a one-size-fits-all category. It's actually [indiscernible]. We're selective on which ones have a most on trend with the consumers, which ones have more premium pricing.

North America, I think, is a combination of many, many things. I mean, it's, I think, being the result of a number of years working on multiple fronts, working on innovation across the portfolio, getting into categories, refining the propositions, learning, refining the propositions. It's about, in the sparkling business, the better marketing, the more media spend. It's about the focus on the pricing and packaging architecture with more smaller packages. It's about getting the execution right. It's the refranchising, bringing new excited bottlers. In the end, this is a result of what's built by a great team of people that have been very focused over a number of years about regenerating growth in the North American business. As Muhtar said, they've had 6 very solid quarters of volume and revenue growth. And I think there are a lot of learnings. There's no silver bullet, but there are a lot of learnings. Now having said that, actually, Japan has also been on a good run, I mean, 3 quarters of very good volume growth, doing well on offsetting deflationary pressure. Again, it's a similar story. The team is very focused on a multiple-category approach, innovation in the products, increasing the quality and quantity of the marketing but always in parallel and in alignment with the bottler where you got a good better execution. Good marketing on its own is not going to get you the answer. It's got to be more better marketing along with more and better execution. And I think that's what you see. And to some extent, Western Europe like kind of came new Coca-Cola European bottlers came well out of the staples on the first quarter. I think the formula is going to be the same: more and better marketing, more and better execution, kind of multilane focus on categories and cranking out the learning of the trying stuff, the innovation and pushing ahead. And I think that's going to be something we'll continue to press across the developed markets. Now turning to China. I think China, again, I don't think if I gave the impression it was all whether, that would be unfair to the team on the ground in China and the system there. They've done a lot of work to address the big change in how the consumer in the responded to the economic circumstances in China. I think part of it is it's a part of the world that has such consistent growth rates over the last decade but a little bit of a slowdown, maybe caught some exaggerated pullback on spending. So I think there is a little bit of stabilization coming through in the macros. We saw that. We've definitely taken action in the things we can control, not just in the commercial policies to strength the wholesale or distributor network and working through the inventory problem, but also on the pricing and packaging. I mean, to give you one example, a very small example, but it's symptomatic of how fast China can change. If you go to the café channel in China, there are all the noodle shops up and down the street. People go there at lunchtime. Last year, they were pack with people. This year, you go there, 1/3 empty. You go, ""Okay, maybe the economy slowed down."" No, that's not what's happening. The explosion of online to off-line ordering and the availability of lots of people on bikes, motorbikes to deliver stuff and the apps and the aggregate apps to buy food, has seen an explosion of ordering of online and delivery of food such that it's just as many people buying from these cafés, but sometimes, in some parts of China, 1/3 of it is being delivered to people, whether they be at work or students. And so we've had to adapt our bandaging having a returnable glass bottle in that café doesn't help you with off-line delivery. So we have to revamp the packaging offer so that we're there with the right package to go where the consumer's going. And that's a micro example of the source of things we have to do in China to adapt to how the market's changing and as contributing to the stabilization. But is, again, as I said, a country undergoing change in its economic model, and that'll throw up new and different consumer behaviors to which we'll have to adapt."

And I think that itself first, without looking outside, without looking anywhere, is a huge rearchitecture that is yielding substantial savings that we can redeploy that into being -- into route to market into ways we actually get our products the most effective, efficient way to the customer and through the customer to the consumer in Japan. So regardless of any encouragement from the outside, we are on a track to end up in a very efficient, very -- and a 21st century bottling system at consumer goods delivery system in Japan that is working well. Now are there other opportunities, and that is not just related to cost saving, and yes, there has been very early discussions in Japan. Can't say any more than that. And we will continue to look at opportunities to see if we can even make our Japanese even stronger. But that's very early days, again, in terms of the level of discussions that have taken place."

Look, I think it's important to say that the premium opportunity in China is big, but it's not as big as the mainstream opportunity. And we are absolutely going to focus on investing in that premium opportunity. It's very much about the big cities, the white-collar. It's going to be also about some of the premium parts of the stills categories, and we're going to go after that. But in the end, the biggest mass of consumer, the biggest mass of disposable income will be in the mainstream. So we will have to be a combination of, yes, addressing the premiums but also going after the mainstream with greater affordability, expanding the distribution reach, upgrading the execution into the third-tier cities and the rural areas. That is also going to be a big driver of our revenue. In terms of the categories, I think water's been going really well by example. We've taken an approach of premiumizing our water business in China, one of our most recent billion-dollar brands, comes out of China effectively, and we are driving the business from that. In the end, the RMB 1 price point to a RMB 2 price point, that's one of the biggest drivers of growth is the water, the RMB 2. Places where we've taken had a little tougher time is perhaps in the juice category with sparking in the middle. Again, when you look at what's growing in terms of the categories, what you do see is it maps quite closely to the consumer segments in terms of who's suffering and who's not suffering in terms of disposable income. The juices, the kind of ambient more going to the rural areas have been hit a little harder. The premium waters, which are perhaps more of the cities, have been doing well."

Today, I'll touch briefly on a few key highlights before handing off to James to provide a more detailed operational review of our performance. 
I'm pleased to report that we delivered third quarter results in line with our expectations and we're on track to deliver against our full year expectations. Our continued focus on our 5 strategic initiatives enabled us to report another quarter of global value share gains with 3% organic revenue growth and over 50 basis points of comparable currency-neutral operating margin expansion. 
Our core business continued to perform well, delivering 4% organic revenue growth year-to-date, in line with our long-term target, driven by our segmented revenue growth strategies, improving marketing and portfolio diversification. Within our core business, developed markets performed well, delivering solid revenue results with 2% unit case volume growth year-to-date and a continued focus on price realization. While we continue to see challenges in many emerging and developing markets, we're taking action to improve our performance. Importantly, we're delivering the profit target we laid out at the beginning of the year. Excluding the impact of structural items, comparable currency-neutral income before tax grew 7% year-to-date. And we're confident we will deliver our full year profit outlook of 6% to 8% growth, excluding these same items. 
We continue our journey of transforming our company to a higher-margin and higher-return business focused on building strong brands, enhancing customer value and leading a strong, dedicated, global franchise system. This quarter, we continued to make solid progress to strengthen and evolve our global system. In North America, we signed definitive agreements on 6 territories and closed transactions on 4 territories, thereby remaining on track to complete our refranchising efforts in our flagship market by the end of 2017.
In Japan, our 2 largest bottlers, Coca-Cola West and Coca-Cola East Japan, reached a definitive agreement to merge their operations and create a strong, consolidated bottler representing over 85% of our system volume in Japan. In Latin America, we reached a long-term comprehensive agreement with Arca Continental regarding joint value creation in Mexico, along with a similar agreement with FEMSA in July. Separately, Coca-Cola FEMSA reached agreement to acquire Vonpar, one of the largest privately owned bottlers in the Brazilian Coca-Cola system, increasing its scale and leveraging FEMSA's strong commercial capabilities. 
In Europe, Coca-Cola European Partners finished its full quarter of operations as a combined company and we're executing in the line plan. And finally, in Africa, we recently exercised our call option to acquire ABI's stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa. We have a number of partners who are highly interested in and qualified for these bottling territories, and we intend to implement our long-term strategic plan for these markets. Over the coming months, we will negotiate the terms of the transaction with ABI, followed by a regulatory approval process. Simultaneously, we have commenced discussions with potential partners and plan to complete this important process as soon as feasible. 
When I take a step back and think about the magnitude of change we had implemented over the past couple of years, I am truly encouraged. We have implemented segmented revenue growth strategies for our markets, invested in capabilities and created clear incentives for the entire organization to drive revenue growth rather than volume only. We're shaping our brand portfolio across the full range of sparkling and still beverage categories to meet changing consumer needs through leading marketing, innovation and targeted M&A, which James will discuss in more details.
We launched ""Taste the Feeling"", a new marketing campaign for Trademark Coca-Cola at the beginning of the year and are seeing positive response from our consumers and customers. And through our ongoing $3 billion productivity initiative, we are taking costs out to both reinvest in the business and drive margin expansion. And as I have discussed, we are rearchitecting the bottling system in key geographies and regions to better capture growth. To put it in perspective, these affected regions account for almost half of our global volume. So the actions we're taking today are going to have significant impact on our system's future performance. Through these actions, we are becoming a much stronger company with higher margins and returns and better positioned to deliver on our long-term growth targets. 
I will now hand the call over to James, who will provide you with a more detailed outlook at our operating performance."

As Muhtar said, we continue to implement our 5 strategic actions for growth. And we're making the necessary changes to have the speed, agility and the focused leadership needed to win today and into the future. 
So before I jump into the results, as you know, we made a number of changes to our operating leadership structure during the quarter. I'd like to say these transitions occurred seamlessly, a testament to our leaders and associates. And these new leaders are bringing a fresh perspective and are working diligently to identify opportunities to accelerate our performance around the world.
Now let me turn to the results. I'd like to talk to you about these through 2 lenses: firstly, the traditional operating results in the quarter somewhat seen by geography; and second, how we continue to evolve our brand marketing and portfolio to stay relevant and meet consumer preferences. 
So our performance in the quarter. Our results were in line with our expectations with 3% organic revenue growth and 2% underlying income before tax growth. Our core business grew organic revenue 3% in the quarter. And as we expected, given the strong growth that we're cycling from the third quarter last year, it's important to note that year-to-date, our core operations continue to grow organic revenue 4% and we remain on track to deliver this performance for the full year.
Our company-owned bottling operations grew organic revenue 2% in the quarter, an acceleration from the first half of the year, driven by North American bottling and an improvement in China. Unit case volume grew 1%, cycling a pretty strong 3% from last year and an acceleration from last quarter, due largely in part to the return to growth in China and a stronger performance in our Western European business. It's worth saying that the macro challenges persist in certain emerging markets, particularly, for example, Argentina and Venezuela negatively impacting consolidated unit case volume growth by 1 point.
So turning and looking around the world. We continue to push hard where we have momentum, take actions where needed and manage through some of the difficult operating conditions. So we continue to do well in a number of key markets with momentum, including places like North America, Mexico and Japan, and so seek to further advance our strategies. For example, North America, we grew organic revenue 3% as we continue to successfully implement both our accelerated refranchising program while delivering top-tier growth among FMCG companies in the U.S. The strength and breadth of our full brand portfolio led to value share gains in both sparkling and still beverages. So that actually overall, we captured 40% of NARTD beverage retail sales growth year-to-date. Also as I said, we did well in Japan and Mexico. And both benefited from strong marketing and innovation as the combination of the ""One Brand"" strategy and new product launches drove continued solid performance.
Turning to some of the other key markets. We saw improved performance in the quarter. Our actions are starting to bear fruit, but we still have more to do. In China, we returned to growth, driven by strong activation of our Olympic campaign, improved execution and frankly, better weather. Our system has largely worked through the wholesale inventory issue. And we are continuing to innovate across the business towards the premium segment with examples like the launch of ZICO Coconut Water through the e-commerce channel. But also at the same time, we're paying proper attention to the mass consumer segment. There, we are driving the availability of entry-level small packs, such as the 300-milliliter bottle, to address affordability issues as the economy remains challenging and we expect continued near-term volatility. Another key market that got better, Western Europe. Solid marketing, innovation and commercial plans with the increased alignment with the new CCEP in its first full quarter as a new company and again a little bit of good weather resulted in strong performance in the quarter with our system gaining both value and volume share. 
Now while some markets -- while we're moving quickly in several markets and seeing success, it's true that we still compete in a number of markets with challenging macroeconomic conditions. The economic environment in Russia is improving slightly as the price of oil stabilizes. However, Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela all remain difficult operating environments for consumer products companies. Therefore, we will continue to concentrate on what we can control. In Brazil and Argentina, we are focused on affordability by maintaining key consumer price points while evolving our price pack architecture to protect our market share. And in Venezuela, we are addressing raw material shortages by rapidly scaling the availability of our Zero Sugar portfolio. 
Now as we look at this quarter but also at the future, I'd like to build on what I've shared in the past about our productivity efforts and evolving revenue growth strategies with an update on our growing and evolving brand portfolio. Of course, we recognize that consumer taste and preferences change and are changing. And we are building a strong, diversified brand portfolio across sparkling and the stills categories to meet these needs, including through internal innovation, bolt-on acquisitions and a lift-and-shift geographic expansion model.
If you look at our still portfolio today, it includes 14 of our 20 billion-dollar brands with #1 or #2 positions in juice, coffee, water, tea and sports drinks categories. Year-to-date, our systems sold 5.8 billion incremental servings of our stills brands, capturing over 25% of the value growth in stills globally. This performance has been driven by action around the world to expand our stills businesses. For example, take our Japan business, which has one of our most diversified portfolios. On top of good growth in our sparkling brands, we continue to drive strong performance across multiple categories through innovations like new premium packaging for our GEORGIA Coffee brand, a new line extension of our Ayataka tea brand and new flavors of our premium I LOHAS water brand. 
In the U.S., we extended smartwater into sparkling water. We revamped the packaging graphics on DASANI Sparkling, resulting in retail value growth of over 80% in the quarter for these 2 products. We expanded the Honest Tea trademark into juice drinks with Honest Kids becoming the #1 organic juice drink chosen for kids. We see ready-to-drink coffee as an important growth category in the U.S. Today, we are the global leader in ready-to-drink coffee category with strong positions in Japan and Korea. So we are leveraging on this strength and launching Gold Peak ready-to-drink cold brew coffee and Dunkin' Donuts branded ready-to-drink coffee to begin capturing this opportunity in our flagship market.
In Europe, we're expanding our stills portfolio by lifting our smartwater and Honest Tea brands from the U.S. and shifting them to Europe. We are also leveraging strong existing brands. For example, we are expanding geographically Innocent, our very successful premium juice and smoothie business, into a strong regional brand but also extending VIO, our popular water brand in Germany into juice drinks and sparkling lemonades. This has resulted in strong double-digit volume growth year-to-date for both brands. 
And finally, bolt-on M&A and investments, when available, will continue to be a part of our portfolio expansion strategy, particularly in the value-added dairy and plant protein beverage spaces. We are pleased by the early results of fairlife in the U.S. and Santa Clara in Mexico. And we look forward to closing our acquisition of plant-based brand, AdeS, in Latin America in early 2017.
Now turning to our sparkling business. I'd like to talk a little bit about how we're doing things differently. We are evolving our sparkling portfolio strategy so that we can grow while reducing sugar consumption. Through these actions, we've been able to outpace the category that is growing retail value by 3% for the first 9 months of the year. So let me give you a few examples of how we're doing this. 
First, our ""Taste the Feeling"" marketing campaign is engaging consumers with better advertising around both the extrinsics and intrinsics of the brand. Second, we're also providing more sugar-free options. In several markets around the world, we have launched Coca-Cola Zero Sugar with a new and improved taste as well as a new visual identity system under our ""One Brand"" strategy. And this is contributing high single-digit volume growth for this brand globally in the quarter. Take GB, for example. While we're only 12 weeks in, we've seen a significant expansion in the consumption versus the former Coke Zero product, resulting in strong double-digit volume growth for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar during the quarter. And we are rolling this out, this new and improved product out, across other European markets. 
More broadly, we've been taking multiple actions to shape choice to address changing consumer preferences around added sugar while working proactively with governments to provide positive solutions. We've been driving a systematic reformulation effort across our portfolio to reduce added sugar while delivering superior consumer taste and improving margins. For example, we currently have over 200 reformulation initiatives underway to reduce added sugar. And so an example of where that might take us as a step forward, in GB, for example, we reduced the sugar and the calories in brands such as Sprite and Fanta by 30%. In our Latin Center business unit, we've reduced the sugar content in almost 2/3 of our flavored sparkling beverages.
And then in combination with this reformulation and innovation effort, we have also focused on small pack sizes, a great way to enjoy a drink with less calories. These packs can provide both a premium experience as well as being affordable yet profitable way to bring people into the franchise. In Mexico, for example, small packs, such as our sleek can and 8-ounce glass bottle, are growing rapidly through both increased distribution and higher velocity per outlet. In China, our premium-priced sleek cans of Diet Coke and Coke Zero is growing strongly. And in India, where we recently launched our new lightweight, affordable PET bottle in just a few territories, we have already sold over 20 million servings. These actions and the results we are seeing give us confidence that we can further accelerate our sparkling business. 
So looking forward, we're working to grow by ensuring ongoing relevance and engagement with our existing brands while also expanding our brand portfolio so that we can meet consumer preferences. So as I think about the rest of the year from an operational's perspective, I, like Muhtar, am confident we will achieve our full year outlook. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Kathy to take you through the numbers."

Organic revenue growth was driven equally by volume and price/mix.",505,"Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to talk quickly about our financial performance in the quarter before moving on to our full year outlook.
Starting at the top line. Organic revenue growth was driven equally by volume and price/mix. Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven both by rate and product mix initiatives across many of our markets, partially offset by 1 point of segment mix due to slower growth in our Bottling Investments Group than in our core concentrate operations. 
At gross profit, our comparable margin increased about 45 basis points as solid pricing, a slightly favorable cost environment and productivity was partially offset by about an 80 basis point currency headwind. Our North America refranchising roughly offset the benefit from deconsolidating our German and South Africa bottling operations, resulting in a slight structural benefit to margins. Excluding the effect of currency and structural items, our underlying gross margin expanded over 100 basis points. Our comparable operating margin declined about 35 basis points. Similar to gross margins, currency headwinds impacted our operating margins by about 90 basis points while structural items, primarily the deconsolidation of our German and South African bottling operations, positively impacted our operating margins. 
Turning to the cash flow. We continue to exercise strong cash flow management. Year-to-date, we have generated $6.7 billion in cash from operations. And we have returned $5.7 billion to shareowners through a combination of net share repurchases and $4.5 billion of dividends paid year-to-date. And that includes our third quarter dividend that was paid on October 3 right after our quarter closed. Net share repurchases year-to-date were $1.2 billion. And we continue to expect them to be $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the full year, in line with our initial guidance. 
Looking ahead to the remainder of the year with 1 quarter remaining, we continue to expect our full year comparable EPS to decline 4% to 7%, in line with our previously communicated expectations. However, we now expect to spend likely less than $2.5 billion on capital expenditures for the full year, down from our initial expectations of $2.5 billion to $3 billion. 
As you construct your models, there are a few items to consider for the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter has 2 additional days as compared to last year, which will result in stronger top line growth than we saw in the third quarter. We expect structural items to be an 11 point headwind on net revenue and a 6 to 7 point headwind on income before tax in the fourth quarter. And finally, we expect currency to be a 1 to 2 point headwind on net revenue and an 8 to 9 point headwind on income before tax in the fourth quarter. 
So in closing, our strategies are working in key markets. We are on track to deliver over $600 million in productivity this year. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver our profit target this year. 
So with that, operator, we are now ready for questions."

Look, I think, first, once again, I want to reiterate the scale of what is being done here on a global basis. As I mentioned in my remarks, the geographies and the regions impacted by this refranchising, massive refranchising, is really when you aggregate it all is roughly around 50% of our global -- will impact 50% of our global volume. So this is really, really big, number one. Number two, the early indications that we have from both the U.S. refranchising efforts, which is the largest one, but also the European restructuring under the Coca-Cola European Partners umbrella is -- which was the biggest refranchising in Europe in history in its structure, essentially have been -- early indications have been positive. In the United States, if you look at it, the last 6 quarters consecutively, we've had volume growth and very encouraging price/mix in the United States continued. And the last sort of year, 4 quarters have been the highest in terms of refranchising activity. So early indications are positive. Europe, the same, James mentioned the positive numbers coming out of the last quarter, yes, helped by many other things other than just refranchising. But the impact is that there hasn't been the disruptions. It's been going on very smoothly. And when you look at it going forward, we've got 4 to 5 quarters of intense refranchising remaining as we bring out the other end of the tunnel, a company that is going to be totally transformed, revitalized in terms of its organizational capability, leadership structure, revitalization of the brands under also with the investment in our brands and the new marketing, the revitalization of our portfolio, of our bottling system as well as our cost base. So we're encouraged with what we see as they transform Coca-Cola Company coming out and also the integrity of the refranchising as evidenced by the continued good results in North America and in Europe."

And then of course, it's a question of what do the macroeconomics do and what actions do each country's governments take to put them on a better course or not. So that's part of the unknown going forward at this stage and the uncertainty. I think, quite clearly, you see, as Muhtar commented, a mixed bag. Across the world, you see those markets that are doing well, sustained growth. He called out at Nigeria, South Africa, the Philippines, other parts of the emerging markets. So it's good, but it's a mixed bag. And I think the actions are underway in a number of these countries to stabilize them, where they're a little tougher, like Brazil, like Argentina, which I called out on the call earlier. And we'll have to see how long it takes for this to take hold in the countries from a macro view. We don't have a clear sight on that. But what we do know is we need to focus on what we can control in those countries, go back to affordability, go back to execution, go back to the basics and build ourselves a better position with more market share so that when it does turn, and that combines with the growth of the developed markets, we can be solidly in the growth rates for our long-term model."

We focus on being competitive in each local market, beverage and fast-moving consumer goods industry, and especially when the economies are in tough times, focusing on staying competitive and gaining share for the long term. The net of all that means we're much more likely to follow or be close to local inflation rates rather than adopt a strategy of a full pass-through of the devaluation of the dollar. So obviously, if the exchange rates change, that will mean different dollar numbers for the corporation. But the local strategy remains stay competitive in the marketplace and it looks more like local inflation. Does that answer your question?"

Today, correct me if I'm wrong, but I think your global portfolio still skews at least 70-30 towards sparkling. But as you look forward, I'm curious as to what percentage of your growth you expect will come from traditional sparkling versus stills. I'm guessing it's probably not 70-30. But is it 50-50 or some other split you could frame for us? And then more importantly, do you think your growth investments today are aligned with that distribution? In other words, if it is 50-50, for example, are your incremental growth investments aligned with that? Or is it still legacy skewed towards sparkling that might need to be rethought? Because I think from the outside, there's still a perception, right or wrong, that your incremental investments are a bit overindexed towards core CSDs versus their future value conservation.

I mean, let me start by saying you're approximately right in volume terms on the current split between sparkling and stills, about 70-30. I think it's worth noting that, that split has been moving in the favor of stills by about 1 point a year. At the turn of the century of 10, 15 years ago, it was a single-digit percent of the mix. So it's going up at about 1% a year. Now part of that is organic on the things we're doing and part of that is the net of some of the bolt-on acquisitions. But it's going up about 1% a year of mix. I think as you look forward, clearly we -- given that we have 50% of the sparkling industry value share and 15% of the sum of all the stills categories value share, we fully expect to be able to grow faster in the stills categories because it will be the combination of the category growth rate plus our ability to gain share, which then feeds into your third question, which is how are the investments aligned? I feel they're aligned. Obviously, it's an ongoing process. So each year, we look at it in the business planning process and we're doing that again this year. But I would not characterize it as we are overinvested in sparkling and underinvested in stills. We're invested behind what's growing. And actually, just to add a little more texture to it, we're doing the right things in sparkling and we tend to be pushing more money towards driving the Zeros, the lights, the smaller packages in the sparkling business. In the stills, it's not a one-size-fits-all category, it's actually multiple categories. And there, we're selective on which ones have a most on-trend with the consumers, which ones have more premium pricing. And therefore, we're very selective about where we funnel the dollars and invest ahead of the curve or in line with the growth rates we're expecting."

Look, North America, I think, is a combination of many, many things. I mean, it's, I think, been the result of a number of years working on multiple fronts, working on innovation across the portfolio, getting into categories, refining the propositions, learning, refining the propositions. It's about, in the sparkling business, the better marketing, the more media spend. It's about the focus on the pricing and packaging architecture with more smaller packages. It's about getting the execution right. It's the refranchising, bringing new excited bottlers. In the end, this is a result that's been built by a great team of people who have been very focused over a number of years about regenerating growth in the North American business. As Muhtar said, they've had 6 very solid quarters of volume and revenue growth. And I think there are a lot of learnings. There's no silver bullet, but there are a lot of learnings. Now having said that, actually Japan has also been on a good run, I mean, had 3 quarters of very good volume growth, doing well on offsetting deflationary pressure. Again, it's a similar story. The team is very focused on a multiple category approach, innovation in the products, increasing the quality and quantity of the marketing but always in parallel and in alignment with the bottler, where you've got to get better execution. Good marketing on its own is not going to get you the answer. It's got to be more and better marketing along with more and better execution. And I think that's what you see. And to some extent, Western Europe, they kind of came -- new Coca-Cola European Partners came well out of the stables on the first quarter. I think the formula is going to be the same, more and better marketing, more and better execution and a multilane focus on categories and cranking out the learning, the trying stuff, the innovation and pushing ahead. And I think that's going to be something we'll continue to press across the developed markets. Now turning to China, I think China, again I don't think -- if I gave the impression it was all weather, that would be unfair to the team on the ground in China and the system there. They've done a lot of work to address the big change in how the consumer responded to the economic circumstances in China. I think part of it is it's a part of the world that has such consistent growth rates over the last decade but a little bit of a slowdown, maybe caught some exaggerated pullback on spending. So I think there is a little bit of stabilization coming through in the macros. We saw that. We've definitely taken action in the things we can control, not just in the commercial policies to strengthen the wholesaler or distributor network and working through the inventory problem, but also on the pricing and packaging. I mean, to give you one example, a very small example, but it's symptomatic of how fast China can change. If you go to the café channel in China, they're all the noodle shops up and down the street, people go there at lunchtime. Last year, they were packed with people. This year, you go there, 1/3 empty. You go, ""Okay, maybe the economy slowed down."" No, that's not what's happening. The explosion of online to offline ordering and the availability of lots of people on bikes, motorbike to deliver stuff and the apps and the aggregator apps to buy food, it has seen an explosion of ordering of online and delivery food such that there's just as many people buying from these cafés, but sometimes in some parts of China, 1/3 of it is being delivered to people, whether they be at work or students. And so we've had to adapt our packaging. Having a returnable glass bottle in that café doesn't help you with offline delivery. So we have to revamp the packaging offer so that we're there with the right package to go where the consumer is going. And that's a micro example of the sorts of things we've had to do in China to adapt to how the market is changing and has contributed to the stabilization. But it is again, as I said, a country undergoing change in its economic model. And that will throw up new and different consumer behaviors to which we'll have to adapt."

Could you just give us a sense of sort of where you feel the Philippines are at this point and maybe what you've done to improve things there?"

Yes, I mean, look, we've had a much better run in the Philippines in the last few quarters, actually strong numbers the first 3 quarters of this year. Actually, last year was 3 very strong quarters. So I think since FEMSA has been in there, they've built on the work that BIG did. They've gone about fixing the fundamentals. There were some fundamental structural stuff that still needed to be improved. And I think they grasped the nettle in the early days. And we're starting to see the benefits of that coming through in the last 6 quarters. Again, it's not silver bullet stuff. It's not too complicated in the sense of it's been about adapting the price package architecture. It's about some of the emphasis on some of the sparkling brands in the Philippines, where some of the local brands that we deemphasized and reemphasized some of the more global brands and the stronger local brands, rebuilding and continuing to construct a more solid distributor network. Obviously, Philippines is complicated, given all the islands and the issue in moving product around. I think they've kind of worked the system in terms of getting the thing nicely oiled in terms of the COGS of the product everywhere, backed up with a little more marketing and a little sharper focus on certain categories. And I think that's played through. And I think the team on the ground has done a good job of taking the performance to a higher level."

So regardless of any encouragement from the outside, we are on a track to end up in a very efficient, very -- and a 21st century bottling system, a consumer goods delivery system in Japan that is working well. Now are there other opportunities? And that is not just related to cost saving. And yes, there has been very early discussions in Japan. I can't say any more than that.

It's focused on where is that consumer demand, what's on trend.

I would say the initial issue for margins, and then over time, we are able to do things that will improve the margin impact. But initially, yes, as a category itself, a lot of these stills have higher cost of goods, they have higher revenue but higher cost of goods. So that does impact margins."

Look, I think it's important to say that the premium opportunity in China is big, but it's not as big as the mainstream opportunity. And we are absolutely going to focus on investing in that premium opportunity. It's very much about the big cities, the white collar. It's going to be also about some of the premium parts of the stills categories. And we're going to go after that. But in the end, the biggest mass of the consumers, the biggest mass of disposable income will be in the mainstream. So it will have to be a combination of, yes, addressing the premiums but also going after the mainstream with the greater affordability, expanding the distribution reach, upgrading the execution into the third-tier cities and the rural areas. That is also going to be a big driver of our revenue. And in terms of the categories, I think what has been going really well by example is we've taken an approach of premiumizing our water business in China. One of our most recent billion-dollar brands, Ice Dew, comes out of China effectively. And we're driving the business from that. In the end, a RMB 1 price point to a RMB 2 price point, that's one of the biggest drivers of growth is the water at the RMB 2. The places where we've taken -- had a little tougher time is perhaps in the juice category with sparkling in the middle. Again, when you look at what's growing in terms of the categories, what you do see is it maps quite closely to the consumer segments in terms of who's suffering and who's not suffering in terms of disposable income. The juices that were kind of ambient that were more going to the rural areas, have been hit a little harder. The premium waters, which are perhaps more to the cities, have been doing well."

Today, I'll touch briefly on a few key highlights before handing off to James to provide a more detailed operational review of our performance. 
I'm pleased to report that we delivered third quarter results in line with our expectations and we're on track to deliver against our full year expectations. Our continued focus on our 5 strategic initiatives enabled us to report another quarter of global value share gains with 3% organic revenue growth and over 50 basis points of comparable currency-neutral operating margin expansion. 
Our core business continued to perform well, delivering 4% organic revenue growth year-to-date, in line with our long-term target, driven by our segmented revenue growth strategies, improving marketing and portfolio diversification. Within our core business, developed markets performed well, delivering solid revenue results with 2% unit case volume growth year-to-date and a continued focus on price realization. While we continue to see challenges in many emerging and developing markets, we're taking action to improve our performance. Importantly, we're delivering the profit target we laid out at the beginning of the year. Excluding the impact of structural items, comparable currency-neutral income before tax grew 7% year-to-date. And we're confident we will deliver our full year profit outlook of 6% to 8% growth, excluding these same items. 
We continue our journey of transforming our company to a higher-margin and higher-return business focused on building strong brands, enhancing customer value and leading a strong, dedicated, global franchise system. This quarter, we continued to make solid progress to strengthen and evolve our global system. In North America, we signed definitive agreements on 6 territories and closed transactions on 4 territories, thereby remaining on track to complete our refranchising efforts in our flagship market by the end of 2017.
In Japan, our 2 largest bottlers, Coca-Cola West and Coca-Cola East Japan, reached a definitive agreement to merge their operations and create a strong, consolidated bottler representing over 85% of our system volume in Japan. In Latin America, we reached a long-term comprehensive agreement with Arca Continental regarding joint value creation in Mexico, along with a similar agreement with FEMSA in July. Separately, Coca-Cola FEMSA reached agreement to acquire Vonpar, one of the largest privately owned bottlers in the Brazilian Coca-Cola system, increasing its scale and leveraging FEMSA's strong commercial capabilities. 
In Europe, Coca-Cola European Partners finished its full quarter of operations as a combined company and we're executing an alligned plan. [ph] And finally, in Africa, we recently exercised our call option to acquire ABI's stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa. We have a number of partners who are highly interested in and qualified for these bottling territories, and we intend to implement our long-term strategic plan for these markets. Over the coming months, we will negotiate the terms of the transaction with ABI, followed by a regulatory approval process. Simultaneously, we have commenced discussions with potential partners and plan to complete this important process as soon as feasible. 
When I take a step back and think about the magnitude of change we had implemented over the past couple of years, I am truly encouraged. We have implemented segmented revenue growth strategies for our markets, invested in capabilities and created clear incentives for the entire organization to drive revenue growth rather than volume only. We're shaping our brand portfolio across the full range of sparkling and still beverage categories to meet changing consumer needs through leading marketing, innovation and targeted M&A, which James will discuss in more detail.
We launched ""Taste the Feeling"", a new marketing campaign for Trademark Coca-Cola at the beginning of the year and are seeing positive response from our consumers and customers. And through our ongoing $3 billion productivity initiative, we are taking costs out to both reinvest in the business and drive margin expansion. And as I have discussed, we are rearchitecting the bottling system in key geographies and regions to better capture growth. To put it in perspective, these affected regions account for almost half of our global volume. So the actions we're taking today are going to have significant impact on our system's future performance. Through these actions, we are becoming a much stronger company with higher margins and returns and better positioned to deliver on our long-term growth targets. 
I will now hand the call over to James, who will provide you with a more detailed outlook of our operating performance."

As Muhtar said, we continue to implement our 5 strategic actions for growth. And we're making the necessary changes to have the speed, agility and the focused leadership needed to win today and into the future. 
So before I jump into the results, as you know, we made a number of changes to our operating leadership structure during the quarter. I'd like to say these transitions occurred seamlessly; a testament to our leaders and associates. And these new leaders are bringing a fresh perspective and are working diligently to identify opportunities to accelerate our performance around the world.
Now let me turn to the results. I'd like to talk to you about these through two lenses: firstly, the traditional operating results in the quarter somewhat seen by geography; and second, how we continue to evolve our brand marketing and portfolio to stay relevant and meet consumer preferences. 
So our performance in the quarter. Our results were in line with our expectations with 3% organic revenue growth and 2% underlying income before tax growth. Our core business grew organic revenue 3% in the quarter. And as we expected, given the strong growth that we're cycling from the third quarter last year, it's important to note that year-to-date, our core operations continue to grow organic revenue 4% and we remain on track to deliver this performance for the full year.
Our company-owned bottling operations grew organic revenue 2% in the quarter, an acceleration from the first half of the year, driven by North American bottling and an improvement in China. Unit case volume grew 1%, cycling a pretty strong 3% from last year and an acceleration from last quarter, due largely in part to the return to growth in China and a stronger performance in our Western European business. It's worth saying that the macro challenges persist in certain emerging markets, particularly, for example, Argentina and Venezuela negatively impacting consolidated unit case volume growth by 1 point.
Turning and looking around the world. We continue to push hard where we have momentum, take actions where needed and manage through some of the difficult operating conditions. So we continue to do well in a number of key markets with momentum, including places like North America, Mexico and Japan, and so seek to further advance our strategies. For example, North America, we grew organic revenue 3% as we continue to successfully implement both our accelerated refranchising program while delivering top-tier growth among FMCG companies in the U.S. The strength and breadth of our full brand portfolio led to value share gains in both sparkling and still beverages. So that actually overall, we captured 40% of NARTD beverage retail sales growth year-to-date. Also as I said, we did well in Japan and Mexico. And both benefited from strong marketing and innovation as the combination of the ""One Brand"" strategy and new product launches drove continued solid performance.
Turning to some of the other key markets. We saw improved performance in the quarter. Our actions are starting to bear fruit, but we still have more to do. In China, we returned to growth, driven by strong activation of our Olympic campaign, improved execution and frankly, better weather. Our system has largely worked through the wholesale inventory issue. And we are continuing to innovate across the business towards the premium segment with examples like the launch of ZICO Coconut Water through the e-commerce channel. But also at the same time, we're paying proper attention to the mass consumer segment. There, we are driving the availability of entry-level small packs, such as the 300-milliliter bottle, to address affordability issues as the economy remains challenging and we expect continued near-term volatility. Another key market that got better: Western Europe. Solid marketing, innovation and commercial plans with the increased alignment with the new CCEP in its first full quarter as a new company and again a little bit of good weather resulted in strong performance in the quarter with our system gaining both value and volume share. 
Now while some markets -- while we're moving quickly in several markets and seeing success, it's true that we still compete in a number of markets with challenging macroeconomic conditions. The economic environment in Russia is improving slightly as the price of oil stabilizes. However, Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela all remain difficult operating environments for consumer products companies. Therefore, we will continue to concentrate on what we can control. In Brazil and Argentina, we are focused on affordability by maintaining key consumer price points while evolving our price pack architecture to protect our market share. And in Venezuela, we are addressing raw material shortages by rapidly scaling the availability of our Zero Sugar portfolio. 
Now as we look at this quarter but also at the future, I'd like to build on what I've shared in the past about our productivity efforts and evolving revenue growth strategies with an update on our growing and evolving brand portfolio. Of course, we recognize that consumer taste and preferences change and are changing. And we are building a strong, diversified brand portfolio across sparkling and the stills categories to meet these needs, including through internal innovation, bolt-on acquisitions and a lift-and-shift geographic expansion model.
If you look at our still portfolio today, it includes 14 of our 20 billion-dollar brands with #1 or #2 positions in juice, coffee, water, tea and sports drinks categories. Year-to-date, our systems sold 5.8 billion incremental servings of our stills brands, capturing over 25% of the value growth in stills globally. This performance has been driven by action around the world to expand our stills businesses. For example, take our Japan business, which has one of our most diversified portfolios. On top of good growth in our sparkling brands, we continue to drive strong performance across multiple categories through innovations like new premium packaging for our GEORGIA Coffee brand, a new line extension of our Ayataka tea brand and new flavors of our premium I LOHAS water brand. 
In the U.S., we extended smartwater into sparkling water. We revamped the packaging graphics on DASANI Sparkling, resulting in retail value growth of over 80% in the quarter for these 2 products. We expanded the Honest Tea trademark into juice drinks with Honest Kids becoming the #1 organic juice drink chosen for kids. We see ready-to-drink coffee as an important growth category in the U.S. Today, we are the global leader in ready-to-drink coffee category with strong positions in Japan and Korea. So we are leveraging on this strength and launching Gold Peak ready-to-drink cold brew coffee and Dunkin' Donuts branded ready-to-drink coffee to begin capturing this opportunity in our flagship market.
In Europe, we're expanding our stills portfolio by lifting our smartwater and Honest Tea brands from the U.S. and shifting them to Europe. We are also leveraging strong existing brands. For example, we are expanding geographically, Innocent; our very successful premium juice and smoothie business, into a strong regional brand but also extending VIO, our popular water brand in Germany into juice drinks and sparkling lemonades. This has resulted in strong double-digit volume growth year-to-date for both brands. 
And finally, bolt-on M&A and investments, when available, will continue to be a part of our portfolio expansion strategy, particularly in the value-added dairy and plant protein beverage spaces. We are pleased by the early results of fairlife in the U.S. and Santa Clara in Mexico. And we look forward to closing our acquisition of plant-based brand, AdeS, in Latin America in early 2017.
Now turning to our sparkling business. I'd like to talk a little bit about how we're doing things differently. We are evolving our sparkling portfolio strategy so that we can grow while reducing sugar consumption. Through these actions, we've been able to outpace the category that is growing retail value by 3% for the first 9 months of the year. So let me give you a few examples of how we're doing this. 
First, our ""Taste the Feeling"" marketing campaign is engaging consumers with better advertising around both the extrinsics and intrinsics of the brand. Second, we're also providing more sugar-free options. In several markets around the world, we have launched Coca-Cola Zero Sugar with a new and improved taste as well as a new visual identity system under our ""One Brand"" strategy. And this is contributing high single-digit volume growth for this brand globally in the quarter. Take GB, for example. While we're only 12 weeks in, we've seen a significant expansion in the consumption versus the former Coke Zero product, resulting in strong double-digit volume growth for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar during the quarter. And we are rolling this out -- this new and improved product out -- across other European markets. 
More broadly, we've been taking multiple actions to shape choice to address changing consumer preferences around added sugar while working proactively with governments to provide positive solutions. We've been driving a systematic reformulation effort across our portfolio to reduce added sugar while delivering superior consumer taste and improving margins. For example, we currently have over 200 reformulation initiatives underway to reduce added sugar. And so an example of where that might take us as a step forward, in GB, for example, we reduced the sugar and the calories in brands such as Sprite and Fanta by 30%. In our Latin Center business unit, we've reduced the sugar content in almost 2/3 of our flavored sparkling beverages.
And then in combination with this reformulation and innovation effort, we have also focused on small pack sizes, a great way to enjoy a drink with less calories. These packs can provide both a premium experience as well as being an affordable yet profitable way to bring people into the franchise. In Mexico, for example, small packs, such as our sleek can and 8-ounce glass bottle, are growing rapidly through both increased distribution and higher velocity per outlet. In China, our premium-priced sleek cans of Diet Coke and Coke Zero is growing strongly. And in India, where we recently launched our new lightweight, affordable PET bottle in just a few territories, we have already sold over 20 million servings. These actions and the results we are seeing give us confidence that we can further accelerate our sparkling business. 
So looking forward, we're working to grow by ensuring ongoing relevance and engagement with our existing brands while also expanding our brand portfolio so that we can meet consumer preferences. So as I think about the rest of the year from an operational's perspective, I, like Muhtar, am confident we will achieve our full year outlook. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Kathy to take you through the numbers."

I'm going to talk quickly about our financial performance in the quarter before moving on to our full year outlook.Starting at the top line. Organic revenue growth was driven equally by volume and price/mix.",505,"Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to talk quickly about our financial performance in the quarter before moving on to our full year outlook.
Starting at the top line. Organic revenue growth was driven equally by volume and price/mix. Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven both by rate and product mix initiatives across many of our markets, partially offset by 1 point of segment mix due to slower growth in our Bottling Investments Group than in our core concentrate operations. 
At gross profit, our comparable margin increased about 45 basis points as solid pricing, a slightly favorable cost environment and productivity was partially offset by about an 80 basis point currency headwind. Our North America refranchising roughly offset the benefit from deconsolidating our German and South Africa bottling operations, resulting in a slight structural benefit to margins. Excluding the effect of currency and structural items, our underlying gross margin expanded over 100 basis points. Our comparable operating margins declined about 35 basis points. Similar to gross margins, currency headwinds impacted our operating margins by about 90 basis points while structural items, primarily the deconsolidation of our German and South African bottling operations, positively impacted our operating margins. 
Turning to the cash flow. We continue to exercise strong cash flow management. Year-to-date, we have generated $6.7 billion in cash from operations. And we have returned $5.7 billion to shareowners through a combination of net share repurchases and $4.5 billion of dividends paid year-to-date. And that includes our third quarter dividend that was paid on October 3 right after our quarter closed. Net share repurchases year-to-date were $1.2 billion. And we continue to expect them to be $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the full year; in line with our initial guidance. 
Looking ahead to the remainder of the year with 1 quarter remaining, we continue to expect our full year comparable EPS to decline 4% to 7%, in line with our previously communicated expectations. However, we now expect to spend likely less than $2.5 billion on capital expenditures for the full year, down from our initial expectations of $2.5 billion to $3 billion. 
As you construct your models, there are a few items to consider for the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter has 2 additional days as compared to last year, which will result in stronger top line growth than we saw in the third quarter. We expect structural items to be an 11 point headwind on net revenue and a 6 to 7 point headwind on income before tax in the fourth quarter. And finally, we expect currency to be a 1 to 2 point headwind on net revenue and an 8 to 9 point headwind on income before tax in the fourth quarter. 
So in closing, our strategies are working in key markets. We are on track to deliver over $600 million in productivity this year. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver our profit targets this year. 
So with that, operator, we are now ready for questions."

Look, I think, first, once again, I want to reiterate the scale of what is being done here on a global basis. As I mentioned in my remarks, the geographies and the regions impacted by this refranchising -- massive refranchising -- is really when you aggregate it all is roughly around 50% of our global -- will impact 50% of our global volume. So this is really, really big, number one. Number two, the early indications that we have from both the U.S. refranchising efforts, which is the largest one, but also the European restructuring under the Coca-Cola European Partners umbrella is -- which was the biggest refranchising in Europe in history in its structure, essentially have been -- early indications have been positive. In the United States, if you look at it, the last 6 quarters consecutively, we've had volume growth and very encouraging price/mix in the United States continued. And the last sort of year, 4 quarters have been the highest in terms of refranchising activity. So early indications are positive. Europe, the same -- James mentioned the positive numbers coming out of the last quarter, yes, helped by many other things other than just refranchising. But the impact is that there hasn't been the disruptions. It's been going on very smoothly. And when you look at it going forward, we've got 4 to 5 quarters of intense refranchising remaining as we bring out the other end of the tunnel, a company that is going to be totally transformed, revitalized in terms of its organizational capability, leadership structure, revitalization of the brands under -- also with the investment in our brands and the new marketing, the revitalization of our portfolio, of our bottling system as well as our cost base. So we're encouraged with what we see as the transformed Coca-Cola Company coming out and also the integrity of the refranchising as evidenced by the continued good results in North America and in Europe."

And then of course, it's a question of what do the macroeconomics do and what actions do each country's governments take to put them on a better course or not. So that's part of the unknown going forward at this stage and the uncertainty. I think, quite clearly, you see, as Muhtar commented, a mixed bag. Across the world, you see those markets that are doing well, sustained growth. He called out Nigeria, South Africa, the Philippines, other parts of the emerging markets. So it's good, but it's a mixed bag. And I think the actions are underway in a number of these countries to stabilize them, where they're a little tougher, like Brazil, like Argentina, which I called out on the call earlier. And we'll have to see how long it takes for this to take hold in the countries from a macro view. We don't have a clear sight on that. But what we do know is we need to focus on what we can control in those countries, go back to affordability, go back to execution, go back to the basics and build ourselves a better position with more market share so that when it does turn, and that combines with the growth in the developed markets, we can be solidly in our growth rates for our long-term model."

We focus on being competitive in each local market: Beverage and fast-moving consumer goods industry, and especially when the economies are in tough times, focusing on staying competitive and gaining share for the long term. The net of all that means we're much more likely to follow or be close to local inflation rates rather than adopt a strategy of a full pass-through of the devaluation of the dollar. So obviously, if the exchange rates change, that will mean different dollar numbers for the corporation. But the local strategy remains stay competitive in the marketplace and it looks more like local inflation. Does that answer your question?"

But is it 50-50 or some other split you could frame for us? And then more importantly, do you think your growth investments today are aligned with that distribution? In other words, if it is 50-50, for example, are your incremental growth investments aligned with that? Or is there still legacy skewed towards sparkling that might need to be rethought?

I mean, let me start by saying you're approximately right in volume terms on the current split between sparkling and stills, about 70-30.

So it's going up at about 1% a year. Now part of that is organic on the things we're doing and part of that is the net of some of the bolt-on acquisitions. But it's going up about 1% a year of mix. I think as you look forward, clearly we -- given that we have 50% of the sparkling industry value share and 15% of the sum of all the stills categories value share, we fully expect to be able to grow faster in the stills categories because it will be the combination of the category growth rate plus our ability to gain share, which then feeds into your third question, which is how are the investments aligned? I feel they're aligned. Obviously, it's an ongoing process. Each year, we look at it in the business planning process and we're doing that again this year. But I would not characterize it as we are overinvested in sparkling and underinvested in stills. We're invested behind what's growing. And actually, just to add a little more texture to it, we're doing the right things on sparkling and we tend to be pushing more money towards driving the Zeros, the lights, the smaller packages in the sparkling business. In the stills, it's not a one-size-fits-all category, it's actually multiple categories. And there, we're selective on which ones have a most on-trends with the consumers, which ones have more premium pricing. And therefore, we're very selective about where we funnel the dollars and invest ahead of the curve or in line with the growth rates we're expecting."

Look, North America, I think, is a combination of many, many things. I mean, it's, I think, been the result of a number of years working on multiple fronts, working on innovation across the portfolio, getting into categories, refining the propositions, learning, refining the propositions. It's about, in the sparkling business, the better marketing, the more media spend. It's about the focus on the pricing and packaging architecture with more smaller packages. It's about getting the execution right. It's the refranchising, bringing new excited bottlers. In the end, this is a result that's been built by a great team of people who have been very focused over a number of years about regenerating growth in the North American business. As Muhtar said, they've had 6 very solid quarters of volume and revenue growth. And I think there are a lot of learnings. There's no silver bullet, but there are a lot of learnings. Now having said that, actually Japan has also been on a good run, I mean, had 3 quarters of very good volume growth, doing well on offsetting deflationary pressure. Again, it's a similar story. The team is very focused on a multiple category approach, innovation in the products, increasing the quality and quantity of the marketing but always in parallel and in alignment with the bottler, where you've got to get better execution. Good marketing on its own is not going to get you the answer. It's got to be more and better marketing along with more and better execution. And I think that's what you see. And to some extent, Western Europe, they kind of came -- new Coca-Cola European Partners came well out of the stables on the first quarter. I think the formula is going to be the same, more and better marketing, more and better execution and a multilane focus on categories and cranking out the learning, the trying stuff, the innovation and pushing ahead. And I think that's going to be something we'll continue to press across the developed markets. Now turning to China, I think China, again I don't think -- if I gave the impression it was all weather, that would be unfair to the team on the ground in China and the system there. They've done a lot of work to address the big change in how the consumer responded to the economic circumstances in China. I think part of it is it's a part of the world that has such consistent growth rates over the last decades but a little bit of a slowdown, maybe caused some exaggerated pullback on spending. So I think there is a little bit of stabilization coming through in the macros. We saw that. We've definitely taken action in the things we can control, not just in the commercial policies to strengthen the wholesaler or distributor network and working through the inventory problem, but also on the pricing and packaging. I mean, to give you one example, a very small example, but it's symptomatic of how fast China can change. If you go to the café channel in China, they're all the noodle shops up and down the street, people go there at lunchtime. Last year, they were packed with people. This year, you go there, 1/3 empty. You go, ""Okay, maybe the economy slowed down."" No, that's not what's happening. The explosion of online to offline ordering and the availability of lots of people on bikes, motorbike to deliver stuff and the apps and the aggregator apps to buy food, it has seen an explosion of ordering of online and delivery food such that there's just as many people buying from these cafés, but sometimes in some parts of China, 1/3 of it is being delivered to people, whether they be at work or students. And so we've had to adapt our packaging. Having a returnable glass bottle in that café doesn't help you with offline delivery. So we have to revamp the packaging offer so that we're there with the right package to go where the consumer is going. And that's a micro example of the sorts of things we've had to do in China to adapt to how the market is changing and has contributed to the stabilization. But it is again, as I said, a country undergoing change in its economic model. And that will throw up new and different consumer behaviors to which we'll have to adapt."

There were some fundamental structural stuff that still needed to be improved. And I think they grasped the nettle in the early days. And we're starting to see the benefits of that coming through in the last 6 quarters. Again, it's not silver bullet stuff. It's not too complicated in the sense of it's been about adapting the price package architecture. It's about some of the emphasis on some of the sparkling brands in the Philippines, where some of the local brands that we deemphasized and reemphasized some of the more global brands and the stronger local brands, rebuilding and continuing to construct a more solid distributor network. Obviously, Philippines is complicated, given all the islands and the issue in moving product around. I think they've kind of worked the system in terms of getting the thing nicely oiled in terms of the COGS so they can get the product everywhere, backed up with a little more marketing and a little sharper focus on certain categories. And I think that's played through. And I think the team on the ground has done a good job of taking the performance to a higher level."

Look, I think it's important to say that the premium opportunity in China is big, but it's not as big as the mainstream opportunity. And we are absolutely going to focus on investing in that premium opportunity. It's very much about the big cities, the white collar. It's going to be also about some of the premium parts of the stills categories. And we're going to go after that. But in the end, the biggest mass of the consumers, the biggest mass of disposable income will be in the mainstream. So it will have to be a combination of, yes, addressing the premiums but also going after the mainstream with the greater affordability, expanding the distribution reach, upgrading the execution into the third-tier cities and the rural areas. That is also going to be a big driver of our revenue. And in terms of the categories, I think what has been going really well by example is we've taken an approach of premium-izing our water business in China. One of our most recent billion-dollar brands, Ice Dew, comes out of China effectively. And we're driving the business from in the end, a RMB 1 price point to a RMB 2 price point. That's one of the biggest drivers of growth is the water at the RMB 2. The places where we've taken -- had a little tougher time is perhaps in the juice category with sparkling in the middle. Again, when you look at what's growing in terms of the categories, what you do see is it maps quite closely to the consumer segments in terms of who's suffering and who's not suffering in terms of disposable income. The juices that were kind of ambient that were more going to the rural areas, have been hit a little harder. The premium waters, which are perhaps more to the cities, have been doing well."

Today, I'll touch briefly on a few key highlights before handing off to James to provide a more detailed operational review of our performance. 
I'm pleased to report that we delivered third quarter results in line with our expectations and we're on track to deliver against our full year expectations. Our continued focus on our 5 strategic initiatives enabled us to report another quarter of global value share gains with 3% organic revenue growth and over 50 basis points of comparable currency-neutral operating margin expansion. 
Our core business continued to perform well, delivering 4% organic revenue growth year-to-date, in line with our long-term target, driven by our segmented revenue growth strategies, improving marketing and portfolio diversification. Within our core business, developed markets performed well, delivering solid revenue results with 2% unit case volume growth year-to-date and a continued focus on price realization. While we continue to see challenges in many emerging and developing markets, we're taking action to improve our performance. Importantly, we're delivering the profit target we laid out at the beginning of the year. Excluding the impact of structural items, comparable currency-neutral income before tax grew 7% year-to-date. And we're confident we will deliver our full year profit outlook of 6% to 8% growth, excluding these same items. 
We continue our journey of transforming our company to a higher-margin and higher-return business focused on building strong brands, enhancing customer value and leading a strong, dedicated, global franchise system. This quarter, we continued to make solid progress to strengthen and evolve our global system. In North America, we signed definitive agreements on 6 territories and closed transactions on 4 territories, thereby remaining on track to complete our refranchising efforts in our flagship market by the end of 2017.
In Japan, our 2 largest bottlers, Coca-Cola West and Coca-Cola East Japan, reached a definitive agreement to merge their operations and create a strong, consolidated bottler representing over 85% of our system volume in Japan. In Latin America, we reached a long-term comprehensive agreement with Arca Continental regarding joint value creation in Mexico, along with a similar agreement with FEMSA in July. Separately, Coca-Cola FEMSA reached agreement to acquire Vonpar, one of the largest privately owned bottlers in the Brazilian Coca-Cola system, increasing its scale and leveraging FEMSA's strong commercial capabilities. 
In Europe, Coca-Cola European Partners finished its full quarter of operations as a combined company and we're executing an aligned plan [ph]. And finally, in Africa, we recently exercised our call option to acquire ABI's stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa. We have a number of partners who are highly interested in and qualified for these bottling territories, and we intend to implement our long-term strategic plan for these markets. Over the coming months, we will negotiate the terms of the transaction with ABI, followed by a regulatory approval process. Simultaneously, we have commenced discussions with potential partners and plan to complete this important process as soon as feasible. 
When I take a step back and think about the magnitude of change we had implemented over the past couple of years, I am truly encouraged. We have implemented segmented revenue growth strategies for our markets, invested in capabilities and created clear incentives for the entire organization to drive revenue growth rather than volume only. We're shaping our brand portfolio across the full range of sparkling and still beverage categories to meet changing consumer needs through leading marketing, innovation and targeted M&A, which James will discuss in more detail.
We launched ""Taste the Feeling"", a new marketing campaign for Trademark Coca-Cola at the beginning of the year and are seeing positive response from our consumers and customers. And through our ongoing $3 billion productivity initiative, we are taking costs out to both reinvest in the business and drive margin expansion. And as I have discussed, we are rearchitecting the bottling system in key geographies and regions to better capture growth. To put it in perspective, these affected regions account for almost half of our global volume. So the actions we're taking today are going to have significant impact on our system's future performance. Through these actions, we are becoming a much stronger company with higher margins and returns and better positioned to deliver on our long-term growth targets. 
I will now hand the call over to James, who will provide you with a more detailed outlook of our operating performance."

As Muhtar said, we continue to implement our 5 strategic actions for growth. And we're making the necessary changes to have the speed, agility and the focused leadership needed to win today and into the future. 
So before I jump into the results, as you know, we made a number of changes to our operating leadership structure during the quarter. I'd like to say these transitions occurred seamlessly; a testament to our leaders and associates. And these new leaders are bringing a fresh perspective and are working diligently to identify opportunities to accelerate our performance around the world.
Now let me turn to the results. I'd like to talk to you about these through 2 lenses: firstly, the traditional operating results in the quarter somewhat seen by geography; and second, how we continue to evolve our brand marketing and portfolio to stay relevant and meet consumer preferences. 
So our performance in the quarter. Our results were in line with our expectations with 3% organic revenue growth and 2% underlying income before tax growth. Our core business grew organic revenue 3% in the quarter. And as we expected, given the strong growth that we're cycling from the third quarter last year, it's important to note that year-to-date, our core operations continue to grow organic revenue 4% and we remain on track to deliver this performance for the full year.
Our company-owned bottling operations grew organic revenue 2% in the quarter, an acceleration from the first half of the year, driven by North American bottling and an improvement in China. Unit case volume grew 1%, cycling a pretty strong 3% from last year and an acceleration from last quarter, due largely in part to the return to growth in China and a stronger performance in our Western European business. It's worth saying that the macro challenges persist in certain emerging markets, particularly, for example, Argentina and Venezuela negatively impacting consolidated unit case volume growth by 1 point.
Turning and looking around the world. We continue to push hard where we have momentum, take actions where needed and manage through some of the difficult operating conditions. So we continue to do well in a number of key markets with momentum, including places like North America, Mexico and Japan, and so seek to further advance our strategies. For example, North America, we grew organic revenue 3% as we continue to successfully implement both our accelerated refranchising program while delivering top-tier growth among FMCG companies in the U.S. The strength and breadth of our full brand portfolio led to value share gains in both sparkling and still beverages. So that actually overall, we captured 40% of NARTD beverage retail sales growth year-to-date. Also as I said, we did well in Japan and Mexico. And both benefited from strong marketing and innovation as the combination of the ""One Brand"" strategy and new product launches drove continued solid performance.
Turning to some of the other key markets. We saw improved performance in the quarter. Our actions are starting to bear fruit, but we still have more to do. In China, we returned to growth, driven by strong activation of our Olympic campaign, improved execution and frankly, better weather. Our system has largely worked through the wholesale inventory issue. And we are continuing to innovate across the business towards the premium segment with examples like the launch of ZICO Coconut Water through the e-commerce channel. But also at the same time, we're paying proper attention to the mass consumer segment. There, we are driving the availability of entry-level small packs, such as the 300-milliliter bottle, to address affordability issues as the economy remains challenging and we expect continued near-term volatility. Another key market that got better: Western Europe. Solid marketing, innovation and commercial plans with the increased alignment with the new CCEP in its first full quarter as a new company and again a little bit of good weather resulted in strong performance in the quarter with our system gaining both value and volume share. 
Now while some markets -- while we're moving quickly in several markets and seeing success, it's true that we still compete in a number of markets with challenging macroeconomic conditions. The economic environment in Russia is improving slightly as the price of oil stabilizes. However, Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela all remain difficult operating environments for consumer products companies. Therefore, we will continue to concentrate on what we can control. In Brazil and Argentina, we are focused on affordability by maintaining key consumer price points while evolving our price pack architecture to protect our market share. And in Venezuela, we are addressing raw material shortages by rapidly scaling the availability of our Zero Sugar portfolio. 
Now as we look at this quarter but also at the future, I'd like to build on what I've shared in the past about our productivity efforts and evolving revenue growth strategies with an update on our growing and evolving brand portfolio. Of course, we recognize that consumer taste and preferences change and are changing. And we are building a strong, diversified brand portfolio across sparkling and the stills categories to meet these needs, including through internal innovation, bolt-on acquisitions and a lift-and-shift geographic expansion model.
If you look at our still portfolio today, it includes 14 of our 20 billion-dollar brands with #1 or #2 positions in juice, coffee, water, tea and sports drinks categories. Year-to-date, our systems sold 5.8 billion incremental servings of our stills brands, capturing over 25% of the value growth in stills globally. This performance has been driven by action around the world to expand our stills businesses. For example, take our Japan business, which has one of our most diversified portfolios. On top of good growth in our sparkling brands, we continue to drive strong performance across multiple categories through innovations like new premium packaging for our GEORGIA Coffee brand, a new line extension of our Ayataka tea brand and new flavors of our premium I LOHAS water brand. 
In the U.S., we extended smartwater into sparkling water. We revamped the packaging graphics on DASANI Sparkling, resulting in retail value growth of over 80% in the quarter for these 2 products. We expanded the Honest Tea trademark into juice drinks with Honest Kids becoming the #1 organic juice drink chosen for kids. We see ready-to-drink coffee as an important growth category in the U.S. Today, we are the global leader in ready-to-drink coffee category with strong positions in Japan and Korea. So we are leveraging on this strength and launching Gold Peak ready-to-drink cold brew coffee and Dunkin' Donuts branded ready-to-drink coffee to begin capturing this opportunity in our flagship market.
In Europe, we're expanding our stills portfolio by lifting our smartwater and Honest Tea brands from the U.S. and shifting them to Europe. We are also leveraging strong existing brands. For example, we are expanding geographically, Innocent; our very successful premium juice and smoothie business, into a strong regional brand but also extending VIO, our popular water brand in Germany into juice drinks and sparkling lemonades. This has resulted in strong double-digit volume growth year-to-date for both brands. 
And finally, bolt-on M&A and investments, when available, will continue to be a part of our portfolio expansion strategy, particularly in the value-added dairy and plant protein beverage spaces. We are pleased by the early results of fairlife in the U.S. and Santa Clara in Mexico. And we look forward to closing our acquisition of plant-based brand, AdeS, in Latin America in early 2017.
Now turning to our sparkling business. I'd like to talk a little bit about how we're doing things differently. We are evolving our sparkling portfolio strategy so that we can grow while reducing sugar consumption. Through these actions, we've been able to outpace the category that is growing retail value by 3% for the first 9 months of the year. So let me give you a few examples of how we're doing this. 
First, our ""Taste the Feeling"" marketing campaign is engaging consumers with better advertising around both the extrinsics and intrinsics of the brand. Second, we're also providing more sugar-free options. In several markets around the world, we have launched Coca-Cola Zero Sugar with a new and improved taste as well as a new visual identity system under our ""One Brand"" strategy. And this is contributing high single-digit volume growth for this brand globally in the quarter. Take GB, for example. While we're only 12 weeks in, we've seen a significant expansion in the consumption versus the former Coke Zero product, resulting in strong double-digit volume growth for Coca-Cola Zero Sugar during the quarter. And we are rolling this out -- this new and improved product out -- across other European markets. 
More broadly, we've been taking multiple actions to shape choice to address changing consumer preferences around added sugar while working proactively with governments to provide positive solutions. We've been driving a systematic reformulation effort across our portfolio to reduce added sugar while delivering superior consumer taste and improving margins. For example, we currently have over 200 reformulation initiatives underway to reduce added sugar. And so an example of where that might take us as a step forward, in GB, for example, we reduced the sugar and the calories in brands such as Sprite and Fanta by 30%. In our Latin Center business unit, we've reduced the sugar content in almost 2/3 of our flavored sparkling beverages.
And then in combination with this reformulation and innovation effort, we have also focused on small pack sizes, a great way to enjoy a drink with less calories. These packs can provide both a premium experience as well as being an affordable yet profitable way to bring people into the franchise. In Mexico, for example, small packs, such as our sleek can and 8-ounce glass bottle, are growing rapidly through both increased distribution and higher velocity per outlet. In China, our premium-priced sleek cans of Diet Coke and Coke Zero is growing strongly. And in India, where we recently launched our new lightweight, affordable PET bottle in just a few territories, we have already sold over 20 million servings. These actions and the results we are seeing give us confidence that we can further accelerate our sparkling business. 
So looking forward, we're working to grow by ensuring ongoing relevance and engagement with our existing brands while also expanding our brand portfolio so that we can meet consumer preferences. So as I think about the rest of the year from an operational's perspective, I, like Muhtar, am confident we will achieve our full year outlook. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Kathy to take you through the numbers."

I'm going to talk quickly about our financial performance in the quarter before moving on to our full year outlook.Starting at the top line. Organic revenue growth was driven equally by volume and price/mix.",505,"Thank you, James, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to talk quickly about our financial performance in the quarter before moving on to our full year outlook.
Starting at the top line. Organic revenue growth was driven equally by volume and price/mix. Consolidated price/mix in the quarter was driven both by rate and product mix initiatives across many of our markets, partially offset by 1 point of segment mix due to slower growth in our Bottling Investments Group than in our core concentrate operations. 
At gross profit, our comparable margin increased about 45 basis points as solid pricing, a slightly favorable cost environment and productivity was partially offset by about an 80 basis point currency headwind. Our North America refranchising roughly offset the benefit from deconsolidating our German and South Africa bottling operations, resulting in a slight structural benefit to margins. Excluding the effect of currency and structural items, our underlying gross margin expanded over 100 basis points. Our comparable operating margins declined about 35 basis points. Similar to gross margins, currency headwinds impacted our operating margins by about 90 basis points while structural items, primarily the deconsolidation of our German and South African bottling operations, positively impacted our operating margins. 
Turning to the cash flow. We continue to exercise strong cash flow management. Year-to-date, we have generated $6.7 billion in cash from operations. And we have returned $5.7 billion to shareowners through a combination of net share repurchases and $4.5 billion of dividends paid year-to-date. And that includes our third quarter dividend that was paid on October 3 right after our quarter closed. Net share repurchases year-to-date were $1.2 billion. And we continue to expect them to be $2 billion to $2.5 billion for the full year; in line with our initial guidance. 
Looking ahead to the remainder of the year with 1 quarter remaining, we continue to expect our full year comparable EPS to decline 4% to 7%, in line with our previously communicated expectations. However, we now expect to spend likely less than $2.5 billion on capital expenditures for the full year, down from our initial expectations of $2.5 billion to $3 billion. 
As you construct your models, there are a few items to consider for the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter has 2 additional days as compared to last year, which will result in stronger top line growth than we saw in the third quarter. We expect structural items to be an 11 point headwind on net revenue and a 6 to 7 point headwind on income before tax in the fourth quarter. And finally, we expect currency to be a 1 to 2 point headwind on net revenue and an 8 to 9 point headwind on income before tax in the fourth quarter. 
So in closing, our strategies are working in key markets. We are on track to deliver over $600 million in productivity this year. And we remain confident in our ability to deliver our profit targets this year. 
So with that, operator, we are now ready for questions."

As I mentioned in my remarks, the geographies and the regions impacted by this refranchising -- massive refranchising -- is really when you aggregate it all is roughly around 50% of our global -- will impact 50% of our global volume. So this is really, really big, number one. Number two, the early indications that we have from both the U.S. refranchising efforts, which is the largest one, but also the European restructuring under the Coca-Cola European Partners umbrella is -- which was the biggest refranchising in Europe in history in its structure, essentially have been -- early indications have been positive. In the United States, if you look at it, the last 6 quarters consecutively, we've had volume growth and very encouraging price/mix in the United States continued. And the last sort of year, 4 quarters have been the highest in terms of refranchising activity. So early indications are positive. Europe, the same -- James mentioned the positive numbers coming out of the last quarter, yes, helped by many other things other than just refranchising. But the impact is that there hasn't been the disruptions. It's been going on very smoothly. And when you look at it going forward, we've got 4 to 5 quarters of intense refranchising remaining as we bring out the other end of the tunnel, a company that is going to be totally transformed, revitalized in terms of its organizational capability, leadership structure, revitalization of the brands under -- also with the investment in our brands and the new marketing, the revitalization of our portfolio, of our bottling system as well as our cost base. So we're encouraged with what we see as the transformed Coca-Cola Company coming out and also the integrity of the refranchising as evidenced by the continued good results in North America and in Europe."

And then of course, it's a question of what do the macroeconomics do and what actions do each country's governments take to put them on a better course or not. So that's part of the unknown going forward at this stage and the uncertainty. I think, quite clearly, you see, as Muhtar commented, a mixed bag. Across the world, you see those markets that are doing well, sustained growth. He called out Nigeria, South Africa, the Philippines, other parts of the emerging markets. So it's good, but it's a mixed bag. And I think the actions are underway in a number of these countries to stabilize them, where they're a little tougher, like Brazil, like Argentina, which I called out on the call earlier. And we'll have to see how long it takes for this to take hold in the countries from a macro view. We don't have a clear sight on that. But what we do know is we need to focus on what we can control in those countries, go back to affordability, go back to execution, go back to the basics and build ourselves a better position with more market share so that when it does turn, and that combines with the growth in the developed markets, we can be solidly in our growth rates for our long-term model."

We focus on being competitive in each local market: Beverage and fast-moving consumer goods industry, and especially when the economies are in tough times, focusing on staying competitive and gaining share for the long term. The net of all that means we're much more likely to follow or be close to local inflation rates rather than adopt a strategy of a full pass-through of the devaluation of the dollar. So obviously, if the exchange rates change, that will mean different dollar numbers for the corporation. But the local strategy remains stay competitive in the marketplace and it looks more like local inflation. Does that answer your question?"

So it's going up at about 1% a year. Now part of that is organic on the things we're doing and part of that is the net of some of the bolt-on acquisitions. But it's going up about 1% a year of mix. I think as you look forward, clearly we -- given that we have 50% of the sparkling industry value share and 15% of the sum of all the stills categories value share, we fully expect to be able to grow faster in the stills categories because it will be the combination of the category growth rate plus our ability to gain share, which then feeds into your third question, which is how are the investments aligned? I feel they're aligned. Obviously, it's an ongoing process. Each year, we look at it in the business planning process and we're doing that again this year. But I would not characterize it as we are overinvested in sparkling and underinvested in stills. We're invested behind what's growing. And actually, just to add a little more texture to it, we're doing the right things on sparkling and we tend to be pushing more money towards driving the Zeros, the lights, the smaller packages in the sparkling business. In the stills, it's not a one-size-fits-all category, it's actually multiple categories. And there, we're selective on which ones have a most on-trends with the consumers, which ones have more premium pricing.

As Muhtar said, they've had 6 very solid quarters of volume and revenue growth. And I think there are a lot of learnings. There's no silver bullet, but there are a lot of learnings. Now having said that, actually Japan has also been on a good run, I mean, had 3 quarters of very good volume growth, doing well on offsetting deflationary pressure. Again, it's a similar story. The team is very focused on a multiple category approach, innovation in the products, increasing the quality and quantity of the marketing but always in parallel and in alignment with the bottler, where you've got to get better execution. Good marketing on its own is not going to get you the answer. It's got to be more and better marketing along with more and better execution. And I think that's what you see. And to some extent, Western Europe, they kind of came -- new Coca-Cola European Partners came well out of the stables on the first quarter. I think the formula is going to be the same, more and better marketing, more and better execution and a multilane focus on categories and cranking out the learning, the trying stuff, the innovation and pushing ahead. And I think that's going to be something we'll continue to press across the developed markets. Now turning to China, I think China, again I don't think -- if I gave the impression it was all weather, that would be unfair to the team on the ground in China and the system there. They've done a lot of work to address the big change in how the consumer responded to the economic circumstances in China. I think part of it is it's a part of the world that has such consistent growth rates over the last decades but a little bit of a slowdown, maybe caused some exaggerated pullback on spending. So I think there is a little bit of stabilization coming through in the macros. We saw that. We've definitely taken action in the things we can control, not just in the commercial policies to strengthen the wholesaler or distributor network and working through the inventory problem, but also on the pricing and packaging. I mean, to give you one example, a very small example, but it's symptomatic of how fast China can change. If you go to the café channel in China, they're all the noodle shops up and down the street, people go there at lunchtime. Last year, they were packed with people. This year, you go there, 1/3 empty. You go, ""Okay, maybe the economy slowed down."" No, that's not what's happening. The explosion of online to offline ordering and the availability of lots of people on bikes, motorbike to deliver stuff and the apps and the aggregator apps to buy food, it has seen an explosion of ordering of online and delivery food such that there's just as many people buying from these cafés, but sometimes in some parts of China, 1/3 of it is being delivered to people, whether they be at work or students. And so we've had to adapt our packaging. Having a returnable glass bottle in that café doesn't help you with offline delivery. So we have to revamp the packaging offer so that we're there with the right package to go where the consumer is going. And that's a micro example of the sorts of things we've had to do in China to adapt to how the market is changing and has contributed to the stabilization. But it is again, as I said, a country undergoing change in its economic model. And that will throw up new and different consumer behaviors to which we'll have to adapt."

Actually, last year was 3 very strong quarters as well. So I think since FEMSA has been in there, they've built on the work that BIG did. They've gone about fixing the fundamentals. There were some fundamental structural stuff that still needed to be improved. And I think they grasped the nettle in the early days. And we're starting to see the benefits of that coming through in the last 6 quarters. Again, it's not silver bullet stuff. It's not too complicated in the sense of it's been about adapting the price package architecture. It's about some of the emphasis on some of the sparkling brands in the Philippines, where some of the local brands that we deemphasized and reemphasized some of the more global brands and the stronger local brands, rebuilding and continuing to construct a more solid distributor network. Obviously, Philippines is complicated, given all the islands and the issue in moving product around. I think they've kind of worked the system in terms of getting the thing nicely oiled in terms of the COGS so they can get the product everywhere, backed up with a little more marketing and a little sharper focus on certain categories. And I think that's played through. And I think the team on the ground has done a good job of taking the performance to a higher level."

And now we're moving towards having 85% of the total business in Japan, which is, as you know, a very large business for us, under one roof. And I think that itself first, without looking outside, without looking anywhere, is a huge rearchitecture that is yielding substantial savings that we can redeploy that into being -- into the route to market, into ways we actually get our products the most effective, efficient way to the customer and through the customer to the consumer in Japan. So regardless of any encouragement from the outside, we are on a track to end up in a very efficient, very -- and a 21st century bottling system, a consumer goods delivery system in Japan that is working well. Now are there other opportunities -- and that is not just related to cost saving. And yes, there has been very early discussions in Japan. I can't say any more than that. And we will continue to look at opportunities to see if we can even make our Japanese system even stronger. But that's very early days again in terms of the level of discussions that have taken place."

I mean, there's definitely a noticeable kind of increase in talk about the still growth and investment at the last conference and on the call today.

Because I think it's still much lower gross margin. And so do you expect margin degradation?

It's focused on where is that consumer demand, what's on trend. And if you just pick out a couple of things that are on trend, things like coconut waters or premium juices or premium ready-to-drink coffees, these are all very high revenue products. Kathy, do you want to say something about the margins?"

I would say the initial issue for margins, and then over time, we are able to do things that will improve the margin impact.

Look, I think it's important to say that the premium opportunity in China is big, but it's not as big as the mainstream opportunity. And we are absolutely going to focus on investing in that premium opportunity. It's very much about the big cities, the white collar. It's going to be also about some of the premium parts of the stills categories. And we're going to go after that. But in the end, the biggest mass of the consumers, the biggest mass of disposable income will be in the mainstream. So it will have to be a combination of, yes, addressing the premiums but also going after the mainstream with the greater affordability, expanding the distribution reach, upgrading the execution into the third-tier cities and the rural areas. That is also going to be a big driver of our revenue. And in terms of the categories, I think what has been going really well by example is we've taken an approach of premium-izing our water business in China. One of our most recent billion-dollar brands, Ice Dew, comes out of China effectively. And we're driving the business from in the end, a RMB 1 price point to a RMB 2 price point. That's one of the biggest drivers of growth is the water at the RMB 2. The places where we've taken -- had a little tougher time is perhaps in the juice category with sparkling in the middle. Again, when you look at what's growing in terms of the categories, what you do see is it maps quite closely to the consumer segments in terms of who's suffering and who's not suffering in terms of disposable income. The juices that were kind of ambient that were more going to the rural areas, have been hit a little harder. The premium waters, which are perhaps more to the cities, have been doing well."
