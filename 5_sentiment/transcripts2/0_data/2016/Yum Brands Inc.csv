I'm pleased you could join us today as we share with you the opportunities ahead for Yum! as well as a review of our results. Before we get started, I want to underscore what I presented at our Investor Day",2153,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased you could join us today as we share with you the opportunities ahead for Yum! as well as a review of our results. 
Before we get started, I want to underscore what I presented at our Investor Day in December. 2016 will be a transformational year for Yum! as we complete the spinoff of our China Division, ultimately creating 2 powerful independent, focused growth companies. The fundamental goal of Yum! however, is unchanged. We are 100% dedicated to building and strengthening KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell all around the world as strong brands are critical to delivering sustained growth and creating shareholder value over the long term. I'm pleased with the momentum we generated across the majority of Yum! in the fourth quarter. 
KFC China, for example, grew same-store sales 6% in the last quarter of 2015. This was a sequential improvement from the third quarter and in line with our expectations. Outside of China, each of our brand divisions grew same-store sales on a 1- and 2-year basis. Our U.S. results in the fourth quarter were particularly strong for all 3 brands as KFC posted its sixth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth, Taco Bell continued to outperform the category and Pizza Hut grew same-store sales 2%. On a 2-year basis, our fourth quarter comps in the U.S. were the best of the year with Pizza Hut at plus 2, KFC at plus 8 and Taco Bell at plus 10. This success has complemented our international results in the quarter where KFC posted 2% same-store sales growth with solid results in both emerging and developed markets and Pizza Hut grew same-store sales 3% in emerging markets.
Fourth quarter EPS grew 11% with full year EPS growth of 3% in 2015 despite a 7% decline in the first half and a 6 percentage points of foreign currency headwinds. For the full year, our brand divisions collectively grew operating profit 8% in constant currency, which is in line with our ongoing growth model target. This was led by 12% operating profit growth at Taco Bell, a remarkable result given the significant investments we made in the fourth quarter to position the brand for continued momentum and category leadership for years to come. Operating profit grew 8% in constant currency in China with impressive cost management partially offsetting weaker than originally expected sales [indiscernible] 
We opened more than 2,300 new units globally in 2015. And as I look forward, I expect 2016 to be a year of improved performance, building on the fourth quarter's momentum. This year, we expect nearly 2400 new restaurants, which means we're opening over 6 restaurants a day, laying the groundwork for future growth. With all of this in mind, we are reiterating the guidance we gave you in December. Given the results we've seen year-to-date and the plans we laid out for each of the brands, we are confident in our ability to deliver 10% operating profit growth in constant currency in 2016.
Now I'd like to discuss what gives me confidence in the future for each of our businesses. After that, Pat will walk you through the financials. So first, China. As I mentioned, KFC, which represents about 75% of the division's operating profit, grew same-store sales 6% in the fourth quarter, continuing the sequential improvement we saw throughout the year. System sales grew 9% in the quarter as we added 114 [ph] net new units, surpassing the 5,000 unit mark. I'm thrilled the China team is applying global best practices, fresh thinking and new insights to revitalize the brand and achieve traction with consumers. test results have proven that global sales-driving techniques are encouraging, and the implementation of these programs shall drive transactions and benefit the division later this year.
One example is which has proven successful globally, and we expect to be similarly well-received in China. I can assure you that we are taking the right steps to grow the business, and the momentum we are seeing makes me confident we will.
Pizza Hut Casual Dining in China, which represents about 25% of China's operating profit, has proven more challenging. System sales in constant currency grew 4% in the fourth quarter as we added 151 net new units, but same-store sales declined 8%. The macroeconomic environment and volatile stock market have impacted the casual dining segment, and we know we had to generate more exciting value to counter this headwind. We'll be more focused on value going forward with workday lunch specials and value pieces as well as other initiatives to drive traffic. We have our work cut out for us at this year and we'll be moderating our development pace a bit this year. Nevertheless, the China team has a number of strategies and that we expect to improve results. We know substantial runway for new units in same-store sales growth for China's leading western casual dining brand.
Before I move on to the other divisions, I want to give you a quick update on January sales in China. We're encouraged by what we're seeing in KFC, but Pizza Hut sales remain soft. It's difficult to gauge exactly where the first quarter will finish, especially given the earlier timing of Chinese New Year. But at this point, we expect same-store sales growth to be up low single digits for the division, which sets us up well for the balance of the year. We expect solid KFC sales going forward. And even with the potential of negative results of Pizza Hut Casual Dining in the first half, we are reconfirming our full year guidance for the China Division to generate same-store sales growth of 2% to 3%, operating profit growth of 10% in constant currency and to open 600 new restaurants.
Now turning to our 3 brand divisions. KFC is our franchise emerging powerhouse. Franchisees [indiscernible] 85% [ph] about 705 new international restaurants in 2015. Total system sales grew 11% in emerging markets for the year with particular strength in Russia and Central and Eastern Europe. In fact, Russia has generated system sales growth of at least 40% in each of the last 4 years. I'm also encouraged that our recent performance in developed markets such as Australia, Japan and the United States. These results reinforce my confidence in the brand's ability to drive sales going forward. We don't only have an ability to generate meaningful growth in mature markets where we have a long-established presence, we also have tremendous potential in emerging markets where we have a significant lead over the competition. So we are taking our global brand identity and unifying that with local cultural insights to expand and grow our business all around the world. We are 100% focused on our real authentic and freshly prepared food and merging that with value and innovation to drive results. The international front we've enjoyed success with lunch and dinner box meals, and we're delighted by in the United States are finding their way into the system. For example, we just introduced national in the U.S. This is a sparkly version of our crispy chicken inspired by one of NASCAR's most famous dishes. The new unit pipeline remains impressive. In KFC's top 12 emerging markets, excluding China, we only have 1 restaurant per million people. Today with an aggregate population of 3 billion people in these markets, think of the potential.
Across the world, we have plans in place to grow sales and to build on the division's consistent operating growth performance. I am confident KFC will continue to excel and reward shareholders for years to come.
At Pizza Hut U.S. we are starting to turn the corner with our focused emphasis on making it easier to get a better pizza. This runs the gamut from improved operations and insight-driven food innovation, digital enhancements and consistent value. While we recognize it was a lot more work to do, we're now generating consistent transaction and same-store sales growth in the United States. Equally significant and as you heard in December, we reached an important agreement with our U.S. franchise. Starting in January, we begun an overhaul of our assets replacing and upgrading in-store technology. From a marketing calendar perspective, we are focused on a balanced approach. This begins with premium-priced innovation least recent launch of pizza to protect and improve unit level economics. You may also seen the launch of our $5 flavor menu the most compelling value menu in the pizza business. In conjunction with our ongoing $6.99 any pairs deal, it will provide customers with great value on an ongoing basis. We are encouraged by the start of the year of pizza in the United States, and we believe we have the right strategy going forward. Our international business at Pizza Hut is led by strength in emerging markets but offset by weakness in some of our developed markets. We believe you can apply best practices from the U.S. business to drive growth in these developing markets going forward.
Finally, Taco Bell delivered a fantastic 2015, surpassing 9 billion in system sales, and we expect solid year end 2016 as well. Taco Bell is on the cutting edge of QSR. And as the industry gold standard for social engagement on the product development, brand positioning and advertising. We have several new exciting product launching this year, including 1 we'll announce during the Superbowl. So be sure to watch the first half to see the national introduction. Our innovation focus extends beyond just food. We are encouraged by early results of our delivery program and are developing expansion plans for additional cities. The addition of our loyalty program in November also in our mobile app and will increase brand affinity as it rewards social behavior. Furthermore, we are focused on our core value messaging to drive actions. We continue to build on our breakfast daypart where sales were growing at twice the rate of our business as a whole. In fact, we grew best breakfast transactions 6% in the fourth quarter. Given the brand's strong economics and broad franchise appeal, we continue to accelerate new year openings both domestically and internationally with a record number of U.S. openings in 2015 and expect to build upon this in 2016. I'm particularly excited that we're starting to traction expanding the brand internationally. We know this process will take time, but we're making real progress here. Our growth plans both domestically and internationally will lay the groundwork for higher operating profit growth in the years to come. With all this progress, you can see I'm very excited about what's happening other company. We are undertaking the biggest strategic move in the history of Yum! with our spin of the China business. We are confident that this will create 2 large, optimally structured, independent companies with unique investment profiles. Yum! China will target 15% ongoing EPS growth, and it's focused solely on Mainland China and will pay the new Yum! a 3% license fee. New Yum! will be a high margin global franchise company targeting 15% shareholder return. Recapitalization plans are underway and will be completed in the first half of this year. We see substantial value in our share at current prices as we have repurchased 23 million shares from the announcement of the separation through last night. I want to assure you that while the spin-off transaction is critically important, we're not going to let that distract us from the business in China or anywhere else. All 3 of our brands have significant opportunities for growth as they progress along the journey to brand excellence. We expect to achieve 10% constant currency growth in operating profit this year as a company and are setting up 2 separate companies that will lead the restaurant industry going forward.
Yum! is in a unique position. We have 3 iconic brands and are making them even stronger. As you've heard me say before, my goal is to build 3 global iconic brands that people trust and champion. We are well on our way to achieving this, led by our brand positioning, courageous leadership and committed team members and franchisees. Needless to say there's a lot to be excited about at Yum!, and I could not be more pleased to lead this company into its next phase. Finally, as you all know, this is Pat's last earnings call with Yum!, and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank him for his leadership, his hard work and unwavering drive to raise the bar of Yum!. He will be missed across the organization. As you may have seen in our 8-K filing, we've appointed our current Corporate Controller, Dave Russell, as interim CFO. And I look forward to working with him while we complete our search for a permanent CFO
And with that, it gives me great pleasure to hand the call over to Pat."

In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: our fourth quarter results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on the separation of our China business. I too am pleased with the overall sales momentum that we demonstrated in the fourth quarter where EPS excluding special items grew 11%. Reported EPS growth was considerably higher as last year's fourth quarter included a noncash special charge related to the impairment of our Little Sheep concept in China. Excluding special items and the impact of foreign exchange, operating profit grew a healthy 17% in the fourth quarter led by system sales growth of 6% and restaurant margin improvement of over 3 percentage points. 
I'll now take you through our results by division, starting with our China business. For the division overall, same-store sales grew 2% in the fourth quarter. As we preannounced, KFC grew same-store sales 6%, which was sequentially better than Q3 as we expected. We're encouraged by the positive momentum in our KFC China business, particularly as it sustained into the new year. Same-store sales at Pizza Hut Casual Dining, however, have remained sluggish and declined 8% in the fourth quarter. As Greg said, the China team is addressing this matter with urgency, and we will update you on our progress throughout the year. Restaurant margin management continues to be a bright spot in China's performance. For the fourth quarter, China restaurant margins improved more than 4 percentage points versus prior year to 11.4%, helped by sales leverage at KFC and productivity improvements across the division, more than offsetting sales leverage at Pizza Hut. As a reminder, our fourth quarter is a seasonally low sales period for the China Division, so the absolute restaurant margin tends to be lower at the time of year. Full year restaurant margin was 15.9% for the division, an improvement of 1 fill percentage point. It's not often that you see restaurant margins expand with declining sales, so this highlights the extent of the China team's effort to improve profitability through cost controls. I'm proud of the team's continued focus on productivity, and I'm confident this bodes well for future profit growth in China as same-store sales continue to recover and unlock significant profit leverage in the business. Given our continued strong belief in China's long-term growth potential, I'm encouraged by continued strong cash paybacks on new units we opened 743 new restaurants in 2015. And while we are prudently dialing back the pace of new unit developments in 2016, targeting about 600 new restaurant openings, we've also expected fewer closures this year, so our net new units will be similar to 2015. Our decision to temper the pace of development balances the reality of current market conditions with the opportunities we have to enter new trade zones and expand our presence in existing ones. We are also making good progress on modernizing our estate. In 2015, we remodeled about 500 restaurants in China, and we plan to remodel about another 550 in 2016. By the end of this year, we will have remodeled our yearly built about 45% or nearly have half of our China estate in a 3-year period.
Now moving to our global KFC Division, which posted its eighth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth. System sales growth was especially strong in emerging markets, up 10% led by Russia and Southeast Asia. International development also delivered solid system sales growth up 6% led by Australia, Japan and Western Europe. And the U.S. recorded its sixth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth at 3%. Restaurant margins grew 90 basis points to 14.7% in the quarter and improved 150 basis points for the year to nearly 15%. Operating profit grew 7% in the quarter before the impact of foreign currency translation. Adjusting this, for a lack of a onetime favorable pension resolution, as well as incremental advertising expense associated with our U.S. acceleration agreement, operating profit grew 11% in the quarter, roughly in line with KFC's ongoing gross model. Importantly, KFC set another new record for international development in 2015 opening 705 new restaurants demonstrating the power of this global iconic brand. Our global Pizza Hut Division delivered 1% same-store sales growth for the quarter led by 2% same-store sales growth in our U.S. business, which accounts for about half of the division system sales. Operating profit improved 6% in constant currency, driven by higher franchise fees and higher restaurant markets, partially offset by an increase in U.S. G&A, including severance and other onetime costs. Restaurant margins actually improved 240 basis points in constant currency for the quarter, driven by same-store sales leverage and commodity deflation. For the year, Pizza Hut opened 429 new international units. While this was below our initial forecast for 2015, we now have a more robust development pipeline and are confident that we'll open at least 525 new international units in 2016. Finally, Taco Bell about posted 4% same-store sales growth in the quarter. Restaurant margin improved to 3.1 percentage points to 23.7% raising full year margins to approximately 22%, a remarkable achievement for this powerhouse brand. Operating profit, however, declined 7% in the fourth quarter due to an expected increase in G&A related to performance-based incentive compensation, strategic growth investments including restaurant technology and international supply chain and other nonrecurring costs. We believe these investments will strengthen the brand and help to sustain positive momentum in the business as evidence of the onetime nature of these expenses, we actually expect Taco Bell's SG&A will decline in 2016. Additionally, we expect restaurant margins to remain above 20% even with our more aggressive push on value. 
On the development front, we opened 276 new stores in 2015. This included 41 units outside the U.S, 4x the number we opened in 2014, demonstrating the progress we're making to ramp up international development. 87% of the deficiency restaurants were open by franchisees, reflecting the attractive investment returns the Taco Bell brand generates. I'd now like to talk about our 2016 outlook. Supported by the results we've seen year-to-date, we continue to expect to deliver operating profit growth of 10% in constant currency this year. And while I will be providing quarterly guidance, I would like to point out that certain brands are facing hurdles both prior year lapse and timing of current year expenses which will weigh on first half results. As a consequence, we expect second-half operating profit growth will be directionally stronger in the first half. This is consistent with our plans coming into the year, and we remained confident we will achieve our full year operating profit guidance.
Now I'd like to quickly cover off our spin-off plants. We're making good progress and are on track to complete the separation of our China business by the end of this year. A major part of our plan is to optimize the capital structure of Yum! Brands and return $6.2 billion to shareholders prior to the separation through the issuance of new debt. From the time we announced the separation through last night, we repurchased 23 million shares. While our weighted average basic share count for the quarter was $433 million, our basic share count as of February 2, 2016, was $411 million. We see value in repurchasing our shares that we consider to be at a discounted price and view this as a prudent use of shareholder capital. I'm also happy to report that we're on scheduled to complete our recapitalization in the first half of the year, issuing incremental debt of approximately $5.2 billion and plan to maintain roughly 5x EBIT to leverage going forward. We're now in the process of finalizing the form and timing of this financing. Now I'm sure you've noticed the volatility in the high-yield market, particularly within the energy and materials sectors. We'll continue to watch this closely, but we're pleased that the rates on our future debt remain very attractive in a historic basis, and we're full steam ahead with our plans.
So let me wrap things up. 2016 will be an exciting year for Yum! Brands. Not only do we expect to deliver 10% operating profit growth in constant currency, but we're proceeding as expected with the separation of our China Division into an independent publicly traded company. Yum! China will have no external debt, and we'll self-fund the growth capital while generating significant free cash flow in year 1 and on an ongoing basis. The new Yum! will be a global diversified franchise company with an optimal capital structure. By 2017, we will be 96% franchised with a stable but fast-growing free cash flow stream. I am pleased I was able to participate in this landmark decision for the company and that we are optimizing shareholders value by creating 2 powerful investment opportunities. I am very confident in both company's future growth prospects and look forward to their ongoing success.
And with that, I'll open up the call to Q&A."

Did Pizza Hut China really get away from the five-star dining at three-star prices in recent years, leaving it more vulnerable now? And can you share with the rolled out so far in the sort of value might be thinking about for the brand and you think that's going to be enough to offset the casual dining weakness in the country? We'd now I think first of all the macros which have got worse since December. And I think we all know that macros impact casual dining more than the impact QSR so I think that's definitely that issue. I would agree with you that we do not have enough value used to overcome this backdrop. I think we've also -- as w5 spoken in previous calls, a lot of discussion around stake and there wasn't this much discussion if you just think about it on our pizza. So I think our ability to talk value but value around pizza, I think you'll see more of that going forward. So yes, the answer is we've got to focus of the Court the strengthen our brand positioning you got a target value to increase transaction such a smart value across dayparts. We also have to, I think, improve our in-store experience in order to stay ahead with the competition. And I think the other thing we've got to do is to be a leader in digital better stay relevant, and I think does a lot of things we can do in that market as well. To round out the answer, we got about 5 value program in test for Pizza Hut in China. We see some early encouraging results, but that's going to take us some time to get into the marketplace and as Pat said I think you'll see a much better second half than you see first half Pizza Hut."

How do we think about the margins for those 3 segments this and to follow that up, could you give us an update on the plans  to franchised those 3 brands you know the 91% to 95% by the end of '17? How is that progressing? And maybe to some extent, how does the success of these brands recently impact that refranchising effort?"

First, in terms of margin performance at 3 global brands. Bear in mind, our equity ownership in those 3 global brand businesses I think, collectively, the order of 10% so it's a franchise driven business but nonetheless we do focus on restaurant margins above for the benefit of her company and then importantly to ensure that our franchisees are realizing good returns on their investment. I would say overall, we're pleased with the progress are making on margins for our KFC global division to improve about [ph] 1 percentage point versus last year was quite a significant accomplishment, combination of same-store sales growth and productivity improvements contributing to that. At Pizza Hut, equally happy with the progress we made this year, to your point, supported by commodity deflation as well as in the last quarter some sales growth. And then for Taco Bell, another banner year with restaurant margins on a full year basis, around 22%. As we build on that momentum into next year, we are expecting our KFC and our Pizza Hut businesses to continue to realize margin improvement aided by same-store sales leverage as well as more modest commodity outlook than we've seen in some years before. In the case of Taco Bell, my expectation is that margins will be above 20%, perhaps a bit below where they were in this year because of the more aggressive push on value and a more tempered approach to pricing. And then in terms of the refranchising, the teams are very much committed to realizing the objectives that we laid out to achieve 96% franchise ownership by the end of 2017. In the last 30 days, Greg and I have met with each one of the global brand divisions to review the refranchising plans, and they're very discreet plans around specific geographies and pacing associated with that. Given the complexity of some of these other transactions, we expect the re-franchising activity will be more heavily concentrated in 2017."

It's just that essay mentioned in my prepared remarks earlier, given current market conditions, we feel that it's prudent to dial back a bit, but we continue to be very confident in the value that we will create from these investments as we're continuing to see cash paybacks of around 3 years, and we know the long term potential of the market remains significant.

And so that's the outlook for China. As it relates to Taco Bell, I would say things are a little bit similar in the sense that the emphasis will be on value to both of the great momentum we had in 2015.

Margins were up versus prior year about 4.5 percentage points, and here's how it breaks down. When you take the 4% pricing, add to it the mix benefit, and strip off the impact of the transaction decline that's about a net 2-point benefit. On top of that, we had a 3-point benefit from productivity and another 1 point benefit from close stores. Offsetting that was 1.5 margin attributable to inflation. Commodities were flat but we had 6% inflation on labor. And so that's basically the walk to the 4.5-point gain in margin versus prior year. In terms of how we are thinking about 2016, as a mentioned before, the team is very much focused on building transactions. So while we do expect some modest inflation from a commodity perspective, up about 1% and high single digits for labor, we're not planning to take pricing to entirely offset that. We will look to some ongoing productivity improvements to help mitigate the impact of inflation, but the goal this to at least maintain margin year-over-year at around 16% and to achieve meaningful improvement in transactions."

We're looking to build awareness of the app to drive utilization, and an important part of that is the introduction of a loyalty component to the app, a game that was launched in late 2015. It's the first loyalty program of its kind that rewards social behavior. And the first reward that was offered for customers who played the game was a free Taco Bell freeze, so there was a lot of excitement around that. The app is also configured in the way the tribes exploration of menu. So it helped to create a lot of buzz and a lot active engagement with our heavy users, very high levels of social sharing of the rewards we've observed, and the overall user response has been very positive.

I'm pleased you could join us today as we share with you the opportunities ahead for Yum! as well as a review of our results.
Before we get started, I want to underscore what I presented at our Investor Day in December. 2016 will be a transformational year for Yum! as we complete the spinoff of our China division, ultimately creating 2 powerful independent, focused growth companies. The fundamental goal of Yum!, however, is unchanged. We are 100% dedicated to building and strengthening KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell all around the world as strong brands are critical to delivering sustained growth and creating shareholder value over the long term. I am pleased with the positive sales momentum we generated across the majority of Yum! in the fourth quarter. 
KFC China, for example, grew same-store sales 6% in the last quarter of 2015. This was a sequential improvement from the third quarter and in line with our expectations. Outside of China, each of our brand divisions grew same-store sales on a 1- and 2-year basis. Our U.S. results in the fourth quarter were particularly strong for all 3 brands, as KFC posted its sixth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth, Taco Bell continued to outperform the category and Pizza Hut grew same-store sales 2%. On a 2-year basis, our fourth quarter comps in the U.S. were the best of the year, with Pizza Hut at plus 2%, KFC at plus 8% and Taco Bell at plus 10%. This success has complemented our international results in the quarter where KFC posted 2% same-store sales growth, with solid results in both emerging and developed markets and Pizza Hut grew same-store sales 3% in emerging markets.
Fourth quarter EPS grew 11%, with full-year EPS growth of 3% in 2015 despite a 7% decline in the first half and a 6 percentage points of foreign currency headwinds. For the full year, our brand divisions collectively grew operating profit 8% in constant currency, which is in line with our ongoing growth model target. This was led by 12% operating profit growth at Taco Bell, a remarkable result given the significant investments we made in the fourth quarter to position the brand for continued momentum and category leadership for years to come. Operating profit grew 8% in constant currency in China, with impressive cost management partially offsetting weaker than originally expected sales results.
We opened more than 2,300 new units globally in 2015. And as I look forward, I expect 2016 to be a year of improved performance, building on the fourth quarter's momentum. This year, we expect to open nearly 2,400 new restaurants, which means we're opening over 6 restaurants a day, laying the groundwork for future growth. With all of this in mind, we are reiterating the guidance we gave you in December. Given the results we've seen year-to-date and the plans we've laid out at each of the brands, we are confident in our ability to deliver 10% operating profit growth in constant currency in 2016.
Now I'd like to discuss what gives me confidence in the future for each of our businesses. After that, Pat will walk you through the financials. So first, China. As I mentioned, KFC, which represents about 75% of the division's operating profit, grew same-store sales 6% in the fourth quarter, continuing the sequential improvement we saw throughout the year. System sales grew 9% in the quarter as we added 114 net new units, surpassing the 5,000 unit mark. I'm thrilled the China team is applying global best practices, fresh thinking and new insights to revitalize the brand and achieve traction with consumers. Early test results of proven global sales-driving tactics are encouraging, and the implementation of these programs should drive transactions and benefit the division later this year.
One example is box meals, which has proven successful globally, and we expect to be similarly well-received in China. I can assure you, we are taking the right steps to grow the business, and the momentum we are seeing makes me confident we will.
Pizza Hut Casual Dining in China, which represents about 25% of China's operating profit, has proven more challenging. System sales in constant currency grew 4% in the fourth quarter as we added 151 net new units, but same-store sales declined 8%. The macroeconomic environment and volatile stock market have impacted the casual dining segment, and we know we had to generate more exciting news and value to counter this headwind. We'll be more focused on value going forward, with workday lunch specials and value pieces as well as other initiatives to drive traffic. We have our work cut out for us at here and we'll be moderating our development pace a bit this year. Nevertheless, the China team has a number of strategies and concepts in test that we expect to improve results. We know a substantial runway for the new units in same-store sales growth for China's leading western casual dining brand.
Before I move on to the other divisions, I want to give you a quick update on January sales in China. We're encouraged by what we're seeing at KFC, but Pizza Hut sales remained soft. It's difficult to gauge exactly where the first quarter will finish, especially given the earlier timing of Chinese New Year. But at this point, we expect same-store sales growth to be up low single digits for the division, which sets us up well for the balance of the year. We expect solid KFC sales going forward. And even with the potential of negative results of Pizza Hut Casual Dining in the first half, we are reconfirming our full-year guidance for the China Division to generate same-store sales growth of 2% to 3%, operating profit growth of 10% in constant currency and to open 600 new restaurants.
Now turning to our 3 brand divisions. KFC is a franchise-led emerging powerhouse. Franchisees opened 85% of our 705 new international restaurants in 2015. Total system sales grew 11% in emerging markets for the year, with particular strength in Russia and Central and Eastern Europe. In fact, Russia has generated system sales growth of at least 40% in each of the last 4 years. I'm also encouraged by our recent performance in developed markets such as Australia, Japan and the United States. These results reinforce my confidence in the brand's ability to drive sales going forward. We don't only have an ability to generate meaningful growth in mature markets where we have a long-established presence, we also have tremendous potential in emerging markets where we have a significant lead over the competition. So we are taking our global brand identity and unifying that with local cultural insights to expand and grow our business all around the world. We are 100% focused on our real, authentic and freshly prepared food and merging that with value and innovation to drive results. On the international front we've enjoyed success with lunch and dinner box meals, and we're delighted ideas created in United States are finding their way into the system. For example, we've just introduced Nashville Hot in the U.S. This is a spicy version of our crispy chicken inspired by one of Nashville's most famous dishes. The new unit pipeline in KFC remains impressive. In KFC's top 12 emerging markets, excluding China, we only have one restaurant per 1 million people. Today, with an aggregate population of 3 billion people in these markets, think of the potential.
Across the world, we have plans in place to grow sales and to build on the division's consistent operating growth performance. I am confident KFC will continue to excel and reward shareholders for years to come.
At Pizza Hut U.S. we are starting to turn the corner with our focused emphasis on making it easier to get a better pizza. This runs the gamut from improved operations and insight-driven food innovation to digital enhancements and consistent value. While we recognize there was a lot more work to do, we're now generating consistent positive transaction and same-store sales growth in the United States. Equally significant, and as you've heard in December, we reached an important agreement with our U.S. franchisees. Starting in January, we began an overhaul of our assets, replacing ovens and upgrading in-store technology. From a marketing calendar perspective, we are focused on a balanced approach. This begins with premium-priced innovation such as our recent launch of stuffed garlic knots pizza to protect and improve unit level economics. You may also have seen the launch of our $5 flavor menu, the most compelling value menu in the pizza business. In conjunction with our ongoing $6.99 any pairs deal, it will provide our customers with great value on an ongoing basis. We are encouraged by the start of the year at Pizza Hut in the United States, and we believe we have the right strategy going forward. Our international business at Pizza Hut is led by strength in emerging markets but offset by weakness in some of our developed markets. We believe we can apply best practices from the U.S. business to drive growth in these developed markets going forward.
Finally, Taco Bell delivered a fantastic 2015, surpassing $9 billion in system sales, and we expect a solid year in 2016 as well. Taco Bell is on the cutting edge of QSR, and is the industry gold standard for social engagement, product development, brand positioning and advertising. We have several new exciting products launching this year, including one we'll announce during the Super Bowl. So be sure to watch the first half to see the national introduction. Our innovation focus extends beyond just food. We are encouraged by early results of our delivery program and our developing expansion plans for additional cities. The addition of our loyalty program in November builds on our mobile app and will increase brand affinity as it rewards social behavior. Furthermore, we are focused on our core value messaging to drive transactions. We continue to build on our breakfast daypart, where sales are growing at twice the rate of our business as a whole. In fact, we grew breakfast transactions 6% in the fourth quarter. Given the brand's strong economics and broad franchise appeal, we continue to accelerate new unit openings both domestically and internationally, with a record number of U.S. openings in 2015 and expect to build upon this in 2016. I'm particularly excited that we're starting to get some traction expanding the brand internationally. We know this process will take time, but we're making real progress here. Our growth plans, both domestically and internationally, will lay the groundwork for higher operating profit growth in the years to come. With all this progress, you can see why I'm very excited about what's happening in our company. We are undertaking the biggest strategic move in the history of Yum! with our spin of the China business. We're confident this will create 2 large, optimally structured, independent companies with unique investment profiles. Yum! China will target 15% ongoing EPS growth, and its focus is solely on Mainland China and will pay the new Yum! a 3% license fee. New Yum! will become a high-margin global franchise company targeting 15% shareholder return. Recapitalization plans are underway and will be completed in the first half of this year. We see substantial value in our share at current prices as we have repurchased 23 million shares from the announcement of the separation through last night. I want to assure you that while the spin-off transaction is critically important, we're not going to let it distract us from running the business in China or anywhere else. All 3 of our brands have significant opportunities for growth as they progress along the journey to brand excellence. We expect to achieve 10% constant currency growth in operating profit this year as a company and are setting up 2 separate companies that will lead the restaurant industry going forward.
Yum! is in a unique position. We have 3 iconic brands and are making them even stronger. As you've heard me say before, my goal as CEO is to build 3 global iconic brands that people trust and champion. We are well on our way to achieving this, led by our brand positioning, courageous leadership and committed team members and franchisees. Needless to say there's a lot to be excited about at Yum!, and I could not be more pleased to lead this company into its next phase. Finally, as you all know, this is Pat's last earnings call with Yum!, and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank him for his leadership, his hard work and unwavering drive to raise the bar at Yum!. He will be missed across the organization. As you may have seen in our 8-K filing, we've appointed our current Corporate Controller, Dave Russell, as interim CFO. And I look forward to working with him while we complete our search for a permanent CFO.
And with that, it gives me great pleasure to hand the call over to Pat."

In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: our fourth quarter results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on the separation of our China business. I, too, am pleased with the overall sales momentum that we demonstrated in the fourth quarter, where EPS excluding special items grew 11%. Reported EPS growth was considerably higher as last year's fourth quarter included a noncash special item charge related to the impairment of our Little Sheep concept in China. Excluding special items and the impact of foreign exchange, operating profit grew a healthy 17% in the fourth quarter, led by system sales growth of 6% and restaurant margin improvement of over 3 percentage points.
I'll now take you through our results by division, starting with our China business. For the division, overall, same-store sales grew 2% in the fourth quarter. As we preannounced, KFC grew same-store sales 6%, which was sequentially better than Q3 as we expected. We're encouraged by the positive momentum in our KFC China business, particularly as it sustained into the new year. Same-store sales at Pizza Hut Casual Dining, however, have remained sluggish and declined 8% in the fourth quarter. As Greg said, the China team is addressing this matter with urgency, and we will update you on our progress throughout the year. Restaurant margin management continues to be a bright spot in China's performance. For the fourth quarter, China restaurant margins improved more than 4 percentage points versus prior year to 11.4%, helped by sales leverage at KFC and productivity improvements across the division, more than offsetting sales deleverage at Pizza Hut. As a reminder, our fourth quarter is a seasonally low sales period for the China Division, so the absolute restaurant margin tends to be lower at that time of year. Full-year restaurant margin was 15.9% for the division, an improvement of 1 full percentage point. It's not often that you see restaurant margins expand with declining sales, so this highlights the extent of the China team's efforts to improve profitability through cost controls. I'm proud of the team's continued focus on productivity and confident this bodes well for future profit growth in China as same-store sales continue to recover and unlock significant profit leverage in the business. Given our continued strong belief in China's long-term growth potential, and encouraged by continued strong cash paybacks on new units, we opened 743 new restaurants in 2015. And while we are prudently dialing back the pace of new unit developments in 2016, targeting about 600 new restaurant openings, we'd also expect fewer closures this year, so our net new units will be similar to 2015. Our decision to temper the pace of development balances the reality of current market conditions, with the opportunities we have to enter new trade zones and expand our presence in existing ones. We are also making good progress on modernizing our estate. In 2015, we remodeled about 500 restaurants in China, and we plan to remodel about another 550 in 2016. By the end of this year, we will have remodeled our newly built about 45% or nearly half of our China estate in a 3-year period.
Now moving to our global KFC Division, which posted its eighth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth. System sales growth was especially strong in emerging markets, up 10% led by Russia and Southeast Asia. International developed markets also delivered solid system sales growth, up 6% led by Australia, Japan and Western Europe. And the U.S. recorded its sixth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth at 3%. Restaurant margins grew 90 basis points to 14.7% in the quarter and improved 150 basis points for the year to nearly 15%. Operating profit grew 7% in the quarter before the impact of foreign currency translation. Adjusting this for the lack of a onetime favorable pension resolution, as well as incremental advertising expense associated with our U.S. acceleration agreement, operating profit grew 11% in the quarter, roughly in line with KFC's ongoing gross model. Importantly, KFC set another new record for international development in 2015 opening 705 new restaurants, demonstrating the power of this global iconic brand. Our global Pizza Hut division delivered 1% same-store sales growth for the quarter, led by 2% same-store sales growth in our U.S. business, which accounts for about half of division system sales. Operating profit improved 6% in constant currency, driven by higher franchise fees and higher restaurant margins, partially offset by an increase in U.S. G&A, including severance and other onetime costs. Restaurant margins actually improved 240 basis points in constant currency for the quarter, driven by same-store sales leverage and commodity deflation. For the year, Pizza Hut opened 429 new international units. While this was below our initial forecast for 2015, we now have a more robust development pipeline and are confident that we'll open at least 525 new international units in 2016. Finally, Taco Bell posted 4% same-store sales growth in the quarter. Restaurant margin improved 3.1 percentage points to 23.7%, raising full-year margins to approximately 22%, a remarkable achievement for this powerhouse brand. Operating profit, however, declined 7% in the fourth quarter due to an expected increase in G&A related to performance-based incentive compensation, strategic growth investments including restaurant technology and international supply chain and other nonrecurring costs. We believe these investments will strengthen the brand and help to sustain positive momentum in the business. As evidence of the onetime nature of these expenses, we actually expect Taco Bell's G&A will decline in 2016. Additionally, we expect restaurant margins to remain above 20% even with our more aggressive push on value. 
On the development front, we opened 276 new stores in 2015. This included 41 units outside the U.S., 4x the number we opened in 2014, demonstrating the progress we're making to ramp up international development. 87% of the division's new restaurants were opened by franchisees, reflecting the attractive investment returns that the Taco Bell brand generates. 
I'd now like to talk about our 2016 outlook. Supported by the results we've seen year-to-date, we continue to expect to deliver operating profit growth of 10% in constant currency this year. And while I won't be providing quarterly guidance, I would like to point out that certain brands are facing hurdles both, prior year lapse and timing of current year expenses which will weigh on first half results. As a consequence, we expect second half operating profit growth will be directionally stronger in the first half. This is consistent with our plans coming into the year, and we remained confident we will achieve our full year operating profit guidance.
Now I'd like to quickly cover off our spin-off plans. We're making good progress and are on track to complete the separation of our China business by the end of this year. A major part of our plan is to optimize the capital structure of Yum! Brands and return $6.2 billion to shareholders prior to the separation through the issuance of new debt. From the time we announced the separation through last night, we repurchased 23 million shares. While our weighted average basic share count for the quarter was $433 million, our basic share count as of February 2, 2016, was $411 million. We see value in repurchasing our shares that we consider to be a discounted price and view this as a prudent use of shareholder capital. 
I'm also happy to report that we're on scheduled to complete our recapitalization in the first half of the year, issuing incremental debt of approximately $5.2 billion and plan to maintain roughly 5x EBITDA leverage going forward. We're now in the process of finalizing the form and timing of this financing. Now I'm sure you've noticed the volatility in the high-yield debt market, particularly within the energy and materials sectors. We'll continue to watch this closely, but we're pleased that the rates on our future debt remain very attractive on a historic basis, and we're full steam ahead with our plans.
So let me wrap things up. 2016 will be an exciting year for Yum! Brands. Not only do we expect to deliver 10% operating profit growth in constant currency, but we're proceeding as expected with the separation of our China Division into an independent publicly traded company. Yum! China will have no external debt, and we'll self-fund the growth capital, while generating significant free cash flow in year 1 and on an ongoing basis. The new Yum! will be a global diversified franchise company with an optimal capital structure. By 2017, we will be 96% franchised with a stable but fast-growing free cash flow stream. I'm pleased I was able to participate in this landmark decision for the company and that we are optimizing shareholder value by creating 2 powerful investment opportunities. I am very confident in both companies' future growth prospects and look forward to their ongoing success.
And with that, I'll open up the call to Q&A."

And so I think our ability to talk value, but to talk value around pizzas, I think you'll see more of that going forward. So yes, the answer is we've got to focus on the core to strengthen our brand positioning. We've got to target value to increase transactions, such smart value across dayparts. We also have to, I think, improve our in-store experience in order to stay ahead with the competition. And I think the other thing we've got is to be leader in digital, we've got to stay relevant. And I think there's a lot of things that we can do in that market as well. To round out the answer, we've got about 5 value programs in test for Pizza Hut in China. We're starting to see some early encouraging results, but that's going to take us some time to get into the marketplace. And as Pat said, I think you'll see a much better second half than you'll see first half out of Pizza Hut China."

The first one being, when we look at the success of 3 global brands, particularly here in the U.S. in recent quarters, on both a sales and margin perspective, how should we think about that margin trajectory into this year. We've got easing costs. We've got very intense competition. How do we think about the margins for those 3 segments this year? And then, to follow that up, can you give us an update on the plans to refranchise those 3 brands, the plan to go from 91% to 95% by the end of '17? How is that progressing? And maybe to some extent, how does the success of those brands recently impact that refranchising effort?"

First, in terms of margin performance of the 3 global brands, bear in mind, our equity ownership in those 3 global brand businesses, I think, collectively, is in the order of 10%, so it's a franchise-driven business. But nonetheless, we do focus on restaurant margins above -- for the benefit of our company estate and importantly, to ensure that our franchisees are realizing good returns on their investment. I would say, overall, we're pleased with the progress we're making on margins for our KFC global division to improve about 1 percentage point versus last year. It was quite a significant accomplishment, a combination of same-store sales growth and productivity improvements contributing to that. At Pizza Hut, equally happy with the progress we've made this year, to your point, supported by commodity deflation as well as in the last quarter, some sales growth. And then for Taco Bell, another banner year, with restaurant margins on a full-year basis, around 22%. As we build on that momentum into next year, we are expecting our KFC and our Pizza Hut businesses to continue to realize margin improvement, aided by same-store sales leverage as well as a more modest commodity outlook than we've seen in some years before. In the case of Taco Bell, my expectation is that margins will be above 20%, perhaps a bit below where they were in this year because of the more aggressive push on value and a more tempered approach to pricing. And then in terms of the refranchising the teams are very much committed to realizing the objectives that we laid out to achieve 96% franchise ownership by the end of 2017. In the last 30 days, Greg and I had met with each one of the global brand divisions to review the refranchising plans, and there are very discreet plans around specific geographies and pacing associated with that. Given the complexity of some of these transactions, we expect the re-franchising activity will be more heavily concentrated in 2017."

And so that may mean that we wouldn't take pricing that we might have in the past to fully offset inflation. And we would be much happier with an outcome where we would build transactions with flat margins as opposed to growing margins. And so that's the outlook for China. As it relates to Taco Bell, I would say things are a little bit similar in the sense that the emphasis will be on value to build on the great momentum we had in 2015.

So we're spending a lot of time making sure that the margin improvements do not impact the customer experience.

I don't think a lot of this competition is going to try and scale up on a sort of broad scale like the Pizza Hut is. And then I think the last point or factor, I think would be aggregators, but that's a small percentage of total sales. So I would say, it's macros, its value, it's competition and it's aggregators. That would be -- I can't put a percentage on for you. I know you'd like it, but those would be the 4 factors. And that's why our response has to be focused on the core, to strengthen the brand positioning, target value-increased transactions, deliver the best in-store dining experience and then leading digital, as Pat said, whether it's free WiFi, queue ticketing, pre-ordering and then partnerships with people like Alipay and WeChat to drive cashless payment, as well as the loyalty program. So that's the things we're doing in response to the 4 things we see driving the sort of, I guess, the performance were not happy with Pizza Hut China."

Margins were up versus prior year about 4.5 percentage points, and here's how it breaks down. When you take the 4% pricing, add to it the mix benefit, and strip off the impact of the transaction decline, that's about a net 2-point benefit. On top of that, we had a 3-point benefit from productivity and another 1 point benefit from closed stores. Offsetting that was 1.5 margin attributable to inflation. Commodities were flat but we had 6% inflation on labor. And so that's basically the walk to the 4.5-point gain in margin versus the prior year. In terms of how we're thinking about 2016, as I mentioned before, the team is very much focused on building transactions. So while we do expect some modest inflation from a commodity perspective, up about 1% and high single digits for labor, we're not planning to take pricing to entirely offset that. We will look to some ongoing productivity improvements to help mitigate the impact of inflation. But the goal is to at least maintain margin year-over-year at around 16% and to achieve meaningful improvement in transactions."

We're looking to build awareness of the app to drive utilization, and an important part of that is the introduction of a loyalty component to the app, a game that was launched in late 2015. It's the first loyalty program of its kind that rewards social behavior. And the first reward that was offered for customers who played the game was a free Taco Bell freeze, so there was a lot of excitement around that. The app is also configured in the way the drives exploration of the menu. So it's helped to create a lot of buzz and a lot active engagement with our heavy users, very high levels of social sharing of the rewards we've observed, and the overall user response has been very positive.

Our view is that customers in lower-tier cities have been more significantly impacted by the softening economy, particularly around the industrial cities, which have been more heavily affected by China's slowing trade. But that's the only meaningful difference, really, to call out. And then as it relates to the Taco Bell G&A, as we mentioned, the increase in the fourth quarter was expected. And it's fair to characterize a large chunk of the incremental G&A as being nonrecurring. So some components would include performance-driven incentive compensation because they have an absolutely blockbuster year, and so they were paid accordingly. We planned for a 100% payout, so that contributes to year-over-year decline as we think about 2016. There were some investments that were made and some strategic growth initiatives. I would highlight international supply chain developments. I would also highlight the digital initiatives like the ones we just talked about, and so that contributed to a spike in the fourth quarter.

I'm pleased you could join us today as we share with you the opportunities ahead for Yum! as well as a review of our results.
Before we get started, I want to underscore what I presented at our Investor Day in December. 2016 will be a transformational year for Yum! as we complete the spinoff of our China division, ultimately creating 2 powerful independent, focused growth companies. The fundamental goal of Yum!, however, is unchanged. We are 100% dedicated to building and strengthening KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell all around the world as strong brands are critical to delivering sustained growth and creating shareholder value over the long term. I am pleased with the positive sales momentum we generated across the majority of Yum! in the fourth quarter. 
KFC China, for example, grew same-store sales 6% in the last quarter of 2015. This was a sequential improvement from the third quarter and in line with our expectations. Outside of China, each of our brand divisions grew same-store sales on a 1- and 2-year basis. Our U.S. results in the fourth quarter were particularly strong for all 3 brands, as KFC posted its sixth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth, Taco Bell continued to outperform the category and Pizza Hut grew same-store sales 2%. On a 2-year basis, our fourth quarter comps in the U.S. were the best of the year, with Pizza Hut at plus 2%, KFC at plus 8% and Taco Bell at plus 10%. These successes complemented our international results in the quarter where KFC posted 2% same-store sales growth, with solid results in both emerging and developed markets and Pizza Hut grew same-store sales 3% in emerging markets.
Fourth quarter EPS grew 11%, with full-year EPS growth of 3% in 2015 despite a 7% decline in the first half and a 6 percentage points of foreign currency headwinds. For the full year, our brand divisions collectively grew operating profit 8% in constant currency, which is in line with our ongoing growth model target. This was led by 12% operating profit growth at Taco Bell, a remarkable result given the significant investments we made in the fourth quarter to position the brand for continued momentum and category leadership for years to come. Operating profit grew 8% in constant currency in China, with impressive cost management partially offsetting weaker than originally expected sales results.
We opened more than 2,300 new units globally in 2015. And as I look forward, I expect 2016 to be a year of improved performance, building on the fourth quarter's momentum. This year, we expect to open nearly 2,400 new restaurants, which means we're opening over 6 restaurants a day, laying the groundwork for future growth. With all of this in mind, we are reiterating the guidance we gave you in December. Given the results we've seen year-to-date and the plans we've laid out at each of the brands, we are confident in our ability to deliver 10% operating profit growth in constant currency in 2016.
Now I'd like to discuss what gives me confidence in the future for each of our businesses. After that, Pat will walk you through the financials. So first, China. As I mentioned, KFC, which represents about 75% of the division's operating profit, grew same-store sales 6% in the fourth quarter, continuing the sequential improvement we saw throughout the year. System sales grew 9% in the quarter as we added 114 net new units, surpassing the 5,000 unit mark. I'm thrilled the China team is applying global best practices, fresh thinking and new insights to revitalize the brand and achieve traction with consumers. Early test results of proven global sales-driving tactics are encouraging, and the implementation of these programs should drive transactions and benefit the division later this year.
One example is box meals, which has proven successful globally, and we expect to be similarly well-received in China. I can assure you, we are taking the right steps to grow the business, and the momentum we are seeing makes me confident we will.
Pizza Hut Casual Dining in China, which represents about 25% of China's operating profit, has proven more challenging. System sales in constant currency grew 4% in the fourth quarter as we added 151 net new units, but same-store sales declined 8%. The macroeconomic environment and volatile stock market have impacted the casual dining segment, and we know we have to generate more exciting news and value to counter this headwind. We'll be more focused on value going forward, with workday lunch specials and value pieces as well as other initiatives to drive traffic. We have our work cut out for us here and we'll be moderating our development pace a bit this year. Nevertheless, the China team has a number of strategies and concepts in test that we expect to improve results. We know a substantial runway for new units and same-store sales growth for China's leading western casual dining brand.
Before I move on to the other divisions, I want to give you a quick update on January sales in China. We're encouraged by what we're seeing at KFC, but Pizza Hut sales remained soft. It's difficult to gauge exactly where the first quarter will finish, especially given the earlier timing of Chinese New Year. But at this point, we expect same-store sales growth to be up low single digits for the division, which sets us up well for the balance of the year. We expect solid KFC sales going forward. And even with the potential of negative results of Pizza Hut Casual Dining in the first half, we are reconfirming our full-year guidance for the China Division to generate same-store sales growth of 2% to 3%, operating profit growth of 10% in constant currency and to open 600 new restaurants.
Now turning to our 3 brand divisions. KFC is a franchise-led emerging powerhouse. Franchisees opened 85% of our 705 new international restaurants in 2015. Total system sales grew 11% in emerging markets for the year, with particular strength in Russia and Central and Eastern Europe. In fact, Russia has generated system sales growth of at least 40% in each of the last 4 years. I'm also encouraged by our recent performance in developed markets such as Australia, Japan and the United States. These results reinforce my confidence in the brand's ability to drive sales going forward. We don't only have an ability to generate meaningful growth in mature markets where we have a long-established presence, we also have tremendous potential in emerging markets where we have a significant lead over the competition. So we are taking our global brand identity and unifying that with local cultural insights to expand and grow our business all around the world. We are 100% focused on our real, authentic and freshly prepared food and merging that with value and innovation to drive results. On the international front, we've enjoyed success with lunch and dinner box meals, and we're delighted ideas created in United States are finding their way into the system. For example, we've just introduced Nashville Hot in the U.S. This is a spicy version of our crispy chicken inspired by one of Nashville's most famous dishes. The new unit pipeline in KFC remains impressive. In KFC's top 12 emerging markets, excluding China, we only have one restaurant per 1 million people. Today, with an aggregate population of 3 billion people in these markets, think of the potential.
Across the world, we have plans in place to grow sales and to build on the division's consistent operating growth performance. I am confident KFC will continue to excel and reward shareholders for years to come.
At Pizza Hut U.S. we are starting to turn the corner with our focused emphasis on making it easier to get a better pizza. This runs the gamut from improved operations and insight-driven food innovation to digital enhancements and consistent value. While we recognize there was a lot more work to do, we're now generating consistent positive transaction and same-store sales growth in the United States. Equally significant, and as you've heard in December, we reached an important agreement with our U.S. franchisees. Starting in January, we began an overhaul of our assets, replacing ovens and upgrading in-store technology. From a marketing calendar perspective, we are focused on a balanced approach. This begins with premium-priced innovation such as our recent launch of stuffed garlic knots pizza to protect and improve unit level economics. You may also have seen the launch of our $5 flavor menu, the most compelling value menu in the pizza business. In conjunction with our ongoing $6.99 any pairs deal, it will provide our customers with great value on an ongoing basis. We are encouraged by the start of the year at Pizza Hut in the United States, and we believe we have the right strategy going forward. Our international business at Pizza Hut is led by strength in emerging markets but offset by weakness in some of our developed markets. We believe we can apply best practices from the U.S. business to drive growth in these developed markets going forward.
Finally, Taco Bell delivered a fantastic 2015, surpassing $9 billion in system sales, and we expect a solid year in 2016 as well. Taco Bell is on the cutting edge of QSR, and is the industry gold standard for social engagement, product development, brand positioning and advertising. We have several new exciting products launching this year, including one we'll announce during the Super Bowl. So be sure to watch the first half to see the national introduction. Our innovation focus extends beyond just food. We are encouraged by early results of our delivery program and our developing expansion plans for additional cities. The addition of our loyalty program in November builds on our mobile app and will increase brand affinity as it rewards social behavior. Furthermore, we are focused on our core value messaging to drive transactions. We continue to build on our breakfast daypart, where sales are growing at twice the rate of our business as a whole. In fact, we grew breakfast transactions 6% in the fourth quarter. Given the brand's strong economics and broad franchise appeal, we continue to accelerate new unit openings both domestically and internationally, with a record number of U.S. openings in 2015 and expect to build upon this in 2016. I'm particularly excited that we're starting to get some traction expanding the brand internationally. We know this process will take time, but we're making real progress here. Our growth plans, both domestically and internationally, will lay the groundwork for higher operating profit growth in the years to come. With all this progress, you can see why I'm very excited about what's happening in our company. We are undertaking the biggest strategic move in the history of Yum! with our spin of the China business. We're confident this will create 2 large, optimally structured, independent companies with unique investment profiles. Yum! China will target 15% ongoing EPS growth, as its focus is solely on Mainland China and will pay the new Yum! a 3% license fee. New Yum! will become a high-margin global franchise company targeting 15% shareholder return. Recapitalization plans are underway and will be completed in the first half of this year. We see substantial value in our share at current prices as we have repurchased 23 million shares from the announcement of the separation through last night. I want to assure you that while the spin-off transaction is critically important, we're not going to let it distract us from running the business in China or anywhere else. All 3 of our brands have significant opportunities for growth as they progress along the journey to brand excellence. We expect to achieve 10% constant currency growth in operating profit this year as a company and are setting up 2 separate companies that will lead the restaurant industry going forward.
Yum! is in a unique position. We have 3 iconic brands and are making them even stronger. As you've heard me say before, my goal as CEO is to build 3 global iconic brands that people trust and champion. We are well on our way to achieving this, led by our brand positioning, courageous leadership and committed team members and franchisees. Needless to say, there's a lot to be excited about at Yum!, and I could not be more pleased to lead this company into its next phase. Finally, as you all know, this is Pat's last earnings call with Yum!, and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank him for his leadership, his hard work and unwavering drive to raise the bar at Yum!. He will be missed across the organization. As you may have seen in our 8-K filing, we've appointed our current Corporate Controller, Dave Russell, as interim CFO. And I look forward to working with him while we complete our search for a permanent CFO.
And with that, it gives me great pleasure to hand the call over to Pat."

In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: our fourth quarter results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on the separation of our China business. I, too, am pleased with the overall sales momentum that we demonstrated in the fourth quarter, where EPS excluding special items grew 11%. Reported EPS growth was considerably higher as last year's fourth quarter included a noncash special item charge related to the impairment of our Little Sheep concept in China. Excluding special items and the impact of foreign exchange, operating profit grew a healthy 17% in the fourth quarter, led by system sales growth of 6% and restaurant margin improvement of over 3 percentage points.
I'll now take you through our results by division, starting with our China business. For the division overall, same-store sales grew 2% in the fourth quarter. As we preannounced, KFC grew same-store sales 6%, which was sequentially better than Q3 as we expected. We're encouraged by the positive momentum in our KFC China business, particularly as it is sustained into the new year. Same-store sales at Pizza Hut Casual Dining, however, have remained sluggish and declined 8% in the fourth quarter. As Greg said, the China team is addressing this matter with urgency, and we will update you on our progress throughout the year. Restaurant margin management continues to be a bright spot in China's performance. For the fourth quarter, China restaurant margins improved more than 4 percentage points versus prior year to 11.4%, helped by sales leverage at KFC and productivity improvements across the division, more than offsetting sales deleverage at Pizza Hut. As a reminder, our fourth quarter is a seasonally low sales period for the China Division, so the absolute restaurant margin tends to be lower at that time of year. Full-year restaurant margin was 15.9% for the division, an improvement of 1 full percentage point. It's not often that you see restaurant margins expand with declining sales, so this highlights the extent of the China team's efforts to improve profitability through cost controls. I'm proud of the team's continued focus on productivity and confident this bodes well for future profit growth in China as same-store sales continue to recover and unlock significant profit leverage in the business. Given our continued strong belief in China's long-term growth potential, and encouraged by continued strong cash paybacks on new units, we opened 743 new restaurants in 2015. And while we are prudently dialing back the pace of new unit development in 2016, targeting about 600 new restaurant openings, we'd also expect fewer closures this year, so our net new units will be similar to 2015. Our decision to temper the pace of development balances the reality of current market conditions, with the opportunities we have to enter new trade zones and expand our presence in existing ones. We are also making good progress on modernizing our estate. In 2015, we remodeled about 500 restaurants in China, and we plan to remodel about another 550 in 2016. By the end of this year, we will have remodeled or newly built about 45% or nearly half of our China estate in a 3-year period.
Now moving to our global KFC Division, which posted its eighth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth. System sales growth was especially strong in emerging markets, up 10% led by Russia and Southeast Asia. International developed markets also delivered solid system sales growth, up 6% led by Australia, Japan and Western Europe. And the U.S. recorded its sixth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth at 3%. Restaurant margins grew 90 basis points to 14.7% in the quarter and improved 150 basis points for the year to nearly 15%. Operating profit grew 7% in the quarter before the impact of foreign currency translation. Adjusting this for the lack of a onetime favorable pension resolution, as well as incremental advertising expense associated with our U.S. acceleration agreement, operating profit grew 11% in the quarter, roughly in line with KFC's ongoing growth model. Importantly, KFC set another new record for international development in 2015 opening 705 new restaurants, demonstrating the power of this global iconic brand. Our global Pizza Hut division delivered 1% same-store sales growth for the quarter, led by 2% same-store sales growth in our U.S. business, which accounts for about half of division system sales. Operating profit improved 6% in constant currency, driven by higher franchise fees and higher restaurant margins, partially offset by an increase in U.S. G&A, including severance and other onetime costs. Restaurant margins actually improved 240 basis points in constant currency for the quarter, driven by same-store sales leverage and commodity deflation. For the year, Pizza Hut opened 429 new international units. While this was below our initial forecast for 2015, we now have a more robust development pipeline and are confident that we'll open at least 525 new international units in 2016. Finally, Taco Bell posted 4% same-store sales growth in the quarter. Restaurant margin improved 3.1 percentage points to 23.7%, raising full-year margins to approximately 22%, a remarkable achievement for this powerhouse brand. Operating profit, however, declined 7% in the fourth quarter due to an expected increase in G&A related to performance-based incentive compensation, strategic growth investments including restaurant technology and international supply chain and other nonrecurring costs. We believe these investments will strengthen the brand and help to sustain positive momentum in the business. As evidence of the onetime nature of these expenses, we actually expect Taco Bell's G&A will decline in 2016. Additionally, we expect restaurant margins to remain above 20% even with our more aggressive push on value. 
On the development front, we opened 276 new stores in 2015. This included 41 units outside the U.S., 4x the number we opened in 2014, demonstrating the progress we're making to ramp up international development. 87% of the division's new restaurants were opened by franchisees, reflecting the attractive investment returns that the Taco Bell brand generates. 
I'd now like to talk about our 2016 outlook. Supported by the results we've seen year-to-date, we continue to expect to deliver operating profit growth of 10% in constant currency this year. And while I won't be providing quarterly guidance, I would like to point out that certain brands are facing hurdles, both prior year lapse and timing of current year expenses which will weigh on first half results. As a consequence, we expect second half operating profit growth will be directionally stronger in the first half. This is consistent with our plans coming into the year, and we remained confident we will achieve our full year operating profit guidance.
Now I'd like to quickly cover off our spin-off plans. We're making good progress and are on track to complete the separation of our China business by the end of this year. A major part of our plan is to optimize the capital structure of Yum! Brands and return $6.2 billion to shareholders prior to the separation through the issuance of new debt. From the time we announced the separation through last night, we repurchased 23 million shares. While our weighted average basic share count for the quarter was $433 million, our basic share count as of February 2, 2016, was $411 million. We see value in repurchasing our shares that we consider to be a discounted price and view this as a prudent use of shareholder capital. 
I'm also happy to report that we're on scheduled to complete our recapitalization in the first half of the year, issuing incremental debt of approximately $5.2 billion and plan to maintain roughly 5x EBITDA leverage going forward. We're now in the process of finalizing the form and timing of this financing. Now I'm sure you've noticed the volatility in the high-yield debt market, particularly within the energy and materials sectors. We'll continue to watch this closely, but we're pleased that the rates on our future debt remain very attractive on a historic basis, and we're full steam ahead with our plans.
So let me wrap things up. 2016 will be an exciting year for Yum! Brands. Not only do we expect to deliver 10% operating profit growth in constant currency, but we're proceeding as expected with the separation of our China Division into an independent publicly traded company. Yum! China will have no external debt, and will self-fund growth capital, while generating significant free cash flow in year 1 and on an ongoing basis. The new Yum! will be a global diversified franchise company with an optimal capital structure. By 2017, we will be 96% franchised with a stable but fast-growing free cash flow stream. I'm pleased I was able to participate in this landmark decision for the company and that we are optimizing shareholder value by creating 2 powerful investment opportunities. I am very confident in both companies' future growth prospects and look forward to their ongoing success.
And with that, I'll open up the call to Q&A."

Well, I think first of all, obviously, the macros which have got worse since December, since we're all together in December, and I think we all know that macros impact casual dining more than they impact QSR. So I think there's definitely that issue. I would agree with you that we do not have enough value news to overcome this backdrop. I think we've also -- as we've spoken about on previous calls, there's a lot of discussion around steak and fajitas, and there wasn't as much discussion, if you just think about it, around pizzas. And so I think our ability to talk value, but to talk value around pizzas, I think you'll see more of that going forward. So yes, the answer is we've got to focus on the core to strengthen our brand positioning. We've got to target value to increase transactions, such a smart value across dayparts. We also have to, I think, improve our in-store experience in order to stay ahead with the competition. And I think the other thing we've got is -- is to be a leader in digital, we've got to stay relevant. And I think there's a lot of things that we can do in that market as well. To round out the answer, we've got about 5 value programs in test for Pizza Hut in China. We're starting to see some early encouraging results, but that's going to take us some time to get into the marketplace.

First, in terms of margin performance of the 3 global brands, bear in mind, our equity ownership in those 3 global brand businesses, I think, collectively, is on the order of 10%, so it's a franchise-driven business. But nonetheless, we do focus on restaurant margins both for the benefit of our company estate and importantly, to ensure that our franchisees are realizing good returns on their investment. I would say, overall, we're pleased with the progress we're making on margins for our KFC global division to improve about 1 percentage point versus last year. It was quite a significant accomplishment, a combination of same-store sales growth and productivity improvements contributing to that. At Pizza Hut, equally happy with the progress we've made this year, to your point, supported by commodity deflation as well as in the last quarter, some sales growth. And then for Taco Bell, another banner year, with restaurant margins on a full-year basis, around 22%. As we build on that momentum into next year, we are expecting our KFC and our Pizza Hut businesses to continue to realize margin improvement aided by same-store sales leverage as well as a more modest commodity outlook than we've seen in some years before. In the case of Taco Bell, my expectation is that margins will be above 20%, perhaps a bit below where they were in this year because of the more aggressive push on value and a more tempered approach to pricing. And then in terms of the refranchising, the teams are very much committed to realizing the objectives that we laid out to achieve 96% franchise ownership by the end of 2017. In the last 30 days, Greg and I had met with each one of the global brand divisions to review the refranchising plans, and there are very discreet plans around specific geographies and pacing associated with that. Given the complexity of some of these transactions, we expect the re-franchising activity will be more heavily concentrated in 2017."

And so that may mean that we wouldn't take pricing that we might have in the past to fully offset inflation. And we would be much happier with an outcome where we would build transactions with flat margins as opposed to growing margins. And so that's the outlook for China.

I think the -- certainly, the customer metrics -- certainly, on KFC, the customer metrics are now back pre the incident. So I think it doesn't matter what metrics you look at. I would say all of those metrics are, obviously, way back. In an absolute sense, the Pizza Hut metrics are actually higher than the KFC metrics, probably hadn't regained as much momentum, but they're, in an absolute sense, higher. I think the other thing, just to address your question is, there's a lot of work being done on menu simplification as well. And so I think what we've got to do is, obviously, besides looking at labor and other cost that go into it, how do we simplify the menu so that we make it easier for the customer to speed up the experience. In KFC's case or in Pizza Hut's case, I think, really deliver the best casual dining in-store experience in order to stay ahead. So there's a number of initiatives around. Simplified menu boards, box meals, make it actually easier for the customer to order rather than standing in queue and lining up. So we're spending a lot of time making sure that the margin improvements do not impact the customer experience. And all of the evidence that I can see suggests that there is no impact on the customer experience, and Micky has the bit between the teeth on improving the speed of service, particularly in KFC, and there's a number of initiatives in place that I think will actually enhance that experience, enhance throughput and, obviously, lead to sales and transaction growth."

And you have to think about that in the context of where average unit volumes are today, and where we know they can go. We're not putting a time frame on it, but we know there's enormous profit leverage in the business, given all the productivity gains that have been made in the last 2 to 3 years and that as the same-store sales continue to recover, we'll see significant margin improvement. To your point, that is up from comps. But I also wouldn't underestimate the opportunity for the China team to continue to realize some structural improvements in the business. They've consistently delivered well beyond our expectations, they have enormous capability, and I think the next leg of productivity improvement in the restaurants will be unlocked by technology. And it's fair to say that the digital capabilities of our China business are the best that we have in our entire company, and we're all very excited about how that's going to transform the customer experience. And that will unlock further productivity opportunity in our restaurants and contribute to that improving margin over time."

We don't have, obviously, the sort of information we have in the U.S. You don't have Crest and NPD data to try and get to specifics that you're asking. But I think we all know, and we've seen this not just in China but outside, that casual dining is impacted by macros. It's just what happens. And it always has a bigger impact on casual dining when macros are volatile and changing than it does on the QSR business. So if I was to say, what are the 4 factors, I would say macros. I think the second one would be we do not have enough value news in order to overcome this sort of macro backdrop, which is why we've got a number of macro tests in the marketplace right now. And obviously, with a sense of urgency, we need to get these tests into the marketplace. I think there is definitely competition, there's definitely more competition in the marketplace. I don't think a lot of this competition is going to try and scale up on a sort of broad scale like the Pizza Hut is. And then I think the last point or factor, I think would be aggregators, but that's a small percentage of total sales. So I would say it's macros, it's value, it's competition and it's aggregators. That would be -- I can't put a percentage on for you. I know you'd like it, but those would be the 4 factors. And that's why our response has to be focus on the core to strengthen the brand positioning, target value-increased transactions, deliver the best in-store dining experience and then leading digital, as Pat said, whether it's free WiFi, queue ticketing, pre-ordering and then partnerships with people like Alipay and WeChat to drive cashless payment, as well as the loyalty program. So that's the things we're doing in response to the 4 things we see driving the sort of, I guess, the performance we're not happy with in Pizza Hut China."

Margins were up versus prior year about 4.5 percentage points, and here's how it breaks down. When you take the 4% pricing, add to it the mix benefit, and strip off the impact of the transaction decline, that's about a net 2-point benefit. On top of that, we had a 3-point benefit from productivity and another 1 point benefit from closed stores. Offsetting that was 1.5 margin attributable to inflation. Commodities were flat but we had 6% inflation on labor. And so that's basically the walk to the 4.5-point gain in margin versus prior year. In terms of how we're thinking about 2016, as I mentioned before, the team is very much focused on building transactions. So while we do expect some modest inflation from a commodity perspective, up about 1% and high single digits for labor, we're not planning to take pricing to entirely offset that. We will look to some ongoing productivity improvements to help mitigate the impact of inflation. But the goal is to at least maintain margin year-over-year at around 16% and to achieve meaningful improvement in transactions."

When we look at the behavior of those customers who were ordering through the app, the average check is higher by about 30%. So we're very much encouraged by those early results. We're looking to build awareness of the app to drive utilization, and an important part of that is the introduction of a loyalty component to the app, a game that was launched in late 2015. It's the first loyalty program of its kind that rewards social behavior. And the first reward that was offered for customers who played the game was a free Taco Bell freeze, so there was a lot of excitement around that. The app is also configured in a way that drives exploration of the menu. So it's helped to create a lot of buzz and a lot of active engagement with our heavy users, very high levels of social sharing of the rewards we've observed, and the overall user response has been very positive.

So first, on China, same-store sales, similar to recent quarters, performance was stronger in Tier 1 cities for both brands. Our view is that customers in lower-tier cities have been more significantly impacted by the softening economy, particularly around the industrial cities, which have been more heavily affected by China's slowing export trade. But that's the only meaningful difference, really, to call out. And then as it relates to Taco Bell G&A, as we mentioned, the increase in the fourth quarter was expected. And it's fair to characterize a large chunk of the incremental G&A as being nonrecurring. So some components would include performance-driven incentive compensation because they had an absolutely blockbuster year, and so they were paid accordingly. We planned for a 100% payout, so that contributes to a year-over-year decline as we think about 2016. There were some investments that were made and some strategic growth initiatives. I would highlight international supply chain developments. I would also highlight the digital initiatives like the ones we just talked about, and so that contributed to a spike in the fourth quarter. And importantly, we think about those as investments to sustain the positive momentum of the brand. I think good businesses that are strong-performing businesses reinvest profit upside to sustain the momentum, and that's exactly what's happened to Taco Bell."

I'm pleased you could join us today as we share with you the opportunities ahead for Yum! as well as a review of our results.
Before we get started, I want to underscore what I presented at our Investor Day in December. 2016 will be a transformational year for Yum! as we complete the spin-off of our China division, ultimately creating 2 powerful independent, focused growth companies. The fundamental goal of Yum!, however, is unchanged. We are 100% dedicated to building and strengthening KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell all around the world as strong brands are critical to delivering sustained growth and creating shareholder value over the long term. I am pleased with the positive sales momentum we generated across the majority of Yum! in the fourth quarter. 
KFC China, for example, grew same-store sales 6% in the last quarter of 2015. This was a sequential improvement from the third quarter and in line with our expectations. Outside of China, each of our brand divisions grew same-store sales on a 1- and 2-year basis. Our U.S. results in the fourth quarter were particularly strong for all 3 brands, as KFC posted its sixth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth, Taco Bell continued to outperform the category and Pizza Hut grew same-store sales 2%. On a 2-year basis, our fourth quarter comps in the U.S. were the best of the year, with Pizza Hut at plus 2%, KFC at plus 8% and Taco Bell at plus 10%. These successes  complemented our international results in the quarter where KFC posted 2% same-store sales growth, with solid results in both emerging and developed markets and Pizza Hut grew same-store sales 3% in emerging markets.
Fourth quarter EPS grew 11%, with full-year EPS growth of 3% in 2015 despite a 7% decline in the first half and a 6 percentage points of foreign currency headwinds. For the full year, our brand divisions collectively grew operating profit 8% in constant currency, which is in line with our ongoing growth model target. This was led by 12% operating profit growth at Taco Bell, a remarkable result given the significant investments we made in the fourth quarter to position the brand for continued momentum and category leadership for years to come. Operating profit grew 8% in constant currency in China, with impressive cost management partially offsetting weaker than originally expected sales results.
We opened more than 2,300 new units globally in 2015. And as I look forward, I expect 2016 to be a year of improved performance, building on the fourth quarter's momentum. This year, we expect to open nearly 2,400 new restaurants, which means we're opening over 6 restaurants a day, laying the groundwork for future growth. With all of this in mind, we are reiterating the guidance we gave you in December. Given the results we've seen year-to-date and the plans we've laid out at each of the brands, we are confident in our ability to deliver 10% operating profit growth in constant currency in 2016.
Now I'd like to discuss what gives me confidence in the future for each of our businesses. After that, Pat will walk you through the financials. So first, China. As I mentioned, KFC, which represents about 75% of the division's operating profit, grew same-store sales 6% in the fourth quarter, continuing the sequential improvement we saw throughout the year. System sales grew 9% in the quarter as we added 114 net new units, surpassing the 5,000 unit mark. I'm thrilled the China team is applying global best practices, fresh thinking and new insights to revitalize the brand and achieve traction with consumers. Early test results of proven global sales-driving tactics are encouraging, and the implementation of these programs should drive transactions and benefit the division later this year.
One example is box meals, which has proven successful globally, and we expect to be similarly well-received in China. I can assure you, we are taking the right steps to grow the business, and the momentum we are seeing makes me confident we will.
Pizza Hut Casual Dining in China, which represents about 25% of China's operating profit, has proven more challenging. System sales in constant currency grew 4% in the fourth quarter as we added 151 net new units, but same-store sales declined 8%. The macroeconomic environment and volatile stock market have impacted the casual dining segment, and we know we have to generate more exciting news and value to counter this headwind. We'll be more focused on value going forward, with workday lunch specials and value pieces as well as other initiatives to drive traffic. We have our work cut out for us  here and we'll be moderating our development pace a bit this year. Nevertheless, the China team has a number of strategies and concepts in test that we expect to improve results. We know there's a substantial runway for the new units and same-store sales growth for China's leading western casual dining brand.
Before I move on to the other divisions, I want to give you a quick update on January sales in China. We're encouraged by what we're seeing at KFC, but Pizza Hut sales remained soft. It's difficult to gauge exactly where the first quarter will finish, especially given the earlier timing of Chinese New Year. But at this point, we expect same-store sales growth to be up low single digits for the division, which sets us up well for the balance of the year. We expect solid KFC sales going forward. And even with the potential of negative results of Pizza Hut Casual Dining in the first half, we are reconfirming our full-year guidance for the China Division to generate same-store sales growth of 2% to 3%, operating profit growth of 10% in constant currency and to open 600 new restaurants.
Now turning to our 3 brand divisions. KFC is a franchise-led emerging powerhouse. Franchisees opened 85% of our 705 new international restaurants in 2015. Total system sales grew 11% in emerging markets for the year, with particular strength in Russia and Central and Eastern Europe. In fact, Russia has generated system sales growth of at least 40% in each of the last 4 years. I'm also encouraged by our recent performance in developed markets such as Australia, Japan and the United States. These results reinforce my confidence in the brand's ability to drive sales going forward. We don't only have an ability to generate meaningful growth in mature markets where we have a long-established presence, we also have tremendous potential in emerging markets where we have a significant lead over the competition. So we are taking our global brand identity and unifying that with local cultural insights to expand and grow our business all around the world. We are 100% focused on our real, authentic and freshly prepared food and merging that with value and innovation to drive results. On the international front, we've enjoyed success with lunch and dinner box meals, and we're delighted ideas created in United States are finding their way into the system. For example, we've just introduced Nashville Hot in the U.S. This is a spicy version of our crispy chicken inspired by one of Nashville's most famous dishes. The new unit pipeline in KFC remains impressive. In KFC's top 12 emerging markets, excluding China, we only have one restaurant per 1 million people. Today, with an aggregate population of 3 billion people in these markets, think of the potential.
Across the world, we have plans in place to grow sales and to build on the division's consistent operating growth performance. I am confident KFC will continue to excel and reward shareholders for years to come.
At Pizza Hut U.S. we are starting to turn the corner with our focused emphasis on making it easier to get a better pizza. This runs the gamut from improved operations and insight-driven food innovation to digital enhancements and consistent value. While we recognize there is a lot more work to do, we're now generating consistent positive transaction and same-store sales growth in the United States. Equally significant, and as you've heard in December, we reached an important agreement with our U.S. franchisees. Starting in January, we began an overhaul of our assets, replacing ovens and upgrading in-store technology. From a marketing calendar perspective, we are focused on a balanced approach. This begins with premium-priced innovation such as our recent launch of stuffed garlic knots pizza to protect and improve unit level economics. You may also have seen the launch of our $5 flavor menu, the most compelling value menu in the pizza business. In conjunction with our ongoing $6.99 any pairs deal, it will provide our customers with great value on an ongoing basis. We are encouraged by the start of the year at Pizza Hut in the United States, and we believe we have the right strategy going forward. Our international business at Pizza Hut is led by strength in emerging markets but offset by weakness in some of our developed markets. We believe we can apply best practices from the U.S. business to drive growth in these developed markets going forward.
Finally, Taco Bell delivered a fantastic 2015, surpassing $9 billion in system sales, and we expect a solid year in 2016 as well. Taco Bell is on the cutting edge of QSR, and is the industry gold standard for social engagement, product development, brand positioning and advertising. We have several new exciting products launching this year, including one we'll announce during the Super Bowl. So be sure to watch the first half to see the national introduction. Our innovation focus extends beyond just food. We are encouraged by early results of our delivery program and our developing expansion plans for additional cities. The addition of our loyalty program in November builds on our mobile app and will increase brand affinity as it rewards social behavior. Furthermore, we are focused on our core value messaging to drive transactions. We continue to build on our breakfast daypart, where sales are growing at twice the rate of our business as a whole. In fact, we grew breakfast transactions 6% in the fourth quarter. Given the brand's strong economics and broad franchise appeal, we continue to accelerate new unit openings both domestically and internationally, with a record number of U.S. openings in 2015 and expect to build upon this in 2016. I'm particularly excited that we're starting to get some traction expanding the brand internationally. We know this process will take time, but we're making real progress here. Our growth plans, both domestically and internationally, will lay the groundwork for higher operating profit growth in the years to come. With all this progress, you can see why I'm very excited about what's happening in our company. We are undertaking the biggest strategic move in the history of Yum! with our spin-off of the China business. We're confident this will create 2 large, optimally structured, independent companies with unique investment profiles. Yum! China will target 15% ongoing EPS growth, as its focus is solely on Mainland China and will pay the new Yum! a 3% license fee. New Yum! will become a high-margin global franchise company targeting 15% shareholder return. Recapitalization plans are underway and will be completed in the first half of this year. We see substantial value in our shares at current prices as we have repurchased 23 million shares from the announcement of the separation through last night. I want to assure you that while the spin-off transaction is critically important, we're not going to let it distract us from running the business in China or anywhere else. All 3 of our brands have significant opportunities for growth as they progress along the journey to brand excellence. We expect to achieve 10% constant currency growth in operating profit this year as a company and are setting up 2 separate companies that will lead the restaurant industry going forward.
Yum! is in a unique position. We have 3 iconic brands and are making them even stronger. As you've heard me say before, my goal as CEO is to build 3 global iconic brands that people trust and champion. We are well on our way to achieving this, led by our brand positioning, courageous leadership and committed team members and franchisees. Needless to say, there's a lot to be excited about at Yum!, and I could not be more pleased to lead this company into its next phase. Finally, as you all know, this is Pat's last earnings call with Yum!, and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank him for his leadership, his hard work and unwavering drive to raise the bar at Yum!. He will be missed across the organization. As you may have seen in our 8-K filing, we've appointed our current Corporate Controller, Dave Russell, as interim CFO. And I look forward to working with him while we complete our search for a permanent CFO.
And with that, it gives me great pleasure to hand the call over to Pat."

In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: our fourth quarter results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on the separation of our China business. I, too, am pleased with the overall sales momentum that we demonstrated in the fourth quarter, where EPS excluding special items grew 11%. Reported EPS growth was considerably higher as last year's fourth quarter included a noncash special item charge related to the impairment of our Little Sheep concept in China. Excluding special items and the impact of foreign exchange, operating profit grew a healthy 17% in the fourth quarter, led by system sales growth of 6% and restaurant margin improvement of over 3 percentage points.
I'll now take you through our results by division, starting with our China business. For the division overall, same-store sales grew 2% in the fourth quarter. As we preannounced, KFC grew same-store sales 6%, which was sequentially better than Q3 as we expected. We're encouraged by the positive momentum in our KFC China business, particularly as it is sustained into the new year. Same-store sales at Pizza Hut Casual Dining, however, have remained sluggish and declined 8% in the fourth quarter. As Greg said, the China team is addressing this matter with urgency, and we will update you on our progress throughout the year. Restaurant margin management continues to be a bright spot in China's performance. For the fourth quarter, China restaurant margins improved more than 4 percentage points versus prior year to 11.4%, helped by sales leverage at KFC and productivity improvements across the division, more than offsetting sales deleverage at Pizza Hut. As a reminder, our fourth quarter is a seasonally low sales period for the China Division, so the absolute restaurant margin tends to be lower at that time of year. Full-year restaurant margin was 15.9% for the division, an improvement of 1 full percentage point. It's not often that you see restaurant margins expand with declining sales, so this highlights the extent of the China team's efforts to improve profitability through cost controls. I'm proud of the team's continued focus on productivity and confident this bodes well for future profit growth in China as same-store sales continue to recover and unlock significant profit leverage in the business. Given our continued strong belief in China's long-term growth potential, and encouraged by continued strong cash paybacks on new units, we opened 743 new restaurants in 2015. And while we are prudently dialing back the pace of new unit development in 2016, targeting about 600 new restaurant openings, we'd also expect fewer closures this year, so our net new units will be similar to 2015. Our decision to temper the pace of development balances the reality of current market conditions, with the opportunities we have to enter new trade zones and expand our presence in existing ones. We are also making good progress on modernizing our estate. In 2015, we remodeled about 500 restaurants in China, and we plan to remodel about another 550 in 2016. By the end of this year, we will have remodeled or newly built about 45% or nearly half of our China estate in a 3-year period.
Now moving to our global KFC Division, which posted its eighth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth. System sales growth was especially strong in emerging markets, up 10% led by Russia and Southeast Asia. International developed markets also delivered solid system sales growth, up 6% led by Australia, Japan and Western Europe. And the U.S. recorded its sixth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth at 3%. Restaurant margins grew 90 basis points to 14.7% in the quarter and improved 150 basis points for the year to nearly 15%. Operating profit grew 7% in the quarter before the impact of foreign currency translation. Adjusting this for the lap of a onetime favorable pension resolution, as well as incremental advertising expense associated with our U.S. acceleration agreement, operating profit grew 11% in the quarter, roughly in line with KFC's ongoing growth model. Importantly, KFC set another new record for international development in 2015 opening 705 new restaurants, demonstrating the power of this global iconic brand. Our global Pizza Hut division delivered 1% same-store sales growth for the quarter, led by 2% same-store sales growth in our U.S. business, which accounts for about half of division system sales. Operating profit improved 6% in constant currency, driven by higher franchise fees and higher restaurant margins, partially offset by an increase in U.S. G&A, including severance and other onetime costs. Restaurant margins actually improved 240 basis points in constant currency for the quarter, driven by same-store sales leverage and commodity deflation. For the year, Pizza Hut opened 429 new international units. While this was below our initial forecast for 2015, we now have a more robust development pipeline and are confident that we'll open at least 525 new international units in 2016. Finally, Taco Bell posted 4% same-store sales growth in the quarter. Restaurant margin improved 3.1 percentage points to 23.7%, raising full-year margins to approximately 22%, a remarkable achievement for this powerhouse brand. Operating profit, however, declined 7% in the fourth quarter due to an expected increase in G&A related to performance-based incentive compensation, strategic growth investments including restaurant technology and international supply chain and other nonrecurring costs. We believe these investments will strengthen the brand and help to sustain positive momentum in the business. As evidence of the onetime nature of these expenses, we actually expect Taco Bell's G&A will decline in 2016. Additionally, we expect restaurant margins to remain above 20% even with our more aggressive push on value. 
On the development front, we opened 276 new stores in 2015. This included 41 units outside the U.S., 4x the number we opened in 2014, demonstrating the progress we're making to ramp up international development. 87% of the division's new restaurants were opened by franchisees, reflecting the attractive investment returns that the Taco Bell brand generates. 
I'd now like to talk about our 2016 outlook. Supported by the results we've seen year-to-date, we continue to expect to deliver operating profit growth of 10% in constant currency this year. And while I won't be providing quarterly guidance, I would like to point out that certain brands are facing hurdles, both prior year lapse and timing of current year expenses which will weigh on first half results. As a consequence, we expect second half operating profit growth will be directionally stronger in the first half. This is consistent with our plans coming into the year, and we remained confident we will achieve our full year operating profit guidance.
Now I'd like to quickly cover off our spin-off plans. We're making good progress and are on track to complete the separation of our China business by the end of this year. A major part of our plan is to optimize the capital structure of Yum! Brands and return $6.2 billion to shareholders prior to the separation through the issuance of new debt. From the time we announced the separation through last night, we repurchased 23 million shares. While our weighted average basic share count for the quarter was $433 million, our basic share count as of February 2, 2016, was $411 million. We see value in repurchasing our shares that we consider to be a discounted price and view this as a prudent use of shareholder capital. 
I'm also happy to report that we're on schedule to complete our recapitalization in the first half of the year, issuing incremental debt of approximately $5.2 billion and plan to maintain roughly 5x EBITDA leverage going forward. We're now in the process of finalizing the form and timing of this financing. Now I'm sure you've noticed the volatility in the high-yield debt market, particularly within the energy and materials sectors. We'll continue to watch this closely, but we're pleased that the rates on our future debt remain very attractive on a historic basis, and we're full steam ahead with our plans.
So let me wrap things up. 2016 will be an exciting year for Yum! Brands. Not only do we expect to deliver 10% operating profit growth in constant currency, but we're proceeding as expected with the separation of our China Division into an independent, publicly traded company. Yum! China will have no external debt, and will self-fund  growth capital, while generating significant free cash flow in year 1 and on an ongoing basis. The new Yum! will be a global diversified franchise company with an optimal capital structure. By 2017, we will be 96% franchised with a stable but fast-growing free cash flow stream. I'm pleased I was able to participate in this landmark decision for the company and that we are optimizing shareholder value by creating 2 powerful investment opportunities. I am very confident in both companies' future growth prospects and look forward to their ongoing success.
And with that, I'll open up the call to Q&A."

So I think there's definitely that issue. I would agree with you that we do not have enough value news to overcome this backdrop. I think we've also -- as we've spoken about on previous calls, there's a lot of discussion around steak and fajitas, and there wasn't as much discussion, if you just think about it, around pizzas. And so I think our ability to talk value, but to talk value around pizzas, I think you'll see more of that going forward. So yes, the answer is we've got to focus on the core to strengthen our brand positioning. We've got to target value to increase transactions, such as smart value across dayparts. We also have to, I think, improve our in-store experience in order to stay ahead with the competition. And I think the other thing we've got is -- is to be a leader in digital, we've got to stay relevant. And I think there's a lot of things that we can do in that market as well. To round out the answer, we've got about 5 value programs in test for Pizza Hut in China. We're starting to see some early encouraging results, but that's going to take us some time to get into the marketplace.

First, in terms of margin performance of the 3 global brands, bear in mind, our equity ownership in those 3 global brand businesses, I think, collectively, is on the order of 10%, so it's a franchise-driven business. But nonetheless, we do focus on restaurant margins both  for the benefit of our company estate and importantly, to ensure that our franchisees are realizing good returns on their investment. I would say, overall, we're pleased with the progress we're making on margins for our KFC global division to improve about 1 percentage point versus last year. It was quite a significant accomplishment, a combination of same-store sales growth and productivity improvements contributing to that. At Pizza Hut, equally happy with the progress we've made this year, to your point, supported by commodity deflation as well as in the last quarter, some sales growth. And then for Taco Bell, another banner year, with restaurant margins on a full-year basis, around 22%. As we build on that momentum into next year, we are expecting our KFC and our Pizza Hut businesses to continue to realize margin improvement aided by same-store sales leverage as well as a more modest commodity outlook than we've seen in some years before. In the case of Taco Bell, my expectation is that margins will be above 20%, perhaps a bit below where they were in this year because of the more aggressive push on value and a more tempered approach to pricing. And then in terms of the refranchising, the teams are very much committed to realizing the objectives that we laid out to achieve 96% franchise ownership by the end of 2017. In the last 30 days, Greg and I had met with each one of the global brand divisions to review the refranchising plans, and there are very discreet plans around specific geographies and pacing associated with that. Given the complexity of some of these transactions, we expect the re-franchising activity will be more heavily concentrated in 2017."

And so that may mean that we wouldn't take pricing that we might have in the past to fully offset inflation. And we would be much happier with an outcome where we would build transactions with flat margins as opposed to growing margins. And so that's the outlook for China.

But again, we're not expecting to fully offset that through pricing as maybe  has been our past practice as a team, as we're focusing on building transactions. And we are counting on continued productivity improvements, but probably not the heroic improvements that we've seen in years past. If we do better than 2% to 3% comps in 2016, we would expect margin to improve, but we're not planning for that right now. The other variable, though, is labor efficiency because the team, let's face it, has consistently surprised us to the upside, and that could provide  further tailwind to China margins in 2016. We think, at this stage, guiding about flat margins year-over-year is appropriate."

I think the other thing, just to address your question is, there's a lot of work being done on menu simplification as well. And so I think what we've got to do is, obviously, besides looking at labor and other cost that go into it, how do we simplify the menu so that we make it easier for the customer to speed up the experience. In KFC's case or in Pizza Hut's case, I think, really deliver the best casual dining in-store experience in order to stay ahead. So there's a number of initiatives around. Simplified menu boards, box meals,  make it actually easier for the customer to order rather than standing in queue and lining up. So we're spending a lot of time making sure that the margin improvements do not impact the customer experience. And all of the evidence that I can see suggests that there is no impact on the customer experience, and Micky has the bit between the teeth on improving the speed of service, particularly in KFC, and there's a number of initiatives in place that I think will actually enhance that experience, enhance throughput and, obviously, lead to sales and transaction growth."

We're not putting a time frame on it, but we know there's enormous profit leverage in the business, given all the productivity gains that have been made in the last 2 to 3 years and that as the same-store sales continue to recover, we'll see significant margin improvement. To your point, that is up from comps. But I also wouldn't underestimate the opportunity for the China team to continue to realize some structural improvements in the business. They've consistently delivered well beyond our expectations, they have enormous capability, and I think the next leg of productivity improvement in the restaurants will be unlocked by technology. And it's fair to say that the digital capabilities of our China business are the best that we have in our entire company, and we're all very excited about how that's going to transform the customer experience.

But I think we all know, and we've seen this not just in China but outside, that casual dining is impacted by macros. It's just what happens. And it always has a bigger impact on casual dining when macros are volatile and changing than it does on the QSR business. So if I was to say, what are the 4 factors, I would say macros. I think the second one would be we do not have enough value news in order to overcome this sort of macro backdrop, which is why we've got a number of macro tests in the marketplace right now. And obviously, with a sense of urgency, we need to get these tests into the marketplace. I think there is definitely competition, there's definitely more competition in the marketplace. I don't think a lot of this competition is going to try and scale up on a sort of broad scale like the Pizza Hut is. And then I think the last point or factor, I think would be aggregators, but that's a small percentage of total sales. So I would say it's macros, it's value, it's competition and it's aggregators. That would be -- I can't put a percentage on for you. I know you'd like it, but those would be the 4 factors. And that's why our response has to be focus on the core to strengthen the brand positioning, target value-increased transactions, deliver the best in-store dining experience and then leading digital, as Pat said, whether it's free WiFi, queue ticketing, pre-ordering and then partnerships with people like Alipay and WeChat to drive cashless payment, as well as the loyalty program. So that's the things we're doing in response to the 4 things we see driving the sort of, I guess, the performance we're not happy with in Pizza Hut China."

Margins were up versus prior year about 4.5 percentage points, and here's how it breaks down. When you take the 4% pricing, add to it the mix benefit, and strip off the impact of the transaction decline, that's about a net 2-point benefit. On top of that, we had a 3-point benefit from productivity and another 1 point benefit from closed stores. Offsetting that was 1.5 margin attributable to inflation. Commodities were flat but we had 6% inflation on labor. And so that's basically the walk to the 4.5-point gain in margin versus  prior year. In terms of how we're thinking about 2016, as I mentioned before, the team is very much focused on building transactions. So while we do expect some modest inflation from a commodity perspective, up about 1% and high single digits for labor, we're not planning to take pricing to entirely offset that. We will look to some ongoing productivity improvements to help mitigate the impact of inflation. But the goal is to at least maintain margin year-over-year at around 16% and to achieve meaningful improvement in transactions."

I think our ability to deliver new value news in the marketplace will be a much greater driver of our improved performance, then I see much growth with that. It will continue to grow. I'm not suggesting it won't continue to grow, but I think that because we have strong brands, and the aggregators want to work with us as strong brands, I think that puts us in a more driver's seat in terms of how we play with them versus the small guys, who I think the aggregators will have different terms and arrangements with. So I feel good about where we are. I can tell you that the China team is all over it. Micky is very well versed. He's  definitely met with the aggregators personally. So we're watching this. It'll  grow. But I think that macros and value will be, in the short term, more important for us to address."

You'll recall that we launched our Taco Bell app in the fourth quarter of 2014. To date, we have about 5 million app downloads. When we look at the behavior of those customers who were ordering through the app, the average check is higher by about 30%. So we're very much encouraged by those early results. We're looking to build awareness of the app to drive utilization, and an important part of that is the introduction of a loyalty component to the app, a game that was launched in late 2015. It's the first loyalty program of its kind that rewards social behavior. And the first reward that was offered for customers who played the game was a free Taco Bell freeze, so there was a lot of excitement around that. The app is also configured in a way that drives exploration of the menu. So it's helped to create a lot of buzz and a lot of active engagement with our heavy users, very high levels of social sharing of the rewards we've observed, and the overall user response has been very positive. So the focus now is having to launch the app and more recently, the loyalty program is to drive awareness, and so we do expect to see even greater trial in the coming months. The goal, as you know, for Taco Bell is to strengthen its position as an on-demand brand. And so leveraging technology to do that is an important part of the brand's priority going forward."

But we can use this to sort of get that message out, and that's making the brand more relevant and making any brand more relevant is the name of the game."

So first, on China, same-store sales, similar to recent quarters, performance was stronger in Tier 1 cities for both brands. Our view is that customers in lower-tier cities have been more significantly impacted by the softening economy, particularly around the industrial cities, which have been more heavily affected by China's slowing export trade. But that's the only meaningful difference, really, to call out. And then as it relates to  Taco Bell G&A, as we mentioned, the increase in the fourth quarter was expected. And it's fair to characterize a large chunk of the incremental G&A as being nonrecurring. So some components would include performance-driven incentive compensation because they had an absolutely blockbuster year, and so they were paid accordingly. We planned for a 100% payout, so that contributes to a year-over-year decline as we think about 2016. There were some investments that were made in some strategic growth initiatives. I would highlight international supply chain developments. I would also highlight the digital initiatives like the ones we just talked about, and so that contributed to a spike in the fourth quarter. And importantly, we think about those as investments to sustain the positive momentum of the brand. I think good businesses that are strong-performing businesses reinvest profit upside to sustain the momentum, and that's exactly what's happened to Taco Bell."

I'm pleased we're off to a strong start in 2016 with better-than-expected core operating profit growth of 21% in the first quarter. This includes 42% growth in our China business due to outstanding Chinese New Year results at KFC, underscoring the power of the KFC brand in China when we delivered insight-driven marketing that resonates with our customers. 
Companywide, all 4 of our divisions posted positive same-store sales and operating profit growth in constant currency. Furthermore, we are on track to finalize the spin-off of our China business by year-end, creating 2 powerful, independent, focused growth companies. As you saw in our release, we're raising full year core operating growth guidance for Yum! Brands to 12% from 10% previously. Even though it is still early in the year, we are confident about the revised guidance, and we'll update you as the year progresses.
Today, I'll give you an overview of each of our operating division, and then Dave Russell, our interim CFO, will walk you through the financials. 
So first, China. For the China division, same-store sales grew 6%, led by 12% same-store sales growth of KFC. Our KFC business, as a reminder, represents about 75% of our operating profit in China. We saw particular success of KFC during the Chinese New Year with bucket meals, which we tailored across 4 customer groups ranging from kids buckets to larger group meals. As a result, buckets makes a much higher percentage than normally. This lifted average ticket as we focused more on group occasions. And we gained even more consumer insights this year, which would help our business both going forward as well as next new year. Pizza Hut Casual Dining, which represents about 25% of our operating profit in China remained challenging. System sales declined 1%, and same-store sales declined 12% in the quarter. Our tough macro environment and competitive landscape continued to weigh on performance. We're addressing this with urgency but realize our recovery will take time.
So wrapping up in China. We are pleased with our first quarter's overall operating profit growth, which came in well ahead of our expectations. The strong margin performance reinforces our confidence in the future earnings power of this business. When we generate sales growth, profit flow-through is impressive. As Steve mentioned, Micky Pant, our China division CEO, is on the call today and will be happy to assist in answering questions you may have in the China business.
Now turning to our 3 global brands divisions. In our KFC division, same-store sales grew 1% in the first quarter or 5% on a 2-year stack. Operating profit grew 7% in constant currency when adjusting for incremental advertising spend in the the U.S. The division opened 79 new international restaurants in 32 countries. 77% of these units were opened by franchisees, and 71% of our new international openings were in emerging markets. I'm encouraged by our ability to generate growth in both emerging and developed markets. System sales and international developed markets grew 5%, and in international emerging markets grew 8%. I recently visited with the team in Canada and was thrilled to see the assets being upgraded and the marketing position around Always Original. With 6% same-store sales growth in the quarter, I'd say it's working. I'm also pleased to see success in emerging markets, which are our key contributor to KFC's growth story. KFC is our franchise-led emerging powerhouse, and I'm confident the brand's get even stronger and will produce strong growth this year and for many years to come.
Pizza Hut grew same-store sales 3% in the quarter and was led by 5% same-store sales growth in the U.S., which makes up approximately 60% of total sales. Our $5 flavor menu helped drive system transactions with company stores leading the way, up 8% in the quarter. Our discipline around making it easier to get a better pizza is holistic and driving traffic. We are focused on the entire customer experience from ordering, payment and delivery tracking to our assets and menu, and I believe this quarter's results are further testament to our maniacal emphasis on this way of thinking. We are on track to replace over 1300 U.S. ovens in 2016. For those stores replacing older ovens, this should result in average energy savings of 25% in ongoing operational costs and a faster cook time. From a marketing calendar perspective, we are focusing on balancing premium product innovation such as stuffed garlic pizza to protect and improve unit economics with compelling value offerings such as their ongoing $6.99 Any deal. All of this will enable us to provide our customers with a better pizza at great value.
Our international business at Pizza Hut saw system sales growth of 3% in constant currency and a 1% decline in same-store sales in the quarter. Sales were especially strong in Latin America and Canada but offset by weaknesses in Korea, Australia and India. We are committed to offering consistent everyday value to our customers and will leverage proven value strategies across markets with similar characteristics. We have high expectations for the international Pizza Hut business. Over the last 5 years, we have opened 1200 international restaurants, and we will continue to grow this business over time. The bottom line is we have established solid momentum with our strategy in the U.S. especially around the $5 flavor menu. And as we roll this overall strategy internationally, we hope to achieve similar success.
Now turning to Taco Bell. Same-store sales grew 1%, lapping 6% growth a year ago, and operating profit grew 4% in the quarter. Restaurant margins were an impressive 21%. While 1% same-store sales growth is not what we're used to seeing at Taco Bell, the timing of our key launches have an impact on same-store sales growth for the quarter. The Quesalupa, which launched in February, makes it almost 10% and drove a meaningful lift in transactions. We also launched our $1 breakfast menu in March. The $1 price point is consistent with Taco Bell's reputation as the value leader in QSR. Taco Bell's new breakfast $1 value menu differentiates itself from the competitive and puts it at the forefront of value in a growing daypart. We now have 10 $1 items on the breakfast menu and are seeing breakfast sales hold at 8% and transaction growth accelerating. The Taco Bell team is exhibiting great flexibility to reap and reacted the competitive value pressures and adjusted their 2016 promotional calendar accordingly to highlight even more value. Insight-driven innovation, favorable food and breakthrough value such as the upcoming launches of the $1 BB crunch burrito should boost sales and further the brand's momentum.
So we're off to a great start at Yum! Over the past several quarters, we really had 3 businesses that needed dramatic improvement: KFC China, Pizza Hut China and Pizza Hut U.S. I'm pleased that we've been able to turn 2 of these 3 businesses as KFC China and Pizza Hut U.S. are on more solid footing. Now let's be clear: we're not out of the woods on these businesses, but we've made a lot of progress, and we'll continue to focus on delivering better results. As you heard me say before, this is a transformational year for Yum! as we finalize the spin-off of our China business, creating 2 powerful, independent, focused growth companies. Our brand strength, unwavering focus on the customer and innovative food driven by insights will allow us to grow Yum! into an even better global company. This is an exciting time, a pivotal time for our company, and I look forward to what the future holds
And with that, I'll hand the call over to Dave."

In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: our first quarter results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our planned recapitalization and the spin-off of our China business. As Greg mentioned, we are very pleased",1579,"Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: our first quarter results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our planned recapitalization and the spin-off of our China business. As Greg mentioned, we are very pleased with our strong first quarter results where core operating profit increased 21%. EPS before special items grew 19%, including a 5-point negative impact from foreign currency. These results were led by better-than-expected sales in restaurant margins in KFC China. EPS also benefited from a 5% reduction in our diluted share count compared to our first quarter last year due to our significant share buybacks over the past 12 months. 
I'll now take you through our results by divisions, starting with our China business. For the China division overall, same-store sales grew 6% in the quarter. KFC grew same-store sales 12%, which was sequentially better than Q4 and exceeded our expectations as successful Chinese New Year promotion drove results. As Greg said, the KFC brand in China is really powerful delivered insight-driven marketing that resonates with our customers.
Same-store sales of Pizza Hut Casual Dining remain sluggish declining 12% in the quarter. We're working to turn the Pizza Hut business around in a difficult macro and competitive environment.
Restaurant margin improved 3.5 percentage points versus the prior year to 22.4%, helped our sales leverage in KFC and commodity deflation, more than offsetting sales deleveraging at Pizza Hut. While our first quarter is a seasonally higher sales period for the China division, restaurant margins of over 22% give us tremendous confidence in the future earning power of this business. When we deliver solid top line growth, the profits are impressive. One other note on China's first quarter results, we had a leap year benefit that added an additional $6 million [ph] of operating profit Q1 to China's results. However, we pool sales from the leap date out of our same-store sales calculation as the extra day had no impact on reported 6% same-store sales growth. The way reporting here at Yum!, none of our other divisions saw an impact from leap year in Q1. 
Now moving to our global KFC division, which posted its ninth consecutive quarter of same-store sales and profit growth. Emerging and international developed markets each grew comps 1%. U.S. recorded seventh consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth despite overlapping 7% comps in the first quarter of last year. Operating margins improved 30 basis points in constant currency, and core operating profit grew 4% in the quarter. Adjusting for the incremental advertising expense associated with the acceleration agreement we reached with our franchisees in 2015, core operating profit grew 7% in the quarter. As a reminder, the acceleration agreement with our U.S. franchisees, which went into effect during the second quarter of last year, called for us to invest incremental media of $20 million in 2016 as opposed to $10 million last year.
Our global Pizza Hut division delivered 3% same-store sales growth for the quarter, led by 5% same-store sales growth in our U.S. business. Same-store sales growth and lower G&A expenses drove core operating profit growth of 9%. This is the best result we've seen our Pizza Hut U.S. in years, and we believe our strategy is working to drive incremental transactions. I am pleased to see momentum behind the business and believe we can transfer our U.S. earnings to benefit the system globally. Digital continues to grow in importance to our sales, comprising 46% of U.S. delivery and carryout sales, a 3 percentage point increase versus a year ago. On Super Bowl Sunday alone, we took over 500,000 digital orders, representing about 50% of sales along with an all-time record day for the business. With digital orders comes higher levels of and higher average of spend, so we're investing as you would expect. Along those lines, we're making progress in migrating to a single point-of-sale system in the U.S. by the end of 2017, which will allow us to be more nimble as we roll out our digital initiatives going forward.
Finally, Taco Bell faced increased value pressure from the change in the first quarter and posted 1% same-store sales growth. Same-store sales improved throughout the quarter, and we remain confident in achieving 3% same-store sales growth for the year with a stronger second half than first half. Despite the lower-than-expected full quarter sales, operating margin improved 150 basis points to 28%, and operating profit grew 4%. Restaurant margins also improved 150 basis points at 21%, and we expect full year margins to be greater than 20% this year albeit slightly lower than last year. On the development front, we opened 49 new restaurants in the quarter with 90% open [indiscernible] franchisees and licensees. Of our new openings, 7 were international units. We expect to open a record number of Taco Bell units internationally in 2016 as we continue to make progress in building up the unit level economics as we enter the new countries.
I'd now like to shift to our 2016 outlook. With our strong first quarter results and the change in China's tax laws whereby a value-added tax or VAT is replacing the business tax, we are raising our full year core operating profit growth forecast to 12% from 10% for Yum!. For a little bit of background on the VAT. China recently announced a reform to its retail tax which is intended to be a progressive and positive shift to more closely align with a more modern service-based economy. Under this reform, a 6% output VAT would replace the 5% business tax currently applied to certain restaurant sales. Input VAT would be credible to the aforementioned 6% outlook VAT. This change is effective May 1, 2016, so in no way had any impact on their first quarter performance. While it's difficult to estimate the impact of the VAT reform prior to its actual implementation, Yum! China currently expects a positive financial business, further enabling continued investment in the business and creating thousands of additional jobs in China. While we are raising our forecast for core operating profit growth from Yum! from 10% to 12%, we are maintaining our guidance for China same-store sales of 2% to 3% for the full year. From a modeling standpoint, there are 2 other things to bear in mind as you build your forecast. First, the second quarter in China, which is typically our seasonally low quarter happens to be our toughest hurdle of the year of a 2-, 3- and 4-year stack same-store sales base. Second, we have an RGM commission the second quarter that we didn't have last year that we expect to cost around $7 million. It's important for you to know that these factors were fully factored into our initial guidance, and our first half and full year performance is expected to exceed our expectations coming to the year.
All in for Yum!, we can outperform our expectations in the first quarter and are raising our full year guidance to 12% core operating profit growth, including the 53rd week. This takes into account the strong first quarter produced by KFC China, weakness in casual dining and the expected VAT benefit in China in addition to our brand divisions continuing to produce results consistent with our initial 2016 targets. It's early in the year to rate guidance, but we feel confident given where things stand, and we'll update you as the year progresses.
Now I'd like to quickly update you on our spin-off plans. We are on track to complete the spin-off by year-end. We plan on filing our initial Form 10 by early May and conducting comprehensive roadshows ahead of the separation. This spin-off will establish 2 unique investment opportunities and create one of the largest U.S.-listed China retail businesses. Another key aspect of our strategy is to optimize the capital structure of Yum!. Given the significant improvement we've seen recently in the debt markets, we'd like to announce another milestone in our previously indicated plan of targeting company-wide leverage of approximately 5x EBITDA. In early May, we into a new financing facility of at least $2 billion [ph], securitizing Taco Bell U.S. royalties. As a next step in our plan, subsidiaries our Pizza Hut and Taco Bell's businesses excluding the Taco Bell subsidiaries included in the securitization financing are expected to enter into a new senior secured credit facility and issue new high-yield notes. More details will be forthcoming as separate release later today. In line with what we previously communicated, we plan to complete our capitalization and have approximately $9 billion of debt outstanding by the end of the second quarter.
Finally, since we announced in October 2015 our intention to separate the China business, we have bought back 24.7 million shares at an average price of $71, returning a total of $1.8 billion to shareholders excluding dividends. As previously announced, a recap will enable us to complete an additional $4.4 billion return of capital to shareholders. 
So let me wrap things up. I'm pleased to started 2016 off with a strong quarter. We're confident we'll deliver 12% core operating profit for the full year, and we're proceeding as expected with the separation of our China business into an independent publicly traded company. We are working diligently to set up both companies for future success and look forward to updating you on any progress throughout the year. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Greg."

First, on Pizza Hut, I just wanted to say to all of you that it is an extremely strong brand in China. All our consumer metrics, the brand image tracking that we do regularly shows that brand regard, value scores, food scores are very high as they recovered fully from the crisis that they had a couple of years ago. We opened 280 new Pizza Huts last year, and new unit returns are very good. Over the last 4 years, we've opened 1,000 Pizza Huts dine-in restaurants alone, and we drove off the competition. So it is a very strong brand. It is true that same-store sales have been negative. But in 2015, for example, our system sales were up 10 points, and we do track through in 22 cities and also through publicly reported companies that operate in casual dining here the overall casual dining performance and, it is our understanding that to gain market share. Part of the reason the casual dining sector has been hit, has been due to a decline in consumer confidence. And as we explained in December last year, part of it was on account of the fact that home delivery through aggregators is growing. This latter phenomenon has tapered off a bit on account of burnouts, et cetera. So we fully expect that Pizza Hut will turn a corner. It is a strong brand. Margin performance is good. Sales were kind of minus 1 system sales in the first quarter, but our goal is to get to same-store sales positive. I cannot put a date on it, David, because the market is volatile, but we're doing a number of things. First is that we have shifted the focus back to the core menu with a lot of pizza activity. So we'd have more pizza innovation in the next 6 months than we've had in a long time, and tested very well. The second, I believe, is our value scores are actually good. You can eat lunch at a Pizza Hut just a little more than KFC, so there's no need for any margin compression, but we do need to communicate that value better, which we have started doing. We the brand position significantly, and we've hired one of the best celebrities in China to bring that point home. And lastly, we continue to emphasize customer service for the programs that we presented in September. So with that, I feel much better about Pizza Hut than I did a few months ago but, of course, I'm disappointed that same-store sales are still negative. And I might also remind you, as you know very well, that Pizza Hut is about 25% of our sales and our profits. So one way to look at it is the 3 or [ph] 4 engines that drive the Yum! China business are KFC and KFC performing well, I think we have the ability to Pizza Hut in coming quarters."

First, I want to commend Micky and the entire China team for what I think is a fantastic Q1. KFC China delivered 12% same-store sales growth. And as you can see from the 42% growth in our profit, the earnings power of our business is extraordinary when it's working in our favor. And we're very encouraged that we've now had 3 consecutive quarters of same-store sales at KFC China. I think, fortunately, we didn't assume that we don't need heroic numbers like they continued throughout the year to reach out 2016 guidance of 2% to 3% same-store sales growth. And recent history shows that China has been difficult for us to call. So regarding our expectations coming into the year, KFC sales were obviously much better in Q1 than we could've imagined. In Q2, we're closer to where we thought we could be for KFC as we believe that our successful Chinese New Year may have pulled forward some of early Q2 sales into Q1. That said, 6 weeks into the quarter, KFC sells a slightly positive, and we're encouraged with where the business is going, and I'll let Micky speak to that in more detail. And as you know, we know that we still got a lot of to do in Pizza Hut and China. And quarter to date, sales have remained double-digit negative. But again, as Dave mentioned, our Q2 lap for both KFC and Pizza Hut more difficult, especially when you look at these multi-year stacks. We feel great about the start of the year. We're confident in raising our guidance. We still expect China full year China division same-store sales to be in the 2% to 3% range, which is consistent with our expectations.

It was the year of the monkey, and we were fortunate that the -- actually not just fortune, but the team at KFC really has hit their stride. So Joy was a very accomplished retail executive now really understood the rhythm of the KFC business, and they put together a sort of 1, 2, 3 punch around the Chinese New Year, extending it from the traditional 10 days to about 4 weeks, centered around a very powerful bucket promotion but also then with activity afterwards featuring a greater sandwich, which was good thinking because after a heavy Chinese New Year, people are looking for a healthy affair. So that aspect is unique to the Chinese New Year, and I think it's a spectacular successful promotion. Somebody asked me how we level up that next year, and I think the one bit of good news we have is next year is the year of the chicken. So we started work already on the promotions that would be running. But some of the factors that worked in Q1 actually give me encouragement for KFC overall. The first is the success of selling our core products, our fried chicken, hot wings, french fries, hotdogs and all the familiar favorites in China. And we are extending that principle by doing more activity around buckets in the back half of the year and also introducing boxed meals, which are a proven international success where you can buy a fairly -- a good -- just like a little bit more money but significantly more product. As you can imagine, following a very large success in January and February we hit almost record volumes in the amount of chicken that we did sell. And also, that sale was accompanied by corresponding traffic growth. The ticket impact on our sales of plus 12% in Q1 was about 3%. So it wasn't as though the pricing impact. It wasn't as though we took pricing to get there. The price impact is only plus 3. The rest of it is on account of the fact that party sizes for these large buckets are very large. And also, there was a significant increase in the number of items brought per person because the promotion was very well run.
In Q2, we're about halfway through the quarter, but the pleasing thing is that KFC is positive. But as Greg said, there's a lot of volatility around it. It's a difficult quarter because they've got tough laps, we've got some expenses. Our goal as a team here is to make Q2 this year the fourth consecutive quarter of positive KFC same-store sales, but I cannot say that that's a guarantee until we have more visibility. But the fact that the flow-through was very strong and profit terms the simplification of the menu boards, which is well conducted, the strength of the marketing calendar in the back half gives me and the team a lot more confidence than we had 6 months ago."

Having come from the Taco Bell brand and having watched that brand be one of the leaders in terms of overall digital engagement, mobile ordering and more, where do you -- how do you feel about the rest of the U.S. portfolio and positioning now? Are you making the progress you want? Is Pizza Hut becoming more of a leader in each category? Is KFC also coming on? And what about test on delivery for other brands like replacement for KFC and even for Taco Bell? Is the rest of the U.S. portfolio catching up to Taco Bell? How -- where do we stand?"

I think the great thing is we can what makes Taco Bell successful.

I think the great thing is we can what makes Taco Bell successful. And obviously, the other 2 brands can obviously track with what they've done and obviously replicate it but in their own brand voice. So I'm very pleased with the progress that Pizza Hut is making. I think this positioning around, making it easier to get a better pizza, I think the -- not only the sales growth, but the transaction growth that we just got. Obviously, part of making it easier was to get out value better Pizza Hut, which we have done. But I think, as we also said on the call, we are investing in technology. We do need to get from 9 POS systems down to 1 POS system. But as we also said, 46% of our delivery carryout sales are digital, and that's growing. And I do think we're making good progress there on the KFC side. I think the always original position move back to finger-licking good. The great thing about KFC in the U.S. is it's the brand is now being talked about. And I think for a long time, it wasn't on anyone's radar screen. So I'm very comfortable I think the launch of national has really helped. Obviously, there's a value game being played by the burger boys because of beat pricing, but the return $5 boxes has been a good move by the KFC team. And then for Taco Bell, the answer is, I think, we're now in 500 stores doing delivery in a couple of the key cities, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, I'm not quite sure where else, but -- so that's been expanded. And I think if you just take the overall concept of easy beats better, which I know the Pizza Hut team originated, but what it basically says is ""Yes, we've got to find ways to make it easier for our people, for customers to get to our brand."" But we do that 2 way: we build more units, but we also obviously will start looking at delivery as a way to get our food to 2 customers in their homes. So very good question. We are making progress. The other brands, I think, are moving to where the Taco Bell brand strength is. A lot of work to be done, but I think we're moving in the right direction, and we're encouraged by that."

We felt very confident that even with some of the headwinds we're facing, particularly Pizza Hut Casual Dining and China are getting to a number that was 12% for the year. As we said, we have not yet -- we have not adjusted the same-store sales forecast for the balance of the year for China. It's too difficult to call, given we're only 2, 3.5 months in.

We have a stadium in the City of with 8,000 people talking about the theme for the future, which is strength to strength. And in particular, when the KFC section was discussed, and we put out plans for the rest of the year and the positioning and the proposed marketing, there was just confidence. I feel that I really feel the brand is making a lot of progress. It is much stronger. I think the positioning is very clear. The calendars are strong. We're doing sensible things around of the core of the brand. We've already cleaned up the menu boards. We will do that even more. We're introducing proven international winners. I think you always have to be cautious when you come to China because there is economic volatility, and there is also unexpected twists and turns. So there's nothing hidden. It's not as though we're worried about specific events or something happening that causes us to worry, but just want to be cautious. We'd had 2 or 3 years of a lot of volatility. So the way we look at it right now is it's a ""show me, don't tell me"" sort of story, and we're hoping quarter after quarter to improve and strengthen the business. I think it's been mentioned a number of times, Q2 is going to be a difficult quarter on account of a variety of factors, but we are very focused in seeing whether we can deliver positive same-store sales and take it from there. So on KFC, I feel confident. I feel that the brand is making a lot of progress. And the other thing we talked about today is we spent a lot of energy, and were going to be taking very good care of store refurbishments. So we have good designs, good plans for aggressive refurbs in some of our older stores. We are opening a symbolically important 5,000 store in Shanghai, which is I think maybe the best KFC in the world. It's a state-of-the-art green store, which will open next week. Also, I think the brand is making progress on every front. On Pizza Hut, like I said before, I'm very disappointed negative same-store sales, and I don't see any reason why we cannot turn it around. There's no our scores are good, our competitive position is fantastic. There really is no international competitor with the name. And in addition to the 1500 dine-in stores, we got about 300 delivery units, which dwarf the competition. So I feel the brands are genuinely making progress. It's just that it's been 2 months. The first quarter was 2 months, and they make a call on the rest of the year, knowing what we've seen over the last 3 years out of the bound of what we should be doing. So that hopefully gave you some context on the way we're looking at it."

By the way, I'm very happy with 8% transaction growth in breakfast with one of our competitors doing all-day breakfast, so let me just say that. So to answer your question, yes, we had tied the launch of the Quesalupa to the Super Bowl. I tried to get the Super Bowl a couple of weeks because that would have really helped us, but unfortunately, the NFL wasn't going to play along. So we were so tied up to the launch with that event that there was a couple of weeks where we were a little naked, I would say. And so obviously, sales and transactions [indiscernible] were soft. The good news is that after that event, the Quesalupa had mix of over 10% and have done well for us. And even more importantly, Brian who's doing a great job leading the brand has -- he and the team have already changed the calendar. And in fact, today, we will launch some new $1 items into the marketplace. There's been a number of revisions to the calendar. So I think we can still be an incredibly innovative brand, socially conscious brand led by digital, but we can also just get out value, so it's more than comparative in the marketplace. And I think talking to Brian the other day, we still have a lot of confidence we'll deliver the at least 3% same-store sales growth for the year on Taco Bell."

The success of the monkey -- the year of the monkey promotion has shown us the importance of choosing the character well, the toys that go over it, the kid's meals that accompany it, which will help us to build for the future.

That was plus 5, which if you think you can [indiscernible] We were soft in a number of places, but there's also real signs of real strength both in emerging and developed. And I think the team believes they also can obviously get sales up to at least the 3% same-store sales number in the year."

That has not struck me as the new units that we are building are in any way have inferior economics are such as entirely smaller units. It's true more stores in smaller cities, but our comps sales growth across tiers have been fairly consistent. We are experimenting with multiple store formats to take into account the fact that there is still very rapid buildout in infrastructure in China, so we are expecting very large number of malls already under construction, the high-speed rail network is being expanded and in China, like the U.S., there's at the moment highways, the drive-throughs, the rest stops, and all those are being developed. I don't really see the character of our productivity per unit changing in the years to come. I think, worldwide, there is a trend what we call small box, which is in line is becoming more popular mall stores etc. so there may be in the longer term slightly smaller format units, but China is not that impacted because we hardly have any drive-through, we hardly have any drive-throughs at all, so most of them will be in line anyway. So maybe we need to think about this question a little bit more, but we don't see any reason why the sort of growth we've enjoyed should not be projected long term in the future."

Well, at the moment, as you know, we stayed at just over 7,000 stores. About 10% are franchised and 90% are equity. I think, at the moment, as long as we have -- and we never chase a number of stores that we have to build, but when we get new trade zones opening and opportunities that make commercial sense and very disciplined process for capital allocation and measuring new unit returns, we have a lot of surplus capital, as you know, in China. All the stores here have been built with the Chinese-generated capital, there's no intrinsic reason why we would want to give that up to franchisees. The 2 reasons why we do expect, however, franchising to be up marginally is, firstly, our regions of the country where it makes sense for franchisees to operate. We recently opened in the autonomous region of Tibet, our first store in Tibet. And for a variety of reasons, including difficult operating conditions and local market knowledge, that was given to a franchisee, and it's been successful and I think that will grow. So parts of the country where we will do it for reasons that it makes sense to do it that way. And the other thing we will be opportunities to do franchising, for example, gas station change, et cetera. And for those technical reasons, percentage of franchising might go up for 10 to maybe 15 or something in the foreseeable future, but we don't expect a significant change there. And of course, if we do not find the ability to invest our capital in productive equity investment, sure, we'll look at franchising more actively. We're not at the moment -- we're agnostic to whether it's franchising or equity, frankly. I mean, both have advantages. Franchisees can -- obviously, capital light and also very innovative. But at the moment, with the the capital that we have, especially as they become independent, I think it will be a good use for the capital to continue to invest. China has a growth market the way we see it, and we still had the vision doubling or tripling our store base, so that's the way we are looking at it. So I would say the franchising percentage would edge up, but it will not be a game changer in our business."

Pizza Hut is celebrated and known for the variety of menus here. We do not want to lose that. At the same time, I think we can make it far more controlled. It also speeds up service, and table turns are an issue of Pizza Hut at peak times, so for those reasons, we are rationalizing the menu. We're also, like I said earlier, point to the great value that we have through lunch combos and other offers, so we're redesigning that part of the menu as well. And lastly, this -- I mean, I'm constantly amazed at how advanced China is digitally. twice the number of cellphones, smartphones as the U.S. population. And even on our offices, people go up and down the elevator to go to lunch, they're looking up where the offers are available and where they can book a table et cetera.

The good news is that for both our brands, we are -- leadership position when it comes to that digital interface, cashless payment et cetera. But to your question, yes, I think to sort of operational simplicity at KFC, making it easier for consumers to choose our bestselling products, and the general philosophy that the menu should not be a -- should be used more as guiding customers to our best-selling products than to give open choices something that this applicable at Pizza Hut as well."

We reported core operating profit growth of 21% for the first quarter 2016. Core operating profit growth is our operating profit growth year-over-year excluding foreign currency translation and special items. Second, as previously announced, effective January of this year, the company's India business integrated its 3 brands into our global brand divisions. The prior year figures have been restated in the release.

I'm pleased we're off to a strong start in 2016 with better-than-expected core operating profit growth of 21% in the first quarter. This includes 42% growth in our China business due to outstanding Chinese New Year results at KFC, underscoring the power of the KFC brand in China when we deliver insight-driven marketing that resonates with our customers. 
Companywide, all 4 of our divisions posted positive same-store sales and operating profit growth in constant currency. Furthermore, we are on track to finalize the spin-off of our China business by year end, creating 2 powerful, independent, focused growth companies. As you saw in our release, we're raising full year core operating growth guidance for Yum! Brands to 12% from 10% previously. Even though it is still early in the year, we are confident about the revised guidance and we'll update you as the year progresses.
Today, I'll give you an overview of each of our operating divisions. And then Dave Russell, our interim CFO, will walk you through the financials. 
So first, China. For the China division, same-store sales grew 6%, led by 12% same-store sales growth at KFC. Our KFC business, as a reminder, represents about 75% of our operating profit in China. We saw particular success at KFC during the Chinese New Year with bucket meals, which we tailored across 4 customer groups ranging from kids buckets to larger group meals. As a result, buckets mixed a much higher percentage than normally. This lifted average ticket as we focused more on group occasions. And we gained even more consumer insights this year, which will help our business both going forward as well as next new year. Pizza Hut Casual Dining, which represents about 25% of our operating profit in China, remained challenging. System sales declined 1%, and same-store sales declined 12% in the quarter. A tough macro environment and competitive landscape continued to weigh on performance. We're addressing this with urgency but realize our recovery will take time.
So wrapping up on China. We are pleased with our first quarter's overall operating profit growth, which came in well ahead of our expectations. The strong margin performance reinforces our confidence in the future earnings power of this business. When we generate sales growth, profit flow-through is impressive. As Steve mentioned, Micky Pant, our division -- China division CEO, is on the call today and will be happy to assist in answering questions you may have on the China business.
Now turning to our 3 global brand divisions. In our KFC division, same-store sales grew 1% in the first quarter or 5% on a 2-year stack. Operating profit grew 7% in constant currency when adjusting for incremental advertising spend in the U.S. The division opened 79 new international restaurants in 32 countries. 77% of these units were opened by franchisees, and 71% of our new international openings were in emerging markets. I'm encouraged by our ability to generate growth in both emerging and developed markets. System sales in international developed markets grew 5%, and in international emerging markets, grew 8%. I recently visited with the team in Canada and was thrilled to see the assets being upgraded and the marketing position around Always Original. With 6% same-store sales growth in the quarter, I'd say it's working. I'm also pleased to see success in emerging markets, which are our key contributor to KFC's growth story. KFC is a franchise-led emerging powerhouse, and I'm confident the brand is getting even stronger and will produce strong growth this year and for many years to come.
Pizza Hut grew same-store sales 3% in the quarter and was led by 5% same-store sales growth in the U.S., which makes up approximately 60% of total sales. Our $5 flavor menu helped drive system transactions with company stores leading the way, up 8% in the quarter. Our discipline around making it easier to get a better pizza is holistic and driving traffic. We are focused on the entire customer experience from ordering, payment and delivery tracking to our assets and menu, and I believe this quarter's results are further testament to our maniacal emphasis on this way of thinking. We are on track to replace over 1,300 U.S. ovens in 2016. So those stores replacing older ovens, this should result in average energy savings of 25% in ongoing operational costs and a faster cook time. From a marketing calendar perspective, we are focusing on balancing premium product innovation such as stuffed garlic knots pizza to protect and improve unit level economics with compelling value offerings such as their ongoing $6.99 Any pairs deal. All of this will enable us to provide our customers with a better pizza at great value.
Our international business at Pizza Hut saw a system sales growth of 3% in constant currency and a 1% decline in same-store sales in the quarter. Sales were especially strong in Latin America and Canada, but offset by weaknesses in Korea, Australia and India. We are committed to offering consistent everyday value to our customers and will leverage proven value strategies across markets with similar characteristics. 
We have high expectations for the international Pizza Hut business. Over the last 5 years, we have opened 1,200 international restaurants, and we will continue to grow this business over time. The bottom line is that we have established solid momentum with our strategy in the U.S., especially around the $5 flavor menu. And as we roll this overall strategy out internationally, we hope to achieve similar success.
Now turning to Taco Bell. Same-store sales grew 1%, lapping 6% growth a year ago, and operating profit grew 4% in the quarter. Restaurant margins were an impressive 21%. While 1% same-store sales growth is not what we're used to seeing at Taco Bell, the timing of our key launches had an impact on same-store sales growth for the quarter. The Quesalupa, which launched in February, mix at almost 10% and drove a meaningful lift in transactions. We also launched our $1 breakfast menu in March. The $1 price point is consistent with Taco Bell's reputation as the value leader in QSR. Taco Bell's new breakfast $1 value menu differentiates itself from the competitors and puts it at the forefront of value in a growing daypart. We now have 10 $1 items on the breakfast menu and are seeing breakfast sales hold at 8% and transaction growth accelerating. The Taco Bell team is exhibiting great flexibility to read and react to the competitive value pressures and adjusted their 2016 promotional calendar accordingly to highlight even more value. Insight-driven innovation, crave-able food and breakthrough value, such as the upcoming launches of the $1 beefy crunch burrito and steak value label this year, should boost sales and further the brand's momentum.
So we're off to a great start at Yum! Over the past several quarters, we really had 3 businesses that needed dramatic improvement: KFC China, Pizza Hut China and Pizza Hut U.S. I'm pleased that we've been able to turn 2 out of these 3 businesses as KFC China and Pizza Hut U.S. are on more solid footing. Now let's be clear: we're not out of the woods on these businesses, but we've made a lot of progress and we'll continue to focus on delivering better results. As you heard me say before, this is a transformational year for Yum! as we finalize the spin-off of our China business, creating 2 powerful, independent, focused growth companies. Our brand strength, unwavering focus on the customer and innovative food offerings driven by consumer insights will allow us to grow Yum! into an even better global company. This is an exciting time and pivotal time for our company, and I look forward to what the future holds.
And with that, I will hand the call over to Dave."

In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: our first quarter results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our planned recapitalization and the spin-off of our China business. As Greg mentioned, we are very pleased with our strong first quarter results where core operating profit increased 21%. EPS before special items grew 19%, including a 5-point negative impact from foreign currency. These results were led by better-than-expected sales in restaurant margins at KFC China. EPS also benefited from a 5% reduction in our diluted share count compared to our first quarter last year due to our significant share buybacks over the past 12 months. 
I'll now take you through our results by divisions, starting with our China business. For the China division overall, same-store sales grew 6% in the quarter. KFC grew same-store sales 12%, which was sequentially better than Q4 and exceeded our expectations. A successful Chinese New Year promotion drove results. As Greg said, the KFC brand in China is really powerful when you deliver insight-driven marketing that resonates with our customers.
Same-store sales at Pizza Hut Casual Dining remained sluggish, declining 12% in the quarter. We are working to turn the Pizza Hut business around in a difficult macro and competitive environment.
Restaurant margin improved 3.5 percentage points versus the prior year to 22.4%, helped by sales leverage at KFC, productivity initiatives and commodity deflations, more than offsetting sales deleverage at Pizza Hut. While our first quarter is a seasonally high sales period for the China division, restaurant margins of over 22% give us tremendous confidence in the future earnings power of this business. When we deliver solid top line growth, the profits are impressive. 
One other note on China's first quarter results, we had a leap year benefit that added an additional $6 million of operating profit in Q1 to China's results. However, we pool sales from the leap date out of our same-store sales calculation, such that the extra day had no impact on reported 6% same-store sales growth. The way our reporting with counters work here at Yum!, none of our other divisions saw any impact from leap year in Q1. 
Now moving to our global KFC division, which posted its ninth consecutive quarter of same-store sales and profit growth. Emerging and international developed markets each grew comps 1%. U.S. recorded its seventh consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth despite overlapping 7% comps in the first quarter of last year. Operating margins improved 30 basis points in constant currency and core operating profit grew 4% in the quarter. Adjusting for the incremental advertising expense associated with the acceleration agreement we reached with our franchisees in 2015, core operating profit grew 7% in the quarter. As a reminder, the acceleration agreement with our U.S. franchisees, which went into effect during the second quarter of last year, called for us to invest incremental media of $20 million in 2016 as opposed to $10 million last year.
Our global Pizza Hut division delivered 3% same-store sales growth for the quarter, led by 5% same-store sales growth in our U.S. business. Same-store sales growth and lower G&A expenses drove core operating profit growth of 9%. This is the best result we've seen in our Pizza Hut U.S. in years, and we believe our strategy is working to drive incremental transactions. I am pleased to see momentum behind the business and believe we can transfer our U.S. learnings to benefit the system globally. Digital continues to grow in importance to our sales, comprising 46% of U.S. delivery and carryout sales, a 3 percentage point increase versus a year ago. On Super Bowl Sunday alone, we took over 500,000 digital orders, representing about 50% of sales along with an all-time record day for the business. With digital orders comes higher levels of loyalty and higher average spend, so we're investing as you would expect. Along those lines, we're making progress in migrating to a single point-of-sale system in the U.S. by the end of 2017, which will allow us to be more nimble as we roll out digital initiatives going forward.
Finally, Taco Bell faced increased value pressure from the burger chains in the first quarter and posted 1% same-store sales growth. Same-store sales improved throughout the quarter, and we remain confident in achieving 3% same-store sales growth for the year with a stronger second half than first half. Despite the lower-than-expected full quarter sales, operating margin improved 150 basis points to 28%, and operating profit grew 4%. Restaurant margins also improved 150 basis points at 21%, and we expect full year margins to be greater than 20% this year albeit slightly lower than last year. 
On the development front, we opened 40 new -- 49 new restaurants in the quarter with 90% opened by franchisees and licensees. Of our new openings, 7 were international units. We expect to open a record number of Taco Bell units internationally in 2016 as we continue to make progress in building out the unit level economics as we enter the new countries.
I'd now like to shift to our 2016 outlook. With our strong first quarter results and the change in China's tax laws, whereby a value-added tax or VAT is replacing the business tax, we are raising our full year core operating profit growth forecast to 12% from 10% for Yum!. 
For a little bit of background on the VAT. China recently announced further reform to its retail tax structure, which is intended to be a progressive and positive shift to more closely align with a more modern service-based economy. Under this reform, a 6% output VAT would replace the 5% business tax currently applied to certain restaurant sales. Input VAT would be credible to the aforementioned 6% output VAT. This change is effective May 1, 2016. So it in no way had any impact on our first quarter performance. While it's difficult to estimate the impact of this VAT reform prior to its actual implementation, Yum! China currently expects a positive financial benefit, further enabling continued investment in the business and creating thousands of additional jobs in China. While we are raising our forecast for core operating profit growth from Yum! from 10% to 12%, we are maintaining our guidance for China same-store sales of 2% to 3% for the full year. 
From a modeling standpoint, there are 2 other things to bear in mind as you build your forecast. First, the second quarter in China, which is typically our seasonally low quarter happens to be our toughest hurdle of the year on a 2-, 3- and 4-year stack same-store sales base. Second, we have an RGM commission in the second quarter that we did not have last year that we expect to cost around $7 million. It is important for you to know that these factors were fully factored into our initial guidance, and our first half and full year performance is expected to exceed our expectations coming to the year.
All-in for Yum!, we can outperform our expectations in the first quarter and are raising our full year guidance to 12% core operating profit growth, including the 53rd week. This takes into account the strong first quarter we produced by KFC China, weakness at Pizza Hut casual dining and the expected VAT benefit in China. 
In addition to our brand divisions continuing to produce results consisting -- consistent with our 2 -- initial 2016 targets, it's early in the year to raise guidance, but we feel confident given where things stand, and we'll update you as the year progresses.
Now I'd like to quickly update you on our spin-off plans. We remain on track to complete the spin-off by year end. We plan on filing our initial Form 10 by early May and conducting comprehensive roadshows ahead of the separation. This spin-off will establish 2 unique investment opportunities and create one of the largest U.S.-listed China retail businesses. Another key aspect of our strategy is to optimize the capital structure of Yum!. Given the significant improvement we've seen recently in the debt markets, we'd like to announce another milestone in our previously communicated plan of targeting companywide leverage of approximately 5x EBITDA. In early May, we plan to enter into a new financing facility of at least $2 billion, securitizing Taco Bell U.S. royalties. As a next step in our plan, subseries will operate our KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell's businesses excluding the Taco Bell subsidiaries included in the securitization financing are expected to enter into a new senior secured credit facility and issue new high-yield notes. More details will be forthcoming in a separate release later today. In line with what we previously communicated, we plan to complete our rate capitalization and have approximately $9 billion of debt outstanding by the end of the second quarter.
Finally, since we announced in October 2015 our intention to separate the China business, we have bought back 24.7 million shares at an average price of $71, returning a total of $1.8 billion to shareholders excluding dividends. As previously announced, a recap will enable us to complete an additional $4.4 billion return of capital to shareholders. 
So let me wrap things up. I'm pleased we started 2016 off with a strong quarter. We're confident we'll deliver 12% core operating profit growth for the full year and we're proceeding as expected with the separation of our China business into an independent publicly traded company. We are working diligently to set up both companies for future success and look forward to updating you on any progress throughout the year. 
And with that, I'll hand the ball -- call back to Greg."

First, on Pizza Hut, I just wanted to say to all of you that it is an extremely strong brand in China. All our consumer metrics, the brand image tracking that we do regularly shows that brand regard, value scores, food scores are very high, and they recovered fully from the crisis that they had a couple of years ago. We opened 280 new Pizza Huts last year, and new unit returns are very good. Over the last 4 years, we've opened 1,000 Pizza Huts dine-in restaurants alone and we dwarfed the competition. So it is a very strong brand. It is true that same-store sales have been negative. But in 2015, for example, our system sales were up 10 points, and we do track through CREST in 22 cities and also through publicly reported companies that operate in casual dining here the overall casual dining performance, and it is our understanding that we gained market share. Part of the reason the casual dining sector has been hit, has been due to a decline in consumer confidence. And as we explained in December last year, part of it was on account of the fact that home delivery through aggregators was growing. This latter phenomenon has tapered off a bit on account of burnouts, et cetera. So we fully expect that Pizza Hut will turn a corner. It is a strong brand. Margin performance have been good. Sales were kind of minus 1, system sales in the first quarter, but our goal is to get to same-store sales positive. I cannot put a date on it, David, because the market is volatile, but we are doing a number of things. First is that we have shifted the focus back to the core menu with a lot of pizza activity. So we will have more pizza innovation in the next 6 months than we've had in a long time, and these are tested very well. The second, I believe, is our value scores are actually good. You can eat lunch at a Pizza Hut at just a little more than at a KFC. So there's no need for any margin compression, but we do need to communicate that value better, which we have started doing. We've clarified the brand position significantly and we've hired one of the best celebrities in China to bring that point home. And lastly, we continue to emphasize customer service for the programs that would be presented in December. So with that, I feel much better about Pizza Hut than I did a few months ago but, of course, I'm disappointed that same-store sales are still negative. And I might also remind you, as you know very well, that Pizza Hut is about 25% of our sales and our profits. So one way to look at it is that 3 of the 4 engines that drive the Yum! China business are KFC. And with KFC performing well, I think we have the ability to support Pizza Hut in coming quarters."

But first, I want to commend Micky and the entire China team for what I think is a fantastic Q1. KFC China delivered 12% same-store sales growth. And as you can see from the 42% growth in our profit, the earnings power of our business is extraordinary when sales are working in our favor. And we're very encouraged that we've now had 3 consecutive quarters of same-store sales at KFC China. I think, fortunately, we didn't assume, and we don't need heroic numbers like this to continue throughout the year to reach our 2016 guidance of 2% to 3% same-store sales growth. And recent history shows that sales in China had been difficult for us to call. So regarding our expectations coming into the year, KFC sales were obviously much better in Q1 than we could've imagined. In Q2, we're closer to where we thought we'd be for KFC as we believe that our successful Chinese New Year may have pulled forward some of early Q2 sales into Q1. That said, 6 weeks into the quarter, KFC sales were slightly positive, and we're encouraged by where the business is going. And obviously I'll let Micky speak to that in more detail. And as you know, we know that we still got a lot of work to do on Pizza Hut in China. And quarter to date, sales have remained double-digit negative. But again, as Dave mentioned, our Q2 laps for both KFC and Pizza Hut are more difficult, especially when you look at these multi-year stacks. So we feel great about the start to the year. We're confident in raising our guidance. We still expect China full  year -- China division same-store sales to be in the 2% to 3% range, which is consistent with our expectations. So with that, I'll just let Micky take over. I just wanted to compliment Micky and the team for a job well done."

I think, John, there were some factors that would be unique to Q1, and that has to do with the Chinese New Year. It was the year of the monkey and we were fortunate that the -- actually, it was not just fortune, but the team at KFC has really hit their stride. So Joey Wat was a very accomplished retail executive, has now really understood the rhythm of the KFC business, and they put together a sort of 1, 2, 3 punch around the Chinese New Year. Extending it from the traditional 10 days to about 4 weeks, centered around a very powerful bucket promotion but also then with activity afterwards featuring a grilled sandwich, which was good thinking because after a heavy Chinese New Year, people are looking for a healthier fare. So that aspect is unique to the Chinese New Year, and I think it was a spectacularly successful promotion. Somebody asked me how we level up that next year, and I think the one bit of good news we have is next year is actually the year of the chicken. So we started work already on the sort of promotions that we'll be running. But some of the factors that worked in Q1 actually give me encouragement for KFC overall. The first is the success of selling our core products, our fried chicken, hot wings, french fries, egg tarts and all the familiar favorites in China. And we are extending that principle by doing more activity around buckets in the back half of the year and also introducing boxed meals, which are a proven international success where you can buy a fairly -- a good -- just like a little bit more money, but significantly more product. As you can imagine, following a very large success in January and February we hit almost record volumes in the amount of chicken that we did sell. And also, that sale was accompanied by corresponding traffic growth. The ticket impact on our sales of plus 12% in Q1 was about 3%. So it wasn't as though that we -- no, sorry, the pricing impact. So it wasn't as though we took pricing to get there. The price impact was only plus 3%. The rest of it is on account of the fact that parting sizes for these large buckets were very large. And also, there was a significant increase in the number of items bought per person because the promotion was very well run. In Q2, we're about halfway through the quarter, but the pleasing thing is that KFC is positive. But as Greg said, there's a lot of volatility around it. It's a difficult quarter because they've got tough laps, we've had some expenses. Our goal as a team here is to make Q2 this year the fourth consecutive quarter of positive KFC same-store sales, but I cannot say that, that's a guarantee until we have more visibility. But the fact that the flow-through was very strong in profit terms, the simplification of the menu boards, which is well conducted, the strength of the marketing calendar in the back half gives me and the team a lot more confidence than we had 6 months ago."

The Taco Bell securitization is only going to be on the U.S. Taco Bell franchise and licensees, so it's just that part. The Taco -- the rest of the Taco Bell business will also be part of the other borrowings. So again, the securitization market, quite honestly, isn't deep enough to do any one of our entire businesses.

I think the great thing is we can codify what makes Taco Bell successful. And obviously, the other 2 brands can obviously track with what they've done and obviously attempt to replicate it, but in their own brand voice. So I'm very pleased with the progress that Pizza Hut is making. I think this positioning around, making it easier to get a better pizza, I think the -- not only the sales growth, but the transaction growth that we just got. Obviously, part of making it easier was to get our value better on Pizza Hut, which we have done. But I think you -- as we also said on the call, we are investing in technology. We do need to get from 9 POS systems down to 1 POS system. But as we also said, 46% of our delivery/carryout sales are digital, and that's growing and I do think we're making good progress there. On the KFC side, I think the Always Original positioning to move back to ""finger lickin' good,"" the great thing about KFC in the U.S. is it's a brand that's now being talked about. And I think for a long time, it wasn't on anyone's radar screen. So I'm very comfortable. I think the launch of Nashville Hot has really helped. Obviously, there's a value game being played by the burger boys because of beef pricing, but I think the return of $5 boxes has been a good move by the KFC team. And then for Taco Bell, yes, the answer is we -- I think we're now in 500 stores doing delivery in a couple of the key cities, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas. I'm not quite sure where else, but -- so that's been expanded. And I think if you just take the overall concept of ""easy beats better,"" which I know the Pizza Hut team originated, but what it basically says is, ""Yes, we've got to find ways to make it easier for our people, for customers to get to our brand."" But we do that 2 way: we build more units, but we also obviously will start looking at delivery as a way to get our food to 2 customers in their homes. So a very good question. We are making progress. The other brands, I think, are moving to where the Taco Bell brand strength is. A lot of work to be done, but I think we're moving in the right direction, and I'm encouraged by that."

So we had a stadium in the [indiscernible] with 8,000 people talking about the theme for the future, which is from ""strength to strength."" And in particular, when the KFC section was discussed, and we put out plans for the rest of the year and the positioning and the proposed marketing, there was just unbounded confidence. I feel that -- I really feel the brand is making a lot of progress. It is much stronger. I think the positioning is very clear. The calendars are strong. We are doing sensible things around the core of the brand. We've already cleaned up the menu boards. We will do that even more. We're introducing proven international winners. I think you always have to be cautious when it's -- when you come to China because there is economic volatility and there is also unexpected twists and turns. So there's nothing hidden. It's not as though we are worried about some specific event or there's something happening that causes us to worry, but we just want to be cautious. We'd had 2 or 3 years of a lot of volatility. So the way we're looking at it right now is it's a ""show me, don't tell me"" sort of story, and we're hoping quarter after quarter to improve and strengthen the business. I think it's been mentioned a number of times, Q2 is going to be a difficult quarter on account of a variety of factors, but we are very focused on seeing whether we can deliver positive same-store sales and take it from there. So on KFC, I feel confident. I feel that the brand is making a lot of progress. And the other thing we didn't talk about today is we that we've spent a lot of energy, and are going to be taking very good care of store refurbishment. So we have good designs, we've got good plans for aggressive refurbs in some of our older stores. We are opening a symbolically important 5,000 store in Shanghai, which is I think maybe the best KFC in the world. It's a state-of-the-art green store, which will open next week. Also, I think the brand is making progress on every front. On Pizza Hut, like I said before, I'm very disappointed it's at negative same-store sales, and I don't see any reason why we cannot turn it around. There's no entrance decrees and all our scores are good, our competitive position is fantastic. There really is no international competitor with the name. And in addition to the 1,500 dine-in stores, we've got about 300 delivery units, which are -- dwarfed the competition. So I feel the brands are really genuinely making progress. It's just that it's been 2 months. The first quarter was 2 months, and they make a call on the rest of the year, knowing what we've seen over the last 3 years seem to be out of the bounds of what we should be doing. So that hopefully gives you some context on the way we're looking at it."

By the way, I'm very happy with 8% transaction growth in breakfast with one of our competitors doing all-day breakfast, so let me just say that. So to answer your question, yes, we had tied the launch of the Quesalupa to the Super Bowl. I tried to get the Super Bowl more forward a couple of weeks because that would have really helped us, but unfortunately, the NFL wasn't going to play along. So we were so tied up to the launch with that event that there was a couple of weeks where we were a little naked, I would say. And so obviously, sales and transactions up to there were soft. The good news is that after that event, the Quesalupa had mix of over 10% and have done well for us. But I think even more importantly, Brian, who is doing a great job leading the brand, had -- he and the team have already changed the calendar. And in fact, today, we will launch some new $1 items into the marketplace. There's been a number of revisions to the calendar. So I think we can still be an incredibly innovative brand, a socially conscious brand led by digital, but we can also just get out value, so it's more than competitive in the marketplace. And I think talking to Brian the other day, he and I have -- still have a lot of confidence we'll deliver the at least 3% same-store sales growth for the year at Taco Bell."

I mean, the year of the dragon and the monkey are of particular significance. Every year is important. One interesting feature that Joey and the team put together was they actually introduced a Christmas bucket in 2015 December, which was reasonably successful, so they're dialing that up. So I think the point really is that if we do a good bucket-oriented for the calendar in December for Christmas and then Chinese New Year next year, we can look to a good performance. The success of the monkey -- the year of the monkey promotion has shown to us the importance of choosing the character well, the toys that go with it, the kid's meals that accompany it, which will all help us to build for the future. And I think the year of the chicken does help.

It's not as though we're building necessarily smaller units. It is true that we build more stores in smaller cities, but our comp sales growth across tiers has been fairly consistent. We are experimenting with multiple store formats to take into account the fact that there is still very rapid build-out in infrastructure in China. So we are expecting very large number of malls that are already under construction, the high-speed rail network is being expanded and then in China, unlike the U.S., there's not a phenomenon at the moment of highways with drive-thrus, or the rest stops, and all of those are being developed. I don't really see the character of our productivity per unit changing in the years to come. I think, worldwide, there is a trend to, what we call, small box, which is because in line they're becoming more popular in mall stores, et cetera. So there may be in the longer term slightly smaller format units, but not -- China is not that impacted because we hardly have any drive-thrus. We hardly have any drive-thrus at all. So most of them are in line anyway. So maybe we need to think about this question a little more, but we don't intrinsically see any reason why the sort of growth we've enjoyed should not be projected long term into the future."

Well, at the moment, as you know, the state of about just over 7,000 stores. About 10% are franchised and 90% are equity. I think, at the moment, as long as we have -- and the way -- we never chase a number of stores that we have to build, but when we get new trade zones opening and opportunities that make commercial sense and has a very disciplined process for capital allocation and measuring new unit returns, we have a lot of surplus capital, as you know, in China. All the stores here have been built with Chinese-generated capital, there's no intrinsic reason why we would want to give that up to franchisees. The 2 reasons why we do expect, however, franchising to up marginally is, firstly, there are our regions of the country where it makes sense for franchisees to operate. We recently opened in the Autonomous Region of Tibet, our first store in Lhasa, Tibet. And for a variety of reasons, including difficult operating conditions and local market knowledge, that was given to a franchisee, and it's been successful and I think that will grow. So there are parts of the country where we will do it for reasons that it makes sense to do it that way. And the other is that there will be opportunities to do franchising, for example, with a gas station chain, et cetera. And for those technical reasons, the percentage of franchising might go up for 10 to maybe 15 or something in the foreseeable future, but we don't expect a significant change there. Now of course, if we do not find the ability to invest our capital in productive equity investment, sure, we'll look at franchising more actively. We're not at the moment -- we're agnostic to whether it's franchising or equity, frankly. I mean, both have advantages. Franchisees can -- obviously, their capital-light and also they're very innovative. But at the moment, with the capital that we have, especially as they become independent, I think it will be a good use for the capital to continue to invest. I mean, China is a growth market, the way we see it. And we still have the vision doubling or tripling our store base. So that's the way we're looking at it. So I would say the franchising percentage will edge up, but it will not be a game-changer in our business."

You actually have -- it's very large number of pages. It's a book. It's a little difficult to navigate, so simplifying that is a priority. Pizza Hut is celebrated and known for the variety of menu here. We do not want to lose that, but at the same time, I think we can make it far more controlled. It also speeds up service, and table turns are an issue at Pizza Hut at peak times. So for those reasons, we are rationalizing the menu. We're also, like I said earlier, pointing out the great value that we have through lunch combos and other offers, so we'll -- we're redesigning that part of the menu as well. And lastly, does it -- this -- I mean, I'm constantly amazed at how advanced China is digitally. It's got twice the number of cell phones, smartphones as the U.S. population. And even on our offices, people go up and down the elevator to go to lunch. They're looking up where the offers are available and where they can book a table, et cetera. So the action is shifting very rapidly to mobile devices, and both the menu as well as digital marketing is becoming very significant. So we are working on that. The good news is that both -- for both our brands, we are in a leadership position when it comes to that whole digital interface, cashless payment, et cetera. But to your question, yes, I think the sort of operational simplicity at KFC, making it easier for consumers to choose our bestselling products, and the general philosophy that the menu should not be a -- should be used more as guiding customers to our best-selling products than to give open choices, which they get confused about, is something that is applicable at Pizza Hut as well."

We reported core operating profit growth of 21% for the first quarter 2016. Core operating profit growth is our operating profit growth year-over-year excluding foreign currency translation and special items. Second, as previously announced, effective January of this year, the company's India business integrated its 3 brands into our global brand divisions. The prior year figures have been restated in the release.

I'm pleased we're off to a strong start in 2016 with better-than-expected core operating profit growth of 21% in the first quarter. This includes 42% growth in our China business due to outstanding Chinese New Year results at KFC, underscoring the power of the KFC brand in China when we deliver insight-driven marketing that resonates with our customers. 
Companywide, all 4 of our divisions posted positive same-store sales and operating profit growth in constant currency. Furthermore, we are on track to finalize the spin-off of our China business by year-end, creating 2 powerful, independent, focused growth companies. As you saw in our release, we're raising full year core operating profit growth guidance for Yum! Brands to 12% from 10% previously. Even though it is still early in the year, we are confident about the revised guidance, and we'll update you as the year progresses.
Today, I'll give you an overview of each of our operating divisions. And then Dave Russell, our interim CFO, will walk you through the financials. 
So first, China. For the China division, same-store sales grew 6%, led by 12% same-store sales growth at KFC. Our KFC business, as a reminder, represents about 75% of our operating profit in China. We saw particular success at KFC during the Chinese New Year with bucket meals, which we tailored across 4 customer groups ranging from kids buckets to larger group meals. As a result, buckets mixed a much higher percentage than normally. This lifted average ticket as we focused more on group occasions. And we gained even more consumer insights this year, which will help our business both going forward as well as next new year. Pizza Hut Casual Dining, which represents about 25% of our operating profit in China, remained challenging. System sales declined 1%, and same-store sales declined 12% in the quarter. A tough macro environment and competitive landscape continued to weigh on performance. We're addressing this with urgency but realize our recovery will take time.
So wrapping up on China. We are pleased with our first quarter's overall operating profit growth, which came in well ahead of our expectations. The strong margin performance reinforces our confidence in the future earnings power of this business. When we generate sales growth, profit flow-through is impressive. As Steve mentioned, Micky Pant, our division -- China division CEO, is on the call today and will be happy to assist in answering questions you may have on the China business.
Now turning to our 3 global brand divisions. In our KFC division, same-store sales grew 1% in the first quarter or 5% on a 2-year stack. Operating profit grew 7% in constant currency when adjusting for incremental advertising spend in the U.S. The division opened 79 new international restaurants in 32 countries. 77% of these units were opened by franchisees, and 71% of our new international openings were in emerging markets. I'm encouraged by our ability to generate growth in both emerging and developed markets. System sales in international developed markets grew 5%, and in international emerging markets, grew 8%. I recently visited with the team in Canada and was thrilled to see the assets being upgraded and the marketing position around Always Original. With 6% same-store sales growth in the quarter, I'd say it's working. I'm also pleased to see success in emerging markets, which are a key contributor to KFC's growth story. KFC is a franchise-led emerging powerhouse, and I'm confident the brand is getting even stronger and will produce strong growth this year and for many years to come.
Pizza Hut grew same-store sales 3% in the quarter and was led by 5% same-store sales growth in the U.S., which makes up approximately 60% of total sales. Our $5 flavor menu helped drive system transactions with company stores leading the way, up 8% in the quarter. Our discipline around making it easier to get a better pizza is holistic and driving traffic. We are focused on the entire customer experience from ordering, payment and delivery tracking to our assets and menu, and I believe this quarter's results are a further testament to our maniacal emphasis on this way of thinking. We are on track to replace over 1,300 U.S. ovens in 2016. For those stores replacing older ovens, this should result in average energy savings of 25% in ongoing operational costs and a faster cook time. From a marketing calendar perspective, we are focusing on balancing premium product innovation such as stuffed garlic knots pizza to protect and improve unit-level economics with compelling value offerings such as their ongoing $6.99 Any pairs deal. All of this will enable us to provide our customers with a better pizza at great value.
Our international business at Pizza Hut saw system sales growth of 3% in constant currency and a 1% decline in same-store sales in the quarter. Sales were especially strong in Latin America and Canada, but offset by weaknesses in Korea, Australia and India. We are committed to offering consistent everyday value to our customers and will leverage proven value strategies across markets with similar characteristics. 
We have high expectations for the international Pizza Hut business. Over the last 5 years, we have opened 1,200 international restaurants, and we will continue to grow this business over time. The bottom line is that we have established solid momentum with our strategy in the U.S., especially around the $5 flavor menu. And as we roll this overall strategy out internationally, we hope to achieve similar success.
Now turning to Taco Bell. Same-store sales grew 1%, lapping 6% growth a year ago, and operating profit grew 4% in the quarter. Restaurant margins were an impressive 21%. While 1% same-store sales growth is not what we're used to seeing at Taco Bell, the timing of our key launches had an impact on same-store sales growth for the quarter. The Quesalupa, which launched in February, mixed at almost 10% and drove a meaningful lift in transactions. We also launched our $1 breakfast menu in March. The $1 price point is consistent with Taco Bell's reputation as the value leader in QSR. Taco Bell's new breakfast $1 value menu differentiates itself from the competitors and puts it at the forefront of value in a growing daypart. We now have 10 $1 items on the breakfast menu and are seeing breakfast sales hold at 8% and transaction growth accelerating. The Taco Bell team is exhibiting great flexibility to read and react to the competitive value pressures and adjusted their 2016 promotional calendar accordingly to highlight even more value. Insight-driven innovation, crave-able food and breakthrough value, such as the upcoming launches of the $1 Beefy Crunch Burrito and steak value [ph] later this year, should boost sales and further the brand's momentum.
So we're off to a great start at Yum! Over the past several quarters, we really had 3 businesses that needed dramatic improvement: KFC China, Pizza Hut China and Pizza Hut U.S. I'm pleased that we've been able to turn 2 out of these 3 businesses, as KFC China and Pizza Hut U.S. are on more solid footing. Now let's be clear: We're not out of the woods on these businesses, but we've made a lot of progress and we'll continue to focus on delivering better results. As you heard me say before, this is a transformational year for Yum! as we finalize the spin-off of our China business, creating 2 powerful, independent, focused growth companies. Our brand strength, unwavering focus on the customer and innovative food offerings driven by consumer insights will allow us to grow Yum! into an even better global company. This is an exciting time and pivotal time for our company, and I look forward to what the future holds.
And with that, I will hand the call over to Dave."

In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: our first quarter results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our planned recapitalization and the spin-off of our China business. As Greg mentioned, we are very pleased",1615,"Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: our first quarter results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our planned recapitalization and the spin-off of our China business. As Greg mentioned, we are very pleased with our strong first quarter results, where core operating profit increased 21%. EPS before special items grew 19%, including a 5-point negative impact from foreign currency. These results were led by better-than-expected sales in restaurant margins at KFC China. EPS also benefited from a 5% reduction in our diluted share count compared to our first quarter last year due to our significant share buybacks over the past 12 months. 
I'll now take you through our results by divisions, starting with our China business. For the China division overall, same-store sales grew 6% in the quarter. KFC grew same-store sales 12%, which was sequentially better than Q4 and exceeded our expectations. A successful Chinese New Year promotion drove results. As Greg said, the KFC brand in China is really powerful when you deliver insight-driven marketing that resonates with our customers.
Same-store sales at Pizza Hut Casual Dining remained sluggish, declining 12% in the quarter. We are working to turn the Pizza Hut business around in a difficult macro and competitive environment.
Restaurant margin improved 3.5 percentage points versus the prior year to 22.4%, helped by sales leverage at KFC, productivity initiatives and commodity deflations, more than offsetting sales deleverage at Pizza Hut. While our first quarter is a seasonally high sales period for the China division, restaurant margins of over 22% give us tremendous confidence in the future earnings power of this business. When we deliver solid top line growth, the profits are impressive. 
One other note on China's first quarter results. We had a leap year benefit that added an additional $6 million of operating profit in Q1 to China's results. However, we pull sales from the leap date out of our same-store sales calculation, such that the extra day had no impact on reported 6% same-store sales growth. The way our reporting with calendars works here at Yum!, none of our other divisions saw any impact from leap year in Q1. 
Now moving to our global KFC division, which posted its ninth consecutive quarter of same-store sales and profit growth. Emerging and international developed markets each grew comps 1%. U.S. recorded its seventh consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth despite overlapping 7% comps in the first quarter of last year. Operating margins improved 30 basis points in constant currency and core operating profit grew 4% in the quarter. Adjusting for the incremental advertising expense associated with the acceleration agreement we reached with our franchisees in 2015, core operating profit grew 7% in the quarter. As a reminder, the acceleration agreement with our U.S. franchisees, which went into effect during the second quarter of last year, called for us to invest incremental media of $20 million in 2016 as opposed to $10 million last year.
Our global Pizza Hut division delivered 3% same-store sales growth for the quarter, led by 5% same-store sales growth in our U.S. business. Same-store sales growth and lower G&A expenses drove core operating profit growth of 9%. This is the best result we've seen in our Pizza Hut U.S. in years, and we believe our strategy is working to drive incremental transactions. I am pleased to see momentum behind the business and believe we can transfer our U.S. learnings to benefit the system globally. Digital continues to grow in importance to our sales, comprising 46% of U.S. delivery and carryout sales, a 3 percentage point increase versus a year ago. On Super Bowl Sunday alone, we took over 500,000 digital orders, representing about 50% of sales along with an all-time record day for the business. With digital orders comes higher levels of loyalty and higher average spend, so we're investing as you would expect. Along those lines, we're making progress in migrating to a single point-of-sale system in the U.S. by the end of 2017, which will allow us to be more nimble as we roll out digital initiatives going forward.
Finally, Taco Bell faced increased value pressure from the burger chains in the first quarter and posted 1% same-store sales growth. Same-store sales improved throughout the quarter, and we remain confident in achieving 3% same-store sales growth for the year with a stronger second half than first half. Despite the lower-than-expected full quarter sales, operating margin improved 150 basis points to 28%, and operating profit grew 4%. Restaurant margins also improved 150 basis points at 21%, and we expect full year margins to be greater than 20% this year, albeit slightly lower than last year. 
On the development front, we opened 40 new -- 49 new restaurants in the first quarter, with 90% opened by franchisees and licensees. Of our new openings, 7 were international units. We expect to open a record number of Taco Bell units internationally in 2016 as we continue to make progress in building out the unit-level economics as we enter into new countries.
I'd now like to shift to our 2016 outlook. With our strong first quarter results and the change in China's tax laws, whereby a value-added tax or VAT is replacing the business tax, we are raising our full year core operating profit growth forecast to 12% from 10% for Yum!. 
For a little bit of background on the VAT. China recently announced further reform to its retail tax structure, which is intended to be a progressive and positive shift to more closely align with a more modern service-based economy. Under this reform, a 6% output VAT would replace the 5% business tax currently applied to certain restaurant sales. Input VAT would be creditable to the aforementioned 6% output VAT. This change is effective May 1, 2016, so it in no way had any impact on our first quarter performance. While it's difficult to estimate the impact of this VAT reform prior to its actual implementation, Yum! China currently expects a positive financial benefit, further enabling continued investment in the business and creating thousands of additional jobs in China. While we are raising our forecast for core operating profit growth from Yum! from 10% to 12%, we are maintaining our guidance for China same-store sales of 2% to 3% for the full year. 
From a modeling standpoint, there are 2 other things to bear in mind as you build your forecast. First, the second quarter in China, which is typically our seasonally low quarter, happens to be our toughest hurdle of the year on a 2-, 3- and 4-year stack same-store sales base. Second, we have an RGM convention in the second quarter that we did not have last year that we expect to cost around $7 million. It is important for you to know that these factors were fully factored into our initial guidance, and our first half and full year performance is expected to exceed our expectations coming into the year.
All-in for Yum!, we outperformed our expectations in the first quarter and are raising our full year guidance to 12% core operating profit growth, including the 53rd week. This takes into account the strong first quarter we produced at KFC China, weakness at Pizza Hut Casual Dining and the expected VAT benefit in China, in addition to our brand divisions continuing to produce results consisting -- consistent with our 2 -- initial 2016 targets. It's early in the year to raise guidance, but we feel confident given where things stand, and we'll update you as the year progresses.
Now I'd like to quickly update you on our spin-off plans. We remain on track to complete the spin-off by year-end. We plan on filing our initial Form 10 by early May and conducting comprehensive roadshows ahead of the separation. This spin-off will establish 2 unique investment opportunities and create one of the largest U.S.-listed China retail businesses. Another key aspect of our strategy is to optimize the capital structure of Yum!. Given the significant improvement we've seen recently in the debt markets, we'd like to announce another milestone in our previously communicated plan of targeting companywide leverage of approximately 5x EBITDA. In early May, we plan to enter into a new financing facility of at least $2 billion, securitizing Taco Bell's U.S. royalties. As a next step in our plan, subsidiaries that operate our KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell's businesses, excluding the Taco Bell subsidiaries included in the securitization financing, are expected to enter into a new senior secured credit facility and issue new high-yield notes. More details will be forthcoming in a separate release later today. In line with what we previously communicated, we plan to complete our rate [ph] capitalization and have approximately $9 billion of debt outstanding by the end of the second quarter.
Finally, since we announced in October 2015 our intention to separate the China business, we have bought back 24.7 million shares at an average price of $71, returning a total of $1.8 billion to shareholders excluding dividends. As previously announced, our recap will enable us to complete an additional $4.4 billion return of capital to shareholders. 
So let me wrap things up. I'm pleased we started 2016 off with a strong quarter. We're confident we'll deliver 12% core operating profit growth for the full year and we're proceeding as expected with the separation of our China business into an independent publicly traded company. We are working diligently to set up both companies for future success and look forward to updating you on any progress throughout the year. 
And with that, I'll hand the ball -- call back to Greg."

First, on Pizza Hut, I just wanted to say to all of you that it is an extremely strong brand in China. All our consumer metrics, the brand image tracking that we do regularly shows that brand regard, value scores, food scores are very high, and they recovered fully from the crisis that we had a couple of years ago. We opened 280 new Pizza Huts last year, and new unit returns are very good. Over the last 4 years, we've opened 1,000 Pizza Huts dine-in restaurants alone and we dwarfed the competition. So it is a very strong brand. It is true that same-store sales have been negative. But in 2015, for example, our system sales were up 10 points, and we do track through CREST in 22 cities and also through publicly reported companies that operate in casual dining here, the overall casual dining performance, and it is our understanding that we gained market share. Part of the reason the casual dining sector has been hit has been due to a decline in consumer confidence. And as we explained in December last year, part of it was on account of the fact that home delivery through aggregators was growing. This latter phenomenon has tapered off a bit on account of burnouts, et cetera. So we fully expect that Pizza Hut will turn the corner. It is a strong brand. Margin performance have been good. Sales were kind of minus 1, system sales in the first quarter, but our goal is to get to same-store sales positive. I cannot put a date on it, David, because the market is volatile, but we are doing a number of things. First is that we have shifted the focus back to the core menu with a lot of pizza activity. So we will have more pizza innovation in the next 6 months than we've had in a long time, and these have tested very well. The second, I believe, is our value scores are actually good. You can eat lunch at a Pizza Hut at just a little more than at a KFC. So there's no need for any margin compression, but we do need to communicate that value better, which we have started doing. We've clarified the brand position significantly and we've hired one of the best celebrities in China to bring that point home. And lastly, we continue to emphasize customer service for the programs that would be presented in December. So with that, I feel much better about Pizza Hut than I did a few months ago but, of course, I'm disappointed that same-store sales are still negative. And I might also remind you, as you know very well, that Pizza Hut is about 25% of our sales and our profits. So one way to look at it is that 3 of the 4 engines that drive the Yum! China business are KFC. And with KFC performing well, I think we have the ability to support [ph] Pizza Hut in coming quarters."

But first, I want to commend Micky and the entire China team for what I think is a fantastic Q1. KFC China delivered 12% same-store sales growth. And as you can see from the 42% growth in op profit, the earnings power of the business is extraordinary when sales are working in our favor. And we're very encouraged that we've now had 3 consecutive quarters of same-store sales at KFC China. I think, fortunately, we didn't assume and we don't need heroic numbers like this to continue throughout the year to reach our 2016 guidance of 2% to 3% same-store sales growth. And recent history shows that sales in China have been difficult for us to call. So regarding our expectations coming into the year, KFC sales were obviously much better in Q1 than we could've imagined. In Q2, we're closer to where we thought we'd be for KFC as we believe that our successful Chinese New Year may have pulled forward some of early Q2 sales into Q1. That said, 6 weeks into the quarter, KFC sales were slightly positive, and we're encouraged by where the business is going. And obviously, I'll let Micky speak to that in more detail. And as you know, we know that we still got a lot of work to do on Pizza Hut in China. And quarter to date, sales have remained double-digit negative. But again, as Dave mentioned, our Q2 laps for both KFC and Pizza Hut are more difficult, especially when you look at these multi-year stacks. So we feel great about the start to the year. We're confident in raising our guidance. We still expect China full year -- China division same-store sales to be in the 2% to 3% range, which is consistent with our expectations. So with that, I'll just let Micky take over. I just wanted to compliment Micky and the team for a job well done."

I think, John, there were some factors that were unique to Q1, and that has to do with the Chinese New Year. It was the year of the monkey and we were fortunate that the -- actually, it was not just fortune, but the team at KFC has really hit their stride. So Joey Wat, who was a very accomplished retail executive, has now really understood the rhythm of the KFC business, and they put together a sort of 1, 2, 3 punch around the Chinese New Year. Extending it from the traditional 10 days to about 4 weeks, centered around a very powerful bucket promotion but also then with activity afterwards featuring a grilled sandwich, which was good thinking because after a heavy Chinese New Year, people are looking for a healthier fare. So that aspect is unique to the Chinese New Year, and I think it was a spectacularly successful promotion. Somebody asked me how we'll ever lap that next year, and I think the one bit of good news we have is next year is actually the year of the chicken. So we started work already on the sort of promotions that we'll be running. But some of the factors that worked in Q1 actually give me encouragement for KFC overall. The first is the success of selling our core products, our fried chicken, hot wings, french fries, egg tarts and all the familiar favorites in China. And we are extending that principle by doing more activity around buckets in the back half of the year and also introducing boxed meals, which are a proven international success where you can buy a fairly -- a good -- just like a little bit more money, but significantly more product. As you can imagine, following a very large success in January and February, we hit almost record volumes in the amount of chicken that we did sell. And also, that sale was accompanied by corresponding traffic growth. The ticket impact on our sales of plus 12% in Q1 was about 3%. So it wasn't as though that we -- no, sorry, the pricing impact. So it wasn't as though we took pricing to get there. The price impact was only plus 3%. The rest of it is on account of the fact that party sizes for these large buckets were very large. And also, there was a significant increase in the number of items bought per person because the promotion was very well run. In Q2, we're about halfway through the quarter, but the pleasing thing is that KFC is positive. But as Greg said, there's a lot of volatility around it. It's a difficult quarter because we've got tough laps, we've had some expenses. Our goal as a team here is to make Q2 this year the fourth consecutive quarter of positive KFC same-store sales, but I cannot say that that's a guarantee until we have more visibility. But the fact that the flow-through was very strong in profit terms, the simplification of the menu boards, which is well conducted, the strength of the marketing calendar in the back half gives me and the team a lot more confidence than we had 6 months ago."

What we did get in the quarter, particularly, was some good productivity gains on account of using more part-time and student labor, which is a phenomena that did not exist in China in the long past, and that is making a difference. So looking forward, it's always a risk, but I don't see labor price inflation as being a significant risk. I think the key for us is going to be product innovation, sensible pricing and get traffic scores back. So I hope that helps."

I think the great thing is we can codify what makes Taco Bell successful. And obviously, the other 2 brands can obviously track with what they've done and obviously attempt to replicate it, but in their own brand voice. So I'm very pleased with the progress that Pizza Hut is making. I think there's positioning around making it easier to get a better pizza. I think the -- not only the sales growth, but the transaction growth that we just got. Obviously, part of making it easier was to get our value better on Pizza Hut, which we have done. But I think you -- as we also said on the call, we are investing in technology. We do need to get from 9 POS systems down to 1 POS system. But as we also said, 46% of our delivery/carryout sales are digital, and that's growing. So I do think we're making good progress there. On the KFC side, I think the Always Original positioning to move back to ""finger lickin' good"". The great thing about KFC in the U.S. is it's a brand that's now being talked about. And I think for a long time, it wasn't on anyone's radar screen. So I'm very comfortable. I think the launch of Nashville Hot has really helped. Obviously, there's a value game being played by the burger boys because of beef pricing, but I think the return of $5 boxes has been a good move by the KFC team. And then for Taco Bell, yes, the answer is we -- I think we're now in 500 stores doing delivery in a couple of the key cities, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas. I'm not quite sure where else, but -- so that's been expanded. And I think if you just take the overall concept of ""easy beats better,"" which I know the Pizza Hut team originated, but what it basically says is, ""Yes, we've got to find ways to make it easier for our people, for customers to get to our brand."" But we do that 2 ways: we build more units, but we also obviously will start looking at delivery as a way to get our food to customers in their homes. So a very good question. We are making progress. The other brands, I think, are moving to where the Taco Bell brand strength is. A lot of work to be done, but I think we're moving in the right direction, and I'm encouraged by that."

Like I said, I think the team and myself are feeling very much more confident. We just, this week, had all of our store managers. So we had a stadium in the city of Dalian with 8,000 people talking about the theme for the future, which is from ""strength to strength."" And in particular, when the KFC section was discussed, and we put out plans for the rest of the year and the positioning and the proposed marketing, there was just unbounded confidence. I feel that -- I really feel the brand is making a lot of progress. It is much stronger. I think the positioning is very clear. The calendars are strong. We are doing sensible things around the core of the brand. We've already cleaned up the menu boards. We will do that even more. We're introducing proven international winners. I think you always have to be cautious when it's -- when you come to China because there is economic volatility and there is also unexpected twists and turns. So there's nothing hidden. It's not as though we are worried about some specific event or there's something happening that causes us to worry, but we just want to be cautious. We've had 2 or 3 years of a lot of volatility. So the way we're looking at it right now is it's a ""show me, don't tell me"" sort of story, and we're hoping quarter after quarter to improve and strengthen the business. I think it's been mentioned a number of times, Q2 is going to be a difficult quarter on account of a variety of factors, but we are very focused on seeing whether we can deliver positive same-store sales and take it from there. So on KFC, I feel confident. I feel that the brand is making a lot of progress. And the other thing we didn't talk about today is we that we've spent a lot of energy and are going to be taking very good care of store refurbishment. So we have good designs, we've got good plans for aggressive refurbs in some of our older stores. We are opening a symbolically important 5,000th store in Shanghai, which is I think maybe the best KFC in the world. It's a state-of-the-art green store, which will open next week. Also, I think the brand is making progress on every front. On Pizza Hut, like I said before, I'm very disappointed it's at negative same-store sales, and I don't see any reason why we cannot turn it around. There's no entrance decrees [ph] and all our scores are good, our competitive position is fantastic. There really is no international competitor with the name. And in addition to the 1,500 dine-in stores, we've got about 300 delivery units, which are -- dwarfed the competition. So I feel the brands are really genuinely making progress. It's just that it's been 2 months. The first quarter was 2 months, and to make a call on the rest of the year, knowing what we've seen over the last 3 years, seems to be out of the bounds of what we should be doing. So that hopefully gives you some context on the way we're looking at it."

By the way, I'm very happy with 8% transaction growth in breakfast with one of our competitors doing all-day breakfast, so let me just say that. So to answer your question, yes, we had tied the launch of the Quesalupa to the Super Bowl. I tried to get the Super Bowl brought forward a couple of weeks because that would have really helped us, but unfortunately, the NFL wasn't going to play along. So we were so tied up to the launch with that event that there was a couple of weeks where we were a little naked, I would say. And so obviously, sales and transactions up to there were soft. The good news is that after that event, the Quesalupa had mix of over 10% and has done well for us. But I think even more importantly, Brian, who is doing a great job leading the brand, had -- he and the team have already changed the calendar. And in fact, today, we will launch some new $1 items into the marketplace. There's been a number of revisions to the calendar. So I think we can still be an incredibly innovative brand, a socially conscious brand, led by digital, but we can also just get out value so it's more than competitive in the marketplace. And I think talking to Brian the other day, he and I have -- still have a lot of confidence we'll deliver the at least 3% same-store sales growth for the year at Taco Bell."

One interesting feature that Joey and the team put together was they actually introduced a Christmas bucket in 2015 December, which was reasonably successful, so they're dialing that up. So I think the point really is that if we do a good bucket-oriented for the calendar in December for Christmas and then Chinese New Year next year, we can look to a good performance. The success of the monkey -- the year of the monkey promotion has shown to us the importance of choosing the character well, the toys that go with it, the kid's meals that accompany it, which will all help us to build for the future. And I think the year of the chicken does help. I mean there's no better authority on chicken than KFC, but I don't think it's going to be culturally that significant that people have to eat chicken in the year of the chicken or something like that.

And so I think, China, I would say the words aren't exactly Always Original. I think it's Be Your True Self, but they pretty much resonate. We've now got this brand on a global positioning, so we can leverage things. Micky has reached out and taken things like the $5 boxes that had been incredibly successful in a number of markets. As he said, they will go into the market soon in China. The Pizza Hut team is looking at a new positioning for Pizza Hut. And as Micky said, I think focusing on the pizza and less on the more and getting back to the core will help that brand as well. So I would sum it up as new leader, great leader, fresh perspective, great team, more global alignment and a real focus on brand building, all underpinned by our fundamental belief that we leverage culture to fuel results."

And I really can't, at the moment, think of a particular reason. That certainly has not struck me that the new units that we are building are -- in any way have inferior economics or any such [ph]. It's not as though we're building necessarily smaller units. It is true that we build more stores in smaller cities, but our comp sales growth across tiers has been fairly consistent. We are experimenting with multiple store formats to take into account the fact that there is still a very rapid build-out in infrastructure in China. So we are expecting a very large number of malls that are already under construction, the high-speed rail network is being expanded and then in China, unlike the U.S., there's not a phenomenon at the moment of highways with drive-thrus, or the rest stops, and all of those are being developed. I don't really see the character of our productivity per unit changing in the years to come. I think, worldwide, there is a trend to, what we call, small box, which is because in-lines are becoming more popular in mall stores, et cetera. So there may be in the longer term slightly smaller-format units, but not -- China is not that impacted because we hardly have any drive-thrus. We hardly have any drive-thrus at all. So most of them are in-lines anyway. So maybe we need to think about this question a little more, but we don't intrinsically see any reason why the sort of growth we've enjoyed should not be projected long term into the future."

Well, at the moment, as you know, the estate of about just over 7,000 stores, about 10% are franchised and 90% are equity. I think, at the moment, as long as we have -- and the way -- we never chase a number of stores that we have to build, but when we get new trade zones opening and opportunities that make commercial sense -- and there's a very disciplined process for capital allocation and measuring new unit returns. We have a lot of surplus capital, as you know, in China. All the stores here have been built with Chinese-generated capital, there's no intrinsic reason why we would want to give that up to franchisees. The 2 reasons why we do expect, however, franchising to up marginally is, firstly, there are regions of the country where it makes sense for franchisees to operate. We recently opened in the Autonomous Region of Tibet, our first store in Lhasa, Tibet. And for a variety of reasons, including difficult operating conditions and local market knowledge, that was given to a franchisee, and it's been successful and I think that will grow. So there are parts of the country where we will do it for reasons that it makes sense to do it that way. And the other is that there will be opportunities to do franchising, for example, with gas station chains, et cetera. And for those technical reasons, the percentage of franchising might go up from 10% to maybe 15% or something in the foreseeable future, but we don't expect a significant change there. Now of course, if we do not find the ability to invest our capital in productive equity investment, sure, we'll look at franchising more actively. We're not at the moment -- we're agnostic to whether it's franchising or equity, frankly. I mean, both have advantages. Franchisees can -- obviously, they're capital-light and also they're very innovative. But at the moment, with the capital that we have, especially as we become independent, I think it will be a good use of the capital to continue to invest. I mean, China is a growth market, the way we see it. And we still have the vision doubling or tripling our store base. So that's the way we're looking at it. So I would say the franchising percentage will edge up, but it will not be a game-changer in our business."

What's difficult for us to say right now is exactly how that -- those credits are going to accumulate and what exactly is going to be creditable, and we are working through that, as you can imagine. With 6,000 stores, it's going to be a monumental effort, and there's also some lack of clarity around the rules at this point still. So we're going to have a lot more for you in July.

You actually have -- it's a very large number of pages. It's a book. It's a little difficult to navigate, so simplifying that is a priority. Pizza Hut is celebrated and known for the variety of menu here. We do not want to lose that, but at the same time, I think we can make it far more controlled. It also speeds up service, and table turns are an issue at Pizza Hut at peak times. So for those reasons, we are rationalizing the menu. We're also, like I said earlier, pointing out the great value that we have through lunch combos and other offers, so we'll -- we're redesigning that part of the menu as well. And lastly, does it -- this -- I mean, I'm constantly amazed at how advanced China is digitally. It's got twice the number of cell phones, smartphones as the U.S. population. And even in our offices, people go up and down the elevator to go to lunch. They're looking up where the offers are available and where they can book a table, et cetera. So the action is shifting very rapidly to mobile devices, and both the menu as well as digital marketing is becoming very significant. So we are working on that. The good news is that both -- for both our brands, we are in a leadership position when it comes to that whole digital interface, cashless payment, et cetera. But to your question, yes, I think the sort of operational simplicity at KFC, making it easier for consumers to choose our bestselling products, and the general philosophy that the menu should not be a -- should be used more as guiding customers to our best-selling products than to give open choices, which they get confused about, is something that is applicable at Pizza Hut as well."

We would like to make you aware of the following upcoming Yum! investor event. Our second quarter 2016 earnings will be released on Wednesday, July 13.
Now before I turn the call over to Greg, I would like to bring your attention to two items you may have noticed in yesterday's release. First, the new terminology. We reported core operating profit growth of 21% for the first quarter 2016. Core operating profit growth is our operating profit growth year-over-year excluding foreign currency translation and special items. Second, as previously announced, effective January of this year, the Company's India business integrated its three brands into our global brand divisions. The prior year figures have been restated in the release. 
Now it's my pleasure to hand the call over to Mr. Greg Creed."

I'm pleased we're off to a strong start in 2016 with better-than-expected core operating profit growth of 21% in the first quarter. This includes 42% growth in our China business due to outstanding Chinese New Year results at KFC, underscoring the power of the KFC brand in China when we deliver insight-driven marketing that resonates with our customers. 
Companywide, all four of our divisions posted positive same-store sales and operating profit growth in constant currency. Furthermore, we are on track to finalize the spin-off of our China business by year-end, creating two powerful independent focused growth companies. As you saw in our release, we're raising full year core operating profit growth guidance for Yum! Brands to 12% from 10% previously. Even though it is still early in the year, we are confident about the revised guidance, and we'll update you as the year progresses.
Today, I'll give you an overview of each of our operating divisions. And then Dave Russell, our interim CFO, will walk you through the financials. 
So first, China. For the China division, same-store sales grew 6%, led by 12% same-store sales growth at KFC. Our KFC business, as a reminder, represents about 75% of our operating profit in China. We saw particular success at KFC during the Chinese New Year with bucket meals, which we tailored across four customer groups ranging from kids’ buckets to larger group meals. As a result, buckets mixed a much higher percentage than normally. This lifted average ticket as we focused more on group occasions. And we gained even more consumer insights this year, which will help our business both going forward as well as next New Year. Pizza Hut Casual Dining, which represents about 25% of our operating profit in China, remained challenging. System sales declined 1%, and same-store sales declined 12% in the quarter. A tough macro environment and competitive landscape continued to weigh on performance. We're addressing this with urgency but realize our recovery will take time.
So wrapping up on China. We are pleased with our first quarter's overall operating profit growth, which came in well ahead of our expectations. The strong margin performance reinforces our confidence in the future earnings power of this business. When we generate sales growth, profit flow-through is impressive. As Steve mentioned, Micky Pant, our division -- China division CEO, is on the call today and will be happy to assist in answering questions you may have on the China business.
Now turning to our three global brand divisions. In our KFC division, same-store sales grew 1% in the first quarter or 5% on a 2-year stack. Operating profit grew 7% in constant currency when adjusting for incremental advertising spend in the U.S. The division opened 79 new international restaurants in 32 countries. 77% of these units were opened by franchisees, and 71% of our new international openings were in emerging markets. I'm encouraged by our ability to generate growth in both emerging and developed markets. System sales in international developed markets grew 5%, and in international emerging markets grew 8%. I recently visited with the team in Canada and was thrilled to see the assets being upgraded and the marketing position around Always Original. With 6% same-store sales growth in the quarter, I would say it's working. I'm also pleased to see success in emerging markets, which are a key contributor to KFC's growth story. KFC is a franchise-led emerging powerhouse, and I'm confident the brand is getting even stronger and will produce strong growth this year and for many years to come.
Pizza Hut grew same-store sales 3% in the quarter and was led by 5% same-store sales growth in the U.S., which makes up approximately 60% of total sales. Our $5 flavor menu helped drive system transactions with company stores leading the way, up 8% in the quarter. Our discipline around making it easier to get a better pizza is holistic and driving traffic. We are focused on the entire customer experience from ordering, payment and delivery tracking, to our assets and menu. And I believe this quarter's results are a further testament to our maniacal emphasis on this way of thinking. We are on track to replace over 1,300 U.S. ovens in 2016. For those stores replacing older ovens, this should result in average energy savings of 25% in ongoing operational costs and a faster cook time. From a marketing calendar perspective, we are focusing on balancing premium product innovation, such as stuffed garlic knots pizza, to protect and improve unit-level economics with compelling value offerings such as their ongoing $6.99 Any Pairs deal. All of this will enable us to provide our customers with a better pizza at great value.
Our international business at Pizza Hut saw system sales growth of 3% in constant currency and a 1% decline in same-store sales in the quarter. Sales were especially strong in Latin America and Canada, but offset by weaknesses in Korea, Australia and India. We are committed to offering consistent everyday value to our customers and will leverage proven value strategies across markets with similar characteristics. 
We have high expectations for the international Pizza Hut business. Over the last five years, we have opened 1,200 international restaurants, and we will continue to grow this business over time. The bottom line is that we have established solid momentum with our strategy in the U.S., especially around the $5 Flavor menu. And as we roll this overall strategy out internationally, we hope to achieve similar success.
Now turning to Taco Bell. Same-store sales grew 1%, lapping 6% growth a year ago, and operating profit grew 4% in the quarter. Restaurant margins were an impressive 21%. While 1% same-store sales growth is not what we're used to seeing at Taco Bell, the timing of our key launches had an impact on same-store sales growth for the quarter. The Quesalupa, which launched in February, mixed at almost 10% and drove a meaningful lift in transactions. We also launched our $1 breakfast menu in March. The $1 price point is consistent with Taco Bell's reputation as the value leader in QSR. Taco Bell's new breakfast $1 value menu differentiates itself from the competitors and puts it at the forefront of value in a growing daypart. We now have ten $1 items on the breakfast menu and are seeing breakfast sales hold at 8% and transaction growth accelerating. The Taco Bell team is exhibiting great flexibility to read and react to the competitive value pressures, and adjusted their 2016 promotional calendar accordingly to highlight even more value. Insight driven innovation, craveable food, and breakthrough values, such as the upcoming launches of the $1 Beefy Crunch Burrito and steak value later this year should boost sales and further the brand's momentum.
We're off to a great start at Yum! Over the past several quarters, we really had three businesses that needed dramatic improvement: KFC China, Pizza Hut China and Pizza Hut U.S. I'm pleased that we have been able to turn two out of these three businesses, as KFC China and Pizza Hut U.S. are on more solid footing. Now let's be clear, we're not out of the woods on these businesses, but we've made a lot of progress and we'll continue to focus on delivering better results. As you heard me say before, this is a transformational year for Yum! as we finalize the spin-off of our China business, creating two powerful independent focused growth companies. Our brand strength, unwavering focus on the customer, and innovative food offerings driven by consumer insights will allow us to grow Yum! into an even better global company. This is an exciting time and pivotal time for our company, and I look forward to what the future holds.
And with that, I will hand the call over to Dave."
365997,330316003,982155,"Yum! Brands, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2016",2016-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Yum! Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll cover three areas: our first quarter results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our planned recapitalization and the spin-off of our China business.

In my remarks today, I'll cover three areas: our first quarter results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our planned recapitalization and the spin-off of our China business. As Greg mentioned, we are very pleased with our strong first quarter results, where core operating profit increased 21%. EPS before special items grew 19%, including a 5-point negative impact from foreign currency. These results were led by better-than-expected sales in restaurant margins at KFC China. EPS also benefited from a 5% reduction in our diluted share count compared to our first quarter last year due to our significant share buybacks over the past 12 months. 
I'll now take you through our results by divisions, starting with our China business. For the China division overall, same-store sales grew 6% in the quarter. KFC grew same-store sales 12%, which was sequentially better than Q4, and exceeded our expectations. A successful Chinese New Year promotion drove results. As Greg said, the KFC brand in China is really powerful when you deliver insight-driven marketing that resonates with our customers.
Same-store sales at Pizza Hut Casual Dining remained sluggish, declining 12% in the quarter. We are working to turn the Pizza Hut business around in a difficult macro and competitive environment.
Restaurant margin improved 3.5 percentage points versus the prior year to 22.4%, helped by sales leverage at KFC, productivity initiatives and commodity deflations, more than offsetting sales deleverage at Pizza Hut. While our first quarter is a seasonally high sales period for the China division, restaurant margins of over 22% give us tremendous confidence in the future earnings power of this business. When we deliver solid top line growth, the profits are impressive. 
One other note on China's first quarter results. We had a leap year benefit that added an additional $6 million of operating profit in Q1 to China's results. However, we pull sales from the leap date out of our same-store sales calculation, such that the extra day had no impact on reported 6% same-store sales growth. The way our reporting with calendars works here at Yum!, none of our other divisions saw any impact from leap year in Q1. 
Now moving to our global KFC division, which posted its ninth consecutive quarter of same-store sales and profit growth. Emerging and international developed markets each grew comps 1%. U.S. recorded its seventh consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth despite overlapping 7% comps in the first quarter of last year. Operating margins improved 30 basis points in constant currency and core operating profit grew 4% in the quarter. Adjusting for the incremental advertising expense associated with the acceleration agreement we reached with our franchisees in 2015, core operating profit grew 7% in the quarter. As a reminder, the acceleration agreement with our U.S. franchisees, which went into effect during the second quarter of last year, called for us to invest incremental media of $20 million in 2016 as opposed to $10 million last year.
Our global Pizza Hut division delivered 3% same-store sales growth for the quarter, led by 5% same-store sales growth in our U.S. business. Same-store sales growth and lower G&A expenses drove core operating profit growth of 9%. This is the best result we've seen in our Pizza Hut U.S. in years, and we believe our strategy is working to drive incremental transactions. I am pleased to see momentum behind the business and believe we can transfer our U.S. learnings to benefit the system globally. Digital continues to grow in importance to our sales, comprising 46% of U.S. delivery and carryout sales, a 3 percentage point increase versus a year ago. On Super Bowl Sunday alone, we took over 500,000 digital orders, representing about 50% of sales along with an all-time record day for the business. With digital orders comes higher levels of loyalty and higher average spend, so we're investing as you would expect. Along those lines, we are making progress in migrating to a single point-of-sale system in the U.S. by the end of 2017, which will allow us to be more nimble as we roll out digital initiatives going forward.
Finally, Taco Bell faced increased value pressure from the burger chains in the first quarter, and posted 1% same-store sales growth. Same-store sales improved throughout the quarter, and we remain confident in achieving 3% same-store sales growth for the year with a stronger second half than first half. Despite the lower than expected full quarter sales, operating margin improved 150 basis points to 28%, and operating profit grew 4%. Restaurant margins also improved 150 basis points at 21%, and we expect full-year margins to be greater than 20% this year, albeit slightly lower than last year. 
On the development front, we opened 40 new -- 49 new restaurants in the first quarter, with 90% opened by franchisees and licensees. Of our new openings, 7 were international units. We expect to open a record number of Taco Bell units internationally in 2016 as we continue to make progress in building out the unit-level economics as we enter into new countries.
I'd now like to shift to our 2016 outlook. With our strong first quarter results and the change in China's tax laws, whereby a value-added tax or VAT is replacing the business tax, we are raising our full year core operating profit growth forecast to 12% from 10% for Yum!. 
For a little bit of background on the VAT. China recently announced further reform to its retail tax structure, which is intended to be a progressive and positive shift to more closely align with a more modern service-based economy. Under this reform, a 6% output VAT would replace the 5% business tax currently applied to certain restaurant sales. Input VAT would be creditable to the aforementioned 6% output VAT. This change is effective May 1, 2016, so it in no way had any impact on our first quarter performance. While it's difficult to estimate the impact of this VAT reform prior to its actual implementation, Yum! China currently expects a positive financial benefit, further enabling continued investment in the business and creating thousands of additional jobs in China. While we are raising our forecast for core operating profit growth from Yum! from 10% to 12%, we are maintaining our guidance for China same-store sales of 2% to 3% for the full year. 
From a modeling standpoint, there are two other things to bear in mind as you build your forecast. First, the second quarter in China, which is typically our seasonally low quarter, happens to be our toughest hurdle of the year on a 2-, 3- and 4-year stack same-store sales base. Second, we have a RGM convention in the second quarter that we did not have last year that we expect to cost around $7 million. It is important for you to note that these factors were fully factored into our initial guidance, and our first half and full year performance is expected to exceed our expectations coming into the year.
All in for Yum!, we outperformed our expectations in the first quarter, and are raising our full-year guidance to 12% core operating profit growth, including the 53rd week. This takes into account the strong first quarter we produced at KFC China, weakness at Pizza Hut Casual Dining and the expected VAT benefit in China, in addition to our brand divisions continuing to produce results consisting -- consistent with our 2 -- initial 2016 targets. It is early in the year to raise guidance, but we feel confident given where things stand, and we'll update you as the year progresses.
Now I'd like to quickly update you on our spin-off plans. We remain on track to complete the spin-off by year-end. We plan on filing our initial Form 10 by early May and conducting comprehensive roadshows ahead of the separation. This spin-off will establish two unique investment opportunities and create one of the largest U.S.-listed China retail businesses. Another key aspect of our strategy is to optimize the capital structure of Yum!. Given the significant improvement we've seen recently in the debt markets, we'd like to announce another milestone in our previously communicated plan of targeting companywide leverage of approximately 5x EBITDA. In early May, we plan to enter into a new financing facility of at least $2 billion, securitizing Taco Bell's U.S. royalties. As a next step in our plan, subsidiaries will operate our KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell's businesses, excluding the Taco Bell subsidiaries included in the securitization financing, are expected to enter into a new senior secured credit facility and issue new high-yield notes. More details will be forthcoming in a separate release later today. In line with what we previously communicated, we plan to complete our rate [ph] capitalization and have approximately $9 billion of debt outstanding by the end of the second quarter.
Finally, since we announced in October 2015 our intention to separate the China business, we have bought back 24.7 million shares at an average price of $71, returning a total of $1.8 billion to shareholders excluding dividends. As previously announced, our recap will enable us to complete an additional $4.4 billion return of capital to shareholders. 
So let me wrap things up. I'm pleased we started 2016 off with a strong quarter. We're confident we'll deliver 12% core operating profit growth for the full year and we're proceeding as expected with the separation of our China business into an independent publicly traded company. We are working diligently to set up both companies for future success and look forward to updating you on any progress throughout the year. 
And with that, I'll hand the ball -- call back to Greg."

First, on Pizza Hut, I just wanted to say to all of you that it is an extremely strong brand in China. All our consumer metrics, the brand image tracking that we do regularly shows that brand regard, value scores, food scores are very high, and they recovered fully from the crisis that we had a couple of years ago. We opened 280 new Pizza Huts last year, and new unit returns are very good. Over the last 4 years, we've opened 1,000 Pizza Huts dine-in restaurants alone and we dwarfed the competition. So it is a very strong brand. It is true that same-store sales have been negative. But in 2015, for example, our system sales were up 10 points, and we do track through CREST in 22 cities and also through publicly reported companies that operate in casual dining here, the overall casual dining performance, and it is our understanding that we gained market share. Part of the reason the casual dining sector has been hit has been due to a decline in consumer confidence. And as we explained in December last year, part of it was on account of the fact that home delivery through aggregators was growing. This latter phenomenon has tapered off a bit on account of burnouts, et cetera. So we fully expect that Pizza Hut will turn the corner. It is a strong brand. Margin performance have been good. Sales were kind of minus 1, system sales in the first quarter, but our goal is to get to same-store sales positive. I cannot put a date on it, David, because the market is volatile, but we are doing a number of things. First is that we have shifted the focus back to the core menu with a lot of pizza activity. So we will have more pizza innovation in the next six months than we've had in a long time, and these have tested very well. The second, I believe, is our value scores are actually good. You can eat lunch at a Pizza Hut at just a little more than at a KFC. So there's no need for any margin compression, but we do need to communicate that value better, which we have started doing. We have clarified the brand position significantly and we've hired one of the best celebrities in China to bring that point home. And lastly, we continue to emphasize customer service for the programs that would be presented in December. So with that, I feel much better about Pizza Hut than I did a few months ago but, of course, I'm disappointed that same-store sales are still negative. And I might also remind you, as you know very well, that Pizza Hut is about 25% of our sales and our profits. So one way to look at it is that three of the four engines that drive the Yum! China business are KFC. And with KFC performing well, I think we have the ability to support Pizza Hut in coming quarters."

But first, I want to commend Micky and the entire China team for what I think is a fantastic Q1. KFC China delivered 12% same-store sales growth. And as you can see from the 42% growth in op profit, the earnings power of the business is extraordinary when sales are working in our favor. And we're very encouraged that we've now had three consecutive quarters of same-store sales at KFC China. I mean, fortunately, we didn't assume and we don't need heroic numbers like this to continue throughout the year to reach our 2016 guidance of 2% to 3% same-store sales growth. And recent history shows that sales in China have been difficult for us to call. So regarding our expectations coming into the year, KFC sales were obviously much better in Q1 than we could have imagined. In Q2, we are closer than we thought we would be for KFC as we believe that our successful Chinese New Year may have pulled forward some of early Q2 sales into Q1. That said, six weeks into the quarter, KFC sales were slightly positive, and we're encouraged by where the business is going. And obviously, I'll let Micky speak to that in more detail. And as you know, we know that we still got a lot of work to do on Pizza Hut in China. And quarter to date, sales have remained double-digit negative, but again, as Dave mentioned, our Q2 laps for both KFC and Pizza Hut are more difficult, especially when you look at these multi-year stacks. So we feel great about the start to the year. We're confidently in raising our guidance. We still expect China full year -- China division same-store sales to be in the 2% to 3% range, which is consistent with our expectations. So with that, I'll just let Micky take over.

I think, John, there were some factors that were unique to Q1, and that has to do with the Chinese New Year. It was the year of the monkey and we were fortunate that the -- actually, it was not just fortune, but the team at KFC has really hit their stride. So Joey Wat, who was a very accomplished retail executive, has now really understood the rhythm of the KFC business. And they put together a sort of 1, 2, 3 punch around the Chinese New Year. Extending it from the traditional ten days to about four weeks, centered around a very powerful bucket promotion. But also then with activity afterwards featuring a grilled sandwich, which was good thinking because after a heavy Chinese New Year, people are looking for a healthier fare. So that aspect is unique to the Chinese New Year, and I think it was a spectacularly successful promotion. Somebody asked me how we'll ever lap that next year, and I think the one bit of good news we have is next year is actually the year of the chicken. So we started work already on the sort of promotions that we'll be running. But some of the factors that worked in Q1 actually give me encouragement for KFC overall. The first is the success of selling our core products, our fried chicken, hot wings, french fries, egg tarts and all the familiar favorites in China. And we are extending that principle by doing more activity around buckets in the back half of the year and also introducing boxed meals, which are a proven international success where you can buy a fairly -- a good -- just like a little bit more money, but significantly more product. As you can imagine, following a very large success in January and February, we hit almost record volumes in the amount of chicken that we did sell. And also, that sale was accompanied by corresponding traffic growth. The ticket impact on our sales of plus 12% in Q1 was about 3%. So it wasn't as though that we -- no, sorry, the pricing impact. So it wasn't as though we took pricing to get there. The price impact was only plus 3. The rest of it is on account of the fact that party sizes for these large buckets were very large. And also, there was a significant increase in the number of items bought per person because the promotion was very well run. In Q2, we're about halfway through the quarter, but the pleasing thing is that KFC is positive. But as Greg said, there's a lot of volatility around it. It's a difficult quarter because we've got tough laps, we've had some expenses. Our goal as a team here is to make Q2 this year the fourth consecutive quarter of positive KFC same-store sales, but I cannot say that that's a guarantee until we have more visibility. But the fact that the flow-through was very strong in profit terms, the simplification of the menu boards, which is well conducted, the strength of the marketing calendar in the back half gives me and the team a lot more confidence than we had six months ago."

So looking forward, it's always a risk, but I don't see labor price inflation as being a significant risk.

I think the great thing is we can codify what makes Taco Bell successful. And obviously, the other 2 brands can obviously track with what they've done and obviously attempt to replicate it, but in their own brand voice. So I'm very pleased with the progress that Pizza Hut is making. I think its positioning around making it easier to get a better pizza. I think the -- not only the sales growth, but the transaction growth that we just got. Obviously, part of making it easier was to get our value better on Pizza Hut, which we have done. But I think you -- as we also said on the call, we are investing in technology. We do need to get from 9 POS systems down to 1 POS system. But as we also said, 46% of our delivery/carryout sales are digital, and that's growing. So I do think we're making good progress there. On the KFC side, I think the Always Original positioning to move back to ""finger lickin' good"". The great thing about KFC in the U.S. is it's a brand that's now being talked about. And I think for a long time, it wasn't on anyone's radar screen. So I'm very comfortable. I think the launch of Nashville Hot has really helped. Obviously, there's a value game being played by the burger boys because of beef pricing, but I think the return of $5 boxes has been a good move by the KFC team. And then for Taco Bell, yes, the answer is we -- I think we're now in 500 stores doing delivery in a couple of the key cities, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas. I'm not quite sure where else, but -- so that's been expanded. And I think if you just take the overall concept of ""easy beats better,"" which I know the Pizza Hut team originated, but what it basically says is, ""Yes, we've got to find ways to make it easier for our people, for customers to get to our brand."" And we do that two ways: we build more units, but we also obviously will start looking at delivery as a way to get our food to customers in their homes. So very good question. We are making progress. The other brands, I think, are moving to where the Taco Bell brand strength is. A lot of work to be done, but I think we're moving in the right direction, and I'm encouraged by that."

Like I said, I think the team and myself are feeling very much more confident. We just, this week, had all of our store managers, who we had a stadium in the City of Dhabia with 8,000 people talking about the theme for the future, which is from ""strength to strength."" And in particular, when the KFC section was discussed, and we put out plans for the rest of the year and the positioning and the proposed marketing, there was just unbounded confidence. So I feel that -- I really feel the brand is making a lot of progress. It is much stronger. I think the positioning is very clear. The calendars are strong. We are doing sensible things around the core of the brand. We've already cleaned up the menu boards. We will do that even more. We're introducing proven international winners. I think you always have to be cautious when it's -- when you come to China because there is economic volatility and there is also unexpected twists and turns. So there's nothing hidden. It's not as though we are worried about some specific event or there's something happening that causes us to worry, but we just want to be cautious. We've had two or three years of a lot of volatility. So the way we're looking at it right now is it's a ""show me, don't tell me"" sort of story, and we're hoping quarter after quarter to improve and strengthen the business. I think it's been mentioned a number of times, Q2 is going to be a difficult quarter on account of a variety of factors, but we are very focused on seeing whether we can deliver positive same-store sales and take it from there. So on KFC, I feel confident. I feel that the brand is making a lot of progress. And the other thing we didn't talk about today is we that we've spent a lot of energy and are going to be taking very good care of store refurbishment. So we have good designs, we've got good plans for aggressive refurbs in some of our older stores. We are opening a symbolically important 5,000th store in Shanghai, which is I think maybe the best KFC in the world. It's a state-of-the-art green store, which will open next week. Also, I think the brand is making progress on every front. On Pizza Hut, like I said before, I'm very disappointed it's at negative same-store sales, and I don't see any reason why we cannot turn it around. There's no entrance decrees [ph] and all our scores are good, our competitive position is fantastic. There really is no international competitor with the name. And in addition to the 1,500 dine-in stores, we've got about 300 delivery units, which are -- dwarfed the competition. So I feel the brands are really genuinely making progress. It's just that it's been two months. The first quarter was two months. And to make a call on the rest of the year, knowing what we've seen over the last three years, seems to be out of the bounds of what we should be doing. So that hopefully gives you some context on the way we're looking at it."

By the way, I'm very happy with 8% transaction growth in breakfast with one of our competitors doing all-day breakfast. So let me just say that. So to answer your question, yes, we had tied the launch of the Quesalupa to the Super Bowl. I tried to get the Super Bowl moved forward a couple of weeks because that would have really helped us, but unfortunately, the NFL wasn't going to play along. So we were so tied up to the launch with that event that there was a couple of weeks where we were a little naked, I would say. And so obviously, sales and transactions up to there were soft. The good news is that after that event, the Quesalupa had mix of over 10% and has done well for us. But I think even more importantly, Brian, who is doing a great job leading the brand, had -- he and the team have already changed the calendar. And in fact, today, we will launch some new $1 items into the marketplace. There's been a number of revisions to the calendar. So I think we can still be an incredibly innovative brand, a socially conscious brand, led by digital, but we can also just get out value so it's more than competitive in the marketplace. And I think talking to Brian the other day, he and I have -- still have a lot of confidence we'll deliver the at least 3% same-store sales growth for the year at Taco Bell."

I mean, the year of the dragon and the monkey are of particular significance. Every year is important. One interesting feature that Joey and the team put together was they actually introduced a Christmas bucket in 2015 December, which was reasonably successful, so they're dialing that up. So I think the point really is that if we do a good bucket-oriented for the calendar in December for Christmas and then Chinese New Year next year, we can look to a good performance. The success of the monkey -- the year of the monkey promotion has shown to us the importance of choosing the character well, the toys that go with it, the kids’ meals that accompany it, which will all help us to build for the future. And I think the year of the chicken does help. I mean there's no better authority on chicken than KFC, but I don't think it's going to be culturally that significant. People have to eat chickens in the year of the chicken or something like that. So it's a help, and all I was saying was that to lap this very successful year of the monkey promotion. So that's one little gift on our side."

I mean, they're just -- they're really having -- I was there in March, looking at the plans, looking at what they've learned from the lessons. Our culture is alive and well in China. So the whole recognition culture, and our belief that culture fuels results I think was absolutely evident. And I think at the same time, what's also happening in the whole business is that we're getting much better at brand building and strengthening our brand positioning. And so I think, China, I would say the words aren't exactly Always Original. I think it's “be your true self”, but they pretty much resonate. We have now got this brand on a global positioning, so we can leverage things. Micky has reached out and taken things like the $5 boxes that had been incredibly successful in a number of markets. As he said, they will go into the market soon in China. The Pizza Hut team is looking at a new positioning for Pizza Hut, and as Micky said, I think focusing on the pizza and less on the more and getting back to the core will help that brand as well. So I would sum it up as new leader, great leader, fresh perspective, great team, more global alignment and a real focus on brand building, all underpinned by our fundamental belief that we leverage culture to fuel results."

It's not as though we're building necessarily smaller units. It is true that we build more stores in smaller cities, but our comp sales growth across tiers has been fairly consistent. We are experimenting with multiple store formats to take into account the fact that there is still a very rapid build-out in infrastructure in China. So we are expecting a very large number of malls that are already under construction, the high-speed rail network is being expanded and then in China, unlike the U.S., there's not a phenomenon at the moment of highways with drive-thrus, or the rest stops, and all of those are being developed. I don't really see the character of our productivity per unit changing in the years to come. I think, worldwide, there is a trend to, what we call, small box, which is because in-lines are becoming more popular in mall stores, et cetera. So there may be in the longer term slightly smaller-format units, but not -- China is not that impacted because we hardly have any drive-thrus. We hardly have any drive-thrus at all. So most of them are in-lines anyway. So maybe we need to think about this question a little more, but we don't intrinsically see any reason why the sort of growth we've enjoyed should not be projected long term into the future."

Well, at the moment, as you know, the estate of about just over 7,000 stores, about 10% are franchised and 90% are equity. I think, at the moment, as long as we have -- and the way -- we never chase a number of stores that we have to build, but when we get new trade zones opening and opportunities that make commercial sense -- and there's a very disciplined process for capital allocation and measuring new unit returns. We have a lot of surplus capital, as you know, in China. All the stores here have been built with Chinese-generated capital, there's no intrinsic reason why we would want to give that up to franchisees. The 2 reasons why we do expect, however, franchising to up marginally is, firstly, there are regions of the country where it makes sense for franchisees to operate. We recently opened in the Autonomous Region of Tibet, our first store in Lhasa, Tibet. And for a variety of reasons, including difficult operating conditions and local market knowledge, that was given to a franchisee, and it's been successful and I think that will grow. So there are parts of the country where we will do it for reasons that it makes sense to do it that way. And the other is that there will be opportunities to do franchising, for example, with gas station chains, et cetera. And for those technical reasons, the percentage of franchising might go up from 10% to maybe 15% or something in the foreseeable future, but we don't expect a significant change there. Now of course, if we do not find the ability to invest our capital in productive equity investment, sure, we'll look at franchising more actively. We're not at the moment -- we're agnostic to whether it's franchising or equity, frankly. I mean, both have advantages. Franchisees can -- obviously, they're capital-light and also they're very innovative. But at the moment, with the capital that we have, especially as we become independent, I think it will be a good use of the capital to continue to invest. I mean, China is a growth market, the way we see it. And we still have the vision doubling or tripling our store base. So that's the way we're looking at it. So I would say the franchising percentage will edge up, but it will not be a game-changer in our business."

What's difficult for us to say right now is exactly how that -- those credits are going to accumulate and what exactly is going to be creditable, and we are working through that.

You actually have -- it's a very large number of pages. It's a book. It's a little difficult to navigate, so simplifying that is a priority. Pizza Hut is celebrated and known for the variety of menu here. We do not want to lose that, but at the same time, I think we can make it far more controlled. It also speeds up service, and table turns are an issue at Pizza Hut at peak times. So for those reasons, we are rationalizing the menu. We're also, like I said earlier, pointing out the great value that we have through lunch combos and other offers, so we'll -- we're redesigning that part of the menu as well. And lastly, does it -- this -- I mean, I'm constantly amazed at how advanced China is digitally. It's got twice the number of cell phones, smartphones as the U.S. population. And even in our offices, people go up and down the elevator to go to lunch. They're looking up where the offers are available and where they can book a table, et cetera. So the action is shifting very rapidly to mobile devices, and both the menu as well as digital marketing is becoming very significant. So we are working on that. The good news is that both -- for both our brands, we are in a leadership position when it comes to that whole digital interface, cashless payment, et cetera. But to your question, yes, I think the sort of operational simplicity at KFC, making it easier for consumers to choose our bestselling products, and the general philosophy that the menu should not be a -- should be used more as guiding customers to our best-selling products than to give open choices, which they get confused about, is something that is applicable at Pizza Hut as well."

Brands delivered second quarter core operating profit growth of 7% and EPS growth, excluding Special Items, of 9%. Given our strong first half results and current trends in China, I'm pleased to raise our full year core operating profit growth forecast to at least 14% from 12% previously. I'm particularly pleased with the continued sales momentum at KFC China, which delivered better-than-expected same-store sales growth of 3%. This represents our fourth consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth in KFC China, despite the second quarter being our most difficult of the year from a historical sales overlap standpoint. Importantly, our China division is off to a good start in the third quarter for both KFC and Pizza Hut Casual Dining, including a return to positives same-store sales at Pizza Hut Casual Dining in recent weeks. 
Outside of China, challenging industry conditions in the U.S. contributed to soft sales results. However, our 3 brand divisions, in the aggregate, delivered core operating profit growth largely in line with our expectations and remain on track to deliver against their full year core operating profit growth targets. We are confident in our plans to drive second half sales improvement, led by continuous focus on innovation, value and our core products. 
This as a transformational year for our company as we remain on track to finalize the separation of our China business with a targeted completion date around October 31, 2016, ultimately creating 2 powerful independent focused growth companies. Our capital structure is fully in place, and we plan to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders but prior to, and after the spin. And I look forward to sharing more details on the transformative initiatives we are undertaking as we become a more heavily franchised company at our New York investor conference on Tuesday, October 11. 
Today, I'll give you an overview of each of our operating divisions and then David Gibbs, our CFO, will walk you through the financials. After that, the team and I will be happy to take any questions you might have. 
So first, China. As I mentioned, I'm particularly pleased, KFC, which represents about 75% of our operating profit in China, reported its fourth consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth with [indiscernible] comps in the second quarter. This was driven by stronger results in the second half of the quarter as bucket-related promotions resonated with consumers. It's great to see the teams focused on the core and value, translating into tangible results. 
Furthermore, we've simplified menus, improved efficiency and conveyed our value proposition to customers, all the while maintaining our consumer perceptions goals. In fact, we've done all these while simultaneously improving restaurant margins in each of the last 4 quarters versus prior year. 
I'm also encouraged by China's -- sorry, by KFC China's plans for their balance of the year, and then pleased to report our third quarter, which began June 1, and is historically our highest from a profitability standpoint, is off to a great start with same-store sales results quarter-to-date at low double digits. We rolled out boxed meals in June and are currently promoting our historically successful wing bucket, which we pulled forward a week earlier this year. As you will note, boxed meals have proven effectively globally for KFC and we expect success in China given test results. It's great to see now sharing across our global knowledge base, and we look forward to leveraging this on an ongoing basis across all of Yum!. 
At Pizza Hut Casual Dining, system sales declined 2% and same-store sales declined 11% in the quarter. The good news is, based on our third quarter results today, it appears that China team strategic initiatives are beginning to bear fruit. As evidence, quarter-to-date same-store sales are slightly negative, and I'm pleased to report they have turned positive in recs week. Our renewed focus on pizza and ensuring customers understand our value proposition are critical to brand's success. It's too early to declare victory, but we know the potential of this brand and are further enhancing our core
simplifying the menu and leveraging ideas of Indonesia and Hong Kong, where we have other successful casual dining concepts to execute on our strategy. 
Overall, we are clearly pleased with the progress we're making in China and our third quarter results to date. We caution overlaps do get tougher though through the balance of the quarter. 
So now, under our 3 branded divisions. In our KFC Division, same-store sales grew 2% in the second quarter or 4% on a 2-year stack. Operating profit grew 6% in the quarter, and the division opened 132 new international restaurants in 42 countries. 88% of these units were opened by franchisees, and 68% of our new international openings were in emerging markets. 
I'm encouraged by our ability to generate growth in both emerging and developed markets, as I think this really speak to the global strength of our brand. In the U.S., for example, we reported our eighth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth. As further evidence, we are gaining traction with our strategy in the U.S, Our 2-year same-store sales growth lapped 3% growth in the prior year, so on a 2-year basis, comps were plus 5. System sales in international developed markets grew 4% and in international emerging markets grew 10%. We remain on track to [indiscernible] 475 net new international restaurants this year, and the U.S. is committed to delivering about 1,000 remodels in 2016. 
After the spinoff of our China division, KFC will be the largest contributor to new Yum! from multiple perspectives, including absolute profit growth, restaurant count and profit growth, to name a few. What really excites me are all the opportunities for growth that exist in this brand. Today, we opened approximately 3 new KFCs a day globally or 1 every 8 hours. We are on a path over time to open 1 every 5 hours, which will nearly double our annual new unit openings. 
Pizza Hut had flat same-store sales in the quarter with 1% same-store sales growth in the U.S. which makes up approximately 60% of total sales. While second quarter results in the U.S. were softer than expected, as competitors respond to our first quarter success with more aggressive promotions, we are pleased to see transaction growth in the U.S. and a continuation of the positive sales trend in our U.S. business. We believe our focus on making it easier to get a better pizza, whether it be by providing consistent value to the $5 Flavor menu and $6.99 Any medium pairs deal or by improvements in technology as we upgrade our web experience and migrate our system to 1 POS, will continue to enhance our business model. As a testament to our strategy, our company-owned stores, which are executing against a comprehensive suite of easy and better initiatives, including a locally competitive value message, driven by data science that is complementary to the national message and new operations programs geared to accelerate improvements in customer satisfaction delivered second quarter same-store sales growth higher than the system with transaction growth more than 5 percentage points higher. This company outperformance is obviously encouraging, as it is a clear indication that we are on the right track, and we are excited about the impact these initiatives will ultimately have on the entire Pizza Hut system. 
Our international business at Pizza Hut saw system sales growth of 3% in constant currency and a 1% decline in same-store sales in the quarter. Sales were strong in Thailand, Canada and the U.K. but offset by weaknesses in Korea. 
Last quarter, I mentioned that we were planning on rolling out proven successful tactics from the U.S. in international markets. I'm pleased to say that we have started this and are seeing success with the $5 Flavor menu in Australia and other markets and have plans to roll this construct out to additional market later this year. This gives us confidence that the international Pizza Hut business is not far behind the U.S. in its turnaround. 
And finally, Taco Bell. Operating profit grew 1% when adjusting for the impact of refranchising. And this was after lapping a plus 29% from the prior year. However, U.S. same-store sales declined 1% as we lap a plus 6% from the prior year. While a plus 5 on a 2-year stack is ahead of the category, we expect more out of Taco Bell given the strength of this brand. 
In the current environment, we need to pay innovation with value that clearly resonates with our consumers. For example, our $5 cravings bundle, deal bundle, improved results toward the end of the second quarter, and through the first 5 weeks of the third quarter, same-store sales are positive. We believe that the Taco Bell is extremely well positioned to succeed in a challenging environment. In market research, Taco Bell always remains as one of the top brands [indiscernible] value and innovation to consumers. We plan to [indiscernible] this division [indiscernible] balance of 2016 and going forward. 
Furthermore, we remain all plan with new-unit development for the year. We are accelerating international new unit openings and are excited to see momentum behind this strategic objective. While it is early days, we believe this could be a meaningful driver of long-term growth and look forward to continued progress. 
Now before I turn it over to David Gibbs, I just wanted to share with you some highlights from our recent biannual franchise convention that was held this year in Las Vegas. I think it's fair to say our franchisees are extremely bullish about the transformation we are undergoing at Yum! as evidenced by a record 1,100 attendees, representing over 100 countries, including numerous participants from our China division. This showcased the power of Yum! at its finest as we brought all 3 brands together to build and share know-how on development advertising, innovation, value and digital. We are on a clear path to become a world-class franchisor and an even sharper brand builder. 
So as I've said, 2016 is truly a transformational year for Yum!. We are confident we'll deliver at least 14% core operating profit growth, and I am pleased with the momentum in our China business as we near completion of the China separation. 
The Yum! China team is excited to reap the benefits of a continued growth in the consuming class. And as an independent company, Yum! China will continue to unlock massive growth opportunities while further capitalizing on what remains the#1 retail opportunity in the world. 
At new Yum!, I couldn't be more excited about the plans we have to become an even more unique and more powerful world-class franchisor. We will not undergo an evolution from Yum!, as you know, it, but instead another transformation as we increase our franchise mix to at least 96% by the end of 2017 and sharpen our focus on 4 key areas: Brand building, franchisee capability, market and asset development and our unique culture. We will make all decisions based on this construct. We will transform our mindset from equity-led to franchise-led and commit to our cost structure that enables us to build on these pillars. And I look forward to sharing additional details of this transformed vision for new Yum! at our Investor Conference in October. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to David Gibbs."

Our second quarter operating results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on the recapitalization and separation of our China business. Let's start with the high-level overview of our second quarter performance. 
Yum! Brands delivered core operating profit growth of 7% in the quarter. Our China division reported flat same-store sales growth despite it being our toughest compare of the year. As Greg said, we are pleased with the progress we are making in China and with sales results to date in the third quarter, which is historically the biggest quarter of the year from a profitability standpoint. 
Second quarter core operating profit in our China Division grew 6% and was impacted, as expected, by an additional $14 million in closures and impairment expense versus prior year as well as a $4 million expense related to our RGM convention. These expenses were partially offset by a benefit from recent value-added tax reform in China, which went into effect on May 1 and positively impacted restaurant margins in the second quarter. 
In aggregate, our 3 brand divisions delivered 3% core operating profit growth in the quarter. This was led by 7% growth at Pizza Hut and 6% growth at KFC, partially offset by soft result at Taco Bell. 
Overall, EPS before Special Items grew 9% including a 4 point negative impact from foreign currency changes. EPS benefited from a 6% reduction in our diluted share count compared to our second quarter last year due to our significant share buybacks over the past 12 months. 
Now I'd like to discuss our 2016 outlook. Given our strong first-half performance and current trends in China, we are raising our core operating profit growth forecast for Yum! from 12% to at least 14%, including 53rd week. We started the year by saying that we expected Yum! core operating profit growth of at least 10%. Outside of China, our 3 brand divisions remain on track to deliver results consistent with our initial targets. Therefore, the increase in Yum!'s 2016 guidance is essentially due to upside in China, including strong year-to-date KFC sales, margin and profit growth, and a balance of the year that will be aided by a vast change, partially offset by return to commodity inflation and higher labor costs. 
As you might recall, last quarter we walked through the pending changes to China's retail tax structure, which became effective May 1. As a reminder, under this reform, a 6% output VAT replaces a 5% business tax currently applied to certain restaurant sales. Input VAT is creditable to the aforementioned 6% output VAT. We believe this change will have a material benefit to Yum! China restaurant margins for the balance of the year. However, the scale and nature of the policy, along with implementation and transition challenges, make it very difficult to pinpoint the exact magnitude of the impact. While we won't provide any further detail on VAT today, we expect to be able to provide more clarity on our third quarter call after we have a full quarter of results behind us. I want to point out that for the balance of the year, we do expect labor and commodity inflation to partially offset this benefit. With this and our first test outperformance in mind, our current guidance for full year China restaurant margins is now at least 17% versus 16% previously. 
Outside of China, our 3 brand divisions remain on track to deliver results consistent with our initial 2016 targets. We expect any potential softness in topline performance to be offset by a favorable commodities environment. That being said, we are confident in our plans to drive sales improvement balance of the year and are encouraged with our positive results third quarter to date at Taco Bell. 
On the development front, we added over 370 new units globally in the second quarter, taking our year-to-date global new restaurant openings to over 650 units. Consistent with prior years, development will be weighted more towards the second half as we expect to accelerate our pace of development balance of year, further laying the groundwork for future growth. 
In China, we have increased our focus on refurbishing and remodeling stores this year, and we believe that momentum that we are seeing in the business today can be partially attributed to this investment in improving the guest experience. In fact, we are reallocating our capital to increase our pace of remodels to nearly 800 in 2016, up from our previous target of 550. At the same time, we're reducing both our growth and net new unit numbers for the year by around 50 to 100 openings versus our original expectations. This is primarily due to fewer new Pizza Hut Casual Dining units this year. But to be clear, our confidence level on the long-term growth prospects of our brands in China remains undiminished. Also, keep in mind, as a division, we expect about 100 fewer closures in 2016 than we had last year, and we continue to get cash paybacks from new KFC and Pizza Hut units in the 3- to 4-year range, both great signs of the underlying strength of the business model and the potential for future expansion. 
And finally, outside of China, for the full year we expect another strong year of development with total gross openings of nearly 1,800 units. 
Turning now to foreign exchange. Given the recent vote by the U.K. to exit the EU, I want to remind investors that one of the many great benefits of Yum! is our global and, therefore, diversified presence. In 2015, approximately 6% of our operating profit was generated from the U.K. and approximately 2% from the remaining euro zone. That being said, with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most of the world's other major foreign currencies, at current forward rate, currency translation is now estimate to negatively effect balance of the year operating profit by about $50 million, which represents an increase of $10 million versus our initial expectations. As always, please take this as directional guidance only as rates will inevitably change as we move throughout the year. In addition, keep in mind this does not impact our core operating profit growth forecast of at least 14%, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation. 
Now I'd like to provide you with an update on our refranchising targets. As you know, in connection with the China separation, we've committed to become at least 96% franchised by the end of 2017. In the past 4 quarters, we've refranchised over 300 restaurants outside of China, including 82 units in the second quarter. Refranchising will, simply put, improve our business model. Proceeds from refranchising enable us to return significant amount of cash to our shareholders while creating an even larger and more stable stream of franchise fees. It also produces immediate SG&A savings as field level employees are typically absorbed into our franchise system. That being said, we realize there are additional opportunities to operate more efficiently and look forward to sharing more detailed plans around our ongoing refranchising strategy and G&A roadmap at our Investor Conference on October 11. 
Now I'd like to quickly update you on our spinoff plans. We remain on track to complete the spinoff with a targeted completion date around October 31. We filed our initial Form 10 on May 3 and filed an amendment earlier this week. Our comprehensive global roadshows will follow our investor conference. 
In conjunction with our spinoff, we are also optimizing the capital structure of Yum!. To this end, I am very pleased to report the successful completion of our planned recapitalization in June. In aggregate, we closed on $6.9 billion of new debt, consisting of a $2.3 billion financing capacity, securitizing our Taco Bell royalties; a $2.5 billion senior secured credit facility; and a $2.1 billion of high-yield notes. With the completion of our recapitalization, today we have approximately $9 billion in debt outstanding at an attractive bended interest rate of less than 5%. This marked yet another milestone in our previously communicated commitment to return $6.2 billion of capital, excluding ongoing dividend payments, to shareholders. 
In fact, since we announced in October 2015 our intention to separate the China business, we have repurchased 3.3 billion of shares, which equates to 42.9 million -- $3.3 billion of shares which equate to 42.9 million shares at an average price of $76. We continue to believe that our stock represents a good value at current prices. But make no mistake, this is just the beginning as we target an additional $3.5 billion in capital return across 2017 and 2018. This will take our total capital returned program, including dividends, to $10 billion over about a 3-year period and further demonstrates our commitment to delivering meaningful cash returns to our shareholders. 
So let me wrap things up. We're confident we'll deliver at least 14% core operating profit growth for the full year, and we're proceeding as expected with the separation of our China business. Our brand businesses are performing, in the aggregate, in line with our initial expectations, and I'm pleased with the progress we're making in China as it approaches its first day as an independent company. As Greg said, 2016 is truly a transformational year for Yum!. We look forward to sharing additional details with you at our New York Investor Conference in October. 
And with that, the team and I are happy to take your questions."

And I think we are encouraged by the trend that we are seeing currently. When same-store sales come back to positive territory and we will re-step up the build rate to Pizza Hut Casual Dining. As far as refurbishment is concerned, that is applicable to both our brands. And it was our judgment that it was very important to improve the customer experience and also to be able to bring our estate in line with retail in China, which has been modernizing in general very rapidly. So as David Gibbs mentioned in his comments, we increased the remodel rates across both brands and, in aggregate, that should be about 800 this year. So we've effectively, in the last 18 months, doubled our rate of refurbishment to bring new estate to acceptable levels. So it's not as though we're reinvesting only in Pizza Hut, we are reinvesting in both the brands. I hope that answers your question."

But you're right, the average unit volumes are opening are slightly down and I can give you some of the reasons. In the pool right now, we got 100 small box units that were test units that are obviously of slightly lower volume. We've got little heavier weighing on Pizza Hut home service and our new unit development is a little bit heavier weighted towards Tier 3 through 6. In fact, the majority of the development occurs there. While some of the stores that we're closing are a little heavier weighted towards Tiers 1 and 2. When you add up all of those smaller points, you get to a little bit of a drag on new unit volumes. But most importantly, critical to us, is we are very happy with our development programs, we're getting positive cash paybacks, 3 to 4 years, margins are improving, sales trends are improving. So we feel good about our development programs. I don't know, Micky, if you have anything else to add."

I just want to reassure you, I think this question came up in the last earnings call as well, is there anything fundamentally changing about our strategy or the delivery of sales and profits from new units as we go forward as compared to the past? I think in general term, the answer is no. We continue to build aggressively. The band mix changed a bit. As David mentioned, we did build Pizza Hut Home Service restaurants which tend to be lower volume. And KFC slowed a little bit because of the 2 years of difficulty in sales. We fully expect KFC development this year to be ahead of our original plans. And in general terms, we see the efficiency and delivery from new units as being just as good as it has been in the past. In general terms, our focus at the moment is to raise traffic and sales in all of stores, and that's one of the reasons we moderated new unit build this year. We're encouraged by the trend we are seeing, and we hope we can continue to deliver growth in sales."

The positioning of the brand is quite clear. It's been explained and our current forward through the organization. Integrated position which covers new product development as well as service, down to uniforms, et cetera. And I think it's resonating well. It is called love to share, and it's appropriate because, unlike KFC, where most people come in singles, they order their meals individually, and Pizza Hut is a group, they tend to order their meals together. There's a big phenomenon now of sharing the food experience through social media. And all that is working in our favor. On both brands, the emphasis has been to continue our rate of innovation and to continue to give consumers good great meals. The differences that we are doing it in a way that is operationally friendly, so it does not slow speed of service or cause problems with value. In the case of KFC, for example, as Greg mentioned, that includes boxed meals which is a tried and tested formula globally, that offers consumers not 3 but 5 items with slightly higher price and offers great value. The innovation across all platforms is strong, but the big difference, I think, is that it is now practical innovation that gives choice without complicating operations a great deal. Across all dayparts, also we have made significant investments in high-quality coffee machines in both brands and high-quality ice cream machines in the case of KFC, to be able to improve our delivery and our quality of products."

So we are really doing all the things you expect, we are on a timeline in order to hit the separation on October 31, plus or minus a couple of days. And we continue to believe that is the very best way to maximize shareholder value. I'll hand it over to David, he can just give you an update on cash return."

So that is not particularly good news from just -- what are people thinking. As I said earlier, we believe that in the U.S., the market on a trailing 13 is about minus 1 in transaction is probably plus 1 in sales. So I think the good news is we have started the third quarter stronger than we finished than we had in the second quarter. I think what it means is, for brands like Taco Bell, we got to make sure that we get communication really tight and focused. I'm not necessarily believe it means we have to drop our prices anymore. I think what we're going to do is do a better job of communicating our value. We also have to remember that the Taco Bell brand always responds to incredible breakthrough innovations. So I think you will see more of that coming from Taco Bell. I have to give the KFC U.S. team credit. I think the George Hamilton as the new colonel behind extra crispy is brilliant, and that is having a positive impact on our sales momentum at KFC in the U.S. right now. So we have gone back to our core product. We haven't had a discount, we obviously wrapped it around $20 buckets and $5 boxes but we done a much better job of breaking through with the communication. And then I think on Pizza Hut, we have announced that we're moving to a new agency. We will get to a new campaign some time before the end of the year. And I think the Pizza Hut team would agree we can do better job of communicating both better and easy. So I'm positive about what's happening now, and I'm positive with regards we're working on. As I said, kudos to the KFC team, I think they have taken a core product and demonstrated you can deliver above category growth by making sure you have breakthrough medication. So better communication, making sure we've got the right product points, making sure we've got breakthrough innovation. I think that's -- I know, that's what the 3 U.S. brands are focused on. I am encouraged but what I'm seeing and I'm encouraged by the momentum we have going into the third quarter.

Pretty much [indiscernible] which was we're encouraged by the progress we're making particularly in those businesses that we have been focused on, which is both Pizza Hut and KFC in China as well as KFC and Pizza Hut in the U.S. As I said, we're off to good start in the third quarter in both China and the U.S. And all of us, and particularly I am looking forward to catching up with everyone at the Investor Conference in New York at October 11.

Brands delivered second quarter core operating profit growth of 7% and EPS growth, excluding special items, of 9%. Given our strong first half results and current trends in China, I'm pleased to raise our",1918,"Thank you Donny, and good morning, everyone. Yum! Brands delivered second quarter core operating profit growth of 7% and EPS growth, excluding special items, of 9%. Given our strong first half results and current trends in China, I'm pleased to raise our full year core operating profit growth forecast to at least 14% from 12% previously. 
I'm particularly pleased with the continued sales momentum at KFC China, which delivered better-than-expected same-store sales growth of 3%. This represents our fourth consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth at KFC China, despite the second quarter being our most difficult of the year from a historical sales overlap standpoint. Importantly, our China division is off to a good start in the third quarter for both KFC and at Pizza Hut Casual Dining, including a return to positive same-store sales at Pizza Hut Casual Dining in recent weeks. 
Outside of China, challenging industry conditions in the U.S. contributed to soft sales results. However, our 3 brand divisions, in the aggregate, delivered core operating profit growth largely in line with our expectations and remain on track to deliver against their full year core operating profit growth targets. We're confident in our plans to drive second half sales improvement, led by a continuous focus on innovation, value and our core products. 
This as a transformational year for our company as we remain on track to finalize the separation of our China business with a targeted completion date around October 31, 2016, ultimately creating 2 powerful, independent focused-growth companies. Our capital structure is fully in place, and we plan to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders both prior to and after the spin. And I look forward to sharing additional details on the transformative initiatives we are undertaking as we become a more heavily franchised company at our New York investor conference on Tuesday, October 11. 
Today, I'll give you an overview of each of our operating divisions, and then David Gibbs, our CFO, will walk you through the financials. After that, the team and I will be happy to take any questions you might have. 
So first, China. As I mentioned, I'm particularly pleased KFC, which represents about 75% of our operating profit in China, reported its fourth consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth, with [indiscernible] comps in the second quarter. This was driven by stronger results in the second half of the quarter as our bucket-related promotions resonated with consumers. It's great to see the team's focus on the core end value translating into tangible results. 
Furthermore, we've simplified menus, improved efficiency and conveyed our value proposition to customers, all the while maintaining our consumer perception scores. In fact, we've done all this while simultaneously improving restaurant margins in each of the last 4 quarters versus prior year. 
I'm also encouraged by China's -- sorry, by KFC China's plans for the balance of the year, and I'm pleased to report our third quarter, which began June 1 and is historically our highest from a profitability standpoint, is off to a great start, with same-store sales results quarter-to-date up low double digits. 
We rolled out box meals in June and are currently promoting our historically successful wing bucket, which we pulled forward a week earlier this year. As you all know, box meals have proven effectively globally for KFC, and we expect success in China given test results. It's great to see know-how sharing across our global knowledge base, and we look forward to leveraging this on an ongoing basis across all of Yum!. 
At Pizza Hut Casual Dining, system sales declined 2% and same-store sales declined 11% in the quarter. The good news is, based on our third quarter results to date, it appears the China team's strategic initiatives are beginning to bear fruit. As evidence, quarter-to-date same-store sales are slightly negative, and I'm pleased to report they have turned positive in recent weeks. Our renewed focus on pizza and ensuring customers understand our value proposition are critical to brand's success. 
It's too early to declare victory, but we know the potential of this brand and are further enhancing our core, simplifying the menu and leveraging ideas from Indonesia and Hong Kong, where we have other successful casual dining concepts, to execute on our strategy. 
Overall, we are clearly pleased with the progress we are making in China and our third quarter results to date. We caution overlaps do get tougher though for the balance of the quarter. 
So now on to our 3 branded divisions. In our KFC Division, same-store sales grew 2% in the second quarter or 4% on a 2-year stack. Operating profit grew 6% in the quarter, and the division opened 132 new international restaurants in 42 countries. 88% of these units were opened by franchisees, and 68% of our new international openings were in emerging markets. 
I'm encouraged by our ability to generate growth in both emerging and developed markets, as I think this really speaks to the global strength of our brand. In the U.S., for example, we reported our eighth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth. As further evidence we are gaining traction with our strategy in the U.S., our 2-year same-store sales growth lapped 3% growth in the prior year. So on a 2-year basis, comps were plus 5. System sales in international developed markets grew 4%, and in international emerging markets, grew 10%. We remain on track to open at least 475 net new international restaurants this year, and the U.S. is committed to delivering about 1,000 remodels in 2016. 
After the spinoff of our China division, KFC will be the largest contributor to new Yum! from multiple perspectives, including absolute profit growth, restaurant count and profit growth, to name a few. What really excites me are all the opportunities for growth that exist for this brand. Today, we open approximately 3 new KFCs a day globally or 1 every 8 hours. We are on a path over time to open 1 every 5 hours, which would nearly double our annual new unit openings. 
Pizza Hut had flat same-store sales in the quarter with 1% same-store sales growth in the U.S., which makes up approximately 60% of total sales. While second quarter results in the U.S. were softer than expected as competitors responded to our first quarter success with more aggressive promotions, we are pleased to see transaction growth in the U.S. and a continuation of the positive sales trends in our U.S. business. 
We believe our focus on making it easier to get a better pizza, whether it be by providing consistent value through the $5 Flavor Menu and $6.99 Any medium pairs deal or by improvements in technology as we upgrade our web experience and migrate our system to 1 POS, will continue to enhance our business model. As a testament to our strategy, our company-owned stores, which are executing against a comprehensive suite of easy and better initiatives, including a locally competitive value message driven by data science that is complementary to the national message and new operations programs geared to accelerate improvements in customer satisfaction, delivered second quarter same-store sales growth higher than the system, with transaction growth more than 5 percentage points higher. This company outperformance is obviously encouraging, as it is a clear indication that we are on the right track, and we are excited about the impact these initiatives will ultimately have on the entire Pizza Hut system. 
Our international business at Pizza Hut saw system sales growth of 3% in constant currency and a 1% decline in same-store sales in the quarter. Sales were strong in Thailand, Canada and the U.K., but offset by weaknesses in Korea. 
Last quarter, I mentioned that we were planning on rolling our proven successful tactics from the U.S. in international markets. I'm pleased to say that we have started this and are seeing success with the $5 Flavor Menu in Australia and other markets and have plans to roll this construct out to additional markets later this year. This gives us confidence that the international Pizza Hut business is not far behind the U.S. in its turnaround. 
And finally, Taco Bell. Operating profit grew 1% when adjusting for the impact of refranchising, and this was after lapping a plus 29% from the prior year. However, U.S. same-store sales declined 1% as we lap a plus 6% from the prior year. While a plus 5 on a 2-year stack is ahead of the category, we expect more out of Taco Bell given the strength of this brand. 
In the current environment, we need to pair innovation with value that clearly resonates with our consumers. For example, our $5 cravings bundle -- deal bundle improved results toward the end of the second quarter. And through the first 5 weeks of the third quarter, same-store sales are positive. 
We believe that the Taco Bell brand is extremely well positioned to exceed in a challenging environment. In market research, Taco Bell always ranks as one of the top brands in providing [ph] value and innovation to consumers. We plan to leverage this position through the balance of 2016 and going forward. 
Furthermore, we remain on plan with new-unit development for the year. We are accelerating international new unit openings and are excited to see momentum behind this strategic objective. While it is early days, we believe this could be a meaningful driver of long-term growth and look forward to continued progress. 
Now before I turn it over to David Gibbs, I just wanted to share with you some of the highlights from our recent biannual franchise convention that was held this year in Las Vegas. I think it's fair to say our franchisees are extremely bullish about the transformation we are undergoing at Yum!, as evidenced by our record 1,100 attendees, representing over 100 countries, including numerous participants from our China division. This showcased the power of Yum! at its finest, as we brought all 3 brands together to build and share know-how on development advertising, innovation, value and digital. We are on a clear path to become a world-class franchisor and an even sharper brand builder. 
So as I've said, 2016 is truly a transformational year for Yum!. We're confident we'll deliver at least 14% core operating profit growth, and I'm pleased with the momentum in our China business as we near completion of the China separation. The Yum! China team is excited to reap the benefits of a continued growth in the consuming class. And as an independent company, Yum! China will continue to unlock massive growth opportunities while further capitalizing on what remains the #1 retail opportunity in the world. 
At new Yum!, I couldn't be more excited about the plans we have to become an even more unique and more powerful world-class franchisor. We will not undergo an evolution from Yum! as you know it, but instead another transformation, as we increase our franchise mix to at least 96% by the end of 2017 and sharpen our focus on 4 key areas: Brand building, franchisee capability, market and asset development and our unique culture. We will make all decisions based on this construct. We will transform our mindset from equity-led to franchise-led and commit to a cost structure that enables us to build on these pillars. And I look forward to sharing additional details of this transformed vision for new Yum! at our Investor Conference in October. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to David Gibbs."

In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: Our second quarter operating results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our recapitalization and the separation of our China business. Let's start with a high-leve",1587,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: Our second quarter operating results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our recapitalization and the separation of our China business. 
Let's start with a high-level overview of our second quarter performance. Yum! Brands delivered core operating profit growth of 7% in the quarter. Our China division reported flat same-store sales growth despite it being our toughest compare of the year. As Greg said, we are pleased with the progress we are making in China and with sales results to date in the third quarter, which is historically the biggest quarter of the year from a profitability standpoint. 
Second quarter core operating profit in our China Division grew 6% and was impacted, as expected, by an additional $14 million in closures and impairment expense versus prior year as well as a $4 million expense related to our RGM convention. These expenses were partially offset by a benefit from recent value-added tax reform in China, which went into effect on May 1 and positively impacted restaurant margins in the second quarter. 
In aggregate, our 3 brand divisions delivered 3% core operating profit growth in the quarter. This was led by 7% growth at Pizza Hut and 6% growth at KFC, partially offset by soft results at Taco Bell. 
Overall, EPS before special items grew 9%, including a 4-point negative impact from foreign currency changes. EPS benefited from a 6% reduction in our diluted share count compared to our second quarter last year due to our significant share buybacks over the past 12 months. 
Now I'd like to discuss our 2016 outlook. Given our strong first-half performance and current trends in China, we are raising our core operating profit growth forecast for Yum! from 12% to at least 14%, including the 53rd week. We started the year by saying that we expected Yum! core operating profit growth of at least 10%. Outside of China, our 3 brand divisions remain on track to deliver results consistent with our initial targets. Therefore, the increase in Yum!'s 2016 guidance is essentially due to upside in China, including strong year-to-date KFC sales, margin and profit growth; and a balance of the year that will be aided by the VAT change; partially offset by a return to commodity inflation and higher labor costs. 
As you might recall, last quarter, we walked through the pending changes to China's retail tax structure, which became effective May 1. As a reminder, under this reform, a 6% output VAT replaces a 5% business tax currently applied to certain restaurant sales. Input VAT is creditable to the aforementioned 6% output VAT. We believe this change will have a material benefit to Yum! China restaurant margins for the balance of the year. However, the scale and nature of the policy, along with implementation and transition challenges, make it very difficult to pinpoint the exact magnitude of the impact. While we won't provide any further detail on VAT today, we expect to be able to provide more clarity on our third quarter call after we have a full quarter of results behind us. I want to point out that for the balance of the year, we do expect labor and commodity inflation to partially offset this benefit. With this and our first half outperformance in mind, our current guidance for full year China restaurant margins is now at least 17% versus 16% previously. 
Outside of China, our 3 brand divisions remain on track to deliver results consistent with our initial 2016 targets. We expect any potential softness in topline performance to be offset by a favorable commodities environment. That being said, we're confident in our plans to drive sales improvement balance of year and are encouraged with our positive results, third quarter to date, at Taco Bell. 
On the development front, we added over 370 new units globally in the second quarter, taking our year-to-date global new restaurant openings to over 650 units. Consistent with prior years, development will be weighted more towards the second half, as we expect to accelerate our pace of development balance of year, further laying the groundwork for future growth. 
In China, we have increased our focus on refurbishing and remodeling stores this year, and we believe the momentum that we are seeing in the business today can be partially attributed to this investment in improving the guest experience. In fact, we are reallocating our capital to increase our pace of remodels to nearly 800 in 2016, up from our previous target of 550. At the same time, we're reducing both our gross and net new unit numbers for the year by around 50 to 100 openings versus our original expectations. This is primarily due to fewer new Pizza Hut Casual Dining units this year. 
But to be clear, our confidence level in the long-term growth prospects of our brands in China remains undiminished. Also keep in mind, as a division, we expect about 100 fewer closures in 2016 than we had last year, and we continue to get cash paybacks for new KFC and Pizza Hut units in the 3- to 4-year range, both great signs of the underlying strength in the business model and the potential for future expansion. 
And finally, outside of China. For the full year, we expect another strong year of development, with total gross openings of nearly 1,800 units. 
Turning now to foreign exchange. Given the recent vote by the U.K. to exit the EU, I want to remind investors that one of the many great benefits of Yum! is our global and therefore diversified presence. In 2015, approximately 6% of our operating profit was generated from the U.K. and approximately 2% from the remaining euro zone. That being said, with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most of the world's other major foreign currencies, at current forward rates, currency translation is now estimated to negatively effect balance of the year operating profit by about $50 million, which represents an increase of $10 million versus our initial expectations. As always, please take this as directional guidance only, as rates will inevitably change as we move throughout the year. In addition, keep in mind this does not impact our core operating profit growth forecast of at least 14%, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation. 
Now I'd like to provide you with an update on our refranchising targets. As you know, in connection with the China separation, we've committed to become at least 96% franchised by the end of 2017. In the past 4 quarters, we've refranchised over 300 restaurants outside of China, including 82 units in the second quarter. 
Refranchising will, simply put, improve our business model. Proceeds from refranchising enable us to return significant amounts of cash to our shareholders while creating an even larger and more stable stream of franchise fees. It also produces immediate SG&A savings, as field-level employees are typically absorbed into our franchise system. That being said, we realize there are additional opportunities to operate more efficiently and look forward to sharing more detailed plans around our ongoing refranchising strategy and G&A roadmap at our Investor Conference on October 11. 
Now I'd like to quickly update you on our spinoff plans. We remain on track to complete the spinoff with a targeted completion date around October 31. We filed our initial Form 10 on May 3 and filed an amendment earlier this week. Our comprehensive global roadshows will follow our investor conference. 
In conjunction with our spinoff, we are also optimizing the capital structure of Yum!. To this end, I'm very pleased to report the successful completion of our planned recapitalization in June. In aggregate, we closed on $6.9 billion of new debt, consisting of a $2.3 billion financing facility, securitizing our Taco Bell U.S. royalties; a $2.5 billion senior secured credit facility; and a $2.1 billion of high-yield notes. With the completion of our recapitalization, today, we have approximately $9 billion in debt outstanding at an attractive blended interest rate of less than 5%. This marks yet another milestone in our previously communicated commitment to return $6.2 billion of capital, excluding ongoing dividend payments, to shareholders. 
In fact, since we announced in October 2015 our intention to separate the China business, we have repurchased 3.3 billion of shares, which equates to 42.9 million -- $3.3 billion of shares, which equate to 42.9 million shares at an average price of $76. We continue to believe that our stock represents a good value at current prices. But make no mistake, this is just the beginning, as we target an additional $3.5 billion in capital return across 2017 and 2018. This will take our total capital returned program, including dividends, to $10 billion over about a 3-year period and further demonstrates our commitment to delivering meaningful cash returns to our shareholders. 
So let me wrap things up. We're confident we'll deliver at least 14% core operating profit growth for the full year, and we're proceeding as expected with the separation of our China business. Our brand businesses are performing, in the aggregate, in line with our initial expectations, and I'm pleased with the progress we're making in China as it approaches its first day as an independent company. 
As Greg said, 2016 is truly a transformational year for Yum!. We look forward to sharing additional details with you at our New York Investor Conference in October. 
And with that, the team and I are happy to take your questions."

And we saw the trend over the last year of same-store sales, and our judgment was that we should pause for a bit. So we will still build, we will be the leading developer of casual dining restaurants by far in China, but be paused for a bit. And I think we are encouraged by the trend that we are seeing currently. When same-store sales come back to positive territory, then we will re-step up the build rate of Pizza Hut Casual Dining. As far as refurbishment is concerned, that is applicable to both our brands. And it was our judgment that it was very important to improve the customer experience and also to be able to bring our estate in line with retail in China, which has been modernizing in general very rapidly. So we've -- as David Gibbs mentioned in his comments, we increased the remodel rate across both brands. And in aggregate, that should be about 800 this year. So we've effectively, in the last 18 months, doubled our rate of refurbishment to bring the estate to acceptable levels. So it's not as though we're reinvesting only in Pizza Hut, we are reinvesting in both the brands. I hope that answers your question."

We've got a little heavier weighing on Pizza Hut Home Service, and our new unit development is a little bit heavier weighted towards Tier 3 through 6. In fact, the majority of the development occurs there. While some of the stores that we're closing are a little heavier weighted towards Tiers 1 and 2. When you add up all of those smaller points, you get to a little bit of a drag on new unit volumes. But most importantly, critical to us, is we're very happy with our development programs, we're getting positive cash paybacks, 3 to 4 years, margins are improving, sales trends are improving. So we feel good about our development programs. I don't know, Micky, if you have anything else to add."

I would -- i just want to reassure you, I think this question came up in the last earnings call as well, is that -- is there anything fundamentally changing about our strategy or the delivery of sales and profits from new units as we go forward as compared to the past? And I think in general term, the answer is no. We continue to build aggressively. The brand mix changed a bit. And as David mentioned, we did build Pizza Hut Home Service restaurants, which tend to be lower volume. And KFC, that slowed a little bit because of the 2 years of difficulty in sales. We fully expect KFC development this year to be ahead of our original plans. And in general terms, we see the efficiency and delivery from new units as being just as good as it has been in the past. In general terms, our focus at the moment is to raise traffic and sales in all our stores, and that's one of the reasons we moderated new unit build this year. We are encouraged by the trend that we are seeing, and we hope we can continue to deliver growth in sales."

Well, if I take the Pizza Hut Casual Dining, I think is in a much better position with regards to the consumer proposition than it was, even I would say, 3 months ago. The positioning of the brand is quite clear. It's been explained and carried forward through the organization. It's an integrated position which covers new product development as well as service, down to uniforms, et cetera. And I think it's resonating well. It's called love to share, and it's appropriate because, unlike KFC, where most people come in singles or order their meals individually; in Pizza Hut, it's a group, they tend to order their meals together. And also as you know, there's a big phenomenon now of sharing the food experience through social media. And all that is working in our favor. On both brands, the emphasis has been to continue our rate of innovation and to continue to give consumers great meals. The differences is that we are doing it in a way that is operationally friendly so that it does not slow speed of service or cause problems with value. In the case of KFC, for example, as Greg mentioned, that includes box meals, which has worked, tried and tested formula globally, that offers consumers not 3 but 5 items for slightly higher price and offers great value. The innovation across all platforms is strong, but the big difference, I think, is that it is now practical innovation that gives choice without complicating operations at a great deal. Across all dayparts, also we've made significant investments in high-quality coffee machines in both brands and high-quality ice cream machines in the case of KFC to be able to improve our delivery and our quality of product."

The rest of it in one shape, way or form is in account of more customers or more food per customer, which are both good news. We have to watch commodity inflation on the back half. At the moment, we feel pretty confident that we can deliver through other productivity initiatives, profit dollar goods without having to take recourse to pricing. But obviously, we remain sensitive to commodity and we will not be stupid about it. But we do want to contain pricing for as long as possible to maintain price stability in the market as well as to continue to offer great value.

I think there was an industry report out yesterday that, I think, 75% of people age 18 to 30 believe that the U.S. is either falling behind or failing as a nation according to a gen forward survey. So that's not particularly good news from just what are people thinking. As I said earlier, we believe that in the U.S., the market on a trailing 13 is about minus 1 in transactions, probably plus 1 in sales. As I said, I think the good news is we have started the third quarter stronger than we finished -- than we have in the second quarter. I think what it means is, for brands like Taco Bell, we've got to make sure that we get our communication really tight and focused. I'm not necessarily believe it means we have to drop our prices any more. I think what we've got to do is do a better job of communicating our value. And we also have to remember that the Taco Bell brand always responds to incredible breakthrough innovations. So I think you'll see more of that coming from Taco Bell. I have to give the KFC U.S. team credit. I think the George Hamilton as the new colonel behind the extra crispy is brilliant, and that is having a positive impact on our sales momentum at KFC in the U.S. right now. So we've gone back to our core product. We haven't had to discount. We've obviously wrapped it around $20 buckets and $5 boxes, but we've just done a much better job of breaking through with the communication. And then I think on Pizza Hut, we will -- we've announced that we're moving to a new agency. We will get to a new campaign some time before the end of the year. And I think the Pizza Hut team would agree we can do better job of communicating both better and easy. So I'm positive about what's happening now and I'm positive about what the guys are working on. And as I've said, kudos to the KFC team, who I think have taken a core product and demonstrated you can deliver above category growth by making sure you really have breakthrough communication. So better communication, making sure we've got the right product points, making sure we've got breakthrough innovation. I think that's -- I know that's what the 3 U.S. brands are focused on. I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing and I'm encouraged by the momentum we have going into the third quarter. 
So what I'd like to do, I think, just -- is just to quickly wrap up. 
So first of all, I want to thank you all for being on the call. We really appreciate it. Pretty much, my last answer probably sums up a lot of it, which was we're encouraged by the progress we're making, particularly in those businesses that we've been focused on, which is both Pizza Hut and KFC in China, as well as KFC and Pizza Hut in the U.S. As I said, we're off to a good start in the third quarter in both China and the U.S. And all of us -- and particularly, I am looking forward to catching up with everyone at the Investor Conference in New York on October 11.

Brands delivered second quarter core operating profit growth of 7% and EPS growth, excluding special items, of 9%. Given our strong first half results and current trends in China, I'm pleased to raise our",1919,"Thank you Donny, and good morning, everyone. Yum! Brands delivered second quarter core operating profit growth of 7% and EPS growth, excluding special items, of 9%. Given our strong first half results and current trends in China, I'm pleased to raise our full year core operating profit growth forecast to at least 14% from 12% previously. 
I'm particularly pleased with the continued sales momentum at KFC China, which delivered better-than-expected same-store sales growth of 3%. This represents our fourth consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth at KFC China, despite the second quarter being our most difficult of the year from a historical sales overlap standpoint. Importantly, our China division is off to a good start in the third quarter for both KFC and at Pizza Hut Casual Dining, including a return to positive same-store sales at Pizza Hut Casual Dining in recent weeks. 
Outside of China, challenging industry conditions in the U.S. contributed to soft sales results. However, our 3 brand divisions, in the aggregate, delivered core operating profit growth largely in line with our expectations and remain on track to deliver against their full year core operating profit growth targets. We're confident in our plans to drive second half sales improvement, led by a continuous focus on innovation, value and our core products. 
This as a transformational year for our company as we remain on track to finalize the separation of our China business with a targeted completion date around October 31, 2016, ultimately creating 2 powerful, independent focused-growth companies. Our capital structure is fully in place, and we plan to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders both prior to and after the spin. And I look forward to sharing additional details on the transformative initiatives we are undertaking as we become a more heavily franchised company at our New York investor conference on Tuesday, October 11. 
Today, I'll give you an overview of each of our operating divisions, and then David Gibbs, our CFO, will walk you through the financials. After that, the team and I will be happy to take any questions you might have. 
So first, China. As I mentioned, I'm particularly pleased KFC, which represents about 75% of our operating profit in China, reported its fourth consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth, with 3% comps in the second quarter. This was driven by stronger results in the second half of the quarter as our bucket-related promotions resonated with consumers. It's great to see the team's focus on the core end value translating into tangible results. 
Furthermore, we've simplified menus, improved efficiency and conveyed our value proposition to customers, all the while, maintaining our consumer perception scores. In fact, we've done all this while simultaneously improving restaurant margins in each of the last 4 quarters versus prior year. 
I'm also encouraged by China's -- sorry, by KFC China's plans for the balance of the year, and I'm pleased to report our third quarter, which began June 1 and is historically our highest from a profitability standpoint, is off to a great start, with same-store sales results quarter-to-date up low double digits. 
We rolled out box meals in June and are currently promoting our historically successful wing bucket, which we pulled forward a week earlier this year. As you all know, box meals have proven effectively globally for KFC, and we expect success in China given test results. It's great to see know-how sharing across our global knowledge base, and we look forward to leveraging this on an ongoing basis across all of Yum!. 
At Pizza Hut Casual Dining, system sales declined 2% and same-store sales declined 11% in the quarter. The good news is, based on our third quarter results to date, it appears the China team's strategic initiatives are beginning to bear fruit. As evidence, quarter-to-date same-store sales are slightly negative, and I'm pleased to report they have turned positive in recent weeks. Our renewed focus on pizza and ensuring customers understand our value propositions are critical to brand's success. 
It's too early to declare victory, but we know the potential of this brand and are further enhancing our core, simplifying the menu and leveraging ideas from Indonesia and Hong Kong, where we have other successful casual dining concepts, to execute on our strategy. 
Overall, we are clearly pleased with the progress we are making in China and our third quarter results to date. We caution overlaps do get tougher though for the balance of the quarter. 
So now on to our 3 branded divisions. In our KFC Division, same-store sales grew 2% in the second quarter or 4% on a 2-year stack. Operating profit grew 6% in the quarter, and the division opened 132 new international restaurants in 42 countries. 88% of these units were opened by franchisees, and 68% of our new international openings were in emerging markets. 
I'm encouraged by our ability to generate growth in both emerging and developed markets, as I think this really speaks to the global strength of our brand. In the U.S., for example, we reported our eighth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth. As further evidence we are gaining traction with our strategy in the U.S., our 2-year same-store sales growth lapped 3% growth in the prior year. So on a 2-year basis, comps were plus 5. System sales in international developed markets grew 4%, and in international emerging markets, grew 10%. We remain on track to open at least 475 net new international restaurants this year, and the U.S. is committed to delivering about 1,000 remodels in 2016. 
After the spinoff of our China division, KFC will be the largest contributor to new Yum! from multiple perspectives, including absolute profit growth, restaurant count and profit growth, to name a few. What really excites me are all the opportunities for growth that exist for this brand. Today, we open approximately 3 new KFCs a day globally or 1 every 8 hours. We are on a path over time to open 1 every 5 hours, which would nearly double our annual new unit openings. 
Pizza Hut had flat same-store sales in the quarter with 1% same-store sales growth in the U.S., which makes up approximately 60% of total sales. While second quarter results in the U.S. were softer than expected as competitors responded to our first quarter success with more aggressive promotions, we are pleased to see transaction growth in the U.S. and a continuation of the positive sales trends in our U.S. business. 
We believe our focus on making it easier to get a better pizza, whether it be by providing consistent value through the $5 Flavor Menu and $6.99 Any medium pairs deal or by improvements in technology as we upgrade our web experience and migrate our system to 1 POS, we'll continue to enhance our business model. 
As a testament to our strategy, our company-owned stores, which are executing against a comprehensive suite of easy and better initiatives, including a locally competitive value message driven by data science that is complementary to the national message and new operations programs geared to accelerate improvements in customer satisfaction, delivered second quarter same-store sales growth higher than the system with transaction growth more than 5 percentage points higher. This company outperformance is obviously encouraging, as it is a clear indication that we are on the right track, and we are excited about the impact these initiatives will ultimately have on the entire Pizza Hut system. 
Our international business at Pizza Hut saw system sales growth of 3% in constant currency and a 1% decline in same-store sales in the quarter. Sales were strong in Thailand, Canada and the U.K., but offset by weaknesses in Korea. 
Last quarter, I mentioned that we were planning on rolling our proven successful tactics from the U.S. in international markets. I'm pleased to say that we have started this and are seeing success with the $5 Flavor Menu in Australia and other markets and have plans to roll this construct out to additional markets later this year. This gives us confidence that the international Pizza Hut business is not far behind the U.S. in its turnaround. 
And finally, Taco Bell. Operating profit grew 1% when adjusting for the impact of refranchising, and this was after lapping a plus 29% from the prior year. However, U.S. same-store sales declined 1% as we lapped a plus 6% from the prior year. While a plus 5 on a 2-year stack is ahead of the category, we expect more out of Taco Bell given the strength of this brand. 
In the current environment, we need to pair innovation with value that clearly resonates with our consumers. For example, our $5 cravings bundle -- deal bundle improved results toward the end of the second quarter. And through the first 5 weeks of the third quarter, same-store sales are positive. 
We believe that the Taco Bell brand is extremely well positioned to exceed (sic) [succeed] in a challenging environment. In market research, Taco Bell always ranks as one of the top brands in providing value and innovation to consumers. We plan to leverage this position through the balance of 2016 and going forward. 
Furthermore, we remain on plan with new-unit development for the year. We are accelerating international new unit openings and are excited to see momentum behind this strategic objective. While it is early days, we believe this could be a meaningful driver of long-term growth and look forward to continued progress. 
Now before I turn it over to David Gibbs, I just wanted to share with you some of the highlights from our recent biennial franchise convention that was held this year in Las Vegas. I think it's fair to say our franchisees are extremely bullish about the transformation we are undergoing at Yum!, as evidenced by our record 1,100 attendees, representing over 100 countries, including numerous participants from our China division. This showcased the power of Yum! at its finest, as we brought all 3 brands together to build and share know-how on development advertising, innovation, value and digital. We are on a clear path to become a world-class franchisor and an even sharper brand builder. 
So as I've said, 2016 is truly a transformational year for Yum!. We're confident we'll deliver at least 14% core operating profit growth, and I'm pleased with the momentum in our China business as we near completion of the China separation. The Yum! China team is excited to reap the benefits of a continued growth in the consuming class. And as an independent company, Yum! China will continue to unlock massive growth opportunities while further capitalizing on what remains the #1 retail opportunity in the world. 
At new Yum!, I couldn't be more excited about the plans we have to become an even more unique and more powerful world-class franchisor. We will not undergo an evolution from Yum! as you know it, but instead another transformation, as we increase our franchise mix to at least 96% by the end of 2017 and sharpen our focus on 4 key areas: brand building, franchisee capability, market and asset development and our unique culture. We will make all decisions based on this construct. We will transform our mindset from equity-led to franchise-led and commit to a cost structure that enables us to build on these pillars. And I look forward to sharing additional details of this transformed vision for new Yum! at our Investor Conference in October. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to David Gibbs."

Let's start with a high-leve",1587,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: our second quarter operating results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our recapitalization and the separation of our China business. 
Let's start with a high-level overview of our second quarter performance. Yum! Brands delivered core operating profit growth of 7% in the quarter. Our China division reported flat same-store sales growth despite it being our toughest compare of the year. As Greg said, we are pleased with the progress we are making in China and with sales results to date in the third quarter, which is historically the biggest quarter of the year from a profitability standpoint. 
Second quarter core operating profit in our China Division grew 6% and was impacted, as expected, by an additional $14 million in closures and impairment expense versus prior year as well as a $4 million expense related to our RGM convention. These expenses were partially offset by a benefit from recent value-added tax reform in China, which went into effect on May 1 and positively impacted restaurant margins in the second quarter. 
In aggregate, our 3 brand divisions delivered 3% core operating profit growth in the quarter. This was led by 7% growth at Pizza Hut and 6% growth at KFC, partially offset by soft results at Taco Bell. 
Overall, EPS before special items grew 9%, including a 4-point negative impact from foreign currency changes. EPS benefited from a 6% reduction in our diluted share count compared to our second quarter last year due to our significant share buybacks over the past 12 months. 
Now I'd like to discuss our 2016 outlook. Given our strong first-half performance and current trends in China, we are raising our core operating profit growth forecast for Yum! from 12% to at least 14%, including the 53rd week. We started the year by saying that we expected Yum! core operating profit growth of at least 10%. Outside of China, our 3 brand divisions remain on track to deliver results consistent with our initial targets. Therefore, the increase in Yum!'s 2016 guidance is essentially due to upside in China, including strong year-to-date KFC sales, margin and profit growth; and a balance of the year that will be aided by the VAT change; partially offset by a return to commodity inflation and higher labor costs. 
As you might recall, last quarter, we walked through the pending changes to China's retail tax structure, which became effective May 1. As a reminder, under this reform, a 6% output VAT replaces a 5% business tax currently applied to certain restaurant sales. Input VAT is creditable to the aforementioned 6% output VAT. We believe this change will have a material benefit to Yum! China restaurant margins for the balance of the year. However, the scale and nature of the policy, along with implementation and transition challenges, make it very difficult to pinpoint the exact magnitude of the impact. 
While we won't provide any further detail on VAT today, we expect to be able to provide more clarity on our third quarter call after we have a full quarter of results behind us. I want to point out that for the balance of the year, we do expect labor and commodity inflation to partially offset this benefit. With this and our first half outperformance in mind, our current guidance for full year China restaurant margins is now at least 17% versus 16% previously. 
Outside of China, our 3 brand divisions remain on track to deliver results consistent with our initial 2016 targets. We expect any potential softness in topline performance to be offset by a favorable commodities environment. That being said, we're confident in our plans to drive sales improvement balance of year and are encouraged with our positive results, third quarter to date, at Taco Bell. 
On the development front, we added over 370 new units globally in the second quarter, taking our year-to-date global new restaurant openings to over 650 units. Consistent with prior years, development will be weighted more towards the second half, as we expect to accelerate our pace of development balance of year, further laying the groundwork for future growth. 
In China, we have increased our focus on refurbishing and remodeling stores this year, and we believe the momentum that we are seeing in the business today can be partially attributed to this investment in improving the guest experience. In fact, we are reallocating our capital to increase our pace of remodels to nearly 800 in 2016, up from our previous target of 550. At the same time, we're reducing both our gross and net new unit numbers for the year by around 50 to 100 openings versus our original expectations. This is primarily due to fewer new Pizza Hut Casual Dining units this year. 
But to be clear, our confidence level in the long-term growth prospects of our brands in China remains undiminished. Also keep in mind, as a division, we expect about 100 fewer closures in 2016 than we had last year, and we continue to get cash paybacks for new KFC and Pizza Hut units in the 3- to 4-year range, both great signs of the underlying strength in the business model and the potential for future expansion. 
And finally, outside of China. For the full year, we expect another strong year of development, with total gross openings of nearly 1,800 units. 
Turning now to foreign exchange. Given the recent vote by the U.K. to exit the EU, I want to remind investors that one of the many great benefits of Yum! is our global and therefore diversified presence. In 2015, approximately 6% of our operating profit was generated from the U.K. and approximately 2% from the remaining euro zone. That being said, with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most of the world's other major foreign currencies, at current forward rates, currency translation is now estimated to negatively affect balance of the year operating profit by about $50 million, which represents an increase of $10 million versus our initial expectations. 
As always, please take this as directional guidance only, as rates will inevitably change as we move throughout the year. In addition, keep in mind this does not impact our core operating profit growth forecast of at least 14%, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation. 
Now I'd like to provide you with an update on our refranchising targets. As you know, in connection with the China separation, we've committed to become at least 96% franchised by the end of 2017. In the past 4 quarters, we've refranchised over 300 restaurants outside of China, including 82 units in the second quarter. 
Refranchising will, simply put, improve our business model. Proceeds from refranchising enable us to return significant amounts of cash to our shareholders while creating an even larger and more stable stream of franchise fees. It also produces immediate G&A savings, as field-level employees are typically absorbed into our franchise system. That being said, we realize there are additional opportunities to operate more efficiently and look forward to sharing more detailed plans around our ongoing refranchising strategy and G&A roadmap at our Investor Conference on October 11. 
Now I'd like to quickly update you on our spinoff plans. We remain on track to complete the spinoff with a targeted completion date around October 31. We filed our initial Form 10 on May 3 and filed an amendment earlier this week. Our comprehensive global roadshows will follow our investor conference. 
In conjunction with our spinoff, we are also optimizing the capital structure of Yum!. To this end, I'm very pleased to report the successful completion of our planned recapitalization in June. In aggregate, we closed on $6.9 billion of new debt, consisting of a $2.3 billion financing facility, securitizing our Taco Bell U.S. royalties; a $2.5 billion senior secured credit facility and a $2.1 billion of high-yield notes. 
With the completion of our recapitalization, today, we have approximately $9 billion in debt outstanding at an attractive blended interest rate of less than 5%. This marks yet another milestone in our previously communicated commitment to return $6.2 billion of capital, excluding ongoing dividend payments, to shareholders. 
In fact, since we announced in October 2015 our intention to separate the China business, we have repurchased 3.3 billion of shares, which equates to 42.9 million -- $3.3 billion of shares, which equate to 42.9 million shares at an average price of $76. We continue to believe that our stock represents a good value at current prices. But make no mistake, this is just the beginning, as we target an additional $3.5 billion in capital return across 2017 and 2018. This will take our total capital returned program, including dividends, to $10 billion over about a 3-year period and further demonstrates our commitment to delivering meaningful cash returns to our shareholders. 
So let me wrap things up. We're confident we'll deliver at least 14% core operating profit growth for the full year, and we're proceeding as expected with the separation of our China business. Our brand businesses are performing, in the aggregate, in line with our initial expectations, and I'm pleased with the progress we're making in China as it approaches its first day as an independent company. 
As Greg said, 2016 is truly a transformational year for Yum!. We look forward to sharing additional details with you at our New York Investor Conference in October. 
And with that, the team and I are happy to take your questions."

So we will still build -- we will be the leading developer of casual dining restaurants by far in China, but be paused for a bit. And I think we are encouraged by the trend that we are seeing currently. When same-store sales come back to positive territory, then we will re-step up the build rate of Pizza Hut Casual Dining. As far as refurbishment is concerned, that is applicable to both our brands. And it was our judgment that it was very important to improve the customer experience and also to be able to bring our estate in line with retail in China, which has been modernizing in general very rapidly. So we've -- as David Gibbs mentioned in his comments, we increased the remodel rate across both brands. And in aggregate, that should be about 800 this year. So we've effectively, in the last 18 months, doubled our rate of refurbishment to bring the estate to acceptable levels. So it's not as though we're reinvesting only in Pizza Hut, we are reinvesting in both the brands. I hope that answers your question."

And as David mentioned, we did build Pizza Hut Home Service restaurants, which tend to be lower volume. And KFC had slowed a little bit because of the 2 years of difficulty in sales. We fully expect KFC development this year to be ahead of our original plans. And in general terms, we see the efficiency and delivery from new units as being just as good as it has been in the past.

Well, if I take the Pizza Hut Casual Dining, I think is in a much better position with regards to the consumer proposition than it was, even I would say, 3 months ago. The positioning of the brand is quite clear. It's been explained and carried forward through the organization. It's an integrated position which covers new product development as well as service, down to uniforms, et cetera. And I think it's resonating well. It's called ""Love to Share"" and it's appropriate because, unlike KFC, where most people come in singles or order their meals individually; in Pizza Hut, it's a group, they tend to order their meals together. And also as you know, there's a big phenomenon now of sharing the food experience through social media. And all that is working in our favor. On both brands, the emphasis has been to continue our rate of innovation and to continue to give consumers great meals. The differences is that we are doing it in a way that is operationally friendly so that it does not slow speed of service or cause problems with value. In the case of KFC, for example, as Greg mentioned, that includes box meals, which has worked, tried and tested formula globally, that offers consumers not 3 but 5 items for slightly higher price and offers great value. The innovation across all platforms is strong, but the big difference, I think, is that it is not all practical innovation that gives choice without complicating operations at a great deal. Across all dayparts, also we've made significant investments in high-quality coffee machines in both brands and high-quality ice cream machines in the case of KFC to be able to improve our delivery and our quality of product."

And I guess the second point was about the China margins. I know you gave some color on that. Also surprised to see the commodity, it looks like the food margins were good in the context of it seems like an emphasis on value.

At the moment, we feel pretty confident that we can deliver through other productivity initiatives, profit dollar goods without having to take recourse to pricing.

I think, as we've said earlier, there is a, I'll call it a malaise in the U.S. is probably the best way to describe it. I think there was an interesting report out yesterday that, I think, 75% of people age 18 to 30 believe that the U.S. is either falling behind or failing as a nation according to a gen forward survey. So that's not particularly good news from just what are people thinking. As I said earlier, we believe that in the U.S., the market on a trailing 13 is about minus 1 in transactions, probably plus 1 in sales. As I said, I think the good news is we have started the third quarter stronger than we finished -- than we have in the second quarter. I think what it means is, for brands like Taco Bell, we've got to make sure that we get our communication really tight and focused. I'm not [ph] necessarily believe it means we have to drop our prices any more. I think what we've got to do is do a better job of communicating our value. And we also have to remember that the Taco Bell brand always responds to incredible breakthrough innovations. So I think you'll see more of that coming from Taco Bell. I have to give the KFC U.S. team credit. I think the George Hamilton as the new colonel behind the extra crispy is brilliant, and that is having a positive impact on our sales momentum at KFC in the U.S. right now. So we've gone back to our core product. We haven't had to discount. We've obviously wrapped it around $20 buckets and $5 boxes, but we've just done a much better job of breaking through with the communication. And then I think on Pizza Hut, we will -- we've announced that we're moving to a new agency. We will get to a new campaign some time before the end of the year. And I think the Pizza Hut team would agree we can do better job of communicating both better and easy. So I'm positive about what's happening now and I'm positive about what the guys are working on. And as I've said, kudos to the KFC team, who I think have taken a core product and demonstrated you can deliver above category growth by making sure you really have breakthrough communication. So better communication, making sure we've got the right product points, making sure we've got breakthrough innovation. I think that's -- I know that's what the 3 U.S. brands are focused on. I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing and I'm encouraged by the momentum we have going into the third quarter. 
So what I'd like to do, I think, just -- is just to quickly wrap up. 
So first of all, I want to thank you all for being on the call. We really appreciate it. Pretty much, my last answer probably sums up a lot of it, which was we're encouraged by the progress we're making, particularly in those businesses that we've been focused on, which is both Pizza Hut and KFC in China, as well as KFC and Pizza Hut in the U.S. As I said, we're off to a good start in the third quarter in both China and the U.S. And all of us -- and particularly, I am looking forward to catching up with everyone at the Investor Conference in New York on October 11.

Brands delivered second quarter core operating profit growth of 7% and EPS growth, excluding special items, of 9%. Given our strong first half results and current trends in China, I'm pleased to raise our full year core operating profit growth forecast to at least 14% from 12% previously. 
I'm particularly pleased with the continued sales momentum at KFC China, which delivered better-than-expected same-store sales growth of 3%. This represents our fourth consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth at KFC China, despite the second quarter being our most difficult of the year from a historical sales overlap standpoint. Importantly, our China division is off to a good start in the third quarter for both KFC and at Pizza Hut Casual Dining, including a return to positive same-store sales at Pizza Hut Casual Dining in recent weeks. 
Outside of China, challenging industry conditions in the U.S. contributed to soft sales results. However, our 3 brand divisions, in the aggregate, delivered core operating profit growth largely in line with our expectations and remain on track to deliver against their full year core operating profit growth targets. We're confident in our plans to drive second half sales improvement, led by a continuous focus on innovation, value and our core products. 
This as a transformational year for our company as we remain on track to finalize the separation of our China business with a targeted completion date around October 31, 2016, ultimately creating 2 powerful, independent focused-growth companies. Our capital structure is fully in place, and we plan to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders both prior to and after the spin. And I look forward to sharing additional details on the transformative initiatives we are undertaking as we become a more heavily franchised company at our New York investor conference on Tuesday, October 11. 
Today, I'll give you an overview of each of our operating divisions, and then David Gibbs, our CFO, will walk you through the financials. After that, the team and I will be happy to take any questions you might have. 
So first, China. As I mentioned, I'm particularly pleased KFC, which represents about 75% of our operating profit in China, reported its fourth consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth, with 3% comps in the second quarter. This was driven by stronger results in the second half of the quarter as our bucket-related promotions resonated with consumers. It's great to see the team's focus on the core end value translating into tangible results. 
Furthermore, we've simplified menus, improved efficiency and conveyed our value proposition to customers, all the while, maintaining our consumer perception scores. In fact, we've done all this while simultaneously improving restaurant margins in each of the last 4 quarters versus prior year. 
I'm also encouraged by China's -- sorry, by KFC China's plans for the balance of the year, and I'm pleased to report our third quarter, which began June 1 and is historically our highest from a profitability standpoint, is off to a great start, with same-store sales results quarter-to-date up low double digits. 
We rolled out box meals in June and are currently promoting our historically successful wing bucket, which we pulled forward a week earlier this year. As you all know, box meals have proven effectively globally for KFC, and we expect success in China given test results. It's great to see know-how sharing across our global knowledge base, and we look forward to leveraging this on an ongoing basis across all of Yum!. 
At Pizza Hut Casual Dining, system sales declined 2% and same-store sales declined 11% in the quarter. The good news is, based on our third quarter results to date, it appears the China team's strategic initiatives are beginning to bear fruit. As evidence, quarter-to-date same-store sales are slightly negative, and I'm pleased to report they have turned positive in recent weeks. Our renewed focus on pizza and ensuring customers understand our value propositions are critical to brand's success. 
It's too early to declare victory, but we know the potential of this brand and are further enhancing our core, simplifying the menu and leveraging ideas from Indonesia and Hong Kong, where we have other successful casual dining concepts, to execute on our strategy. 
Overall, we are clearly pleased with the progress we are making in China and our third quarter results to date. We caution overlaps do get tougher though for the balance of the quarter. 
So now on to our 3 branded divisions. In our KFC Division, same-store sales grew 2% in the second quarter or 4% on a 2-year stack. Operating profit grew 6% in the quarter, and the division opened 132 new international restaurants in 42 countries. 88% of these units were opened by franchisees, and 68% of our new international openings were in emerging markets. 
I'm encouraged by our ability to generate growth in both emerging and developed markets, as I think this really speaks to the global strength of our brand. In the U.S., for example, we reported our eighth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth. As further evidence we are gaining traction with our strategy in the U.S., our 2-year same-store sales growth lapped 3% growth in the prior year. So on a 2-year basis, comps were plus 5. System sales in international developed markets grew 4%, and in international emerging markets, grew 10%. We remain on track to open at least 475 net new international restaurants this year, and the U.S. is committed to delivering about 1,000 remodels in 2016. 
After the spinoff of our China division, KFC will be the largest contributor to new Yum! from multiple perspectives, including absolute profit growth, restaurant count and profit growth, to name a few. What really excites me are all the opportunities for growth that exist for this brand. Today, we open approximately 3 new KFCs a day globally or 1 every 8 hours. We are on a path over time to open 1 every 5 hours, which would nearly double our annual new unit openings. 
Pizza Hut had flat same-store sales in the quarter with 1% same-store sales growth in the U.S., which makes up approximately 60% of total sales. While second quarter results in the U.S. were softer than expected as competitors responded to our first quarter success with more aggressive promotions, we are pleased to see transaction growth in the U.S. and a continuation of the positive sales trends in our U.S. business. 
We believe our focus on making it easier to get a better pizza, whether it be by providing consistent value through the $5 Flavor Menu and $6.99 Any medium pairs deal or by improvements in technology as we upgrade our web experience and migrate our system to 1 POS, we'll continue to enhance our business model. 
As a testament to our strategy, our company-owned stores, which are executing against a comprehensive suite of easy and better initiatives, including a locally competitive value message driven by data science that is complementary to the national message and new operations programs geared to accelerate improvements in customer satisfaction, delivered second quarter same-store sales growth higher than the system with transaction growth more than 5 percentage points higher. This company outperformance is obviously encouraging, as it is a clear indication that we are on the right track, and we are excited about the impact these initiatives will ultimately have on the entire Pizza Hut system. 
Our international business at Pizza Hut saw system sales growth of 3% in constant currency and a 1% decline in same-store sales in the quarter. Sales were strong in Thailand, Canada and the U.K., but offset by weaknesses in Korea. 
Last quarter, I mentioned that we were planning on rolling our proven successful tactics from the U.S. in international markets. I'm pleased to say that we have started this and are seeing success with the $5 Flavor Menu in Australia and other markets and have plans to roll this construct out to additional markets later this year. This gives us confidence that the international Pizza Hut business is not far behind the U.S. in its turnaround. 
And finally, Taco Bell. Operating profit grew 1% when adjusting for the impact of refranchising, and this was after lapping a plus 29% from the prior year. However, U.S. same-store sales declined 1% as we lapped a plus 6% from the prior year. While a plus 5 on a 2-year stack is ahead of the category, we expect more out of Taco Bell given the strength of this brand. 
In the current environment, we need to pair innovation with value that clearly resonates with our consumers. For example, our $5 cravings bundle -- deal bundle improved results toward the end of the second quarter. And through the first 5 weeks of the third quarter, same-store sales are positive. 
We believe that the Taco Bell brand is extremely well positioned to exceed (sic) [succeed] in a challenging environment. In market research, Taco Bell always ranks as one of the top brands in providing value and innovation to consumers. We plan to leverage this position through the balance of 2016 and going forward. 
Furthermore, we remain on plan with new-unit development for the year. We are accelerating international new unit openings and are excited to see momentum behind this strategic objective. While it is early days, we believe this could be a meaningful driver of long-term growth and look forward to continued progress. 
Now before I turn it over to David Gibbs, I just wanted to share with you some of the highlights from our recent biennial franchise convention that was held this year in Las Vegas. I think it's fair to say our franchisees are extremely bullish about the transformation we are undergoing at Yum!, as evidenced by our record 1,100 attendees, representing over 100 countries, including numerous participants from our China division. This showcased the power of Yum! at its finest, as we brought all 3 brands together to build and share know-how on development advertising, innovation, value and digital. We are on a clear path to become a world-class franchisor and an even sharper brand builder. 
So as I've said, 2016 is truly a transformational year for Yum!. We're confident we'll deliver at least 14% core operating profit growth, and I'm pleased with the momentum in our China business as we near completion of the China separation. The Yum! China team is excited to reap the benefits of a continued growth in the consuming class. And as an independent company, Yum! China will continue to unlock massive growth opportunities while further capitalizing on what remains the #1 retail opportunity in the world. 
At new Yum!, I couldn't be more excited about the plans we have to become an even more unique and more powerful world-class franchisor. We will not undergo an evolution from Yum! as you know it, but instead another transformation, as we increase our franchise mix to at least 96% by the end of 2017 and sharpen our focus on 4 key areas: brand building, franchisee capability, market and asset development and our unique culture. We will make all decisions based on this construct. We will transform our mindset from equity-led to franchise-led and commit to a cost structure that enables us to build on these pillars. And I look forward to sharing additional details of this transformed vision for new Yum! at our Investor Conference in October. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to David Gibbs."

In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: our second quarter operating results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our recapitalization and the separation of our China business. Let's start with a high-leve",1587,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: our second quarter operating results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our recapitalization and the separation of our China business. 
Let's start with a high-level overview of our second quarter performance. Yum! Brands delivered core operating profit growth of 7% in the quarter. Our China division reported flat same-store sales growth despite it being our toughest compare of the year. As Greg said, we are pleased with the progress we are making in China and with sales results to date in the third quarter, which is historically the biggest quarter of the year from a profitability standpoint. 
Second quarter core operating profit in our China Division grew 6% and was impacted, as expected, by an additional $14 million in closures and impairment expense versus prior year as well as a $4 million expense related to our RGM convention. These expenses were partially offset by a benefit from recent value-added tax reform in China, which went into effect on May 1 and positively impacted restaurant margins in the second quarter. 
In aggregate, our 3 brand divisions delivered 3% core operating profit growth in the quarter. This was led by 7% growth at Pizza Hut and 6% growth at KFC, partially offset by soft results at Taco Bell. 
Overall, EPS before special items grew 9%, including a 4-point negative impact from foreign currency changes. EPS benefited from a 6% reduction in our diluted share count compared to our second quarter last year due to our significant share buybacks over the past 12 months. 
Now I'd like to discuss our 2016 outlook. Given our strong first-half performance and current trends in China, we are raising our core operating profit growth forecast for Yum! from 12% to at least 14%, including the 53rd week. We started the year by saying that we expected Yum! core operating profit growth of at least 10%. Outside of China, our 3 brand divisions remain on track to deliver results consistent with our initial targets. Therefore, the increase in Yum!'s 2016 guidance is essentially due to upside in China, including strong year-to-date KFC sales, margin and profit growth; and a balance of the year that will be aided by the VAT change; partially offset by a return to commodity inflation and higher labor costs. 
As you might recall, last quarter, we walked through the pending changes to China's retail tax structure, which became effective May 1. As a reminder, under this reform, a 6% output VAT replaces a 5% business tax currently applied to certain restaurant sales. Input VAT is creditable to the aforementioned 6% output VAT. We believe this change will have a material benefit to Yum! China restaurant margins for the balance of the year. However, the scale and nature of the policy, along with implementation and transition challenges, make it very difficult to pinpoint the exact magnitude of the impact. 
While we won't provide any further detail on VAT today, we expect to be able to provide more clarity on our third quarter call after we have a full quarter of results behind us. I want to point out that for the balance of the year, we do expect labor and commodity inflation to partially offset this benefit. With this and our first half outperformance in mind, our current guidance for full year China restaurant margins is now at least 17% versus 16% previously. 
Outside of China, our 3 brand divisions remain on track to deliver results consistent with our initial 2016 targets. We expect any potential softness in topline performance to be offset by a favorable commodities environment. That being said, we're confident in our plans to drive sales improvement balance of year and are encouraged with our positive results, third quarter to date, at Taco Bell. 
On the development front, we added over 370 new units globally in the second quarter, taking our year-to-date global new restaurant openings to over 650 units. Consistent with prior years, development will be weighted more towards the second half, as we expect to accelerate our pace of development balance of year, further laying the groundwork for future growth. 
In China, we have increased our focus on refurbishing and remodeling stores this year, and we believe the momentum that we are seeing in the business today can be partially attributed to this investment in improving the guest experience. In fact, we are reallocating our capital to increase our pace of remodels to nearly 800 in 2016, up from our previous target of 550. At the same time, we're reducing both our gross and net new unit numbers for the year by around 50 to 100 openings versus our original expectations. This is primarily due to fewer new Pizza Hut Casual Dining units this year. 
But to be clear, our confidence level in the long-term growth prospects of our brands in China remains undiminished. Also keep in mind, as a division, we expect about 100 fewer closures in 2016 than we had last year, and we continue to get cash paybacks for new KFC and Pizza Hut units in the 3- to 4-year range, both great signs of the underlying strength in the business model and the potential for future expansion. 
And finally, outside of China. For the full year, we expect another strong year of development, with total gross openings of nearly 1,800 units. 
Turning now to foreign exchange. Given the recent vote by the U.K. to exit the EU, I want to remind investors that one of the many great benefits of Yum! is our global and therefore diversified presence. In 2015, approximately 6% of our operating profit was generated from the U.K. and approximately 2% from the remaining euro zone. That being said, with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most of the world's other major foreign currencies, at current forward rates, currency translation is now estimated to negatively affect balance of the year operating profit by about $50 million, which represents an increase of $10 million versus our initial expectations. 
As always, please take this as directional guidance only, as rates will inevitably change as we move throughout the year. In addition, keep in mind this does not impact our core operating profit growth forecast of at least 14%, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation. 
Now I'd like to provide you with an update on our refranchising targets. As you know, in connection with the China separation, we've committed to become at least 96% franchised by the end of 2017. In the past 4 quarters, we've refranchised over 300 restaurants outside of China, including 82 units in the second quarter. 
Refranchising will, simply put, improve our business model. Proceeds from refranchising enable us to return significant amounts of cash to our shareholders while creating an even larger and more stable stream of franchise fees. It also produces immediate G&A savings, as field-level employees are typically absorbed into our franchise system. That being said, we realize there are additional opportunities to operate more efficiently and look forward to sharing more detailed plans around our ongoing refranchising strategy and G&A roadmap at our Investor Conference on October 11. 
Now I'd like to quickly update you on our spinoff plans. We remain on track to complete the spinoff with a targeted completion date around October 31. We filed our initial Form 10 on May 3 and filed an amendment earlier this week. Our comprehensive global roadshows will follow our investor conference. 
In conjunction with our spinoff, we are also optimizing the capital structure of Yum!. To this end, I'm very pleased to report the successful completion of our planned recapitalization in June. In aggregate, we closed on $6.9 billion of new debt, consisting of a $2.3 billion financing facility, securitizing our Taco Bell U.S. royalties; a $2.5 billion senior secured credit facility and a $2.1 billion of high-yield notes. 
With the completion of our recapitalization, today, we have approximately $9 billion in debt outstanding at an attractive blended interest rate of less than 5%. This marks yet another milestone in our previously communicated commitment to return $6.2 billion of capital, excluding ongoing dividend payments, to shareholders. 
In fact, since we announced in October 2015 our intention to separate the China business, we have repurchased 3.3 billion of shares, which equates to 42.9 million -- $3.3 billion of shares, which equate to 42.9 million shares at an average price of $76. We continue to believe that our stock represents a good value at current prices. But make no mistake, this is just the beginning, as we target an additional $3.5 billion in capital return across 2017 and 2018. This will take our total capital returned program, including dividends, to $10 billion over about a 3-year period and further demonstrates our commitment to delivering meaningful cash returns to our shareholders. 
So let me wrap things up. We're confident we'll deliver at least 14% core operating profit growth for the full year, and we're proceeding as expected with the separation of our China business. Our brand businesses are performing, in the aggregate, in line with our initial expectations, and I'm pleased with the progress we're making in China as it approaches its first day as an independent company. 
As Greg said, 2016 is truly a transformational year for Yum!. We look forward to sharing additional details with you at our New York Investor Conference in October. 
And with that, the team and I are happy to take your questions."

So we will still build -- we will be the leading developer of casual dining restaurants by far in China, but be paused for a bit. And I think we are encouraged by the trend that we are seeing currently. When same-store sales come back to positive territory, then we will re-step up the build rate of Pizza Hut Casual Dining. As far as refurbishment is concerned, that is applicable to both our brands. And it was our judgment that it was very important to improve the customer experience and also to be able to bring our estate in line with retail in China, which has been modernizing in general very rapidly. So we've -- as David Gibbs mentioned in his comments, we increased the remodel rate across both brands. And in aggregate, that should be about 800 this year.

And as David mentioned, we did build Pizza Hut Home Service restaurants, which tend to be lower volume. And KFC had slowed a little bit because of the 2 years of difficulty in sales. We fully expect KFC development this year to be ahead of our original plans. And in general terms, we see the efficiency and delivery from new units as being just as good as it has been in the past.

Well, if I take the Pizza Hut Casual Dining, I think is in a much better position with regards to the consumer proposition than it was, even I would say, 3 months ago. The positioning of the brand is quite clear. It's been explained and carried forward through the organization. It's an integrated position which covers new product development as well as service, down to uniforms, et cetera. And I think it's resonating well. It's called ""Love to Share"" and it's appropriate because, unlike KFC, where most people come in singles or order their meals individually; in Pizza Hut, it's a group, they tend to order their meals together. And also as you know, there's a big phenomenon now of sharing the food experience through social media. And all that is working in our favor. On both brands, the emphasis has been to continue our rate of innovation and to continue to give consumers great meals. The differences is that we are doing it in a way that is operationally friendly so that it does not slow speed of service or cause problems with value. In the case of KFC, for example, as Greg mentioned, that includes box meals, which has worked, tried and tested formula globally, that offers consumers not 3 but 5 items for slightly higher price and offers great value. The innovation across all platforms is strong, but the big difference, I think, is that it is not all practical innovation that gives choice without complicating operations at a great deal. Across all dayparts, also we've made significant investments in high-quality coffee machines in both brands and high-quality ice cream machines in the case of KFC to be able to improve our delivery and our quality of product."

Was just hoping you guys could talk about how you're evaluating the remaining $3.3 billion of cash return to shareholders through October. At current trading prices, we're kind of estimating this is going to be about 20% of your daily trading volume if you repurchase that all over the course of every day over the next 3.5 months. So it just seems like an ambitious endeavor. And just want to hear what kind of factors could lead you guys to reallocate some of that cash to a special dividend."

We are, however, doing more and more effective marketing activity through digital media, et cetera, which is a complicated topic, but we're getting higher and higher efficiencies that's allowing us to target specific consumers that will allow us to drive traffic to our stores and develop sales satisfactorily.

I think, as we've said earlier, there is a, I'll call it a malaise in the U.S. is probably the best way to describe it. I think there was an interesting report out yesterday that, I think, 75% of people age 18 to 30 believe that the U.S. is either falling behind or failing as a nation according to a gen forward survey. So that's not particularly good news from just what are people thinking. As I said earlier, we believe that in the U.S., the market on a trailing 13 is about minus 1 in transactions, probably plus 1 in sales. As I said, I think the good news is we have started the third quarter stronger than we finished -- than we have in the second quarter. I think what it means is, for brands like Taco Bell, we've got to make sure that we get our communication really tight and focused. I'm not [ph] necessarily believe it means we have to drop our prices any more. I think what we've got to do is do a better job of communicating our value. And we also have to remember that the Taco Bell brand always responds to incredible breakthrough innovations. So I think you'll see more of that coming from Taco Bell. I have to give the KFC U.S. team credit. I think the George Hamilton as the new colonel behind the extra crispy is brilliant, and that is having a positive impact on our sales momentum at KFC in the U.S. right now. So we've gone back to our core product. We haven't had to discount. We've obviously wrapped it around $20 buckets and $5 boxes, but we've just done a much better job of breaking through with the communication. And then I think on Pizza Hut, we will -- we've announced that we're moving to a new agency. We will get to a new campaign some time before the end of the year. And I think the Pizza Hut team would agree we can do better job of communicating both better and easy. So I'm positive about what's happening now and I'm positive about what the guys are working on. And as I've said, kudos to the KFC team, who I think have taken a core product and demonstrated you can deliver above category growth by making sure you really have breakthrough communication. So better communication, making sure we've got the right product points, making sure we've got breakthrough innovation. I think that's -- I know that's what the 3 U.S. brands are focused on. I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing and I'm encouraged by the momentum we have going into the third quarter. 
So what I'd like to do, I think, just -- is just to quickly wrap up. 
So first of all, I want to thank you all for being on the call. We really appreciate it. Pretty much, my last answer probably sums up a lot of it, which was we're encouraged by the progress we're making, particularly in those businesses that we've been focused on, which is both Pizza Hut and KFC in China, as well as KFC and Pizza Hut in the U.S. As I said, we're off to a good start in the third quarter in both China and the U.S. And all of us -- and particularly, I am looking forward to catching up with everyone at the Investor Conference in New York on October 11.

Brands delivered second quarter core operating profit growth of 7% and EPS growth, excluding special items, of 9%. Given our strong first half results and current trends in China, I'm pleased to raise our full year core operating profit growth forecast to at least 14% from 12% previously. 
I'm particularly pleased with the continued sales momentum at KFC China, which delivered better-than-expected same-store sales growth of 3%. This represents our fourth consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth at KFC China, despite the second quarter being our most difficult of the year from a historical sales overlap standpoint. Importantly, our China division is off to a good start in the third quarter for both KFC and at Pizza Hut Casual Dining, including a return to positive same-store sales at Pizza Hut Casual Dining in recent weeks. 
Outside of China, challenging industry conditions in the U.S. contributed to soft sales results. However, our 3 brand divisions, in the aggregate, delivered core operating profit growth largely in line with our expectations and remain on track to deliver against their full year core operating profit growth targets. We're confident in our plans to drive second half sales improvement, led by a continuous focus on innovation, value and our core products. 
This as a transformational year for our company as we remain on track to finalize the separation of our China business with a targeted completion date around October 31, 2016, ultimately creating 2 powerful, independent focused-growth companies. Our capital structure is fully in place, and we plan to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders both prior to and after the spin. And I look forward to sharing additional details on the transformative initiatives we are undertaking as we become a more heavily franchised company at our New York investor conference on Tuesday, October 11. 
Today, I'll give you an overview of each of our operating divisions, and then David Gibbs, our CFO, will walk you through the financials. After that, the team and I will be happy to take any questions you might have. 
So first, China. As I mentioned, I'm particularly pleased KFC, which represents about 75% of our operating profit in China, reported its fourth consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth, with 3% comps in the second quarter. This was driven by stronger results in the second half of the quarter as our bucket-related promotions resonated with consumers. It's great to see the team's focus on the core end value translating into tangible results. 
Furthermore, we've simplified menus, improved efficiency and conveyed our value proposition to customers, all the while, maintaining our consumer perception scores. In fact, we've done all this while simultaneously improving restaurant margins in each of the last 4 quarters versus prior year. 
I'm also encouraged by China's -- sorry, by KFC China's plans for the balance of the year, and I'm pleased to report our third quarter, which began June 1 and is historically our highest from a profitability standpoint, is off to a great start, with same-store sales results quarter-to-date up low double digits. 
We rolled out box meals in June and are currently promoting our historically successful wing bucket, which we pulled forward a week earlier this year. As you all know, box meals have proven effective globally for KFC, and we expect success in China given test results. It's great to see know-how sharing across our global knowledge base, and we look forward to leveraging this on an ongoing basis across all of Yum!. 
At Pizza Hut Casual Dining, system sales declined 2% and same-store sales declined 11% in the quarter. The good news is, based on our third quarter results to date, it appears the China team's strategic initiatives are beginning to bear fruit. As evidence, quarter-to-date same-store sales are slightly negative, and I'm pleased to report they have turned positive in recent weeks. Our renewed focus on pizza and ensuring customers understand our value propositions are critical to brand success. 
It's too early to declare victory, but we know the potential of this brand and are further enhancing our core, simplifying the menu and leveraging ideas from Indonesia and Hong Kong, where we have other successful casual dining concepts, to execute on our strategy. 
Overall, we are clearly pleased with the progress we are making in China and our third quarter results to date. We caution overlaps do get tougher though for the balance of the quarter. 
So now on to our 3 branded divisions. In our KFC Division, same-store sales grew 2% in the second quarter or 4% on a 2-year stack. Operating profit grew 6% in the quarter, and the division opened 132 new international restaurants in 42 countries. 88% of these units were opened by franchisees, and 68% of our new international openings were in emerging markets. 
I'm encouraged by our ability to generate growth in both emerging and developed markets, as I think this really speaks to the global strength of our brand. In the U.S., for example, we reported our eighth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth. As further evidence we are gaining traction with our strategy in the U.S., our 2-year same-store sales growth lapped 3% growth in the prior year. So on a 2-year basis, comps were plus 5%. System sales in international developed markets grew 4%, and in international emerging markets, grew 10%. We remain on track to open at least 475 net new international restaurants this year, and the U.S. is committed to delivering about 1,000 remodels in 2016. 
After the spinoff of our China division, KFC will be the largest contributor to new Yum! from multiple perspectives, including absolute profit growth, restaurant count and profit growth, to name a few. What really excites me are all the opportunities for growth that exist for this brand. Today, we open approximately 3 new KFCs a day globally or 1 every 8 hours. We are on a path over time to open 1 every 5 hours, which would nearly double our annual new unit openings. 
Pizza Hut had flat same-store sales in the quarter with 1% same-store sales growth in the U.S., which makes up approximately 60% of total sales. While second quarter results in the U.S. were softer than expected as competitors responded to our first quarter success with more aggressive promotions, we are pleased to see transaction growth in the U.S. and a continuation of the positive sales trends in our U.S. business. 
We believe our focus on making it easier to get a better pizza, whether it be by providing consistent value through the $5 Flavor Menu and $6.99 Any medium pairs deal or by improvements in technology as we upgrade our web experience and migrate our system to 1 POS, we'll continue to enhance our business model. 
As a testament to our strategy, our company-owned stores, which are executing against a comprehensive suite of easy and better initiatives, including a locally competitive value message driven by data science that is complementary to the national message and new operations programs geared to accelerate improvements in customer satisfaction, delivered second quarter same-store sales growth higher than the system with transaction growth more than 5 percentage points higher. This company outperformance is obviously encouraging, as it is a clear indication that we are on the right track, and we are excited about the impact these initiatives will ultimately have on the entire Pizza Hut system. 
Our international business at Pizza Hut saw system sales growth of 3% in constant currency and a 1% decline in same-store sales in the quarter. Sales were strong in Thailand, Canada and the U.K., but offset by weaknesses in Korea. 
Last quarter, I mentioned that we were planning on rolling out proven successful tactics from the U.S. in international markets. I'm pleased to say that we have started this and are seeing success with the $5 Flavor Menu in Australia and other markets and have plans to roll this construct out to additional markets later this year. This gives us confidence that the international Pizza Hut business is not far behind the U.S. in its turnaround. 
And finally, Taco Bell. Operating profit grew 1% when adjusting for the impact of refranchising, and this was after lapping a plus 29% from the prior year. However, U.S. same-store sales declined 1% as we lapped a plus 6% from the prior year. While a plus 5 on a 2-year stack is ahead of the category, we expect more out of Taco Bell given the strength of this brand. 
In the current environment, we need to pair innovation with value that clearly resonates with our consumers. For example, our $5 cravings bundle -- deal bundle improved results toward the end of the second quarter. And through the first 5 weeks of the third quarter, same-store sales are positive. 
We believe that the Taco Bell brand is extremely well positioned to exceed (sic) [ succeed ] in a challenging environment. In market research, Taco Bell always ranks as one of the top brands in providing value and innovation to consumers. We plan to leverage this position through the balance of 2016 and going forward. 
Furthermore, we remain on plan with new-unit development for the year. We are accelerating international new unit openings and are excited to see momentum behind this strategic objective. While it is early days, we believe this could be a meaningful driver of long-term growth and look forward to continued progress. 
Now before I turn it over to David Gibbs, I just wanted to share with you some of the highlights from our recent biennial franchise convention that was held this year in Las Vegas. I think it's fair to say our franchisees are extremely bullish about the transformation we are undergoing at Yum!, as evidenced by our record 1,100 attendees, representing over 100 countries, including numerous participants from our China division. This showcased the power of Yum! at its finest, as we brought all 3 brands together to build and share know-how on development advertising, innovation, value and digital. We are on a clear path to become a world-class franchisor and an even sharper brand builder. 
So as I've said, 2016 is truly a transformational year for Yum!. We're confident we'll deliver at least 14% core operating profit growth, and I'm pleased with the momentum in our China business as we near completion of the China separation. The Yum! China team is excited to reap the benefits of a continued growth in the consuming class. And as an independent company, Yum! China will continue to unlock massive growth opportunities while further capitalizing on what remains the #1 retail opportunity in the world. 
At new Yum!, I couldn't be more excited about the plans we have to become an even more unique and more powerful world-class franchisor. We will not undergo an evolution from Yum! as you know it, but instead another transformation, as we increase our franchise mix to at least 96% by the end of 2017 and sharpen our focus on 4 key areas: brand building, franchisee capability, market and asset development and our unique culture. We will make all decisions based on this construct. We will transform our mindset from equity-led to franchise-led and commit to a cost structure that enables us to build on these pillars. And I look forward to sharing additional details of this transformed vision for new Yum! at our Investor Conference in October. 
And with that, I'll hand it over to David Gibbs."

In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: our second quarter operating results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our recapitalization and the separation of our China business. Let's start with a high-leve",1587,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: our second quarter operating results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our recapitalization and the separation of our China business. 
Let's start with a high-level overview of our second quarter performance. Yum! Brands delivered core operating profit growth of 7% in the quarter. Our China division reported flat same-store sales growth despite it being our toughest compare of the year. As Greg said, we are pleased with the progress we are making in China and with sales results to date in the third quarter, which is historically the biggest quarter of the year from a profitability standpoint. 
Second quarter core operating profit in our China Division grew 6% and was impacted, as expected, by an additional $14 million in closures and impairment expense versus prior year as well as a $4 million expense related to our RGM convention. These expenses were partially offset by a benefit from recent value-added tax reform in China, which went into effect on May 1 and positively impacted restaurant margins in the second quarter. 
In aggregate, our 3 brand divisions delivered 3% core operating profit growth in the quarter. This was led by 7% growth at Pizza Hut and 6% growth at KFC, partially offset by soft results at Taco Bell. 
Overall, EPS before special items grew 9%, including a 4-point negative impact from foreign currency changes. EPS benefited from a 6% reduction in our diluted share count compared to our second quarter last year due to our significant share buybacks over the past 12 months. 
Now I'd like to discuss our 2016 outlook. Given our strong first-half performance and current trends in China, we are raising our core operating profit growth forecast for Yum! from 12% to at least 14%, including the 53rd week. We started the year by saying that we expected Yum! core operating profit growth of at least 10%. Outside of China, our 3 brand divisions remain on track to deliver results consistent with our initial targets. Therefore, the increase in Yum!'s 2016 guidance is essentially due to upside in China, including strong year-to-date KFC sales, margin and profit growth; and a balance of the year that will be aided by the VAT change; partially offset by a return to commodity inflation and higher labor costs. 
As you might recall, last quarter, we walked through the pending changes to China's retail tax structure, which became effective May 1. As a reminder, under this reform, a 6% output VAT replaces a 5% business tax currently applied to certain restaurant sales. Input VAT is creditable to the aforementioned 6% output VAT. We believe this change will have a material benefit to Yum! China restaurant margins for the balance of the year. However, the scale and nature of the policy, along with implementation and transition challenges, make it very difficult to pinpoint the exact magnitude of the impact. 
While we won't provide any further detail on VAT today, we expect to be able to provide more clarity on our third quarter call after we have a full quarter of results behind us. I want to point out that for the balance of the year, we do expect labor and commodity inflation to partially offset this benefit. With this and our first half outperformance in mind, our current guidance for full year China restaurant margins is now at least 17% versus 16% previously. 
Outside of China, our 3 brand divisions remain on track to deliver results consistent with our initial 2016 targets. We expect any potential softness in topline performance to be offset by a favorable commodities environment. That being said, we're confident in our plans to drive sales improvement balance of year and are encouraged with our positive results, third quarter to date, at Taco Bell. 
On the development front, we added over 370 new units globally in the second quarter, taking our year-to-date global new restaurant openings to over 650 units. Consistent with prior years, development will be weighted more towards the second half, as we expect to accelerate our pace of development balance of year, further laying the groundwork for future growth. 
In China, we have increased our focus on refurbishing and remodeling stores this year, and we believe the momentum that we are seeing in the business today can be partially attributed to this investment in improving the guest experience. In fact, we are reallocating our capital to increase our pace of remodels to nearly 800 in 2016, up from our previous target of 550. At the same time, we're reducing both our gross and net new unit numbers for the year by around 50 to 100 openings versus our original expectations. This is primarily due to fewer new Pizza Hut Casual Dining units this year. 
But to be clear, our confidence level in the long-term growth prospects of our brands in China remains undiminished. Also keep in mind, as a division, we expect about 100 fewer closures in 2016 than we had last year, and we continue to get cash paybacks for new KFC and Pizza Hut units in the 3- to 4-year range, both great signs of the underlying strength in the business model and the potential for future expansion. 
And finally, outside of China. For the full year, we expect another strong year of development, with total gross openings of nearly 1,800 units. 
Turning now to foreign exchange. Given the recent vote by the U.K. to exit the EU, I want to remind investors that one of the many great benefits of Yum! is our global and therefore diversified presence. In 2015, approximately 6% of our operating profit was generated from the U.K. and approximately 2% from the remaining euro zone. That being said, with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most of the world's other major foreign currencies, at current forward rates, currency translation is now estimated to negatively impact balance of the year operating profit by about $50 million, which represents an increase of $10 million versus our initial expectations. 
As always, please take this as directional guidance only, as rates will inevitably change as we move throughout the year. In addition, keep in mind this does not impact our core operating profit growth forecast of at least 14%, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation. 
Now I'd like to provide you with an update on our refranchising targets. As you know, in connection with the China separation, we've committed to become at least 96% franchised by the end of 2017. In the past 4 quarters, we've refranchised over 300 restaurants outside of China, including 82 units in the second quarter. 
Refranchising will, simply put, improve our business model. Proceeds from refranchising enable us to return significant amounts of cash to our shareholders while creating an even larger and more stable stream of franchise fees. It also produces immediate G&A savings, as field-level employees are typically absorbed into our franchise system. That being said, we realize there are additional opportunities to operate more efficiently and look forward to sharing more detailed plans around our ongoing refranchising strategy and G&A roadmap at our Investor Conference on October 11. 
Now I'd like to quickly update you on our spinoff plans. We remain on track to complete the spinoff with a targeted completion date around October 31. We filed our initial Form 10 on May 3 and filed an amendment earlier this week. Our comprehensive global roadshows will follow our investor conference. 
In conjunction with our spinoff, we are also optimizing the capital structure of Yum!. To this end, I'm very pleased to report the successful completion of our planned recapitalization in June. In aggregate, we closed on $6.9 billion of new debt, consisting of a $2.3 billion financing facility, securitizing our Taco Bell U.S. royalties; a $2.5 billion senior secured credit facility and a $2.1 billion of high-yield notes. 
With the completion of our recapitalization, today, we have approximately $9 billion in debt outstanding at an attractive blended interest rate of less than 5%. This marks yet another milestone in our previously communicated commitment to return $6.2 billion of capital, excluding ongoing dividend payments, to shareholders. 
In fact, since we announced in October 2015 our intention to separate the China business, we have repurchased 3.3 billion of shares, which equates to 42.9 million -- $3.3 billion of shares, which equate to 42.9 million shares at an average price of $76. We continue to believe that our stock represents a good value at current prices. But make no mistake, this is just the beginning, as we target an additional $3.5 billion in capital return across 2017 and 2018. This will take our total capital returned program, including dividends, to $10 billion over about a 3-year period and further demonstrates our commitment to delivering meaningful cash returns to our shareholders. 
So let me wrap things up. We're confident we'll deliver at least 14% core operating profit growth for the full year, and we're proceeding as expected with the separation of our China business. Our brand businesses are performing, in the aggregate, in line with our initial expectations, and I'm pleased with the progress we're making in China as it approaches its first day as an independent company. 
As Greg said, 2016 is truly a transformational year for Yum!. We look forward to sharing additional details with you at our New York Investor Conference in October. 
And with that, the team and I are happy to take your questions."

So we will still build -- we will be the leading developer of casual dining restaurants by far in China, but we paused for a bit. And I think we are encouraged by the trend that we are seeing currently. When same-store sales come back to positive territory, then we will re-step up the build rate of Pizza Hut Casual Dining. As far as refurbishment is concerned, that is applicable to both our brands. And it was our judgment that it was very important to improve the customer experience and also to be able to bring our estate in line with retail in China, which has been modernizing in general very rapidly. So we've -- as David Gibbs mentioned in his comments, we increased the remodel rate across both brands. And in aggregate, that should be about 800 this year. So we've effectively, in the last 18 months, doubled our rate of refurbishment to bring the estate to acceptable levels. So it's not as though we're reinvesting only in Pizza Hut, we are reinvesting in both the brands. I hope that answers your question."

We've got a little heavier weighting on Pizza Hut Home Service, and our new unit development is a little bit heavier weighted towards Tier 3 through 6. In fact, the majority of the development occurs there. While some of the stores that we're closing are a little heavier weighted towards Tiers 1 and 2. When you add up all of those smaller points, you get to a little bit of a drag on new unit volumes.

And I think in general term, the answer is no. We continue to build aggressively. The brand mix changed a bit. And as David mentioned, we did build Pizza Hut Home Service restaurants, which tend to be lower volume. And KFC had slowed a little bit because of the 2 years of difficulty in sales. We fully expect KFC development this year to be ahead of our original plans. And in general terms, we see the efficiency and delivery from new units as being just as good as it has been in the past. In general terms, our focus at the moment is to raise traffic and sales in all our stores, and that's one of the reasons we moderated new unit build this year.

Well, if I take the Pizza Hut Casual Dining, I think is in a much better position with regards to the consumer proposition than it was, even I would say, 3 months ago. The positioning of the brand is quite clear. It's been explained and carried forward through the organization. It's an integrated position which covers new product development as well as service, down to uniforms, et cetera. And I think it's resonating well. It's called Love to Share and it's appropriate because, unlike KFC, where most people come in singles or order their meals individually; in Pizza Hut, it's a group that tend to order their meals together. And also as you know, there's a big phenomenon now of sharing the food experience through social media. And all that is working in our favor. On both brands, the emphasis has been to continue our rate of innovation and to continue to give consumers great meals. The differences is that we are doing it in a way that is operationally friendly so that it does not slow speed of service or cause problems with value. In the case of KFC, for example, as Greg mentioned, that includes box meals, which has worked (sic) [ a well ] tried-and-tested formula globally, that offers consumers not 3 but 5 items for a slightly higher price and offers great value. The innovation across all platforms is strong, but the big difference, I think, is that it is not all practical innovation that gives choice without complicating operations at a great deal. Across all dayparts, also we've made significant investments in high-quality coffee machines in both brands and high-quality ice cream machines in the case of KFC to be able to improve our delivery and our quality of product."

But the Taco Bell miss was essentially driven by transactions. But as I said, I'm happy that in the first -- whatever, first 5 or 6 weeks of the third quarter, we're back in positive territory on Taco Bell. So that's a nice change in momentum."

Karen, we -- in general, we had -- as you know, commodities were very favorable in the first half, so we really didn't see any reason to take pricing. We continue to offer bigger meal bundles, and especially buckets, and they offer great value anyway. The net impact of pricing is actually 2, which are all rollover. The rest of it in one shape, way or form is in account of more customers or more food per customer, which are both good news. We have to watch commodity inflation on the back half. At the moment, we feel pretty confident that we can deliver through other productivity initiatives, profit targets without having to take recourse to pricing. But obviously, we remain sensitive to commodity and we will not be stupid about it. But we do want to contain pricing for as long as possible to maintain price stability in the market as well as to continue to offer great value. We are very focused on transaction growth, but we will not do it at the expense of profits to come to that. The way things are at the moment, we feel pretty comfortable that through the year, we do not have to take any further pricing.

We are very keen to hold that for a period, but we don't see any reason to lift up the transactions any further. I don't think it'll get helped particularly by pricing. We are, however, doing more and more effective marketing activity through digital media, et cetera, which is a complicated topic, but we're getting higher and higher efficiencies that's allowing us to target specific consumers that will allow us to drive traffic to our stores and develop sales satisfactorily.

I think, as we've said earlier, there is a, I'll call it a malaise in the U.S. is probably the best way to describe it. I think there was an interesting report out yesterday that, I think, 75% of people age 18 to 30 believe that the U.S. is either falling behind or failing as a nation according to a GenForward survey. So that's not particularly good news from just what are people thinking. As I said earlier, we believe that in the U.S., the market on a trailing 13 is about minus 1 in transactions, probably plus 1 in sales. As I said, I think the good news is we have started the third quarter stronger than we finished -- than we have in the second quarter. I think what it means is, for brands like Taco Bell, we've got to make sure that we get our communication really tight and focused. I'm not [ph] necessarily believe it means we have to drop our prices any more. I think what we've got to do is do a better job of communicating our value. And we also have to remember that the Taco Bell brand always responds to incredible breakthrough innovation. So I think you'll see more of that coming from Taco Bell. I have to give the KFC U.S. team credit. I think the George Hamilton as the new Colonel behind the Extra Crispy is brilliant, and that is having a positive impact on our sales momentum at KFC in the U.S. right now. So we've gone back to our core product. We haven't had to discount. We've obviously wrapped it around $20 buckets and $5 boxes, but we've just done a much better job of breaking through with the communication. And then I think on Pizza Hut, we will -- we've announced that we're moving to a new agency. We will get to a new campaign some time before the end of the year. And I think the Pizza Hut team would agree we can do better job of communicating both better and easy. So I'm positive about what's happening now and I'm positive about what the guys are working on. And as I've said, kudos to the KFC team, who I think have taken a core product and demonstrated you can deliver above category growth by making sure you really have breakthrough communication. So better communication, making sure we've got the right price points, making sure we've got breakthrough innovation. I think that's -- I know that's what the 3 U.S. brands are focused on. I'm encouraged by what I'm seeing and I'm encouraged by the momentum we have going into the third quarter. 
So what I'd like to do, I think, just -- is just to quickly wrap up. 
So first of all, I want to thank you all for being on the call. We really appreciate it. Pretty much, my last answer probably sums up a lot of it, which was we're encouraged by the progress we're making, particularly in those businesses that we've been focused on, which is both Pizza Hut and KFC in China as well as KFC and Pizza Hut in the U.S. As I said, we're off to a good start in the third quarter in both China and the U.S. And all of us -- and particularly, I am looking forward to catching up with everyone at the Investor Conference in New York on October 11.

Brands delivered third quarter core operating profit growth of 11% and EPS growth, excluding special items, of 9%. For 2016, we are raising our core operating profit growth guidance from at least 14% to at least 15% owing to continued strength in our business outside of China and solid profitability in China despite sales headwinds, which I'll discuss shortly.
Today, I'll give you an overview of each of our operating divisions, and then David Gibbs, our President and CFO, will walk you through the financials. After that, the team and I, including Micky Pant, the CEO of Yum! China and Ted CFO of Yum! China, will be happy to take any questions you might have. For those of you don't know Ted, he joined the Yum! China team in August. He's been with Yum! for the last 7 years and served as CFO of KFC Australia and New Zealand and most recently as the General Manager of our KFC Asia business outside of China. Ted brings significant financial and operational expertise to make this leadership team as they prepare for the separation.
Now let's begin today with China. As we mentioned in our second quarter call, we were pleased with the results we saw through the first 6 weeks of Q3 as sales were ahead of our plan. However, [indiscernible] in the second half of the third quarter, which we built into the forecast, were compounded by international court ruling regarding claim to sovereignty over the South China Sea. The ruling triggered a series of protests and boycotts intensified by social media against a few international companies with well-known Western brands. At its peak, the demonstration significantly impacted store traffic in certain trade zones, and this was during our busiest season.
The impact to our sales was sudden, and while difficult to pinpoint the exact magnitude of the impact on the quarter, our best estimate is there was a 400 to 500 basis points impact to the division's same-store sales in the quarter.
Most importantly, as we got further away from the incident in July, sales improved. Fourth quarter, which began in September, have seen improvement continue with quarter-to-date sales down modestly. We're encouraged by recent trends [indiscernible] the important holiday, which is currently ongoing, and optimistic about a strong product and promotional calendar for the balance of the quarter, which Micky will discuss. Given these trends in the business, we expect same-store sales to be positive for the balance of the quarter.
In spite of the external headwind, the team was able to execute well and manage costs, resulting in solid profitability, with core operating profit up 14%. It is unfortunate that something outside of our control impacted our sales. But thanks to solid execution, it appears to be mostly behind us at this point, and we are moving forward with excitement about the balance of the year with confidence in the long-term potential of this business.
As we prepare to separate the China business, there is a lot to be excited about. First, the strategic partnership we previously announced with Primavera and Ant Financial is a tremendous asset and competitive advantage. Both are well respected Chinese institutions that are ideal partners for Yum! China as a stand-alone public company operating in China.
Second, we are the undisputed category leader in digital engagement. We are building the world's greatest loyalty program with a large and growing database to help us drive future sales.
Our mobile payment has doubled from 10% to 20% of sales over the last year, and with Ant Financial's Alipay, will continue to grow.
Third, delivery. We currently offer delivery for more than 4,000 units across China. This is an unmatched and growing platform that affords further growth opportunities. 
And finally, idea sharing. As we get closer to separation, what is ironic is Yum! and the China Division have never been closer from a know-how and idea sharing perspective. And this will continue post separation. You'll hear a lot more about all of this next week.
Now on to our 3 brand divisions. Excited to say we're on track to deliver another year of strong operating profit growth, which is a testament of the talent and capabilities within the global team. For the third quarter, we are very pleased that, in aggregate, our business outside of China produced 11% growth core operating profit growth ahead of our expectations. And what has been an overall sluggish environment for the QSR category, particularly in the United States, 2 of our 3 brands have been delivering solid results and has continued to do so into the fourth quarter thus far.
Our KFC division excelled. Same-store sales grew 4% in the third quarter, or 7% on a 2-year stack. Core operating profit grew 19% in the quarter, and the division opened 138 new international restaurants in 42 countries. 70% of our new international openings were in emerging markets.
System sales on international developed markets grew 4% and international emerging markets grew 12%. This brand continued to perform in nearly every market globally, with particular strength in Russia, Continental Europe and Africa this quarter. And we remain on track to open at least 475 net new international units this year, and the U.S. is full steam ahead on its remodel program.
In particular, I'm pleased with the third quarter results out of the U.S., which were driven by the Extra Crispy campaign. We continue to gain traction with our strategy here, and our 6% same-store sales growth lapped 2% growth in the prior year. 2-year comps of plus 8 in the quarter are category leading, and this is our ninth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth in the U.S. and speaks to the importance of an online franchise system and strong marketing adhering to core innovation and value.
The KFC U.S. team, in partnership with the franchisees, have really turned this brand around in the last 2 [ph] years and the brands continued strengthening in a sluggish QSR market is commendable. This achievement in the U.S. gives me confidence in continued global success as we share best practices across the system.
Pizza Hut system sales in constant currency were flat, and same-store sales declined 1% in the third quarter. The U.S. market was influenced by unsuccessful promotion and the competitive environment. As we saw earlier this year, we know the brand can be formed when the right product is combined with compelling value and the messaging is distinctive and disruptive. And I am confident in our ability to turn around the Pizza Hut U.S. business. We believe the fundamentals are being put in place. And now execution is the focus.
Our international business of Pizza Hut saw system sales growth of 3% in constant currency and flat same-store sales growth in the quarter. Across our international markets, we are leveraging a wealth of proven ownable value to address specific consumer needs and rolling them out rapidly from one market to another.
In Thailand, for example, we took a bold approach to value, leveraging and any construct in tandem with significant product and operations improvements and have seen double-digit sales and transaction growth since launch.
Other markets now taking learnings from the significant turnaround. This traction gives us confidence that the international Pizza Hut turnaround is underway.
Finally, I'm very pleased with Taco Bell's strong performance in the third quarter. Core operating profit grew 9%. U.S. same-store sales grew 3%, even as we lapped a plus 4% from the prior year. This included 1 percentage point of growth in transactions, or over 2 percentage points better than the industry. Our strategy of bracketing value with the $1.49 steak flatbread sandwiches and $5 boxes, which provided abundant value, allow us to grow transactions and boost check.
Furthermore, we saw impressive results with our breakfast offering in the quarter as transactions grew 14%, driven by our $1 breakfast menus. We're now taking the learnings from the success and promoting our all-day dollar menus. It all goes to show that when you remain committed to the core and value, the results follow. 
In addition to being a clear leader in offering low prices, we are now leading the category in good value for money.
As for Taco Bell development, we remain on plan with at least 300 new restaurant openings for the year. Taco Bell international is an area of enviable growth potential, and we are excited to see the momentum behind the strategic objective. While it's early days, we believe it is to be a meaningful driver of long-term growth and look forward to continued progress.
So 2016 marks the beginning of a massive transformation for Yum!, a transformation that has been years in the making. The first step is the October 31 separation of the China business. This business began with the first KFC in Beijing nearly 30 years ago and has grown to over 7,000 restaurants in over 1,100 cities. Today, it is one of China's largest employers with over 400,000 employees serving over 2 billion customers every year. In short, this business is our powerhouse with unrivaled growth opportunities in the world's fastest-growing major economy.
As we announced on September 2, investments with Primavera Capital Group and Ant financial bring strategic value and additional local and digital knowhow immediately and over the long term.
In addition, on September 15, we announced a world-class Board of Directors for Yum! China, with Doctor Fred, Chairman and Founder of Primavera Capital Group, to serve as nonexecutive Chairman. I have the utmost confidence that this board will offer the market insights and strategic vision required to enable Yum! China to reach its full potential.
Including the Primavera investment, Yum! China will have a very strong financial foundation, over $900 million of cash and no external debt on the balance sheet at spin. I couldn't be more optimistic about the future of this business or the great foundation that is now in place for them to begin their journey as an independent company. And I look forward to watching them succeed for many years to come.
So in conclusion. At new Yum!, the massive transformation will continue as we become a unique and focused world-class franchisor. Following the separation, we'll be roughly 93% franchised, with a clear path to reach our stated goal of becoming at least 96% franchised by the end of 2017.
We have given a great deal of thought towards creating a high-growth, asset-light efficient company best positioned for accelerating growth in global system sales, operating profits and cash flow. And we're excited to share more details behind our thinking here next Tuesday, so stay tuned.

In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: our third quarter operating results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our recapitalization and the separation of our China business.Let's start with a high-level",1419,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: our third quarter operating results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our recapitalization and the separation of our China business.
Let's start with a high-level overview of our third quarter performance. We're pleased Yum! Brands delivered year-over-year core operating profit growth of 11% in the quarter. In aggregate, our 3 brand divisions, excluding China, delivered 11% core operating profit growth in the quarter, led by 19% growth at KFC, partially offset by soft results at Pizza Hut. This growth is especially impressive given how competitive and sluggish the QSR category has been recently, particularly in the U.S.
Combined, our brands are outperforming the category, and we're pleased to see relative outperformance continuing thus far in the fourth quarter.
In our China Division, core operating profit grew 14% despite a 1% decline in same-store sales. The implementation of the value-added tax and continued tight cost controls materially benefited unit economics and enabled us to offset inflation and sales deleverage, primarily resulting from the South China Sea ruling. As Greg mentioned, tougher back-of-quarter laps were compounded by the incident. While it is very difficult to be precise given all the moving pieces in our China business right now, our best estimate is this had a 400 to 500 basis points impact to our same-store sales in the quarter. 
It was most sever in July, primarily affecting our stores in lower-tier cities where the protests were more intense. The impact continued to dissipate and sales have recovered off their lows.
Over all, for the quarter, EPS before special items grew 9%, including a 6-point negative impact from foreign currency changes.
Now I'd like to discuss our 2016 outlook. As Greg mentioned, we're raising our 2016 full year core operating profit growth guidance to at least 15% from at least 14%, including the 53rd week. This increase is supported by strength in our overall business outside China and healthy profitability in China despite temporary sales headwinds as we discussed.
As expected, third quarter margins in the China Division benefited due in part to the diligent effort across our entire China team in implementing the new VAT. In each of the last 2 quarters, we highlighted the change in the China's retail tax structure, which became effective on May 1. The benefit to our business continues to fluctuate from month to month as we refine our ability to get input credits and as the interpretation of the new tax code becomes clear.
As a result, we will not provide precise guidance for the future benefit of this tax change other than to say that we expect it to be worth at least 2 points of margin upside on a go-forward basis.
We still expect full year China restaurant margins of at least 17%.
This reflects the ongoing benefit of the VAT, offset by labor and commodity inflation as well as our investment [indiscernible] into generating sales.
Now let's talk about development. Yum! remains one of the leading global retail developers. In the third quarter, we added over 475 total new units, taking our year-to-date global new restaurant openings to nearly 1,150 units. Consistent with prior years, development will be weighted more towards the fourth quarter as we expect to accelerate our pace of development balance of the year, further laying the groundwork for future growth. For the full year, we expect China to add about 525 gross new units, and for new Yum! Brands, to add over 2,175 units, which will continue to include China.
With regards to refranchising, we've committed to becoming at least 96% franchised by the end of 2017. Once we finalize the separation of our China business, we will be 93% franchised. Over the last 4 quarters, we refranchised nearly 470 restaurants. In the third quarter specifically, we refranchised 94 stores, 48 of which were Pizza Hut restaurants. Refranchising allows us to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders while reducing G&A expenditure as field-level employees are typically absorbed into our franchisee's system. We look forward to sharing our strategy for improving overall efficiency at Yum! with you next week.
One housekeeping item. Unallocated corporate G&A in the quarter, excluding special items, was $44 million, with the increase versus last year largely due to timing. For the full year, we expect this to come in closer to $205 million, excluding special items.
Now I'd like to talk about our capital structure. In connection with the pending separation of our China business, we are optimizing the capital structure of Yum!. We closed the previously announced $2.5 billion new senior secured credit facilities and $2.1 billion senior unsecured notes offering on June 16, which was 5 days into our third quarter.
As a result, we have total debt outstanding of $9.2 billion. Our intention is to maintain leverage equal to about 5x EBITDA at new Yum, while Yum! China should have over $900 million in cash and no external debt at separation.
In the quarter, we also swapped a portion of our floating rate debt to fixed, resulting in about 90% of our debt fixed for a total current blended rate of 4.75%.
With this in mind, we expect interest expense of about $300 million in 2016.
We're fully committed to returning cash to shareholders. Last December at our analyst and investor day, we committed to returning approximately $6.2 billion of capital, excluding our ongoing dividend payments between separation announcement and completion, which assumed a year-end 2016 separation of our China Division.
In connection with this, we have repurchased approximately 5.3 billion shares at an average price of $81, reducing our share count by approximately 15% as of October 4. We plan to return the remainder of our previously committed $6.2 billion of capital before year-end. Including our recently increased quarterly dividend, we have returned $5.2 billion to shareholders year-to-date.
Now I'd like to quickly update you on our China separation plans. We are on track to complete the separation after the close of business on October 31. On September 23, the board approved the separation of our China business via a dividend distribution of 1 share of Yum! China common stock per each share of Yum! Brands common stock held at the close of business on October 19, the record date for the distribution.
We expect to complete the distribution of Yum! China common stock to shareholders on October 31.
[indiscernible] issued trading for both Yum! Brands and Yum! China will begin on the NYSE on October 17 and Yum! China will begin trading regularly as an independent company on November 1.
As Greg mentioned, we were pleased with the announced investment in Yum! China by Primavera Capital and Ant Financial. They will make a $460 million strategic investment, reflecting an 8% discount to the volume weighted average trading price in days 31 through 60, following the separation of Yum! China. Additionally, they will receive 2 warrant tranches, representing approximately 2% of equity value in each tranche, with stock prices equating to Yum! China equity values of $12 billion and $15 billion.
This is an attractive structure for shareholders as it minimizes upfront dilution and highlights the long-term value in Yum! China as an investment.
More importantly, we are thrilled with the strategic partnership and the benefits this offers Yum! China. Both Primavera and Ant Financial are well-respected Chinese institutions that are ideal partners. Doctor Fred, who leads Primavera, will become the nonexecutive Chairman of Yum! China, and Ant Financial will have an observant seat. Given the value these ideal partnerships will bring to the table, we believe Yum! China is set up for success immediately and over the long term.
So to wrap things up, we have an exogenous and temporary [indiscernible] in China sales mid-quarter, but we're able to hold the line on operating profit in China. And with the strong performance of the brands outside of China, in aggregate, we have line of sight to at least 15% core operating profit growth for the full year.
As Greg said, 2016 is a truly transformational year for Yum!. We're nearing completion of the separation of our China business and had secured strong strategic partners. We've enhanced our capital structure and we've made progress on the franchising. We look forward to sharing additional details on these matters and more with you at our New York investor conference next Tuesday.
And with that, the team and I are happy to take your questions. Operator?"

And the second point is, is there an opportunity to make up some of that top line gap with faster unit growth?

So trust me, we are very disappointed with the negative comps number. But this was very unusual. The first half of the year, we were trending very nicely. In fact, the third quarter -- the second quarter of this year was the fourth straight quarter of same-store sales growth. And in Q3, we were trending to the middle of the quarter very strongly. And then right around the 13th of July, this matter started. And we saw very sharp and sudden decline in sales. The good news was that thereafter the recovery started almost immediately within 10 days or so, but it did have impact. Two things. Firstly, unlike the food safety incidents, [indiscernible] conducted that there's been no damage or whatever to the brand. Trends continue to improve. And I think the other point, which was mentioned by both Greg and David, the spin-off, coupled with the 2 very strong strategic partners, we have very deep respect in China, I think is going to help us in the longer term in issues with matters like this. I think if you're at the 11th of October, Tuesday, Investor meeting in New York, we'll give you more comfort as to why we feel that we can grow into the future. But [indiscernible] this incident, we have comp growth in Q3. And we're expecting from this point onwards to the rest of the year to get back to growth. As far as new unit development is concerned, I think for the quarter, the impact was -- yes, it was -- I don't see any particular reason why we will not have strong new unit growth. Again, we will share more details on the 11th. This year, as you know, we did take our Pizza Hut dine and bill rate down from last year's 280 to about 150. And that was done -- 150 is still on a base of 1,500 is about 10%. We felt that was a responsible thing to do, and it kept Pizza Hut comps back, which are trending upwards. Once that is done, I think it will go back to a strong growth part. So we don't see really a sort of ongoing decline in China at all."

I put it down to if you think what we are in the quarter, we have Extra Crispy chicken which we have for 40 years and the $5 box and the $20 bucket. I think what demonstrates is when you have distinctive and disruptive positioning and breakthrough advertising with great product quality and very good operations, I think what you'll see is you can get the customer to actually come in more often. So I think that was the KFC story. I'm particularly proud of what the Taco Bell team did, how quickly they reacted to the Q2 minus 1 number to change the calendar for Q3. It's not easy to do. So a huge call out to the Taco Bell team for basically getting it back and 1.49 [ph] flat bread, the crunch wrap which is doing it well and obviously putting it in the $5 box. So I think the answer is we're back to the core, selling core products. They've got distinctive and disruptive advertising and positioning, and I think that's the cornerstones of success."

But after what we've got in the month of November is a winning item that's been tested very well and done with in the past and extended through November, which is the snack platter, which is a good example of how KFC in China is unique in the sense that the snack platter have got 4 parts to it. 3 of them are familiar for people anywhere in the religious french fries, popcorn, chicken and hot wings. The fourth part is squid, fried squid, which is unique to hear. It's done well in the past and [indiscernible] price point of 29, so we feel very good about our November calendar. And then in December, for the first time last year, we started Christmas promotion. Christmas is not a traditional holiday in China. And the response is pretty good.

And with a lot of innovation taken from winning items from around the world. So December, I think, for the December promotions, looks particularly strong.

Brands delivered third quarter core operating profit growth of 11% and EPS growth, excluding special items, of 9%. For 2016, we are raising our core operating profit growth guidance from at least 14% to at least 15%, owing to continued strength in our business outside of China and solid profitability in China despite sales headwinds, which I'll discuss shortly.
Today, I'll give you an overview of each of our operating divisions; and then David Gibbs, our President and CFO, will walk you through the financials. After that, the team and I, including Micky Pant, CEO of Yum! China; and Ted Stedem, CFO of Yum! China, will be happy to take any questions you might have. 
For those of you who don't know Ted, he joined the Yum! China team in August. He's been with Yum! for the last 7 years and served as CFO of KFC Australia and New Zealand and most recently, as the General Manager of our KFC Asia business outside of China. Ted brings significant financial and operational expertise to Micky's leadership team as they prepare for the separation.
Now let's begin today with China. As we mentioned in our second quarter call, we were pleased with the results we saw through the first 6 weeks of Q3 as sales were ahead of our plan. However, tougher laps in the second half of the third quarter, which we built into the forecast, were compounded by an international court ruling regarding claims to sovereignty over the South China Sea. The ruling triggered a series of protests and boycotts intensified by social media against a few international companies with well-known Western brands. At its peak, the demonstration significantly impacted store traffic in certain trade zones, and this was during our busiest season.
The impact to our sales was sudden, and while difficult to pinpoint the exact magnitude of the impact on the quarter, our best estimate is there was a 400 to 500 basis point impact to the division's same-store sales in the quarter.
Most importantly, as we got further away from the incident in July, sales improved. Fourth quarter, which began in September, has seen improvement continue with quarter-to-date sales down modestly. We're encouraged by recent trends through the important Golden Week holiday, which is currently ongoing, and optimistic about a strong product and promotional calendar for the balance of the quarter, which Micky will discuss. Given these trends in the business, we expect same-store sales to be positive for the balance of the quarter.
In spite of the external headwind, the team was able to execute well and manage costs, resulting in solid profitability, with core operating profit up 14%. It is unfortunate that something outside of our control impacted our sales, but thanks to solid execution, it appear to be mostly behind us at this point, and we are moving forward with excitement about the balance of the year with confidence in the long-term potential of this business.
As we prepare to separate the China business, there is a lot to be excited about. First, the strategic partnership we previously announced with Primavera and Ant Financial is a tremendous asset and competitive advantage. Both are well respected Chinese institutions that are ideal partners for Yum! China as a stand-alone public company operating in China.
Second, we are the undisputed category leader in digital engagement. We're building the world's greatest loyalty program with a large and growing database to help us drive future sales.
Our mobile payment has doubled from 10% to 20% of sales over the last year, and with Ant Financial's Alipay, will continue to grow.
Third, delivery. We currently offer delivery from more than 4,000 units across China. This is an unmatched and growing platform that affords further growth opportunities. 
And finally, idea sharing. As we get closer to separation, what is ironic is Yum! and the China Division have never been closer from a knowhow and idea-sharing perspective, and this will continue post separation. You'll hear a lot more about all of this next week.
Now on to our 3 brand divisions, where I'm excited to say we're on track to deliver another year of strong operating profit growth, which is a testament to the talents and capabilities within the global team. For the third quarter, we are very pleased that in aggregate, our business outside of China produced 11% core operating profit growth ahead of our expectations. In what has been an overall sluggish environment for the QSR category, particularly in the United States, 2 of our 3 brands have been delivering solid results and has continued to do so into the fourth quarter thus far.
Our KFC Division excelled. Same-store sales grew 4% in the third quarter or 7% on a 2-year stack. Core operating profit grew 19% in the quarter, and the division opened 138 new international restaurants in 42 countries. 70% of our new international openings were in emerging markets.
System sales in international developed markets grew 4% and international emerging markets grew 12%. This brand continued to perform in nearly every market globally, with particular strength in Russia, Continental Europe and Africa this quarter. And we remain on track to open at least 475 net new international units this year, and the U.S. is full steam ahead on its remodel program.
In particular, I'm pleased with the third quarter results out of the U.S., which were driven by the Extra Crispy campaign. We continue to gain traction with our strategy here, and our 6% same-store sales growth lapped 2% growth in the prior year. 2-year comps of plus 8 in the quarter are category leading, and this is our ninth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth in the U.S. and speaks to the importance of an aligned franchise system and strong marketing adhering to core innovation and value.
The KFC U.S. team, in partnership with the franchisees, have really turned this brand around in the last 2 years, and the brands' continued strengthening in a sluggish QSR market is commendable. This achievement in the U.S. gives me confidence in continued global success as we share best practices across the system.
Pizza Hut system sales in constant currency were flat, and same-store sales declined 1% in the third quarter. The U.S. market was influenced by an unsuccessful promotion and the competitive environment. As we saw earlier this year, we know the brand can perform when the right product is combined with compelling value and the messaging is distinctive and disruptive, and I am confident in our ability to turn around the Pizza Hut U.S. business. We believe the fundamentals are being put in place and now execution is the focus.
Our international business of Pizza Hut saw system sales growth of 3% in constant currency and flat same-store sales growth in the quarter. Across our international markets, we are leveraging a wealth of proven, ownable value bits [ph] to address specific consumer needs and rolling them out rapidly from one market to another.
In Thailand, for example, we took a bold approach to value, leveraging in any construct in tandem with significant product and operations improvements and have seen double-digit sales and transaction growth since launch.
Other markets now taking learnings from this significant turnaround. This traction gives us confidence that the international Pizza Hut turnaround is underway.
Finally, I'm very pleased with Taco Bell's strong performance in the third quarter. Core operating profit grew 9%. U.S. same-store sales grew 3%, even as we lapped a plus 4% from the prior year. This included 1 percentage point of growth in transactions or over 2 percentage points better than the industry. Our strategy of bracketing value with the $1.49 steak flatbread sandwiches and $5 boxes, which provided abundant value, allow us to grow transactions and boost check.
Furthermore, we saw impressive results with our breakfast offering in the quarter as transactions grew 14%, driven by our $1 breakfast menu. We're now taking the learnings from this success in promoting our all-day dollar menu. It all goes to show that when you remain committed to the core and value, the results follow. 
In addition to being a clear leader in offering low prices, we are now the -- leading the category in good value for money.
As for Taco Bell development, we remain on plan with at least 300 new restaurant openings for the year. Taco Bell international is an area of enviable growth potential, and we are excited to see the momentum behind the strategic objective. While it's early days, we believe that it's to be a meaningful driver of long-term growth and look forward to continued progress.
So 2016 marks the beginning of a massive transformation for Yum!, a transformation that has been years in the making. The first step is the October 31 separation of the China business. This business began with the first KFC in Beijing nearly 30 years ago and has grown to over 7,000 restaurants in over 1,100 cities. Today, it is one of China's largest employers with over 400,000 employees serving over 2 billion customers every year. In short, this business is a powerhouse with unrivaled growth opportunities in the world's fastest-growing major economy.
As we announced on September 2, investments with Primavera Capital Group and Ant Financial bring strategic value and additional local and digital knowhow immediately and over the long term.
In addition, on September 15, we announced a world-class Board of Directors for Yum! China, with Dr. Fred Hu, Chairman and Founder of Primavera Capital Group, to serve as Nonexecutive Chairman. I have the utmost confidence that this board will offer the market insights and strategic vision required to enable Yum! China to reach its full potential.
Including the Primavera investment, Yum! China will have a very strong financial foundation, over $900 million of cash and no external debt on the balance sheet at spin. I couldn't be more optimistic about the future of this business or the great foundation that is now in place for them to begin their journey as an independent company, and I look forward to watching them succeed for many years to come.
So in conclusion. At new Yum!, the massive transformation will continue as we become a unique and focused world-class franchisor. Following the separation, we'll be roughly 93% franchised, with a clear path to reach our stated goal of becoming at least 96% franchised by the end of 2017.
We've given a great deal of thought towards creating a high-growth, asset-light efficient company best positioned for accelerating growth in global system sales, operating profits and cash flow. And we're excited to share more details behind our thinking here next Tuesday, so stay tuned.
And with that, gives me pleasure to hand over to David Gibbs."

In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: our third quarter operating results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our recapitalization and the separation of our China business.Let's start with a high-level",1416,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: our third quarter operating results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our recapitalization and the separation of our China business.
Let's start with a high-level overview of our third quarter performance. We're pleased Yum! Brands delivered year-over-year core operating profit growth of 11% in the quarter. In aggregate, our 3 brand divisions, excluding China, delivered 11% core operating profit growth in the quarter, led by 19% growth at KFC, partially offset by soft results at Pizza Hut. This growth is especially impressive given how competitive and sluggish the QSR category has been recently, particularly in the U.S.
Combined, our brands are outperforming the category, and we're pleased to see relative outperformance continuing thus far in the fourth quarter.
In our China Division, core operating profit grew 14% despite a 1% decline in same-store sales. The implementation of a value-added tax and continued tight cost controls materially benefited unit economics and enabled us to offset inflation and sales deleverage primarily resulting from the South China Sea ruling. As Greg mentioned, tougher back-of-quarter laps were compounded by the incident. While it is very difficult to be precise given all the moving pieces in our China business right now, our best estimate is this had a 400 to 500 basis points impact to our same-store sales in the quarter. 
It was most severe in July, primarily affecting our stores in lower-tier cities where the protests were more intense. The impact continued to dissipate and sales have recovered off their lows.
Overall, for the quarter, EPS before special items grew 9%, including a 6-point negative impact from foreign currency changes.
Now I'd like to discuss our 2016 outlook. As Greg mentioned, we're raising our 2016 full year core operating profit growth guidance to at least 15% from at least 14%, including the 53rd week. This increase is supported by strength in our overall business outside China and healthy profitability in China despite temporary sales headwinds as we discussed.
As expected, third quarter margins in the China Division benefited due in part to the diligent effort across our entire China team in implementing the new VAT. In each of the last 2 quarters, we highlighted the change into China's retail tax structure, which became effective on May 1. The benefit to our business continues to fluctuate from month to month as we refine our ability to get input credits and as the interpretation of the new tax code becomes clearer.
As a result, we will not provide precise guidance for the future benefit of this tax change other than to say that we expect it to be worth at least 2 points of margin upside on a go-forward basis.
We still expect full year China restaurant margins of at least 17%.  This reflects the ongoing benefit of the VAT, offset by labor and commodity inflation as well as our investment back into generating sales.
Now let's talk about development. Yum! remains one of the leading global retail developers. In the third quarter, we added over 475 total new units, taking our year-to-date global new restaurant openings to nearly 1,150 units. Consistent with prior years, development will be weighted more towards the fourth quarter as we expect to accelerate our pace of development balance of year, further laying the groundwork for future growth. For the full year, we expect China to add about 525 gross new units, and for new Yum! Brands, to add over 2,175 units, which will continue to include China.
With regards to refranchising, we've committed to becoming at least 96% franchised by the end of 2017. Once we finalize the separation of our China business, we will be 93% franchised. Over the last 4 quarters, we refranchised nearly 470 restaurants. In the third quarter specifically, we refranchised 94 stores, 48 of which were Pizza Hut restaurants. Refranchising allows us to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders while reducing G&A expenditure as field-level employees are typically absorbed into our franchise system. We look forward to sharing our strategy for improving overall efficiency at Yum! with you next week.
One housekeeping item. Unallocated corporate G&A in the quarter, excluding special items, was $44 million, with the increase versus last year largely due to timing. For the full year, we expect this to come in closer to $205 million, excluding special items.
Now I'd like to talk about our capital structure. In connection with the pending separation of our China business, we are optimizing the capital structure of Yum!. We closed the previously announced $2.5 billion new senior secured credit facilities and $2.1 billion senior unsecured notes offering on June 16, which was 5 days into our third quarter.
As a result, we have total debt outstanding of $9.2 billion. Our intention is to maintain leverage equal to about 5x EBITDA at new Yum, while Yum! China should have over $900 million in cash and no external debt at separation.
In the quarter, we also swapped a portion of our floating rate debt to fixed, resulting in about 90% of our debt fixed for a total current blended rate of 4.75%.
With this in mind, we expect interest expense of about $300 million in 2016.
We're fully committed to returning cash to shareholders. Last December at our Analyst and Investor Day, we committed to returning approximately $6.2 billion of capital, excluding our ongoing dividend payments, between separation announcement and completion, which assumed a year-end 2016 separation of our China Division.
In connection with this, we have repurchased approximately 5.3 billion shares at an average price of $81, reducing our share count by approximately 15% as of October 4. We plan to return the remainder of our previously committed $6.2 billion of capital before year-end. Including our recently increased quarterly dividend, we have returned $5.2 billion to shareholders year-to-date.
Now I'd like to quickly update you on our China separation plans. We are on track to complete the separation after the close of business on October 31. On September 23, the board approved the separation of our China business via a dividend distribution of 1 share of Yum! China common stock per each share of Yum! Brands common stock held at the close of business on October 19, the record date for the distribution.
We expect to complete the distribution of Yum! China common stock to shareholders on October 31.
When-issued trading for both Yum! Brands and Yum! China will begin on the NYSE on October 17, and Yum! China will begin trading regular way as an independent company on November 1.
As Greg mentioned, we were pleased with the announced investment in Yum! China by Primavera Capital and Ant Financial. They will make a $460 million strategic investment, reflecting an 8% discount to the volume weighted average trading price in days 31 through 60, following the separation of Yum! China. Additionally, they will receive 2 warrant tranches, representing approximately 2% of equity value in each tranche, with strike prices equating to Yum! China equity values of $12 billion and $15 billion.
This is an attractive structure for shareholders as it minimizes upfront dilution and highlights the long-term value in Yum! China as an investment.
More importantly, we are thrilled with the strategic partnership and the benefits this offers Yum! China. Both Primavera and Ant Financial are well-respected Chinese institutions that are ideal partners. Dr. Fred Hu, who leads Primavera, will become the Nonexecutive Chairman of Yum! China, and Ant Financial will have an observer seat. Given the value these ideal partners will bring to the table, we believe Yum! China is set up for success immediately and over the long term.
So to wrap things up, we have an exogenous and temporary event at China sales mid-quarter, but we're able to hold the line on operating profit in China. And with the strong performance of our brands outside of China in aggregate, we have line of sight to at least 15% core operating profit growth for the full year.
As Greg said, 2016 is a truly transformational year for Yum!. We're nearing completion of the separation of our China business and have secured strong strategic partners. We've enhanced our capital structure, and we've made progress on refranchising. We look forward to sharing additional details on these matters and more with you at our New York Investor Conference next Tuesday.
And with that, the team and I are happy to take your questions. Operator?"

So I guess the question I have is sort of twofold. One is, is there just a higher country risk now? And does that mean that the long-term targets of kind of 4% to 5% maybe are going to be harder to reach? And the second point is, is there an opportunity to make up some of that top line gap with faster unit growth?

So trust me, we are very disappointed with the negative comps number. But this was very unusual. The first half of the year, we were trending very nicely. In fact, third quarter -- second quarter of this year was the fourth straight quarter of same-store sales growth. And in Q3, we were trending through the middle of the quarter very strongly. And then right around the 13th of July, this matter started, and we saw very sharp and sudden decline in sales. The good news was that thereafter, the recovery started almost immediately within 10 days or so, but it did have this impact. Two things. Firstly is that unlike the food safety incidents, research that we've conducted have shown that there's been no damage whatsoever to the brand. Our trends have continued to improve. And I think the other point, which was mentioned in by both Greg and David, the spin-off, coupled with the 2 very strong strategic partners, who are very deep respected in China, I think will help us in the longer term in issues and matters like this. I think if you're at the 11 October, Tuesday, Investor Meeting in New York, we'll give you more comfort as to why we feel that we can grow comps into the future. But had it not been for this incident, we would almost certainly have had comp growth in Q3. And we're expecting from this point onwards to the rest of the year to get back to growth. As far as new unit development is concerned, I think for the quarter, the impact was -- yes, it's --  it -- I don't see any particular reason why we will not have strong new unit growth. Again, we will share more details on the 11th. This year, as you know, we did take our Pizza Hut Dine-In build rate down from last year's 280 to about 150. And that was done -- 150 is still, on a base of 1,500, is about 10%. We felt that was a responsible thing to do, and it kept Pizza Hut comps back, which are trending upwards. And once that is done, I think we'll get back onto a strong growth path. So we don't see really a sort of ongoing decline in our union of build rate [ph] in China at all."

The Taco Bell and KFC businesses are going to be, I think, a little over 80% of new Yum!'s profits after the separation, so it is really nice to see the comp acceleration in the sales of both of those brands, and I guess this is seemingly happened without industry acceleration underneath you. So what was it that changed so quickly in the third quarter for both of these brands to really divert from the industry so dramatically? And how much follow-through does this have going forward, the strategy that drove that?"

Yes, I think that I wouldn't necessarily say it was an abrupt change. I think certainly if you take the U.S., I mean KFC U.S. has just delivered its ninth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth. There's no doubt the plus 6 rolling or the plus 2 and the plus 8. It definitely means we're growing share in the category, which is great. I put it down to -- and if you think what we're in in the quarter, we essentially ran Extra Crispy chicken, which we've had for over 40 years [ph] in the $5 box and $20 bucket. I think what it demonstrates is when you have distinctive and disruptive positioning and breakthrough advertising with great product quality and very good operations, I think what you'll see is you can get the customer to actually come in more often. And so I think that was certainly the KFC story. I was particularly proud of what the Taco Bell team did, how quickly they reacted to the Q2 minus 1 number to change the calendar for Q3. It's not easy to do. So a huge call out to the Taco Bell team for basically getting us back into $1.49 flatbread, the Triple Double Crunchwrap, which did incredibly well and obviously then putting it into $5 box. So I think the answer is we're back to the core, selling great core products. We've got distinctive and disruptive advertising and positioning, and I think that's the cornerstone to success."

We did focus on our core bestsellers, so we did simplify the menu just a little bit, but the core bestsellers, including fried chicken, the Zinger sandwich were dialed up, and that is having a beneficial effect. Our key price points, especially the crucial RMB 29, RMB 39 price points, which are the last 2 price points in this market. And lastly, digital. I think digital has been probably the most significant growth area for us, and our cashless payments have grown from 10% to 20% in a very short period of the time. We expect that to continue as we partner up with people like Alipay to expand it. And our loyalty programs are significant now, so the percentage of transactions that are being scanned at the till for loyalty points is very significant. And overall, spend on digital has become a very large part of our total marketing spend. All this put together is having good results, and we've accordingly geared our calendar for the balance of this year as well as for next year. So both on KFC and Pizza Hut, a considerable attention to core product, key price points and continued in-store execution, and that really is what's working."

But after what we've got in the month of November is a winning item that has been tested very well and done well in the past, extended through November, which is the snack platter, which is a good example of how KFC in China is unique, in the sense that the snack platter have got 4 parts to it. Three of them are familiar to people from anywhere in the world, which is french fries, popcorn, chicken and hot wings. But the fourth part is squid, fried squid, which is quite unique to hear. It's done very well in the past and we've got that at a break-in price point of RMB 29, so we feel very good about our November calendar. And then in December, for the first time last year, we started a Christmas promotion. Christmas is not a traditional holiday in China. And the response is pretty good. So we've taken that to another level this year with covering the entire gamut from low-end meals at RMB 35 to buckets for families at RMB 98 and with a lot of innovation taken from winning items from around the world.

We're very keen to keep the estate current because China architectural standards and especially in the bigger cities have gone up dramatically over the last several years with a lot of international entries, and we have been left behind a little bit. So that has been corrected quite substantially."

I'm just wondering directionally perhaps how you think about the opportunity there with presumably the refranchising. And I assume that there's modest further refranchising from here, but where you think those margins or what gating factors are there on that margin? And another question, Greg, just on Taco Bell, I mean, a very strong result and it sounds like you attribute most of that to product news and more so on the value front. So with that as a backdrop, I'm just wondering whether Taco Bell still aspire for more of that premium push. And why you think the QSR category has been sluggish recently?

I think we're, what, 5 weeks away from the general elections. I think there is just great uncertainty as to what's going to happen in the U.S. in particular as a result of the outcome of the election. It goes without saying that people are sort of trying to decide who to choose and what the impact will be on the economy, and I think people are maybe just hunkering down a little bit. But that said, that's why I think I'm even more pleased with the performance of KFC and Taco Bell in the quarter because despite that uncertainty, those 2 brands, I think, in being incredibly distinctive and disruptive and going back to the core of delivering great experience, just making sure the value was right. Those -- that's how you win, even in a sluggish market. And I think there are lessons that we're also applying around the restaurant [ph].  I mean, KFC outside the U.S. had just a game-buster quarter, probably with the exception of Japan, developed markets, developing markets. You can ask me any country, and I'll show you incredible sales growth. So I think the global growth of the KFC brand and the momentum it has and the strength that we've now got in the U.S. sets that up for particular strength. Taco Bell, as I said, across all the facets you want a brand to be strong at, is just tearing ahead. And I think once we get through the election and then that uncertainty is removed, hopefully, the market will find some momentum. But I'm really confident that our brands can grow in either strong markets or markets that don't have the momentum we'd love to have."

And value isn't just what you pay, it's what you get. And I think if you look at what's in the box or if you look at now the Sony promotion we're doing right now, which from a millennial point of view is an incredibly attractive promotional offer. And I know the Sony box, the team is very happy with the performance of the Sony box as we get into the fourth quarter, which is why we said we have momentum.

Brands delivered third quarter core operating profit growth of 11% and EPS growth, excluding special items, of 9%. For 2016, we are raising our core operating profit growth guidance from at least 14% to at least 15%, owing to continued strength in our business outside of China and solid profitability in China despite sales headwinds, which I'll discuss shortly.
Today, I'll give you an overview of each of our operating divisions; and then David Gibbs, our President and CFO, will walk you through the financials. After that, the team and I, including Micky Pant, CEO of Yum! China; and Ted Stedem, CFO of Yum! China, will be happy to take any questions you might have. 
For those of you who don't know Ted, he joined the Yum! China team in August. He's been with Yum! for the last 7 years and served as CFO of KFC Australia and New Zealand and most recently, as the General Manager of our KFC Asia business outside of China. Ted brings significant financial and operational expertise to Micky's leadership team as they prepare for the separation.
Now let's begin today with China. As we mentioned in our second quarter call, we were pleased with the results we saw through the first 6 weeks of Q3 as sales were ahead of our plan. However, tougher laps in the second half of the third quarter, which we built into the forecast, were compounded by an international court ruling regarding claims to sovereignty over the South China Sea. The ruling triggered a series of protests and boycotts intensified by social media against a few international companies with well-known Western brands. At its peak, the demonstration significantly impacted store traffic in certain trade zones, and this was during our busiest season.
The impact to our sales was sudden, and while difficult to pinpoint the exact magnitude of the impact on the quarter, our best estimate is there was a 400 to 500 basis point impact to the division's same-store sales in the quarter.
Most importantly, as we got further away from the incident in July, sales improved. Fourth quarter, which began in September, has seen improvement continue with quarter-to-date sales down modestly. We're encouraged by recent trends through the important Golden Week holiday, which is currently ongoing, and optimistic about a strong product and promotional calendar for the balance of the quarter, which Micky will discuss. Given these trends in the business, we expect same-store sales to be positive for the balance of the quarter.
In spite of the external headwind, the team was able to execute well and manage costs, resulting in solid profitability with core operating profit up 14%. It is unfortunate that something outside of our control impacted our sales, but thanks to solid execution, it appears to be mostly behind us at this point, and we are moving forward with excitement about the balance of the year with confidence in the long-term potential of this business.
As we prepare to separate the China business, there's a lot to be excited about. First, the strategic partnership we previously announced with Primavera and Ant Financial is a tremendous asset and competitive advantage. Both are well-respected Chinese institutions that are ideal partners for Yum! China as a stand-alone public company operating in China.
Second, we are the undisputed category leader in digital engagement. We're building the world's greatest loyalty program with a large and growing database to help us drive future sales.
Our mobile payment has doubled from 10% to 20% of sales over the last year and, with Ant Financial's Alipay, will continue to grow.
Third, delivery. We currently offer delivery from more than 4,000 units across China. This is an unmatched and growing platform that affords further growth opportunities. 
And finally, idea sharing. As we get closer to separation, what is ironic is Yum! and the China Division have never been closer from a knowhow and idea-sharing perspective, and this will continue post-separation. You'll hear a lot more about all of this next week.
Now on to our 3 brand divisions, where I'm excited to say we are on track to deliver another year of strong operating profit growth, which is a testament to the talents and capabilities within the global team. For the third quarter, we are very pleased that, in aggregate, our business outside of China produced 11% core operating profit growth ahead of our expectations. In what has been an overall sluggish environment for the QSR category, particularly in the United States, 2 of our 3 brands have been delivering solid results and has continued to do so into the fourth quarter thus far.
Our KFC Division excelled. Same-store sales grew 4% in the third quarter or 7% on a 2-year stack. Core operating profit grew 19% in the quarter, and the division opened 138 new international restaurants in 42 countries. 70% of our new international openings were in emerging markets.
System sales in international developed markets grew 4% and international emerging markets grew 12%. This brand continues to perform in nearly every market globally, with particular strength in Russia, Continental Europe and Africa this quarter. And we remain on track to open at least 475 net new international units this year, and the U.S. is full steam ahead on its remodel program.
In particular, I'm pleased with the third quarter results out of the U.S., which were driven by the Extra Crispy campaign. We continue to gain traction with our strategy here, and our 6% same-store sales growth lapped 2% growth in the prior year. 2-year comps of plus 8 in the quarter are category leading, and this is our ninth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth in the U.S. and speaks to the importance of an aligned franchise system and strong marketing adhering to core innovation and value.
The KFC U.S. team, in partnership with the franchisees, have really turned this brand around in the last 2 years, and the brands' continued strength in a sluggish QSR market is commendable. This achievement in the U.S. gives me confidence in continued global success as we share best practices across the system.
Pizza Hut system sales in constant currency were flat, and same-store sales declined 1% in the third quarter. The U.S. market was influenced by an unsuccessful promotion and the competitive environment. As we saw earlier this year, we know the brand can perform when the right product is combined with compelling value and the messaging is distinctive and disruptive, and I am confident in our ability to turn around the Pizza Hut U.S. business. We believe the fundamentals are being put in place and now execution is the focus.
Our international business at Pizza Hut saw system sales growth of 3% in constant currency and flat same-store sales growth in the quarter. Across our international markets, we are leveraging a wealth of proven, ownable value base to address specific consumer needs and rolling them out rapidly from one market to another.
In Thailand, for example, we took a bold approach to value, leveraging in any construct in tandem with significant product and operations improvements and have seen double-digit sales and transaction growth since launch.
Other markets now taking learnings from this significant turnaround. This traction gives us confidence that the international Pizza Hut turnaround is underway.
Finally, I'm very pleased with Taco Bell's strong performance in the third quarter. Core operating profit grew 9%. U.S. same-store sales grew 3%, even as we lapped a plus 4% from the prior year. This included 1 percentage point of growth in transactions or over 2 percentage points better than the industry. Our strategy of bracketing value with the $1.49 steak flatbread sandwiches and $5 boxes, which provided abundant value, allow us to grow transactions and boost check.
Furthermore, we saw impressive results with our breakfast offering in the quarter as transactions grew 14% driven by our $1 breakfast menu. We're now taking the learnings from this success in promoting our all-day dollar menu. It all goes to show that when you remain committed to the core and value, the results follow. 
In addition to being a clear leader in offering low prices, we are now the -- leading the category in good value for money.
As for Taco Bell development, we remain on plan with at least 300 new restaurant openings for the year. Taco Bell international is an area of enviable growth potential, and we are excited to see the momentum behind the strategic objective. While it's early days, we believe that it's going to be a meaningful driver of long-term growth and look forward to continued progress.
So 2016 marks the beginning of a massive transformation for Yum!, a transformation that has been years in the making. The first step is the October 31 separation of the China business. This business began with the first KFC in Beijing nearly 30 years ago and has grown to over 7,000 restaurants in over 1,100 cities. Today, it is one of China's largest employers with over 400,000 employees serving over 2 billion customers every year. In short, this business is a powerhouse with unrivaled growth opportunities in the world's fastest-growing major economy.
As we announced on September 2, investments by Primavera Capital Group and Ant Financial bring strategic value and additional local and digital knowhow immediately and over the long term.
In addition, on September 15, we announced a world-class Board of Directors for Yum! China with Dr. Fred Hu, Chairman and Founder of Primavera Capital Group, to serve as Nonexecutive Chairman. I have the utmost confidence that this board will offer the market insights and strategic vision required to enable Yum! China to reach its full potential.
Including the Primavera investment, Yum! China will have a very strong financial foundation, over $900 million of cash and no external debt on the balance sheet at spin. I couldn't be more optimistic about the future of this business or the great foundation that is now in place for them to begin their journey as an independent company, and I look forward to watching them succeed for many years to come.
So in conclusion. At new Yum!, the massive transformation will continue as we become a unique and focused world-class franchisor. Following the separation, we'll be roughly 93% franchised with a clear path to reach our stated goal of becoming at least 96% franchised by the end of 2017.
We've given a great deal of thought towards creating a high-growth, asset-light efficient company best positioned for accelerating growth in global system sales, operating profits and cash flow. And we're excited to share more details behind our thinking here next Tuesday, so stay tuned.
And with that, gives me pleasure to hand over to David Gibbs."

In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: our third quarter operating results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our recapitalization and the separation of our China business.Let's start with a high-level",1416,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: our third quarter operating results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our recapitalization and the separation of our China business.
Let's start with a high-level overview of our third quarter performance. We're pleased Yum! Brands delivered year-over-year core operating profit growth of 11% in the quarter. In aggregate, our 3 brand divisions, excluding China, delivered 11% core operating profit growth in the quarter, led by 19% growth at KFC, partially offset by soft results at Pizza Hut. This growth is especially impressive given how competitive and sluggish the QSR category has been recently, particularly in the U.S.
Combined, our brands are outperforming the category, and we're pleased to see relative outperformance continuing thus far in the fourth quarter.
In our China Division, core operating profit grew 14% despite a 1% decline in same-store sales. The implementation of a value-added tax and continued tight cost controls materially benefited unit economics and enabled us to offset inflation and sales deleverage primarily resulting from the South China Sea ruling. As Greg mentioned, tougher back-of-quarter laps were compounded by the incident. While it is very difficult to be precise given all the moving pieces in our China business right now, our best estimate is this had a 400 to 500 basis point impact to our same-store sales in the quarter. 
It was most severe in July, primarily affecting our stores in lower-tier cities where the protests were more intense. The impact continues to dissipate, and sales have recovered off their lows.
Overall, for the quarter, EPS before special items grew 9%, including a 6 point negative impact from foreign currency changes.
Now I'd like to discuss our 2016 outlook. As Greg mentioned, we're raising our 2016 full year core operating profit growth guidance to at least 15% from at least 14%, including the 53rd week. This increase is supported by strength in our overall business outside China and healthy profitability in China despite temporary sales headwinds as we discussed.
As expected, third quarter margins in the China Division benefited due in part to the diligent effort across our entire China team in implementing the new VAT. In each of the last 2 quarters, we highlighted the change into China's retail tax structure, which became effective on May 1. The benefit to our business continues to fluctuate from month to month as we refine our ability to get input credits and as the interpretation of the new tax code becomes clearer.
As a result, we will not provide precise guidance for the future benefit of this tax change other than to say that we expect it to be worth at least 2 points of margin upside on a go-forward basis.
We still expect full year China restaurant margins of at least 17%. This reflects the ongoing benefit of the VAT, offset by labor and commodity inflation as well as our investment back into generating sales.
Now let's talk about development. Yum! remains one of the leading global retail developers. In the third quarter, we added over 475 total new units, taking our year-to-date global new restaurant openings to nearly 1,150 units. Consistent with prior years, development will be weighted more towards the fourth quarter as we expect to accelerate our pace of development balance of year, further laying the groundwork for future growth. For the full year, we expect China to add about 525 gross new units and for new Yum! Brands to add over 2,175 units, which will continue to include China.
With regards to refranchising, we've committed to becoming at least 96% franchised by the end of 2017. Once we finalize the separation of our China business, we will be 93% franchised. Over the last 4 quarters, we refranchised nearly 470 restaurants. In the third quarter specifically, we refranchised 94 stores, 48 of which were Pizza Hut restaurants. Refranchising allows us to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders while reducing G&A expenditure as field-level employees are typically absorbed into our franchise system. We look forward to sharing our strategy for improving overall efficiency at Yum! with you next week.
One housekeeping item. Unallocated corporate G&A in the quarter, excluding special items, was $44 million with the increase versus last year largely due to timing. For the full year, we expect this to come in closer to $205 million, excluding special items.
Now I'd like to talk about our capital structure. In connection with the pending separation of our China business, we are optimizing the capital structure of Yum!. We closed the previously announced $2.5 billion new senior secured credit facilities and $2.1 billion senior unsecured notes offering on June 16, which was 5 days into our third quarter.
As a result, we have total debt outstanding of $9.2 billion. Our intention is to maintain leverage equal to about 5x EBITDA at new Yum!, while Yum! China should have over $900 million in cash and no external debt at separation.
In the quarter, we also swapped a portion of our floating rate debt to fixed, resulting in about 90% of our debt fixed for a total current blended rate of 4.75%.
With this in mind, we expect interest expense of about $300 million in 2016.
We're fully committed to returning cash to shareholders. Last December at our Analyst and Investor Day, we committed to returning approximately $6.2 billion of capital, excluding our ongoing dividend payments, between separation announcement and completion, which assumed a year-end 2016 separation of our China Division.
In connection with this, we have repurchased approximately 5.3 billion shares at an average price of $81, reducing our share count by approximately 15% as of October 4. We plan to return the remainder of our previously committed $6.2 billion of capital before year-end. Including our recently increased quarterly dividend, we have returned $5.2 billion to shareholders year-to-date.
Now I'd like to quickly update you on our China separation plans. We are on track to complete the separation after the close of business on October 31. On September 23, the board approved the separation of our China business via a dividend distribution of 1 share of Yum! China common stock per each share of Yum! Brands common stock held at the close of business on October 19, the record date for the distribution.
We expect to complete the distribution of Yum! China common stock to shareholders on October 31.
When-issued trading for both Yum! Brands and Yum! China will begin on the NYSE on October 17, and Yum! China will begin trading regular way as an independent company on November 1.
As Greg mentioned, we were pleased with the announced investment in Yum! China by Primavera Capital and Ant Financial. They will make a $460 million strategic investment, reflecting an 8% discount to the volume-weighted average trading price in days 31 through 60 following the separation of Yum! China. Additionally, they will receive 2 warrant tranches, representing approximately 2% of equity value in each tranche with strike prices equating to Yum! China equity values of $12 billion and $15 billion.
This is an attractive structure for shareholders as it minimizes upfront dilution and highlights the long-term value in Yum! China as an investment.
More importantly, we are thrilled with the strategic partnership and the benefits this offers Yum! China. Both Primavera and Ant Financial are well-respected Chinese institutions that are ideal partners. Dr. Fred Hu, who leads Primavera, will become the Nonexecutive Chairman of Yum! China, and Ant Financial will have an observer seat. Given the value these ideal partners will bring to the table, we believe Yum! China is set up for success immediately and over the long term.
So to wrap things up, we had an exogenous and temporary event at China sales mid-quarter but were able to hold the line on operating profit in China. And with the strong performance of our brands outside of China in aggregate, we have line of sight to at least 15% core operating profit growth for the full year.
As Greg said, 2016 is a truly transformational year for Yum!. We're nearing completion of the separation of our China business and have secured strong strategic partners. We've enhanced our capital structure, and we've made progress on refranchising. We look forward to sharing additional details on these matters and more with you at our New York Investor Conference next Tuesday.
And with that, the team and I are happy to take your questions. Operator?"

So I guess the question I have is sort of twofold. One is, is there just a higher country risk now? And does that mean that the long-term targets of kind of 4% to 5% maybe are going to be harder to reach? And the second point is, is there an opportunity to make up some of that top line gap with faster unit growth? Because it looks like unit growth -- gross units is -- has continued to come down a little bit."

So trust me, we are very disappointed with the negative comps number. But this was very unusual. The first half of the year, we were trending very nicely. In fact, third quarter -- second quarter of this year was the fourth straight quarter of same-store sales growth. And in Q3, we were trending through the middle of the quarter very strongly. And then right around the 13th of July, this matter started, and we saw a very sharp and sudden decline in sales. The good news was that, thereafter, the recovery started almost immediately within 10 days or so, but it did have this impact. Two things. Firstly is that unlike a food safety incident, research that we've conducted has shown that there's been no damage whatsoever to the brand. Our trends have continued to improve. And I think the other point, which was mentioned by both Greg and David, the spinoff coupled with the 2 very strong strategic partners, who have very deep respect in China, I think will help us in the longer term in issues and matters like this. I think if you're at the 11 October, Tuesday, Investor Meeting in New York, we'll give you more comfort as to why we feel that we can grow comps into the future. But had it not been for this incident, we would almost certainly have had comp growth in Q3. And we're expecting from this point onwards for the rest of the year to get back to growth. As far as new unit development is concerned, I think for the quarter, I think the impact was -- yes, it's -- it -- I don't see any particular reason why we will not have strong new unit growth. Again, we will share more details on the 11th. This year, as you know, we did take our Pizza Hut Dine-In build rate down from last year's 280 to about 150. And that was done -- 150 is still, on a base of 1,500, is about 10%. We felt that was the responsible thing to do, and it kept Pizza Hut comps back, which are trending upwards. And once that is done, I think we'll get back onto a strong growth path. So we don't see really a sort of ongoing decline in our union of build rate [ph] in China at all."

There's no doubt the plus 6 rolling over plus 2 into plus 8, it definitely means we're growing share in the category, which is great. I put it down to -- and if you think what we're in, in the quarter, we essentially ran Extra Crispy chicken, which we've had for over 40 years in a $5 box and a $20 bucket. I think what it demonstrates is when you have distinctive and disruptive positioning and breakthrough advertising with great product quality and very good operations, I think what you'll see is you can get the customer to actually come in more often. And so I think that was certainly the KFC story. I was particularly proud of what the Taco Bell team did, how quickly they reacted to their Q2 minus 1 number to change the calendar for Q3. It's not easy to do. So a huge call out to the Taco Bell team for basically getting us back into $1.49 flatbread, the Triple Double Crunchwrap, which did incredibly well and obviously then putting it in a $5 box. So I think the answer is we're back to the core, selling great core products. We've got distinctive and disruptive advertising and positioning, and I think that's the cornerstone to success."

We did focus on our core bestsellers, so we did simplify the menu just a little bit, but the core bestsellers, including fried chicken, the Zinger sandwich were dialed up, and that is having a beneficial effect. Our key price points, especially the crucial RMB 29, RMB 39 price points, which are the last 2 price points in this market. And lastly, digital. I think digital has been probably the most significant growth area for us, and our cashless payments have grown from 10% to 20% in a very short period of time. We expect that to continue as we partner up with people like Alipay to expand it. And our loyalty programs are significant now, so the percentage of transactions that are being scanned at the till for loyalty points is very significant. And overall, spend on digital has become a very large part of our total marketing spend. All this put together is having good results, and we've accordingly geared our calendar for the balance of this year as well as for next year. So both on KFC and Pizza Hut, a considerable attention to core product, key price points and continued in-store execution, and that really is what's working."

But after what we've got in the month of November is a winning item that has been tested very well and done well in the past, extended through November, which is the snack platter, which is a good example of how KFC in China is unique in the sense that the snack platter has got 4 parts to it. Three of them are familiar to people from anywhere in the world, which is french fries, popcorn, chicken and hot wings. But the fourth part is squid, fried squid, which is quite unique to here. It's done very well in the past, and we've got that at a break-in price point of CNY 29, so we feel very good about our November calendar. And then in December, for the first time last year, we started a Christmas promotion. Christmas is not a traditional holiday in China. And the response was pretty good. So we've taken that to another level this year with covering the entire gamut from low-end meals at RMB 35 to buckets for families at RMB 98, and with a lot of innovation taken from winning items from around the world. So December, I think, for the Christmas promotion, looks particularly strong. And that's what give us confidence in the balance of the quarter.

Those -- that's how you win even in a sluggish market. And I think there are lessons that we're also applying around the rest of the world. I mean, KFC outside the U.S. had just a gangbuster quarter, probably with the exception of Japan, developed markets, developing markets. You can ask me any country, and I'll show you incredible sales growth. So I think the global growth of the KFC brand and the momentum it has and the strength that we've now got in the U.S. sets that up for particular strength. Taco Bell, as I said, across all the facets you want a brand to be strong at, is just powering ahead.

And then my question, with Taco Bell performed well in a difficult industry backdrop and obviously, the competitive promotional environment continues to be pretty fierce, I was wondering about the decision to launch a $1 all-day menu as you guys seem to be seeing success with the $5 box strategy and, Greg, the core value strategy outlined earlier. Presumably, these $1 menus, obviously, $1 offerings have better margins -- excuse me, the -- obviously, the core value offerings seem to have better margins than the $1 menu deal that you'd be launching within the context of an inflationary labor environment."

Obviously, we had the significant growth, as we said, in breakfast. But I think without breakfast, transactions would have been slightly positive. I think the key to Taco Bell's success is it's not just a one-show pony. We didn't just do $1 menus. We also did Triple Double Crunchwraps in $5 boxes. So I think it's our ability to have great value. And value isn't just what you pay, it's what you get. And I think if you look at what's in the boxes or if you look at now the Sony promotion we're doing right now, which from a millennial point of view is an incredibly attractive promotional offer. And I know the Sony box, the team is very happy with the performance of the Sony box as we go into the fourth quarter, which is why we said we have momentum. So I think transactions were probably slightly up ex breakfast. Margins in the quarter, I think, were well over 21%, close to 22%. I've been talking to some Taco Bell franchisees. I can assure you they love those sort of margins. And I think as I see it, with the work that Brian and the team are doing, we're set up for continued success at Taco Bell going forward."

Pizza Hut Dine-In is significant in world growth to aggregate, but for the rest of it, it's mainly our own delivery systems. We are listed with the major aggregators, so we are present in all of them. It is true that there's been a lot of fallout because the profitability of the aggregators reportedly is very negative. So of course, the big 3 companies are still continuing to support their delivery engines. But the rate of discounting, et cetera, I think has moderated over time, but it still is a growth area."

Brands delivered third quarter core operating profit growth of 11% and EPS growth, excluding special items, of 9%. For 2016, we are raising our core operating profit growth guidance from at least 14% to at least 15%, owing to continued strength in our business outside of China and solid profitability in China despite sales headwinds, which I'll discuss shortly.
Today, I'll give you an overview of each of our operating divisions; and then David Gibbs, our President and CFO, will walk you through the financials. After that, the team and I, including Micky Pant, CEO of Yum! China; and Ted Stedem, CFO of Yum! China, will be happy to take any questions you might have. 
For those of you who don't know Ted, he joined the Yum! China team in August. He's been with Yum! for the last 7 years and served as CFO of KFC Australia and New Zealand and most recently, as the General Manager of our KFC Asia business outside of China. Ted brings significant financial and operational expertise to Micky's leadership team as they prepare for the separation.
Now let's begin today with China. As we mentioned in our second quarter call, we were pleased with the results we saw through the first 6 weeks of Q3 as sales were ahead of our plan. However, tougher laps in the second half of the third quarter, which we built into the forecast, were compounded by an international court ruling regarding claims to sovereignty over the South China Sea. The ruling triggered a series of protests and boycotts intensified by social media against a few international companies with well-known Western brands. At its peak, the demonstration significantly impacted store traffic in certain trade zones, and this was during our busiest season.
The impact to our sales was sudden, and while difficult to pinpoint the exact magnitude of the impact on the quarter, our best estimate is there was a 400 to 500 basis point impact to the division's same-store sales in the quarter.
Most importantly, as we got further away from the incident in July, sales improved. Fourth quarter, which began in September, has seen improvement continue with quarter-to-date sales down modestly. We're encouraged by recent trends through the important Golden Week holiday, which is currently ongoing, and optimistic about a strong product and promotional calendar for the balance of the quarter, which Micky will discuss. Given these trends in the business, we expect same-store sales to be positive for the balance of the quarter.
In spite of the external headwind, the team was able to execute well and manage costs, resulting in solid profitability with core operating profit up 14%. It is unfortunate that something outside of our control impacted our sales, but thanks to solid execution, it appears to be mostly behind us at this point, and we are moving forward with excitement about the balance of the year with confidence in the long-term potential of this business.
As we prepare to separate the China business, there's a lot to be excited about. First, the strategic partnership we previously announced with Primavera and Ant Financial is a tremendous asset and competitive advantage. Both are well-respected Chinese institutions that are ideal partners for Yum! China as a stand-alone public company operating in China.
Second, we are the undisputed category leader in digital engagement. We're building the world's greatest loyalty program with a large and growing database to help us drive future sales.
Our mobile payment has doubled from 10% to 20% of sales over the last year and, with Ant Financial's Alipay, will continue to grow.
Third, delivery. We currently offer delivery from more than 4,000 units across China. This is an unmatched and growing platform that affords further growth opportunities. 
And finally, idea sharing. As we get closer to separation, what is ironic is Yum! and the China Division have never been closer from a knowhow and idea-sharing perspective, and this will continue post-separation. You'll hear a lot more about all of this next week.
Now on to our 3 brand divisions, where I'm excited to say we are on track to deliver another year of strong operating profit growth, which is a testament to the talents and capabilities within the global team. For the third quarter, we are very pleased that, in aggregate, our business outside of China produced 11% core operating profit growth ahead of our expectations. In what has been an overall sluggish environment for the QSR category, particularly in the United States, 2 of our 3 brands have been delivering solid results and has continued to do so into the fourth quarter thus far.
Our KFC Division excelled. Same-store sales grew 4% in the third quarter or 7% on a 2-year stack. Core operating profit grew 19% in the quarter, and the division opened 138 new international restaurants in 42 countries. 70% of our new international openings were in emerging markets.
System sales in international developed markets grew 4% and international emerging markets grew 12%. This brand continues to perform in nearly every market globally, with particular strength in Russia, Continental Europe and Africa this quarter. And we remain on track to open at least 475 net new international units this year, and the U.S. is full steam ahead on its remodel program.
In particular, I'm pleased with the third quarter results out of the U.S., which were driven by the Extra Crispy campaign. We continue to gain traction with our strategy here, and our 6% same-store sales growth lapped 2% growth in the prior year. 2-year comps of plus 8 in the quarter are category leading, and this is our ninth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth in the U.S. and speaks to the importance of an aligned franchise system and strong marketing adhering to core innovation and value.
The KFC U.S. team, in partnership with the franchisees, have really turned this brand around in the last 2 years, and the brands' continued strength in a sluggish QSR market is commendable. This achievement in the U.S. gives me confidence in continued global success as we share best practices across the system.
Pizza Hut system sales in constant currency were flat, and same-store sales declined 1% in the third quarter. The U.S. market was influenced by an unsuccessful promotion and the competitive environment. As we saw earlier this year, we know the brand can perform when the right product is combined with compelling value and the messaging is distinctive and disruptive, and I am confident in our ability to turn around the Pizza Hut U.S. business. We believe the fundamentals are being put in place and now execution is the focus.
Our international business at Pizza Hut saw system sales growth of 3% in constant currency and flat same-store sales growth in the quarter. Across our international markets, we are leveraging a wealth of proven, ownable value base to address specific consumer needs and rolling them out rapidly from one market to another.
In Thailand, for example, we took a bold approach to value, leveraging in any construct in tandem with significant product and operations improvements and have seen double-digit sales and transaction growth since launch.
Other markets now taking learnings from this significant turnaround. This traction gives us confidence that the international Pizza Hut turnaround is underway.
Finally, I'm very pleased with Taco Bell's strong performance in the third quarter. Core operating profit grew 9%. U.S. same-store sales grew 3%, even as we lapped a plus 4% from the prior year. This included 1 percentage point of growth in transactions or over 2 percentage points better than the industry. Our strategy of bracketing value with the $1.49 steak flatbread sandwiches and $5 boxes, which provided abundant value, allow us to grow transactions and boost check.
Furthermore, we saw impressive results with our breakfast offering in the quarter as transactions grew 14% driven by our $1 breakfast menu. We're now taking the learnings from this success in promoting our all-day dollar menu. It all goes to show that when you remain committed to the core and value, the results follow. 
In addition to being a clear leader in offering low prices, we are now the -- leading the category in good value for money.
As for Taco Bell development, we remain on plan with at least 300 new restaurant openings for the year. Taco Bell international is an area of enviable growth potential, and we are excited to see the momentum behind the strategic objective. While it's early days, we believe that it's going to be a meaningful driver of long-term growth and look forward to continued progress.
So 2016 marks the beginning of a massive transformation for Yum!, a transformation that has been years in the making. The first step is the October 31 separation of the China business. This business began with the first KFC in Beijing nearly 30 years ago and has grown to over 7,000 restaurants in over 1,100 cities. Today, it is one of China's largest employers with over 400,000 employees serving over 2 billion customers every year. In short, this business is a powerhouse with unrivaled growth opportunities in the world's fastest-growing major economy.
As we announced on September 2, investments by Primavera Capital Group and Ant Financial bring strategic value and additional local and digital knowhow immediately and over the long term.
In addition, on September 15, we announced a world-class Board of Directors for Yum! China with Dr. Fred Hu, Chairman and Founder of Primavera Capital Group, to serve as Nonexecutive Chairman. I have the utmost confidence that this board will offer the market insights and strategic vision required to enable Yum! China to reach its full potential.
Including the Primavera investment, Yum! China will have a very strong financial foundation, over $900 million of cash and no external debt on the balance sheet at spin. I couldn't be more optimistic about the future of this business or the great foundation that is now in place for them to begin their journey as an independent company, and I look forward to watching them succeed for many years to come.
So in conclusion. At new Yum!, the massive transformation will continue as we become a unique and focused world-class franchisor. Following the separation, we'll be roughly 93% franchised with a clear path to reach our stated goal of becoming at least 96% franchised by the end of 2017.
We've given a great deal of thought towards creating a high-growth, asset-light efficient company best positioned for accelerating growth in global system sales, operating profits and cash flow. And we're excited to share more details behind our thinking here next Tuesday, so stay tuned.
And with that, gives me pleasure to hand over to David Gibbs."

In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: our third quarter operating results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our recapitalization and the separation of our China business.Let's start with a high-level",1416,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: our third quarter operating results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our recapitalization and the separation of our China business.
Let's start with a high-level overview of our third quarter performance. We're pleased Yum! Brands delivered year-over-year core operating profit growth of 11% in the quarter. In aggregate, our 3 brand divisions, excluding China, delivered 11% core operating profit growth in the quarter, led by 19% growth at KFC, partially offset by soft results at Pizza Hut. This growth is especially impressive given how competitive and sluggish the QSR category has been recently, particularly in the U.S.
Combined, our brands are outperforming the category, and we're pleased to see relative outperformance continuing thus far in the fourth quarter.
In our China Division, core operating profit grew 14% despite a 1% decline in same-store sales. The implementation of a value-added tax and continued tight cost controls materially benefited unit economics and enabled us to offset inflation and sales deleverage primarily resulting from the South China Sea ruling. As Greg mentioned, tougher back-of-quarter laps were compounded by the incident. While it is very difficult to be precise given all the moving pieces in our China business right now, our best estimate is this had a 400 to 500 basis point impact to our same-store sales in the quarter. 
It was most severe in July, primarily affecting our stores in lower-tier cities where the protests were more intense. The impact continues to dissipate, and sales have recovered off their lows.
Overall, for the quarter, EPS before special items grew 9%, including a 6 point negative impact from foreign currency changes.
Now I'd like to discuss our 2016 outlook. As Greg mentioned, we're raising our 2016 full year core operating profit growth guidance to at least 15% from at least 14%, including the 53rd week. This increase is supported by strength in our overall business outside China and healthy profitability in China despite temporary sales headwinds as we discussed.
As expected, third quarter margins in the China Division benefited due in part to the diligent effort across our entire China team in implementing the new VAT. In each of the last 2 quarters, we highlighted the change into China's retail tax structure, which became effective on May 1. The benefit to our business continues to fluctuate from month to month as we refine our ability to get input credits and as the interpretation of the new tax code becomes clearer.
As a result, we will not provide precise guidance for the future benefit of this tax change other than to say that we expect it to be worth at least 2 points of margin upside on a go-forward basis.
We still expect full year China restaurant margins of at least 17%. This reflects the ongoing benefit of the VAT, offset by labor and commodity inflation as well as our investment back into generating sales.
Now let's talk about development. Yum! remains one of the leading global retail developers. In the third quarter, we added over 475 total new units, taking our year-to-date global new restaurant openings to nearly 1,150 units. Consistent with prior years, development will be weighted more towards the fourth quarter as we expect to accelerate our pace of development balance of year, further laying the groundwork for future growth. For the full year, we expect China to add about 525 gross new units and for new Yum! Brands to add over 2,175 units, which will continue to include China.
With regards to refranchising, we've committed to becoming at least 96% franchised by the end of 2017. Once we finalize the separation of our China business, we will be 93% franchised. Over the last 4 quarters, we refranchised nearly 470 restaurants. In the third quarter specifically, we refranchised 94 stores, 48 of which were Pizza Hut restaurants. Refranchising allows us to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders while reducing G&A expenditure as field-level employees are typically absorbed into our franchise system. We look forward to sharing our strategy for improving overall efficiency at Yum! with you next week.
One housekeeping item. Unallocated corporate G&A in the quarter, excluding special items, was $44 million with the increase versus last year largely due to timing. For the full year, we expect this to come in closer to $205 million, excluding special items.
Now I'd like to talk about our capital structure. In connection with the pending separation of our China business, we are optimizing the capital structure of Yum!. We closed the previously announced $2.5 billion new senior secured credit facilities and $2.1 billion senior unsecured notes offering on June 16, which was 5 days into our third quarter.
As a result, we have total debt outstanding of $9.2 billion. Our intention is to maintain leverage equal to about 5x EBITDA at new Yum!, while Yum! China should have over $900 million in cash and no external debt at separation.
In the quarter, we also swapped a portion of our floating rate debt to fixed, resulting in about 90% of our debt fixed for a total current blended rate of 4.75%.
With this in mind, we expect interest expense of about $300 million in 2016.
We're fully committed to returning cash to shareholders. Last December at our Analyst and Investor Day, we committed to returning approximately $6.2 billion of capital, excluding our ongoing dividend payments, between separation announcement and completion, which assumed a year-end 2016 separation of our China Division.
In connection with this, we have repurchased approximately 5.3 billion shares at an average price of $81, reducing our share count by approximately 15% as of October 4. We plan to return the remainder of our previously committed $6.2 billion of capital before year-end. Including our recently increased quarterly dividend, we have returned $5.2 billion to shareholders year-to-date.
Now I'd like to quickly update you on our China separation plans. We are on track to complete the separation after the close of business on October 31. On September 23, the board approved the separation of our China business via a dividend distribution of 1 share of Yum! China common stock per each share of Yum! Brands common stock held at the close of business on October 19, the record date for the distribution.
We expect to complete the distribution of Yum! China common stock to shareholders on October 31.
When-issued trading for both Yum! Brands and Yum! China will begin on the NYSE on October 17, and Yum! China will begin trading regular way as an independent company on November 1.
As Greg mentioned, we were pleased with the announced investment in Yum! China by Primavera Capital and Ant Financial. They will make a $460 million strategic investment, reflecting an 8% discount to the volume-weighted average trading price in days 31 through 60 following the separation of Yum! China. Additionally, they will receive 2 warrant tranches, representing approximately 2% of equity value in each tranche with strike prices equating to Yum! China equity values of $12 billion and $15 billion.
This is an attractive structure for shareholders as it minimizes upfront dilution and highlights the long-term value in Yum! China as an investment.
More importantly, we are thrilled with the strategic partnership and the benefits this offers Yum! China. Both Primavera and Ant Financial are well-respected Chinese institutions that are ideal partners. Dr. Fred Hu, who leads Primavera, will become the Nonexecutive Chairman of Yum! China, and Ant Financial will have an observer seat. Given the value these ideal partners will bring to the table, we believe Yum! China is set up for success immediately and over the long term.
So to wrap things up, we had an exogenous and temporary event at China sales mid-quarter but were able to hold the line on operating profit in China. And with the strong performance of our brands outside of China in aggregate, we have line of sight to at least 15% core operating profit growth for the full year.
As Greg said, 2016 is a truly transformational year for Yum!. We're nearing completion of the separation of our China business and have secured strong strategic partners. We've enhanced our capital structure, and we've made progress on refranchising. We look forward to sharing additional details on these matters and more with you at our New York Investor Conference next Tuesday.
And with that, the team and I are happy to take your questions. Operator?"

So I guess the question I have is sort of twofold. One is, is there just a higher country risk now? And does that mean that the long-term targets of kind of 4% to 5% maybe are going to be harder to reach? And the second point is, is there an opportunity to make up some of that top line gap with faster unit growth? Because it looks like unit growth -- gross units is -- has continued to come down a little bit."

So trust me, we are very disappointed with the negative comps number. But this was very unusual. The first half of the year, we were trending very nicely. In fact, third quarter -- second quarter of this year was the fourth straight quarter of same-store sales growth. And in Q3, we were trending through the middle of the quarter very strongly. And then right around the 13th of July, this matter started, and we saw a very sharp and sudden decline in sales. The good news was that, thereafter, the recovery started almost immediately within 10 days or so, but it did have this impact. Two things. Firstly is that unlike a food safety incident, research that we've conducted has shown that there's been no damage whatsoever to the brand. Our trends have continued to improve. And I think the other point, which was mentioned by both Greg and David, the spinoff coupled with the 2 very strong strategic partners, who have very deep respect in China, I think will help us in the longer term in issues and matters like this. I think if you're at the 11 October, Tuesday, Investor Meeting in New York, we'll give you more comfort as to why we feel that we can grow comps into the future. But had it not been for this incident, we would almost certainly have had comp growth in Q3. And we're expecting from this point onwards for the rest of the year to get back to growth. As far as new unit development is concerned, I think for the quarter, I think the impact was -- yes, it's -- it -- I don't see any particular reason why we will not have strong new unit growth. Again, we will share more details on the 11th. This year, as you know, we did take our Pizza Hut Dine-In build rate down from last year's 280 to about 150. And that was done -- 150 is still, on a base of 1,500, is about 10%. We felt that was the responsible thing to do, and it kept Pizza Hut comps back, which are trending upwards. And once that is done, I think we'll get back onto a strong growth path. So we don't see really a sort of ongoing decline in our union of build rate [ph] in China at all."

There's no doubt the plus 6 rolling over plus 2 into plus 8, it definitely means we're growing share in the category, which is great. I put it down to -- and if you think what we're in, in the quarter, we essentially ran Extra Crispy chicken, which we've had for over 40 years in a $5 box and a $20 bucket. I think what it demonstrates is when you have distinctive and disruptive positioning and breakthrough advertising with great product quality and very good operations, I think what you'll see is you can get the customer to actually come in more often. And so I think that was certainly the KFC story. I was particularly proud of what the Taco Bell team did, how quickly they reacted to their Q2 minus 1 number to change the calendar for Q3. It's not easy to do. So a huge call out to the Taco Bell team for basically getting us back into $1.49 flatbread, the Triple Double Crunchwrap, which did incredibly well and obviously then putting it in a $5 box. So I think the answer is we're back to the core, selling great core products. We've got distinctive and disruptive advertising and positioning, and I think that's the cornerstone to success."

As you probably know, we did divert capital to store refurbishment in a very large way, so we'll give more details on the 11th, but we've improved the look and feel of our stores quite considerably, especially in the larger cities. We did focus on our core bestsellers, so we did simplify the menu just a little bit, but the core bestsellers, including fried chicken, the Zinger sandwich were dialed up, and that is having a beneficial effect. Our key price points, especially the crucial RMB 29, RMB 39 price points, which are the last 2 price points in this market. And lastly, digital. I think digital has been probably the most significant growth area for us, and our cashless payments have grown from 10% to 20% in a very short period of time. We expect that to continue as we partner up with people like Alipay to expand it. And our loyalty programs are significant now, so the percentage of transactions that are being scanned at the till for loyalty points is very significant. And overall, spend on digital has become a very large part of our total marketing spend. All this put together is having good results, and we've accordingly geared our calendar for the balance of this year as well as for next year. So both on KFC and Pizza Hut, a considerable attention to core product, key price points and continued in-store execution, and that really is what's working."

But after what we've got in the month of November is a winning item that has been tested very well and done well in the past, extended through November, which is the snack platter, which is a good example of how KFC in China is unique in the sense that the snack platter has got 4 parts to it. Three of them are familiar to people from anywhere in the world, which is french fries, popcorn, chicken and hot wings. But the fourth part is squid, fried squid, which is quite unique to here. It's done very well in the past, and we've got that at a break-in price point of CNY 29, so we feel very good about our November calendar. And then in December, for the first time last year, we started a Christmas promotion. Christmas is not a traditional holiday in China. And the response was pretty good. So we've taken that to another level this year with covering the entire gamut from low-end meals at RMB 35 to buckets for families at RMB 98, and with a lot of innovation taken from winning items from around the world.

It goes without saying that people are sort of trying to decide who to choose and what the impact will be on the economy, and I think people are maybe just hunkering down a little bit. But that said, that's why I think I'm even more pleased with the performance of KFC and Taco Bell in the quarter because, despite that uncertainty, those 2 brands, I think, in being incredibly distinctive and disruptive and going back to the core of delivering great experiences, making sure the value was right. Those -- that's how you win even in a sluggish market. And I think there are lessons that we're also applying around the rest of the world. I mean, KFC outside the U.S. had just a gangbuster quarter, probably with the exception of Japan, developed markets, developing markets. You can ask me any country, and I'll show you incredible sales growth. So I think the global growth of the KFC brand and the momentum it has and the strength that we've now got in the U.S. sets that up for particular strength. Taco Bell, as I said, across all the facets you want a brand to be strong at, is just powering ahead. And I think once we get through the election and then that uncertainty is removed, hopefully, the market will find some momentum. But I'm really confident that our brands can grow in either strong markets or markets that don't have the momentum we'd love to have."

Brands delivered third quarter core operating profit growth of 11% and EPS growth, excluding special items, of 9%. For 2016, we are raising our core operating profit growth guidance from at least 14% to at least 15%, owing to continued strength in our business outside of China and solid profitability in China despite sales headwinds, which I'll discuss shortly.
Today, I'll give you an overview of each of our operating divisions; and then David Gibbs, our President and CFO, will walk you through the financials. After that, the team and I, including Micky Pant, CEO of Yum China; and Ted Stedem, CFO of Yum China, will be happy to take any questions you might have. 
For those of you who don't know Ted, he joined the Yum China team in August. He's been with Yum! for the last 7 years and served as CFO of KFC Australia and New Zealand and most recently, as the General Manager of our KFC Asia business outside of China. Ted brings significant financial and operational expertise to Micky's leadership team as they prepare for the separation.
Now let's begin today with China. As we mentioned on our second quarter call, we were pleased with the results we saw through the first 6 weeks of Q3 as sales were ahead of our plan. However, tougher laps in the second half of the third quarter, which we built into the forecast, were compounded by an international court ruling regarding claims to sovereignty over the South China Sea. The ruling triggered a series of protests and boycotts intensified by social media against a few international companies with well-known Western brands. At its peak, the demonstrations significantly impacted store traffic in certain trade zones, and this was during our busiest season.
The impact to our sales was sudden, and while difficult to pinpoint the exact magnitude of the impact on the quarter, our best estimate is there was a 400 to 500 basis point impact to the division's same-store sales in the quarter.
Most importantly, as we got further away from the incident in July, sales improved. Fourth quarter, which began in September, has seen improvement continue with quarter-to-date sales down modestly. We're encouraged by recent trends through the important Golden Week holiday, which is currently ongoing, and optimistic about a strong product and promotional calendar for the balance of the quarter, which Micky will discuss. Given these trends in the business, we expect same-store sales to be positive for the balance of the quarter.
In spite of the external headwind, the team was able to execute well and manage costs, resulting in solid profitability with core operating profit up 14%. It is unfortunate that something outside of our control impacted our sales, but thanks to solid execution, it appears to be mostly behind us at this point, and we are moving forward with excitement about the balance of the year with confidence in the long-term potential of this business.
As we prepare to separate the China business, there is a lot to be excited about. First, the strategic partnership we previously announced with Primavera and Ant Financial is a tremendous asset and competitive advantage. Both are well-respected Chinese institutions that are ideal partners for Yum China as a stand-alone public company operating in China.
Second, we are the undisputed category leader in digital engagement. We're building the world's greatest loyalty program with a large and growing database to help us drive future sales.
Our mobile payment has doubled from 10% to 20% of sales over the last year, and with Ant Financial's Alipay, will continue to grow.
Third, delivery. We currently offer delivery from more than 4,000 units across China. This is an unmatched and growing platform that affords further growth opportunities. 
And finally, idea sharing. As we get closer to separation, what is ironic is Yum! and the China Division have never been closer from a know-how and idea-sharing perspective, and this will continue post-separation. You'll hear a lot more about all of this next week.
Now on to our 3 brand divisions, where I'm excited to say we are on track to deliver another year of strong operating profit growth, which is a testament to the talent and capabilities within the global team. For the third quarter, we are very pleased that, in aggregate, our business outside of China produced 11% core operating profit growth ahead of our expectations. In what has been an overall sluggish environment for the QSR category, particularly in the United States, 2 of our 3 brands have been delivering solid results and have continued to do so into the fourth quarter thus far.
Our KFC Division excelled. Same-store sales grew 4% in the third quarter or 7% on a 2-year stack. Core operating profit grew 19% in the quarter, and the division opened 138 new international restaurants in 42 countries. 70% of our new international openings were in emerging markets.
System sales in international developed markets grew 4% and international emerging markets grew 12%. This brand continued to perform in nearly every market globally, with particular strength in Russia, Continental Europe and Africa this quarter. And we remain on track to open at least 475 net new international units this year, and the U.S. is full steam ahead on its remodel program.
In particular, I'm pleased with the third quarter results out of the U.S., which were driven by the Extra Crispy campaign. We continue to gain traction with our strategy here, and our 6% same-store sales growth lapped 2% growth in the prior year. 2-year comps of plus 8 in the quarter are category leading, and this is our ninth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth in the U.S. and speaks to the importance of an aligned franchise system and strong marketing adhering to core innovation and value.
The KFC U.S. team, in partnership with the franchisees, have really turned this brand around in the last 2 years, and the brands' continued strength in a sluggish QSR market is commendable. This achievement in the U.S. gives me confidence in continued global success as we share best practices across the system.
Pizza Hut system sales in constant currency were flat, and same-store sales declined 1% in the third quarter. The U.S. market was influenced by an unsuccessful promotion and the competitive environment. As we saw earlier this year, we know the brand can perform when the right product is combined with compelling value and the messaging is distinctive and disruptive, and I am confident in our ability to turn around the Pizza Hut U.S. business. We believe the fundamentals are being put in place and now execution is the focus.
Our international business of Pizza Hut saw system sales growth of 3% in constant currency and flat same-store sales growth in the quarter. Across our international markets, we are leveraging a wealth of proven, ownable value bets to address specific consumer needs and rolling them out rapidly from one market to another.
In Thailand, for example, we took a bold approach to value, leveraging in any construct in tandem with significant product and operations improvements and have seen double-digit sales and transaction growth since launch.
Other markets now are taking learnings from this significant turnaround. This traction gives us confidence that the international Pizza Hut turnaround is underway.
Finally, I'm very pleased with Taco Bell's strong performance in the third quarter. Core operating profit grew 9%. U.S. same-store sales grew 3%, even as we lapped a plus 4% from the prior year. This included 1 percentage point of growth in transactions or over 2 percentage points better than the industry. Our strategy of bracketing value with the $1.49 steak flatbread sandwiches and $5 boxes, which provided abundant value, allow us to grow transactions and boost check.
Furthermore, we saw impressive results with our breakfast offering in the quarter as transactions grew 14% driven by our $1 breakfast menu. We're now taking the learnings from this success in promoting our all-day dollar menu. It all goes to show that when you remain committed to the core and value, the results follow. 
In addition to being a clear leader in offering low prices, we are now the -- leading the category in good value for money.
As for Taco Bell development, we remain on plan with at least 300 new restaurant openings for the year. Taco Bell international is an area of enviable growth potential, and we are excited to see the momentum behind this strategic objective. While it's early days, we believe that this could be a meaningful driver of long-term growth and look forward to continued progress.
So 2016 marks the beginning of a massive transformation for Yum!, a transformation that has been years in the making. The first step is the October 31 separation of the China business. This business began with the first KFC in Beijing nearly 30 years ago and has grown to over 7,000 restaurants in over 1,100 cities. Today, it is one of China's largest employers with over 400,000 employees serving over 2 billion customers every year. In short, this business is a powerhouse with unrivaled growth opportunities in the world's fastest-growing major economy.
As we announced on September 2, investments by Primavera Capital Group and Ant Financial brings strategic value and additional local and digital knowhow immediately and over the long term.
In addition, on September 15, we announced a world-class Board of Directors for Yum China with Dr. Fred Hu, Chairman and Founder of Primavera Capital Group, to serve as Nonexecutive Chairman. I have the utmost confidence that this board will offer the market insights and strategic vision required to enable Yum China to reach its full potential.
Including the Primavera investment, Yum China will have a very strong financial foundation, over $900 million of cash and no external debt on the balance sheet at spin. I couldn't be more optimistic about the future of this business or the great foundation that is now in place for them to begin their journey as an independent company, and I look forward to watching them succeed for many years to come.
So in conclusion. At new Yum!, the massive transformation will continue as we become a unique and focused world-class franchisor. Following the separation,  we will be roughly 93% franchised with a clear path to reach our stated goal of becoming at least 96% franchised by the end of 2017.
We've given a great deal of thought towards creating a high-growth, asset-light efficient company best positioned for accelerating growth in global system sales, operating profits and cash flow. And we're excited to share more details behind our thinking here next Tuesday, so stay tuned.
And with that, gives me pleasure to hand over to David Gibbs."

In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: our third quarter operating results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our recapitalization and the separation of our China business.Let's start with a high-level",1416,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: our third quarter operating results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our recapitalization and the separation of our China business.
Let's start with a high-level overview of our third quarter performance. We're pleased Yum! Brands delivered year-over-year core operating profit growth of 11% in the quarter. In aggregate, our 3 brand divisions, excluding China, delivered 11% core operating profit growth in the quarter, led by 19% growth at KFC, partially offset by soft results at Pizza Hut. This growth is especially impressive given how competitive and sluggish the QSR category has been recently, particularly in the U.S.
Combined, our brands are outperforming the category, and we're pleased to see relative outperformance continuing thus far in the fourth quarter.
In our China Division, core operating profit grew 14% despite a 1% decline in same-store sales. The implementation of a value-added tax and continued tight cost controls materially benefited unit economics and enabled us to offset inflation and sales deleverage primarily resulting from the South China Sea ruling. As Greg mentioned, tougher back-of-quarter laps were compounded by the incident. While it is very difficult to be precise given all the moving pieces in our China business right now, our best estimate is this had a 400 to 500 basis points impact to our same-store sales in the quarter. 
It was most severe in July, primarily affecting our stores in lower-tier cities where the protests were more intense. The impact continues to dissipate, and sales have recovered off their lows.
Overall, for the quarter, EPS before special items grew 9%, including a 6 point negative impact from foreign currency changes.
Now I'd like to discuss our 2016 outlook. As Greg mentioned, we're raising our 2016 full year core operating profit growth guidance to at least 15% from at least 14%, including the 53rd week. This increase is supported by strength in our overall business outside China and healthy profitability in China despite temporary sales headwinds as we discussed.
As expected, third quarter margins in the China Division benefited due in part to the diligent effort across our entire China team in implementing the new VAT. In each of the last 2 quarters, we highlighted the changes to China's retail tax structure, which became effective on May 1. The benefit to our business continues to fluctuate from month to month as we refine our ability to get input credits and as the interpretation of the new tax code becomes clearer.
As a result, we will not provide precise guidance for the future benefit of this tax change other than to say that we expect it to be worth at least 2 points of margin upside on a go-forward basis.
We still expect full year China restaurant margins of at least 17%. This reflects the ongoing benefit of the VAT, offset by labor and commodity inflation as well as our investment back into generating sales.
Now let's talk about development. Yum! remains one of the leading global retail developers. In the third quarter, we added over 475 total new units, taking our year-to-date global new restaurant openings to nearly 1,150 units. Consistent with prior years, development will be weighted more towards the fourth quarter as we expect to accelerate our pace of development balance of year, further laying the groundwork for future growth. For the full year, we expect China to add about 525 gross new units and for new Yum! Brands to add over 2,175 units, which will continue to include China.
With regards to refranchising, we've committed to becoming at least 96% franchised by the end of 2017. Once we finalize the separation of our China business, we will be 93% franchised. Over the last 4 quarters, we refranchised nearly 470 restaurants. In the third quarter specifically, we refranchised 94 stores, 48 of which were Pizza Hut restaurants. Refranchising allows us to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders while reducing G&A expenditure as field-level employees are typically absorbed into our franchise system. We look forward to sharing our strategy for improving overall efficiency at Yum! with you next week.
One housekeeping item. Unallocated corporate G&A in the quarter, excluding special items, was $44 million with the increase versus last year largely due to timing. For the full year, we expect this to come in closer to $205 million, excluding special items.
Now I'd like to talk about our capital structure. In connection with the pending separation of our China business, we are optimizing the capital structure of Yum!. We closed the previously announced $2.5 billion new senior secured credit facilities and $2.1 billion senior unsecured notes offering on June 16, which was 5 days into our third quarter.
As a result, we have total debt outstanding of $9.2 billion. Our intention is to maintain leverage equal to about 5x EBITDA at new Yum!, while Yum China should have over $900 million in cash and no external debt at separation.
In the quarter, we also swapped a portion of our floating rate debt to fixed, resulting in about 90% of our debt fixed for a total current blended rate of 4.75%.
With this in mind, we expect interest expense of about $300 million in 2016.
We're fully committed to returning cash to shareholders. Last December at our Analyst and Investor Day, we committed to returning approximately $6.2 billion of capital, excluding our ongoing dividend payments, between separation announcement and completion, which assumed a year-end 2016 separation of our China Division.
In connection with this, we have repurchased approximately 5.3 billion shares at an average price of $81, reducing our share count by approximately 15% as of October 4. We plan to return the remainder of our previously committed $6.2 billion of capital before year-end. Including our recently increased quarterly dividend, we have returned $5.2 billion to shareholders year-to-date.
Now I'd like to quickly update you on our China separation plans. We are on track to complete the separation after the close of business on October 31. On September 23, the board approved the separation of our China business via a dividend distribution of 1 share of Yum China common stock per each share of Yum! Brands common stock held at the close of business on October 19, the record date for the distribution.
We expect to complete the distribution of Yum China common stock to shareholders on October 31.
When-issued trading for both Yum! Brands and Yum China will begin on the NYSE on October 17, and Yum China will begin trading regular way as an independent company on November 1.
As Greg mentioned, we were pleased with the announced investment in Yum China by Primavera Capital and Ant Financial. They will make a $460 million strategic investment, reflecting an 8% discount to the volume-weighted average trading price in days 31 through 60 following the separation of Yum China. Additionally, they will receive 2 warrant tranches, representing approximately 2% of equity value in each tranche with strike prices equating to Yum China equity values of $12 billion and $15 billion.
This is an attractive structure for shareholders as it minimizes upfront dilution and highlights the long-term value in Yum China as an investment.
More importantly, we are thrilled with the strategic partnership and the benefits this offers Yum China. Both Primavera and Ant Financial are well-respected Chinese institutions that are ideal partners. Dr. Fred Hu, who leads Primavera, will become the Nonexecutive Chairman of Yum China, and Ant Financial will have an observer seat. Given the value these ideal partners will bring to the table, we believe Yum China is set up for success immediately and over the long term.
So to wrap things up, we had an exogenous and temporary event hit China sales mid-quarter, but we're able to hold the line on operating profit in China. And with the strong performance of our brands outside of China in aggregate, we have line of sight to at least 15% core operating profit growth for the full year.
As Greg said, 2016 is a truly transformational year for Yum!. We're nearing completion of the separation of our China business and have secured strong strategic partners. We've enhanced our capital structure, and we've made progress on refranchising. We look forward to sharing additional details on these matters and more with you at our New York Investor Conference next Tuesday.
And with that, the team and I are happy to take your questions. Operator?"

So I guess the question I have is sort of twofold. One is, is there just a higher country risk now? And does that mean that the long-term targets of kind of 4% to 5% maybe are going to be harder to reach? And the second point is, is there an opportunity to make up some of that top line gap with faster unit growth?

So trust me, we are very disappointed with the negative comps number. But this was very unusual. The first half of the year, we were trending very nicely. In fact, third quarter -- second quarter of this year was the fourth straight quarter of same-store sales growth. And in Q3, we were trending through the middle of the quarter very strongly. And then right around the 13th of July, this matter started, and we saw a very sharp and sudden decline in sales. The good news was that, thereafter, the recovery started almost immediately within 10 days or so, but it did have this impact. Two things. First is that unlike the food safety incidents, research that we've conducted has shown that there has been no damage whatsoever to the brand. Our trends have continued to improve. And I think the other point, which was mentioned by both Greg and David, the spinoff coupled with the 2 very strong strategic partners, who have very deep respect in China, I think will help us in the longer term in issues and matters like this. I think if you are at the 11 October, Tuesday, Investor Meeting in New York, we'll give you more comfort as to why we feel that we can grow comps into the future. But had it not been for this incident, we would almost certainly have had comp growth in Q3. And we're expecting from this point onwards through the rest of the year to get back to growth. As far as new unit development is concerned, I think for the quarter, I think the impact was -- yes, it's -- it -- I don't see any particular reason why we will not have strong new unit growth. Again, we will share more details on the 11th. This year, as you know, we did take our Pizza Hut Dine-In build rate down from last year's 280 to about 150. And that was done -- 150 is still, on a base of 1,500, is about 10%. We felt that was the responsible thing to do, and to get Pizza Hut comps back, which are trending upwards. And once that is done, I think we can get back onto a strong growth path. So we don't see really a sort of ongoing decline in our union of build rate in China at all."

There's no doubt the plus 6 rolling or the plus 2 and the plus 8, it definitely means we're growing share in the category, which is great. I put it down to -- and if you think what we're in, in the quarter, we essentially ran Extra Crispy chicken, which we've had for over 40 years in the $5 box and $20 bucket. I think what it demonstrates is when you have distinctive and disruptive positioning and breakthrough advertising with great product quality and very good operations, I think what you'll see is you can get the customer to actually come in more often. And so I think that was certainly the KFC story. I was particularly proud of what the Taco Bell team did, how quickly they reacted to the Q2 minus 1 number to change the calendar for Q3. It's not easy to do. So a huge call out to the Taco Bell team for basically getting us back $1.49 flatbread, the Triple Double Crunchwrap, which did incredibly well and obviously then putting it into $5 box. So I think the answer is we are back to the core, selling great core products. We've got distinctive and disruptive advertising and positioning, and I think that's the cornerstone to success."

So they ran a $1 breakfast menu through the quarter, and that, as you saw, delivered a really impressive 14% transaction growth in that daypart. What they've done is they've now taken that to an all-day value menu play, which has only just started in the marketplace. I think as I said, what was impressive is not only do we have now the market-leading position for low prices, we now have the category-leading position for everyday great value. And so I think that you're seeing these brands, particularly both these brands, strengthen in the marketplace."

As you probably know, we did divert capital to store refurbishment in a very large way, so we'll give more details on the 11th, but we've improved the look and feel of our stores quite considerably, especially in the larger cities. We did focus on our core bestsellers, so we did simplify the menu just a little bit, but the core bestsellers, including fried chicken, the Zinger sandwich were dialed up, and that is having a beneficial effect. Our key price points, especially the crucial RMB 29, RMB 39 price points, which are the last 2 price points in this market. And lastly, digital. I think digital has been probably the most significant growth area for us, and our cashless payments have grown from 10% to 20% in a very short period of time. We expect that to continue as we partner up with people like Alipay to expand it. And our loyalty programs are significant now, so the percentage of transactions that are being scanned at the till for loyalty points is very significant. And overall, spend on digital has become a very large part of our total marketing spend. All this put together is having good results, and we've accordingly geared our calendar for the balance of this year as well as for next year. So both on KFC and Pizza Hut, a considerable attention to core product, key price points and continued in-store execution, and that really is what's working."

We're in the middle of the Golden Week, which is the second most significant holiday after the Chinese New Year, and that's going well at this time. It's a peak selling period and comps are good. But after what we've got in the month of November is a winning item that has been tested very well and done well in the past, extended through November, which is the snack platter, which is a good example of how KFC in China is unique in the sense that the snack platter has got 4 parts to it. Three of them are familiar to people from anywhere in the world, which is french fries, popcorn, chicken and hot wings. But the fourth part is squid, fried squid, which is quite unique to hear. It's done very well in the past, and we've got that at a very keen price point of RMB 29, so we feel very good about our November calendar. And then in December, for the first time last year, we started a Christmas promotion. Christmas is not a traditional holiday in China. And the response was pretty good. So we're -- we've taken that to another level this year with covering the entire gamut from low-end meals at RMB 35 to buckets for families at RMB 98, and with a lot of innovation taken from winning items from around the world.

We've been doing a bunch of work just talking to different -- to millennials, Gen X, Gen Y, Boomers. I think we're, what, 5 weeks away from a general elections. I think there is just great uncertainty as to what's going to happen in the U.S. in particular as a result of the outcome of the election. It goes without saying that people are sort of trying to decide who to choose and what the impact will be on the economy, and I think people are maybe just hunkering down a little bit. But that said, that's why I think I'm even more pleased with the performance of KFC and Taco Bell in the quarter because, despite that uncertainty, those 2 brands, I think, in being incredibly distinctive and disruptive and going back to the core of delivering great experiences, making sure the value was right. Those -- that's how you win even in a sluggish market. And I think there are lessons that we're also applying around the rest of the world. I mean, KFC outside the U.S. had just a gangbuster quarter, probably with the exception of Japan, developed markets, developing markets. You can ask me any country, and I'll show you incredible sales growth. So I think the global growth of the KFC brand and the momentum it has and the strength that we've now got in the U.S. sets that up for particular strength. Taco Bell, as I said, across all the facets you want a brand to be strong at, is just powering ahead. And I think once we get through the election and then that uncertainty is removed, hopefully, the market will find some momentum. But I'm really confident that our brands can grow in either strong markets or markets that don't have the momentum we'd love to have."

And I think if you look at what's in the boxes or if you look at now the Sony promotion we're doing right now, which from a millennial point of view is an incredibly attractive promotional offer. And I know the Sony box, the team is very happy with the performance of the Sony box as we go into the fourth quarter, which is why we said we have momentum. So I think transactions were probably slightly up ex breakfast. Margins in the quarter, I think, were well over 21%, close to 22%. I've been talking to some Taco Bell franchisees.

Brands delivered third quarter core operating profit growth of 11% and EPS growth, excluding special items, of 9%. For 2016, we are raising our core operating profit growth guidance from at least 14% to at least 15%, owing to continued strength in our business outside of China and solid profitability in China despite sales headwinds, which I'll discuss shortly.
Today, I'll give you an overview of each of our operating divisions; and then David Gibbs, our President and CFO, will walk you through the financials. After that, the team and I, including Micky Pant, CEO of Yum China; and Ted Stedem, CFO of Yum China, will be happy to take any questions you might have. 
For those of you who don't know Ted, he joined the Yum China team in August. He's been with Yum! for the last 7 years and served as CFO of KFC Australia and New Zealand and most recently, as the General Manager of our KFC Asia business outside of China. Ted brings significant financial and operational expertise to Micky's leadership team as they prepare for the separation.
Now let's begin today with China. As we mentioned on our second quarter call, we were pleased with the results we saw through the first 6 weeks of Q3 as sales were ahead of our plan. However, tougher laps in the second half of the third quarter, which we built into the forecast, were compounded by an international court ruling regarding claims to sovereignty over the South China Sea. The ruling triggered a series of protests and boycotts intensified by social media against a few international companies with well-known Western brands. At its peak, the demonstrations significantly impacted store traffic in certain trade zones, and this was during our busiest season.
The impact to our sales was sudden, and while difficult to pinpoint the exact magnitude of the impact on the quarter, our best estimate is there was a 400 to 500 basis point impact to the division's same-store sales in the quarter.
Most importantly, as we got further away from the incident in July, sales improved. Fourth quarter, which began in September, has seen improvement continue with quarter-to-date sales down modestly. We're encouraged by recent trends through the important Golden Week holiday, which is currently ongoing, and optimistic about a strong product and promotional calendar for the balance of the quarter, which Micky will discuss. Given these trends in the business, we expect same-store sales to be positive for the balance of the quarter.
In spite of the external headwind, the team was able to execute well and manage costs, resulting in solid profitability with core operating profit up 14%. It is unfortunate that something outside of our control impacted our sales, but thanks to solid execution, it appears to be mostly behind us at this point, and we are moving forward with excitement about the balance of the year with confidence in the long-term potential of this business.
As we prepare to separate the China business, there is a lot to be excited about. First, the strategic partnership we previously announced with Primavera and Ant Financial is a tremendous asset and competitive advantage. Both are well-respected  Chinese institutions that are ideal partners for Yum China as a stand-alone public company operating in China.
Second, we are the undisputed category leader in digital engagement. We're building the world's greatest loyalty program with a large and growing database to help us drive future sales.
Our mobile payment has doubled from 10% to 20% of sales over the last year, and with Ant Financial's Alipay, will continue to grow.
Third, delivery. We currently offer delivery from more than 4,000 units across China. This is an unmatched and growing platform that affords further growth opportunities. 
And finally, idea sharing. As we get closer to separation, what is ironic is Yum! and the China Division have never been closer from a know-how and idea-sharing perspective, and this will continue post-separation.  You'll hear a lot more about all of this next week.
Now on to our 3 brand divisions, where I'm excited to say we are on track to deliver another year of strong operating profit growth, which is a testament to the talent and capabilities within the global team. For the third quarter, we are very pleased that, in aggregate, our business outside of China produced 11% core operating profit growth ahead of our expectations. In what has been an overall sluggish environment for the QSR category, particularly in the United States, 2 of our 3 brands have been delivering solid results and have continued to do so into the fourth quarter thus far.
Our KFC Division excelled. Same-store sales grew 4% in the third quarter or 7% on a 2-year stack. Core operating profit grew 19% in the quarter, and the division opened 138 new international restaurants in 42 countries. 70% of our new international openings were in emerging markets.
System sales in international developed markets grew 4% and international emerging markets grew 12%. This brand continued to perform in nearly every market globally, with particular strength in Russia, Continental Europe and Africa this quarter. And we remain on track to open at least 475 net new international units this year, and the U.S. is full steam ahead on its remodel program.
In particular, I'm pleased with the third quarter results out of the U.S., which were driven by the Extra Crispy campaign. We continue to gain traction with our strategy here, and our 6% same-store sales growth lapped 2% growth in the prior year. 2-year comps of plus 8 in the quarter are category leading, and this is our ninth consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth in the U.S. and speaks to the importance of an aligned franchise system and strong marketing adhering to core innovation and value.
The KFC U.S. team, in partnership with the franchisees, have really turned this brand around in the last 2 years, and the brands' continued strength in a sluggish QSR market is commendable. This achievement in the U.S. gives me confidence in continued global success as we share best practices across the system.
Pizza Hut system sales in constant currency were flat, and same-store sales declined 1% in the third quarter. The U.S. market was influenced by an unsuccessful promotion and the competitive environment. As we saw earlier this year, we know the brand can perform when the right product is combined with compelling value and the messaging is distinctive and disruptive, and I am confident in our ability to turn around the Pizza Hut U.S. business. We believe the fundamentals are being put in place and now execution is the focus.
Our international business of Pizza Hut saw system sales growth of 3% in constant currency and flat same-store sales growth in the quarter. Across our international markets, we are leveraging a wealth of proven, ownable value bets  to address specific consumer needs and rolling them out rapidly from one market to another.
In Thailand, for example, we took a bold approach to value, leveraging in any construct in tandem with significant product and operations improvements and have seen double-digit sales and transaction growth since launch.
Other markets now are taking learnings from this significant turnaround. This traction gives us confidence that the international Pizza Hut turnaround is underway.
Finally, I'm very pleased with Taco Bell's strong performance in the third quarter. Core operating profit grew 9%. U.S. same-store sales grew 3%, even as we lapped a plus 4% from the prior year. This included 1 percentage point of growth in transactions or over 2 percentage points better than the industry. Our strategy of bracketing value with the $1.49 steak flatbread sandwiches and $5 boxes, which provided abundant value, allow us to grow transactions and boost check.
Furthermore, we saw impressive results with our breakfast offering in the quarter as transactions grew 14% driven by our $1 breakfast menu. We're now taking the learnings from this success in promoting our all-day dollar menu. It all goes to show that when you remain committed to the core and value, the results follow. 
In addition to being a clear leader in offering low prices, we are now the -- leading the category in good value for money.
As for Taco Bell development, we remain on plan with at least 300 new restaurant openings for the year. Taco Bell international is an area of enviable growth potential, and we are excited to see the momentum behind this strategic objective. While it's early days, we believe that this could be a meaningful driver of long-term growth and look forward to continued progress.
So 2016 marks the beginning of a massive transformation for Yum!, a transformation that has been years in the making. The first step is the October 31 separation of the China business. This business began with the first KFC in Beijing nearly 30 years ago and has grown to over 7,000 restaurants in over 1,100 cities. Today, it is one of China's largest employers with over 400,000 employees serving over 2 billion customers every year. In short, this business is a powerhouse with unrivaled growth opportunities in the world's fastest-growing major economy.
As we announced on September 2, investments by Primavera Capital Group and Ant Financial brings strategic value and additional local and digital knowhow immediately and over the long term.
In addition, on September 15, we announced a world-class Board of Directors for Yum China with Dr. Fred Hu, Chairman and Founder of Primavera Capital Group, to serve as Nonexecutive Chairman. I have the utmost confidence that this board will offer the market insights and strategic vision required to enable Yum China to reach its full potential.
Including the Primavera investment, Yum China will have a very strong financial foundation, over $900 million of cash and no external debt on the balance sheet at spin. I couldn't be more optimistic about the future of this business or the great foundation that is now in place for them to begin their journey as an independent company, and I look forward to watching them succeed for many years to come.
So in conclusion. At new Yum!, the massive transformation will continue as we become a unique and focused world-class franchisor. Following the separation,  we will be roughly 93% franchised with a clear path to reach our stated goal of becoming at least 96% franchised by the end of 2017.
We've given a great deal of thought towards creating a high-growth, asset-light efficient company best positioned for accelerating growth in global system sales, operating profits and cash flow. And we're excited to share more details behind our thinking here next Tuesday, so stay tuned.
And with that, gives me pleasure to hand over to David Gibbs."

In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: our third quarter operating results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our recapitalization and the separation of our China business.Let's start with a high-level",1416,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll cover 3 areas: our third quarter operating results, our outlook for 2016 and an update on our recapitalization and the separation of our China business.
Let's start with a high-level overview of our third quarter performance. We're pleased Yum! Brands delivered year-over-year core operating profit growth of 11% in the quarter. In aggregate, our 3 brand divisions, excluding China, delivered 11% core operating profit growth in the quarter, led by 19% growth at KFC, partially offset by soft results at Pizza Hut. This growth is especially impressive given how competitive and sluggish the QSR category has been recently, particularly in the U.S.
Combined, our brands are outperforming the category, and we're pleased to see relative outperformance continuing thus far in the fourth quarter.
In our China Division, core operating profit grew 14% despite a 1% decline in same-store sales. The implementation of a value-added tax and continued tight cost controls materially benefited unit economics and enabled us to offset inflation and sales deleverage primarily resulting from the South China Sea ruling. As Greg mentioned, tougher back-of-quarter laps were compounded by the incident. While it is very difficult to be precise given all the moving pieces in our China business right now, our best estimate is this had a 400 to 500 basis points impact to our same-store sales in the quarter. 
It was most severe in July, primarily affecting our stores in lower-tier cities where the protests were more intense. The impact continues to dissipate, and sales have recovered off their lows.
Overall, for the quarter, EPS before special items grew 9%, including a 6 point negative impact from foreign currency changes.
Now I'd like to discuss our 2016 outlook. As Greg mentioned, we're raising our 2016 full year core operating profit growth guidance to at least 15% from at least 14%, including the 53rd week. This increase is supported by strength in our overall business outside China and healthy profitability in China despite temporary sales headwinds as we discussed.
As expected, third quarter margins in the China Division benefited due in part to the diligent effort across our entire China team in implementing the new VAT. In each of the last 2 quarters, we highlighted the changes to China's retail tax structure, which became effective on May 1. The benefit to our business continues to fluctuate from month to month as we refine our ability to get input credits and as the interpretation of the new tax code becomes clearer.
As a result, we will not provide precise guidance for the future benefit of this tax change other than to say that we expect it to be worth at least 2 points of margin upside on a go-forward basis.
We still expect full year China restaurant margins of at least 17%.  This reflects the ongoing benefit of the VAT, offset by labor and commodity inflation as well as our investment back into generating sales.
Now let's talk about development. Yum! remains one of the leading global retail developers. In the third quarter, we added over 475 total new units, taking our year-to-date global new restaurant openings to nearly 1,150 units. Consistent with prior years, development will be weighted more towards the fourth quarter as we expect to accelerate our pace of development balance of year, further laying the groundwork for future growth. For the full year, we expect China to add about 525 gross new units and for new Yum! Brands to add over 2,175 units, which will continue to include China.
With regards to refranchising, we've committed to becoming at least 96% franchised by the end of 2017. Once we finalize the separation of our China business, we will be 93% franchised. Over the last 4 quarters, we refranchised nearly 470 restaurants. In the third quarter specifically, we refranchised 94 stores, 48 of which were Pizza Hut restaurants. Refranchising allows us to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders while reducing G&A expenditure as field-level employees are typically absorbed into our franchise system. We look forward to sharing our strategy for improving overall efficiency at Yum! with you next week.
One housekeeping item. Unallocated corporate G&A in the quarter, excluding special items, was $44 million with the increase versus last year largely due to timing. For the full year, we expect this to come in closer to $205 million, excluding special items.
Now I'd like to talk about our capital structure. In connection with the pending separation of our China business, we are optimizing the capital structure of Yum!. We closed the previously announced $2.5 billion new senior secured credit facilities and $2.1 billion senior unsecured notes offering on June 16, which was 5 days into our third quarter.
As a result, we have total debt outstanding of $9.2 billion. Our intention is to maintain leverage equal to about 5x EBITDA at new Yum!, while Yum China should have over $900 million in cash and no external debt at separation.
In the quarter, we also swapped a portion of our floating rate debt to fixed, resulting in about 90% of our debt fixed for a total current blended rate of 4.75%.
With this in mind, we expect interest expense of about $300 million in 2016.
We're fully committed to returning cash to shareholders. Last December at our Analyst and Investor Day, we committed to returning approximately $6.2 billion of capital, excluding our ongoing dividend payments, between separation announcement and completion, which assumed a year-end 2016 separation of our China Division.
In connection with this, we have repurchased approximately 5.3 billion shares at an average price of $81, reducing our share count by approximately 15% as of October 4. We plan to return the remainder of our previously committed $6.2 billion of capital before year-end. Including our recently increased quarterly dividend, we have returned $5.2 billion to shareholders year-to-date.
Now I'd like to quickly update you on our China separation plans. We are on track to complete the separation after the close of business on October 31. On September 23, the board approved the separation of our China business via a dividend distribution of 1 share of Yum China common stock per each share of Yum! Brands common stock held at the close of business on October 19, the record date for the distribution.
We expect to complete the distribution of Yum China common stock to shareholders on October 31.
When-issued trading for both Yum! Brands and Yum China will begin on the NYSE on October 17, and Yum China will begin trading regular way as an independent company on November 1.
As Greg mentioned, we were pleased with the announced investment in Yum China by Primavera Capital and Ant Financial. They will make a $460 million strategic investment, reflecting an 8% discount to the volume-weighted  average trading price in days 31 through 60 following the separation of Yum China. Additionally, they will receive 2 warrant tranches, representing approximately 2% of equity value in each tranche with strike prices equating to Yum China equity values of $12 billion and $15 billion.
This is an attractive structure for shareholders as it minimizes upfront dilution and highlights the long-term value in Yum China as an investment.
More importantly, we are thrilled with the strategic partnership and the benefits this offers Yum China. Both Primavera and Ant Financial are well-respected Chinese institutions that are ideal partners. Dr. Fred Hu, who leads Primavera, will become the Nonexecutive Chairman of Yum China, and Ant Financial will have an observer seat. Given the value these ideal partners will bring to the table, we believe Yum China is set up for success immediately and over the long term.
So to wrap things up, we had an exogenous and temporary event hit China sales mid-quarter, but we're able to hold the line on operating profit in China. And with the strong performance of our brands outside of China in aggregate, we have line of sight to at least 15% core operating profit growth for the full year.
As Greg said, 2016 is a truly transformational year for Yum!. We're nearing completion of the separation of our China business and have secured strong strategic partners. We've enhanced our capital structure, and we've made progress on refranchising. We look forward to sharing additional details on these matters and more with you at our New York Investor Conference next Tuesday.
And with that, the team and I are happy to take your questions. Operator?"

So I guess the question I have is sort of twofold. One is, is there just a higher country risk now? And does that mean that the long-term targets of kind of 4% to 5% maybe are going to be harder to reach? And the second point is, is there an opportunity to make up some of that top line gap with faster unit growth? Because it looks like unit growth -- gross units is -- has continued to come down a little bit."

So trust me, we are very disappointed with the negative comps number. But this was very unusual. The first half of the year, we were trending very nicely. In fact, third quarter -- second quarter of this year was the fourth straight quarter of same-store sales growth. And in Q3, we were trending through the middle of the quarter very strongly. And then right around the 13th of July, this matter started, and we saw a very sharp and sudden decline in sales. The good news was that, thereafter, the recovery started almost immediately within 10 days or so, but it did have this impact. Two things. First is that unlike the food safety incidents, research that we've conducted has shown that there has been no damage whatsoever to the brand. Our trends have continued to improve. And I think the other point, which was mentioned  by both Greg and David, the spinoff coupled with the 2 very strong strategic partners, who have very deep respect in China, I think will help us in the longer term in issues and matters like this. I think if you are at the 11 October, Tuesday, Investor Meeting in New York, we'll give you more comfort as to why we feel that we can grow comps into the future. But had it not been for this incident, we would almost certainly have had comp growth in Q3. And we're expecting from this point onwards through the rest of the year to get back to growth. As far as new unit development is concerned, I think for the quarter, I think the impact was -- yes, it's --  it -- I don't see any particular reason why we will not have strong new unit growth. Again, we will share more details on the 11th. This year, as you know, we did take our Pizza Hut Dine-In build rate down from last year's 280 to about 150. And that was done -- 150 is still, on a base of 1,500, is about 10%. We felt that was the responsible thing to do, and to get Pizza Hut comps back, which are trending upwards. And once that is done, I think we can get back onto a strong growth path. So we don't see really a sort of ongoing decline in our union of build rate  in China at all."

There's no doubt the plus 6 rolling or the plus 2 and the plus 8, it definitely means we're growing share in the category, which is great. I put it down to -- and if you think what we're in, in  the quarter, we essentially ran Extra Crispy chicken, which we've had for over 40 years  in the $5 box and $20 bucket. I think what it demonstrates is when you have distinctive and disruptive positioning and breakthrough advertising with great product quality and very good operations, I think what you'll see is you can get the customer to actually come in more often. And so I think that was certainly the KFC story. I was particularly proud of what the Taco Bell team did, how quickly they reacted to the Q2 minus 1 number to change the calendar for Q3. It's not easy to do. So a huge call out to the Taco Bell team for basically getting us back  $1.49 flatbread, the Triple Double Crunchwrap, which did incredibly well and obviously then putting it into $5 box. So I think the answer is we are back to the core, selling great core products. We've got distinctive and disruptive advertising and positioning, and I think that's the cornerstone to success."

As you probably know, we did divert capital to store refurbishment in a very large way, so we'll give more details on the 11th, but we've improved the look and feel of our stores quite considerably, especially in the larger cities. We did focus on our core bestsellers, so we did simplify the menu just a little bit, but the core bestsellers, including fried chicken, the Zinger sandwich were dialed up, and that is having a beneficial effect. Our key price points, especially the crucial RMB 29, RMB 39 price points, which are the last 2 price points in this market. And lastly, digital. I think digital has been probably the most significant growth area for us, and our cashless payments have grown from 10% to 20% in a very short period of  time. We expect that to continue as we partner up with people like Alipay to expand it. And our loyalty programs are significant now, so the percentage of transactions that are being scanned at the till for loyalty points is very significant. And overall, spend on digital has become a very large part of our total marketing spend. All this put together is having good results, and we've accordingly geared our calendar for the balance of this year as well as for next year. So both on KFC and Pizza Hut, a considerable attention to core product, key price points and continued in-store execution, and that really is what's working."

But I'd let Micky talk a little bit more about some of those promotions and the impact we're expecting on the business."

Well as you know, it's a 4-month quarter, and we've passed September, which is a tough lap for us. We're in the middle of the Golden Week, which is the second most significant holiday after the Chinese New Year, and that's going well at this time. It's a peak selling period and comps are good. But after what we've got in the month of November is a winning item that has been tested very well and done well in the past, extended through November, which is the snack platter, which is a good example of how KFC in China is unique in the sense that the snack platter has got 4 parts to it. Three of them are familiar to people from anywhere in the world, which is french fries, popcorn, chicken and hot wings. But the fourth part is squid, fried squid, which is quite unique to here. It's done very well in the past, and we've got that at a very keen price point of RMB 29, so we feel very good about our November calendar. And then in December, for the first time last year, we started a Christmas promotion. Christmas is not a traditional holiday in China. And the response was pretty good. So we're -- we've taken that to another level this year with covering the entire gamut from low-end meals at RMB 35 to buckets for families at RMB 98, and with a lot of innovation taken from winning items from around the world. So December, I think, for the Christmas promotion, looks particularly strong. And that's what give us confidence in the balance of the quarter. So obviously, we can -- we'll report Q4 when Q4 is done, but at this time, felt the incident, we feel, is behind us and the Golden Week is going quite well and the calendar looks really strong."

Those -- that's how you win even in a sluggish market. And I think there are lessons that we're also applying around the rest of the world. I mean, KFC outside the U.S. had just a gangbuster quarter, probably with the exception of Japan, developed markets, developing markets. You can ask me any country, and I'll show you incredible sales growth. So I think the global growth of the KFC brand and the momentum it has and the strength that we've now got in the U.S. sets that up for particular strength. Taco Bell, as I said, across all the facets you want a brand to be strong at, is just powering ahead.

And as I said, in any market, strong markets or sluggish markets, there will always be winners and losers, and I think having the right tactics in order to ensure that you win is what's critical. And obviously in the quarter, 2 of the brands delivered, and we've got lessons from that. And I'm very confident that we can continue to apply those lessons to KFC and to Taco Bell and that we can apply those lessons to Pizza Hut, and there'll be a lot more on the Pizza Hut story that we'll talk about next Tuesday. And I know the Pizza Hut team is looking forward to telling you about their plans to reignite growth in that brand as well."

Specifically, if you could provide the U.S. company-owned number relative to the system, which I think you provided last quarter, as a way to kind of see some of the traction from the initiatives? And anything you could share on the easy and better initiatives or the local value message would be helpful."

I think the good news is next Tuesday, Artie will take you through a lot about the whole easy and better strategy for the U.S. And obviously, Milind  will talk about what's happening internationally. What I can tell you is that in the quarter, the company same-store sales were 3 points ahead of the system, and transactions were 6 points ahead of the system. So again, the company outperformed the system, and obviously, we're working with the franchisees to bring them along to sort of deliver that improved performance across the entire brand."

We tracked -- we repeatedly tracked those through industry monitors as well as we're  looking at it very closely just internally to make sure we don't miss an opportunity. The gross merchandise volume is still growing. For us, the total delivery volume is approximately 10% of our sales. So circa $600 million, $700 million a year will  go through delivery. The percentage that goes through aggregators, I don't have -- it's not a very large percentage of what we have. Pizza Hut Dine-In is significant in both growth to aggregate, but for the rest of it, it's mainly our own delivery systems. We are listed with the major aggregators, so we are present in all of them. It is true that there's been a lot of fallout because the profitability of the aggregators reportedly is very negative. So of course, the big 3 companies are still continuing to support their delivery engines. But the rate of discounting, et cetera, I think has moderated over time, but it still is a growth area."
