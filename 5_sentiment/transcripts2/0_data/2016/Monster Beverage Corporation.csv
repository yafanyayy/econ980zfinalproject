We are continuing to make good progress with the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola Bottlers Worldwide. We have successfully concluded negotiations with Coca-Cola Bottlers in many countries and are planning to launch Monster with these bottlers in most of their international markets in the near future. We have substantially completed the transition of Monster in most of the 28 countries serviced by the Coca-Cola Group and are currently the process of transitioning the remaining countries. We have successfully launched Monster in Russia and the moving forward with plans to commence production and distribution of Monster in Nigeria through Coca-Cola Hellenic. We have also recently successfully transitioned our Monster brand in both Spain and Portugal to Coca-Cola Iberian partners. We are continuing to transition in a number of countries in Africa to Coca-Cola Bottlers. This process will continue through the remainder of 2016. We also reached agreement with Coca-Cola for distribution of Monster within the countries with foreword in their Coca-Cola territory, which includes Turkey and 10 other countries. We have reached agreement with the Coca-Cola which distributes Coca-Cola products in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Fiji. Finally, we have reached agreement with Big, the 100% owned Coca-Cola bottle that operates in a number of international markets for the distribution of Monster in the majority of their markets. 
We've also made good progress in our discussions with, Hawker and other bottlers operating in South America. Our plan to launch Monster in China are continuing to move forward with Coca-Cola bottlers. We received preliminary approval from Chinese authorities for our Monster Energy formula and are currently awaiting formal approval. We had successful a trial run in China and are currently engaged in additional trial runs. We are stock planning to launch Monster in China later in the second quarter of 2016 but the launch could be delayed by various factors including regulatory approvals. We've also made good progress in the repositioning, repackaging and reformulation of many of the Coca-Cola energy brands that were acquired as a result of the Coca-Cola transaction. As announced earlier in the week, we are pleased with our pending acquisition of the concentrated flavor business operated by American Fruits and Flavors in California for $690 million in cash, subject to adjustment. The acquisition agreement was entered into on February 22, 2016 and we expect to close this transaction by the end of the first quarter of 2016. AFF is our a principal supplier of concentrated flavors for our Monster Energy drink line. Our purchases from AFF represent approximately 87% of their sales. In 2015, AFF's total net revenues were approximately $168 million and its adjusted operating income was approximately -- AFF was approximately $87 million. It's our intention that AFF will continue to operate from its existing premises in Southern California and will continue to carry on its business of supplying concentrated flavors to third-party customers as it has in the past. Following the transaction, we will own the vast majority of the proprietary flavors that we used in our Monster Energy drinks including, in particular, the flavors used for our Original Green Monster Energy drink, Lo-Carb Monster Energy and Monster Energy Absolutely Zero. The majority of the flavors used that our Java Monster and Ultra lines as well as flavors used in many other Monster Energy drinks. we intend to continue to purchase concentrated flavors from other flavor suppliers who both our existing products and new products we developed. Put simply, we intend to operate in the same way as we have in the past to ensure that we are able to develop and secure the best flavors in the future and to continue to excel at innovation. The acquisition of AFF will be mutually accretive to the company from the transactions closing. The location of AFF's facilities in Southern California will facilitate our management of the business and the integration of AFF business into the Monster organization. We're Where excited by this acquisition which aligns us with our principal flavor supplier and will enable us to expand and secure most of our flavors at an economical costs. 
Our board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $1.75 billion of the company's outstanding common stock, which combined with the current outstanding authorization of $250 million remaining from the September 2015 repurchase program, totals $2 billion. We are planning to move forward with the return on capital in 2016 to our for shareholders pursuant to repurchases which could be effected pursuant to open market transactions and modified Dutch auction tender offer, accelerated share repurchases, probably negotiated cross-sections or otherwise subject to applicable laws, regulations and approvals. The timing of share repurchases or a modified Dutch auction tender offer will depend on a variety of factors including market conditions and may be suspend discount continued at any time. 
Obviously, the company is expected to continue to generate cash from operations. In the fourth quarter, sales in the beverage industry in general and of culminated beverages in particular continue to show weakness. However, the sales of Monster Energy products accelerated in January. In the fourth quarter, the company achieved record growth sales of $743.2 million, up 6.7% from $696.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Net sales were $645.4 million, up 6.6% from $605.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Net sales in the fourth quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $19.7 million. Net sales were also adversely affected by the buy in before the price increase effect of August 31, 2015 which had an estimated impact of approximately $11 million by de-stocking in Spain and South Africa by existing international distributors in anticipation of our transition to Coca-Cola Bottlers in these countries and also by a reduction in inventory in Germany during the fourth quarter, all of which had an estimated impact of $11.8 million. In total, such amounts had a negative impact on net sales of approximately $42.5 million in the fourth quarter. The increase in net sales after adjusting for these items would have made approximately 13.6% as compared to the reported increase of 6.6%. 
Our original Green Monster Energy drink continue to perform well at retail. Retail sales of the Ultra continue to show good growth in the United States during the fourth quarter as did our Java Monster line. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales were 62.5% as compared to 54.8% for the comparable 2014 fourth quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to increased net sales of the Concentrate segment which has higher gross margins than the Finished Product segment, the disposal of our nonenergy brands and the price increase on our 16 ounce Monster Energy drinks effective August 31, 2015. Distribution cost as a percentage of net sales were 3.2% as compared to 4.1% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.9% compared to 9.3% in the same quarter a year ago. Sponsorship and endorsement cost, advertising expense principally for strategic brands, merchandisers delayed costs, social media expenses and permissions, were all higher in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. General and administrative costs including distributed terminations as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 fourth quarter were 11% as compared to 9.5% for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Payroll expenses were up $6.1 million due partly to increased staffing in connection with our acquisition of the strategic brands. Stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $3 million higher in the 2015 fourth quarter as compared to the same quarter last year. Distributed termination costs were $3.3 million higher in the fourth quarter as compared to the 2014 fourth quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation considering the advertising, marketing and promotion, ingredients, usage safety and sale of the company's products was $3.1 million higher in the 2015 fourth quarter as compared to the 2014 4th quarter. In addition, other legal costs were $1.8 million higher for the 2015 4th quarter. 
On a pro forma basis, in effect of the items above, operating income for the quarter would have been approximately 31% higher than the reported operating income for the same quarter in 2014. Our effective tax rate increased from 34.7% to 39.5% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the reduction in the domestic production deduction. On an ongoing basis, we expect that our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36.5%. Net income was $138.7 million compared to net income of $125.3 million during the fourth quarter of last year, an increase of 10.7%. However, due to the substantial increase in share capital, diluted shares increased from $174.9 million to $205.8 million. Following the issuance of shares to Coca-Cola. Diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.67 in the -- for the fourth quarter from $0.72 in the 2014 comparable quarter. 
Turning to full-year results. The company achieved record gross sales of $3.1 billion for the full year, up 9.9% from $2.8 billion in 2014. Net sales were up 10.5% from $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. Net sales for the year were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates totaling $84.3 million for the year. The acceleration of deferred revenue added $39.8 million to net sales in 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 60% for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 54.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating income was up 19.6% to $893.7 million from $747.5 million in 2014. Pro forma operating income as adjusted for acceleration of deferred revenue of $39.8 million, distributed termination costs of $224 million, the Coca-Cola transaction expenses of $15.5 million, as well $161.5 million from the gain on the sale of the non-enmity business was $931.9 million, an increase of [indiscernible] 2014. Operations from outside of North America delivered operating income of $51.5 million for the 2015 full year as compared to operating income of $37.8 million for the 2014 full year. Our effective tax rate increased to 38.7% in 2015 from 35.2% in 2014. Net income was $546.7 million, up 13.2% over net income of $483.2 million in 2014 and diluted earnings per share increased 2.4% to $2.84 from $2.77 in 2014.

Net sales to customers outside the United States were $145.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $133.8 million in the corresponding quarter of 2014, an increase of 8.6%.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covered single months, which is a short period that  may often be materially influenced, positively and/or negatively by sales in the offshore convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the offshore chain in Turkey may materially influence by promotions that maybe undertaken in that chain by 1 or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activity could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13 week period ended December 2015, the OXXO 13 week period's vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 12.7% to 13.5% in Great Britain. From 17.8% to 20.3% in France. From 10.6% to 13.6% in Germany.

According to IRI, Monster's market share increased in the 13 weeks to the end of December 2015 from 29.7% to 50.5%. 
I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be use as a guide [indiscernible] channels Nielsen and IRI in the EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, for the month of December 2015, Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 20.3% as compared to 14.2% last year, and in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of November declined from 5.7% to 3.7% as compared to the same period last year.

For the top 20 EMEA markets which account for approximately 92% of EMEA Monster volume. Nielsen reports that in the 13 weeks at the end of December 2015, Monster's retail value sales grew 19.3%. According to, for the month of December 2015, the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 32.7% to 38.6%. The launch of Monster Energy Ultra in Japan continues to be a positive driver for the brand. Net sales for the Finished Products segment in the fourth quarter, formally the DSD segment but excluding Peace Tea, were negatively impacted by approximately $16 million of foreign currency movements in the fourth quarter and by approximately $74.1 million for the year. Net sales from the Finished Products segment in the fourth quarter were also adversely affected by the buy in of approximately $11 million before the price increase on August 31, 2015 and by de-stocking in the amount of approximately $11.8 million in Spain and South Africa and the reduction in inventory in Germany as described above. 
On a pro forma basis, net sales for the Finished Products segment for the fourth quarter after adjustments for these items would have increased 8.5% from $574.8 million to $623.9 million in the quarter. On a pro forma basis, after adjusting for foreign currency movements of $74.1 million and $39.8 million of acceleration of deferred revenues, net sales for the Finished Products segment for the year would have increased 10.3% from $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion. Net sales for the company's new Concentrate segment were negatively impacted by approximately $3.7 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter and by approximately $10.2 million for the year. On a pro forma basis after adjustments from such foreign currency movements, net sales of the Concentrate segment would have been $64.1 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2015 and $133.5 million for the year. 
As a result of the Coca-Cola transaction which closed on June 12, 2015, there were no sales for the other segment during the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to $30.8 million of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2014 and for the full year of 2015, net sales for the other segment was $60.8 million as compared to $150.4 million in 2014. 
Europe, Middle East and Africa net sales in the fourth quarter in euros increased 26.3% and in dollars increased 10.2% over the same period last year.

Despite the de-stocking issues described earlier, EMEA overall is now operating well and we have made good strides in achieving increased sales, distribution levels and in storage execution including securing distribution, buy Coca-Cola bottles in new countries and territories within the region. The launch of Mega Monster in 553 mL cans with the resealable lid in a limited additional markets in Europe has been successful and is largely incremental to our original Monster 500 mL sized products. Additionally, we have continued the launch of a limited number of SKUs in the Ultra line in a number of countries in Europe with positive initial response. Ultra will be launched in a further 15 markets in Europe in the first half of 2016. Monster sales completions from our distribution partners to customers in the fourth quarter of 2015 were up 18.9% in EMEA and in particular, sales depletions experience double-digit growth in Spain, Germany and South Africa. In Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden, Monster achieved increased sales gains at retail las well as increased market share. In many international markets, we are independent distribution partners anticipated the Monster brand being transitioned to the Coca-Cola network, so there was remarkably lower compared to last year than levels in markets which were already been distributed. We were already being distributed by the Coca-Cola Bottlers system also as compared to last year. We are pleased with the initial sales and distribution gains following the December launch of Monster in Russia. The rollout of Monster in Russia is currently taking place. 
In Asia Pacific, net sales for the quarter increased 52.6% in local currencies and 37.2% in dollars. For the year, net sales increased 45.1% in local currencies and 27% in dollars. Net sales in Mexico, Central and South America and the Caribbean for the quarter increased 28.8% in local currencies and 10.7% in dollars. And for the year, increased 29.8% in local currencies and 15.7% in dollars compared to 2014. Monster sales in Brazil were negatively impacted due largely to the overall difficult economic and market conditions, together with the uncertainties for distributors relating to the Coca-Cola transaction. In Chile, sales of Monster continue to show good growth. Net sales in the quarter increased 114% over the fourth quarter of last year and for 2015 increased 29.1% over 2014. In Mexico, net sales for the fourth quarter increased 24.4% in local currency and 5.4% in dollars as compared to the same quarter last year. And in 2015, net sales in Mexico increased 14.2% in local currency and 10% -- 10.2% in dollars as compared to 2014.

We are moving ahead of production in India and anticipate reentering the market in India later in 2016. 
As mentioned earlier, we are optimistic that we will be able to finalize agreements with Coca-Cola Bottlers in numerous countries in the near future. We are also continuing to evaluate production opportunity with Coca-Cola Bottlers both in the U.S. and internationally, which we believe will yield cost reductions. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $2.2 billion compared to $370.3 million at December 31, 2014. Short-term investments of $744.6 million compared to $781.1 million at December 31, 2014. Long term investment decreased $15.3 million from $42.9 million at December 31,2014. All optional securities have now been redeemed in full and are no longer included in either short or long-term investments. Days outstanding for account receivable were 43.2 days at December 31, 2015 and 36.4 days at December 31, 2014. Inventories decreased to $156.1 million from $174.6 million at December 31, 2014. Average days of inventory was 58 days at December 31, 2015, which is slightly higher than 57.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2014. During the 2015 4th quarter, we launched Ultra Black, which is previously sold last year on a limited time basis through a single convenience and gas chain. It has now been made available to the general public. In the fourth quarter, we also launched Pipeline internationally. In the first quarter of 2016, we launched Salted Caramel Java Monster and early in the process, we're launching our new Gronk Energy drink. We are planning to launch additional new products in 2016. Gross sales in January 2016 in dollars were approximately 9.5% higher than in January 2015. In local currencies, gross sales in January 2016 were approximately 12.2% higher than in January 2015. January 2015 gross sales included the all warehouse division at Peace Tea. [indiscernible] a gain that sells in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionate impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores and should not necessarily be imputed to or brought as an indicative of results for the fourth quarter or any future period. Income [indiscernible] I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. 1, our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the propriety formulas of products. This transaction will immediately be accretive to the company's earnings. 2, the board has authorized a new repurchase program of up to $1.75 billion of its equity securities, in addition to the $250 million available under the previously authorized $500 million share repurchase program. once implemented, the effect of this repurchase program will be to substantially reduced the number of shares of common stock outstanding and thereby, earnings on a per share basis. 3, North American and international gross margins remain healthy and continue to improve. 4, the U.S. Nielsen market statistics and equivalent market statistics for many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is invariably growing ahead of the category. 5, the new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales. We believe that the repositioning of our Juice Monster and Punch Monster lines continue to be positive. 6, we are particularly be pleased with our performance in our international markets. 7, we are successfully transitioned a number of companies to Coca-Cola Bottlers and we have reached in advance stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola Bottlers for the second quarter of 2016. 
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you."

On your first question, I think you know that we are conservative folk when it comes to borrowing and we took a decision and the board took a decision that we would rather maintain a cash positive situation, hence the amount of the buyback. So the results of the buyback will mean that we will not have to go into borrowings. So that's the answer to your first question. The answer to your second question is the $87 million operating income that we discussed, is the operating income in 2015. Some of the customers may in fact choose not to continue with the company. But we account for 87% of the company's business and the business that we place with AFF is indeed profitable to them. So as you model, I think a good chunk of that $87 million could be taken into enhancing operating income for the consolidated organization. But as results of the other 13% that's really too premature to say but the number will be determined in due course."

Nielsen, I just, as you know, scan data and therefore, that's happening. And then, your demand for retailers, the list is a big promotion and then, also less choppy than our demand. Our demand are really, clearly are demand from our customers is choppy and that choppiness has been exacerbated during the last 12 -- probably 12 months or so. But because of all these announcements, because of the changes, different bottlers or distributors have different policies and holding inventory, some bought up extra inventory because they were just, I think anticipated being canceled and having their own mind that somehow that would give them a longer period to sell or different opportunities to sell and then, you've got to deal with that inventory situation and there are a lot of independent bottlers and that's part of the issue, there was no consistent pattern. And that really is what has happened. And so obviously, we can only report our revenues as they are and as they come into us and try and match them as well. So we believe that the -- literally, if you're looking to the trends, the more important trends are not our reports over the last 3 or 4 quarters but it is the Nielsen numbers, which are showing consistent numbers and shall include growth both in the U.S. and internationally. And that's what keeps us excited and comfortable as to what the direction of our brand and our brand is continuing to grow. As soon as we are able to get through all these transitions, get rid of the uncertainties, we will see long term growth that we think healthy growth for the brand and for the company."

We are introducing some new flavors and as Hilton indicated, we are packaging has change, something we're continuing to make changes. The most important, we've actually, decided on some strategic positioning for the brands and again, those are being changed. I mean, in many cases, one of their higher costs we have is for example advertising as it was in advertising embedded we've committed in order to and in the best interest of the brands, we continue to be responsible for it. It was committed before we took over but ultimately, we don't believe that, that was really beneficial for the brand and its not a direction we're going on. So we've changed those directions.

One of the things I -- I would like to just perhaps just stress on the call is I think there have been 1 or 2 questions that were just focus on why we did the transaction now and this timing and we have other things -- I just wanted to say that this was an acquisition and the strategy behind buying and getting ownership of our own flavors was something we considered very important and valuable as far back as a decade ago. And we have made approaches repeatedly. We have spent time trying to negotiate and really, it came about last year that I think the owner was approaching, getting close of his 80th birthday and for the first time after an approach, they decided they will accept the family through an approach and absolutely we took the opportunity when we could. It wasn't just a spur of the moment. This is what we saw been that we wanting to do for a very long time. And then, there has been some other suggestions whether if we can expect more acquisitions along this line. This isn't -- we don't think so. We're not going to give you, anything. But certainly, that is not our intention to get into the flavor business or concentrate business. We're not intending to expand it. This clearly was a very strategic acquisition for a supplier of almost all of our products. And for us, we're able to lock a pretty much most of these revenues or our revenues as we go forward every additional case of Monster we sell, that will be additional margin that we will be able to basically drop to our bottom line. So we see this as a very low risk and a very strategic acquisition. It's based in California. It's easy to manage. It's not a mess of stock. It's not a very capital intensive business, very low capital base, a very low working capital requirement. It is also strategic we felt to enable our flavor supplier to grow internationally with us. As a private company, they have faced some challenges in many countries and actually, having the resources and the expertise to have their flavors, get through the regulatory process in these countries and be able to import ingredients and supply them in country and not being an international base but yet their flavors were obviously, very, very important and key for us. So we believe that by aligning ourselves with them, we will be able to facilitate and help them on the regulatory side. We have quite a deep bench of stock. We understand regulatory issues and legal issues in the regulatory area. We also obviously, it's important for us as we expand into many more countries and many more distant places, we want to really have the opportunity to have -- put our best foot forward and have these key flavors come from this supplier and not to resort to alternative suppliers. With that being said, obviously, we do also intend to continue to work with our existing suppliers because we want everybody -- we want to obviously, ensure that we're still able to get cutting edge technology, cutting edge flavors, have everybody stay competitive whether it's in the AFF side or our independent supplier side. And so for all those reasons, we do believe this transaction to be very, very important for us going forward. 
Thanks, everybody for your continued interest in the company. We continue to obviously believe in the company and our growth strategy and are committed to continuing to develop and to differentiate our brands and to expand the company both at home and abroad and in particular, to expand distribution of our products and the strategic -- including the strategic brands through the Coca-Cola Bottler system internationally. We are particularly excited about the new opportunities that we have going forward with our robust portfolio to give us annuity across strategic brands. Thank you very much for your attendance."

We are continuing to make good progress with the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers worldwide. We have successfully concluded negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers in many countries and are planning to launch Monster with these bottlers in most of their international markets in the near future. We have substantially completed the transition of Monster in most of the 28 countries serviced by the Coca-Cola Hellenic Group and are currently the process of transitioning the remaining countries. We have successfully launched Monster in Russia and are moving forward with plans to commence production and distribution of Monster in Nigeria through Coca-Cola Hellenic. We have also recently successfully transitioned our Monster brand in both Spain and Portugal to Coca-Cola Iberian Partners. We are continuing to transition a number of countries in Africa to Coca-Cola bottlers. This process will continue through the remainder of 2016. We have also reached agreement with Coca-Cola Içecek for distribution of Monster within the countries which fall within their Coca-Cola territory, which includes Turkey and 10 other countries. We have reached agreement with the Coca-Cola Amatil, which distributes Coca-Cola products in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Fiji. Finally, we have reached agreement with Big, the 100% owned Coca-Cola bottler that operates in a number of international markets for the distribution of Monster in a majority of their markets. 
We've also made good progress in our discussions with FEMSA, AKO and other bottlers operating in South America. Our plans to launch Monster in China are continuing to move forward with the Coca-Cola bottlers there. We received preliminary approval from the Chinese authorities for our Monster Energy formula and are currently awaiting formal approval. We had a successful trial run in China and are currently engaged in additional trial runs. We are still planning to launch Monster in China late in the second quarter of 2016, but the launch could be delayed by various factors including regulatory approvals. We've also made good progress in the repositioning, repackaging and reformulation of many of the Coca-Cola energy brands that were acquired as a result of the Coca-Cola transaction. As announced earlier in the week, we are pleased with our pending acquisition of a concentrated flavor business operated by American Fruits & Flavors in California for $690 million in cash, subject to adjustment. The acquisition agreement was entered into on February 22, 2016, and we expect to close this transaction by the end of the first quarter of 2016. AFF is our principal supplier of concentrated flavors for our Monster Energy drink line. Our purchases from AFF represent approximately 87% of their sales. In 2015, AFF's total net revenues were approximately $168 million and its adjusted operating income was approximately -- sorry, AFF was approximately $87 million. It is our intention that AFF will continue to operate from its existing premises in Southern California and will continue to carry on its business of supplying concentrated flavors to third-party customers as it has in the past. Following the transaction, we will own the vast majority of the proprietary flavors that we use in our Monster Energy drinks including, in particular, the flavors used for our Original Green Monster Energy drink, Lo-Carb Monster Energy and Monster Energy Absolutely Zero, the majority of the flavors that are used in our Java Monster and Ultra lines as well as flavors used in many other Monster Energy drinks. We intend to continue to purchase concentrated flavors from other flavor suppliers who both our existing products and new products we develop. Put simply, we intend to operate in the same way as we have in the past to ensure that we are able to develop and secure the best flavors in the future and to continue to excel at innovation. The acquisition of AFF will be immediately accretive to the company from the transactions closing. The location of AFF's facilities in Southern California will facilitate our management of the business and the integration of AFF's business into the Monster organization. We're extremely excited by this acquisition, which aligns us with our principal flavor supplier and will enable us to expand and secure most of our flavors at an economical cost. 
Our board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $1.75 billion of the company's outstanding common stock, which, combined with the current outstanding authorization of $250 million remaining from the September 2015 repurchase program, totals $2 billion. We are planning to move forward with the return of capital in 2016 to our shareholders pursuant to repurchases, which could be effected pursuant to open market transactions and modified Dutch auction tender offer, accelerated share repurchases, probably negotiated cross-sections or otherwise, subject to applicable laws, regulations and approvals. The timing of share repurchases or a modified Dutch auction tender offer will depend on a variety of factors including market conditions and maybe suspend or discount continued at any time. 
Obviously, the company is expected to continue to generate cash from operations. In the fourth quarter, sales in the beverage industry in general and of carbonated beverages in particular continue to show weakness. However, the sales of Monster Energy products accelerated in January. In the fourth quarter, the company achieved record growth sales of $743.2 million, up 6.7% from $696.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Net sales were $645.4 million, up 6.6% from $605.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Net sales in the fourth quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $19.7 million. Net sales were also adversely affected by the buy-in before the price increase effect of August 31, 2015, which had an estimated impact of approximately $11 million by destocking in Spain and South Africa by existing international distributors in anticipation of our transition to Coca-Cola Bottlers in these countries and also by a reduction in inventory in Germany during the fourth quarter, all of which had an estimated impact of $11.8 million. In total, such amounts had a negative impact on net sales of approximately $42.5 million in the fourth quarter. The increase in net sales after adjusting for these items would have been approximately 13.6% as compared to the reported increase of 6.6%. 
Our original Green Monster Energy drink continue to perform well at retail. Retail sales of the Ultra line continue to show good growth in the United States during the fourth quarter as did our Java Monster line. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales were 62.5% as compared to 54.8% for the comparable 2014 fourth quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to increased net sales of the Concentrate segment, which has higher gross margins than the Finished Products segment, the disposal of our nonenergy brands and the price increase on our 16 ounce Monster Energy drinks effective August 31, 2015. Distribution cost as a percentage of net sales were 3.2% as compared to 4.1% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.9% compared to 9.3% in the same quarter a year ago. Sponsorship and endorsement costs, advertising expenses principally for strategic brands, merchandise display costs, social media expenses and commissions, were all higher in the fourth quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. General and administrative costs, including distributed terminations as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 fourth quarter were 11% as compared to 9.5% for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Payroll expenses were up $6.1 million due partially to increased staffing in connection with our acquisition of the strategic brands. Stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $3 million higher in the 2015 fourth quarter as compared to the same quarter last year. Distributed termination costs were $3.3 million higher in the fourth quarter as compared to the 2014 fourth quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation considering the advertising, marketing and promotion, ingredients, usage safety and sale of the company's product were $3.1 million higher in the 2015 fourth quarter as compared to the 2014 4th quarter. In addition, other legal costs were $1.8 million higher for the 2015 4th quarter. 
On a pro forma basis, in effect of the items above, operating income for the quarter would have been approximately 31% higher than the reported operating income for the same quarter in 2014. Our effective tax rate increased from 34.7% to 39.5% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the reduction in the domestic production deduction. On an ongoing basis, we expect that our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36.5%. Net income was $138.7 million compared to net income of $125.3 million during the fourth quarter of last year, an increase of 10.7%. However, due to the substantial increase in share capital, diluted shares increased from $174.9 million to $205.8 million. Following the issuance of shares to Coca-Cola. Diluted earnings per share decreased to $0.67 in the -- for the fourth quarter from $0.72 in the 2014 comparable quarter. 
Turning to full year results. The company achieved record gross sales of $3.1 billion for the full year, up 9.9% from $2.8 billion in 2014. Net sales were up 10.5% from $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. Net sales for the year were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates totaling $84.3 million for the year. The acceleration of deferred revenue added $39.8 million to net sales in 2015. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 60% for the year ended December 31, 2015, from 54.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Operating income was up 19.6% to $893.7 million from $747.5 million in 2014. Pro forma operating income is adjusted for acceleration of deferred revenue of $39.8 million, distributed termination costs of $224 million, the Coca-Cola transaction expenses of $15.5 million as well as $161.5 million from the gain on the sale of the non-energy business was $931.9 million, an increase of approximately $23.9 million over 2014. Operations from outside of North America delivered operating income of $51.5 million for the 2015 full year as compared to operating income of $37.8 million for the 2014 full year. Our effective tax rate increased to 38.7% in 2015 from 35.2% in 2014. Net income was $546.7 million, up 13.2% over net income of $483.2 million in 2014, and diluted earnings per share increased 2.4% to $2.84 from $2.77 in 2014. 
Gross sales to customers outside the United States were $177.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $160 million in the corresponding quarter of 2014, an increase of 10.6%. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $145.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $133.8 million in the corresponding quarter of 2014, an increase of 8.6%. Foreign exchange movements had an unfavorable impact on gross sales with approximately $23 million -- $23.1 million, and our net sales were approximately $19.7 million. Gross sales to customers outside the United States were $713.2 million in 2015 compared to $657.9 million in 2014, an increase of 8.4%. Net sales to customers outside the United States were $580.3 million in 2015 compared to $534.2 million in 2014, an increase of 8.6%. Foreign exchange movements had an unfavorable impact on gross sales of approximately $102.4 million and on net sales of approximately $84.3 million.

Sales in the OXXO chain in Turkey may be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activity should have a -- could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended December 2015, the OXXO 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 12.7% to 13.5% in Great Britain; from 17.8% to 20.3% in France; from 10.6% to 13.6% in Germany.

According to IRI, Monster's market share increased in the 13 weeks to the end of December 2015 from 29.7% to 30.5%. 
I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide for the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in the EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, for the month of December 2015 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 20.3% as compared to 14.2% last year. And in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of November declined from 5.7% to 3.7% as compared to the same period last year. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13 weeks to the end of December 2015, Monster's retail value sales grew 15.8% in Spain, 11.4% in South Africa and 41.8% in Germany. For the top 20 EMEA markets, which account for approximately 92% of EMEA Monster volume, Nielsen reports that in the 13 weeks to the end of December 2015, Monster's retail value sales grew 19.3%. According to INTAGE, for the month of December 2015, the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 32.6% to 38.6%. The launch of Monster Energy Ultra in Japan continues to be a positive driver for the brand. Net sales for the Finished Products segment in the fourth quarter, formally the DSD segment but excluding Peace Tea, were negatively impacted by approximately $16 million of foreign currency movements in the fourth quarter and by approximately $74.1 million for the year. Net sales from the Finished Products segment in the fourth quarter were also adversely affected by the buy-in of approximately $11 million before the price increase on August 31, 2015, and by destocking in the amount of approximately $11.8 million in Spain and South Africa and the reduction in inventory in Germany as described above. 
On a pro forma basis, net sales for the Finished Products segment for the fourth quarter after adjustments for these items would have increased 8.5% from $574.8 million to $623.9 million in the quarter. On a pro forma basis, after adjusting for foreign currency movements of $74.1 million and $39.8 million of acceleration of deferred revenues, net sales for the Finished Products segment for the year would have increased 10.3% from $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion. Net sales for the company's new Concentrate segment were negatively impacted by approximately $3.7 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter and by approximately $10.2 million for the year. On a pro forma basis after adjustment from such foreign currency movements, net sales for the Concentrate segment would have been $64.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, and $133.5 million for the year. 
As a result of the Coca-Cola transaction, which closed on June 12, 2015, there were no sales for the Other segment during the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to $30.8 million of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2014. And for the full year 2015, net sales for the Other segment was $60.8 million as compared to $150.4 million in 2014. 
Europe, Middle East and Africa net sales in the fourth quarter in euros increased 26.3% and in dollars increased 10.2% over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 44.2% in the same period last year to 53.4% during the quarter. For 2015, net sales in euros increased 30.5% and in dollars increased 8.8% over 2014. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 41.2% in 2014 to 48.4% during 2015. Despite the destocking issues described earlier, EMEA overall is now operating well and we have made good strides in achieving increased sales, distribution levels and in store execution including securing distribution by Coca-Cola bottlers in new countries and territories within the region. The launch of Mega Monster in 553 mL cans with the resealable lid in limited additional markets in Europe has been successful and is largely incremental to our original Monster 500 mL sized products. Additionally, we have continued the launch of a limited number of SKUs in the Ultra line in a number of countries in Europe with positive initial response. Ultra will be launched in a further 15 markets in Europe in the first half of 2016. Monster sales  depletions from our distribution partners to customers in the fourth quarter of 2015 were up 18.9% in EMEA, and in particular, sales depletions experienced double-digit growth in Spain, Germany and South Africa. In Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden, Monster achieved increased sales gains at retail as well as increased market share. In many international markets where our independent distribution partners anticipated the Monster brand being transitioned to the Coca-Cola network, sales levels were markedly lower compared to last year than sales levels in markets which were already being distributed. We were already being distributed by the Coca-Cola bottler system also as compared to last year. We are pleased with the initial sales and distribution gains following the December launch of Monster in Russia. The rollout of Monster in Russia is currently taking place. 
In Asia Pacific, net sales for the quarter increased 52.6% in local currencies and 37.2% in dollars. For the year, net sales increased 45.1% in local currencies and 27% in dollars. Net sales in Mexico, Central and South America and the Caribbean for the quarter increased 28.8% in local currencies and 10.7% in dollars, and for the year, increased 29.8% in local currencies and 15.7% in dollars compared to 2014. Monster sales in Brazil were negatively impacted due largely to the overall difficult economic and market conditions there, together with the uncertainties for distributors relating to the Coca-Cola transaction. In Chile, sales of Monster continue to show good growth. Net sales in the quarter increased 114% over the fourth quarter of last year, and for 2015, increased 29.1% over 2014. In Mexico, net sales for the fourth quarter increased 24.4% in local currency and 5.4% in dollars as compared to the same quarter last year. And in 2015, net sales in Mexico increased 14.2% in local currency and 10% in -- 10.2% in dollars as compared to 2014. In Japan, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 15.3% in local currency and 4.1% in dollars as compared to the same quarter last year. And in 2015, net sales in Japan increased 32.4% in local currency and 13.4% in dollars as compared to 2014. We are moving ahead of production in India and anticipate reentering the market in India later in 2016. 
As mentioned earlier, we are optimistic that we will be able to finalize agreements with Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries in the near future. We are also continuing to evaluate production opportunities with Coca-Cola bottlers both in the U.S. and internationally, which we believe will yield cost reductions. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $2.2 billion compared to $370.3 million at December 31, 2014. Short-term investments of $744.6 million compared to $781.1 million at December 31, 2014. Long-term investments decreased $15.3 million from $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. All auction rate securities have now been redeemed in full and are no longer included in either short- or long-term investments. Days outstanding for account receivables were 43.2 days at December 31, 2015, and 36.4 days at December 31, 2014. Inventories decreased to $156.1 million from $174.6 million at December 31, 2014. Average days of inventory was 58 days at December 31, 2015, which was slightly higher than 57.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2014.
During the 2015 fourth quarter, we launched Ultra Black, which was previously sold last year on a limited time basis through a single convenience and gas chain, but has now been made available to the general public. In the fourth quarter, we also launched Pipeline Punch nationally. In the first quarter of 2016, we launched Salted Caramel Java Monster, and early in the process, we're launching our new Gronk Energy drink. We are planning to launch additional new products in 2016.
Gross sales in January 2016 in dollars were approximately 9.5% higher than in January 2015. In local currencies, gross sales in January 2016 were approximately 12.2% higher than in January 2015. January 2015 gross sales included the old Warehouse division at Peace Tea. We cautioned again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores and should not necessarily be imputed to or brought in as indicative of our results for the full quarter or any future period.
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the propriety formulas for our principal products. This transaction will immediately be accretive to the company's earnings. Two, the board has authorized a new repurchase program of up to $1.75 billion of its equity securities, in addition to the $250 million available under the previously authorized $500 million share repurchase program. Once implemented, the effect of this repurchase program will be to substantially reduce the number of shares of common stock outstanding and thereby enhance earnings on a per share basis. Three, North American and international gross margins remain healthy and continue to improve. Four, the U.S. Nielsen market statistics and equivalent market statistics for many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is invariably growing ahead of the category. Five, the new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales. We believe that the repositioning of our Juice Monster and Punch Monster lines continue to be positive. Six, we are particularly pleased with our performance in our international markets. Seven, we have successfully transitioned a number of companies to Coca-Cola bottlers and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers from the second quarter of 2016. 
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you."

On the -- on your first question, I think you know that we are conservative folk when it comes to borrowing and we took a decision and the board took a decision that we would rather maintain a cash-positive situation, hence the amount of the buyback. So the results of the buyback will mean that we will not have to go into borrowings. So that's the answer to your first question. The answer to your second question is the $87 million operating income that we discussed is the operating income in 2015. Some of the customers may in fact choose not to continue with the company. But we account for 87% of the company's business and the business that we place with AFF is indeed profitable to them. So as you model, I think a good chunk of that $87 million could be taken into enhancing operating income for the consolidated organization. But as a result of the other 13%, it's really too premature to say, but the number will be determined in due course."

That's why we spend time on the call dealing with the Nielsen numbers and we've actually also referred to some of the sales out numbers from our distribution because that is more indicative of your ongoing and sort of more stable demand for our products. Nielsen are just, as you know, pure scan data, and therefore, that's the demand that's happening. And then, your demand from retailers, unless there's a big promotion, that's also less choppy than our demand. Our demands are really -- clearly, our demand, apart from our customers, is choppy and that choppiness has been exacerbated during the last 12 -- probably 12 months or so. But because of all these announcements, because of the changes, different bottlers or distributors have different policies in holding inventory. Some bought up extra inventory because they were just, I think, anticipated being canceled and have in their own minds that somehow that would give them a longer period to sell or different opportunities to sell and then you've got to deal with that inventory situation. And there are a lot of independent -- there were independent bottlers and that's part of the issue and there was no consistent pattern. And that really is what has happened. And so obviously, we can only report our revenues as they are and as they come into us and we try and match them as well. And so we believe that the -- literally, if you're looking to the trends, the more important trends are not our reports over the last 3 or 4 quarters but it is the Nielsen numbers, which are showing consistent numbers and shall include growth both in the U.S. and internationally. And that's what keeps us excited and makes us comfortable that -- as to the direction of our brand and our brand is continuing to grow. And so as soon as we are able to actually get through all these transitions, get rid of the uncertainties, we will see long-term growth that we think is a healthy growth for the brand and for the company."

We spoke earlier that we're repositioning a number of their brands. We -- or a number of our brands. We're repackaging them, and we have a number of marketing initiatives going with regard to those brands. So a lot of it is a lot of all of that.

And these things does take time to turn this around in different regions of the world. But we are doing that and we've got into it now. We are introducing some new flavors. And as Hilton indicated, our packaging has changed on some of them and we're continuing to make changes. The most important, we've actually decided on some strategic positioning for the brands, and again, those are being changed. I mean, in many cases, one of the higher costs we had was, for example, advertising. There was an advertising campaign that we've committed in order to, in the best interest of the brands, we continue to be responsible for it. It was committed before we took over. But ultimately, we don't believe that, that was really beneficial for the brand and it's not a direction we're going on. So we've changed those directions. So these are the changes that we are making, and long term, we believe we will stabilize and continue to grow these brands but in slightly different ways."

One of the things I would like to just perhaps just stress on the call is I think there have been 1 or 2 questions that were just focused as to why we did the transaction now and timing and we have other things, but I just wanted to say that this was an acquisition and the strategy behind buying and getting ownership of our own flavors was something we considered very important and valuable as far back as a decade ago. And we have made approaches repeatedly. We have spent time trying to negotiate. And really, it came about last year that I think the owner was approaching -- getting only close of his 80th birthday. And for the first time after an approach, they decided that they were receptive, the family, to an approach. And obviously, we took the opportunity when we could. It wasn't just spur of the moment. This is something we've been wanting to do for a very long time. And then there has been some other suggestions. You asked whether this is -- people, if we could expect more acquisitions along this line. This isn't -- we don't think so. We're not going to give you any [indiscernible] on anything. But certainly, that is not our intention to get into the flavor business or concentrate business. We're not intending to expand that. This clearly was a very strategic acquisition for a supplier of almost all of our products. And for us, we are able to lock up pretty much most of these revenues or our revenues as we sell -- as we go forward, every additional case of Monster we sell, that will be additional margin that we will be able to basically drop to our bottom line. So we see this as a very low risk and a very strategic acquisition. It's based in California. It's easy to manage. It's not a massive staff. It's not a very capital-intensive business, has a very low capital base, a very low working capital requirement. It is also strategic, we felt, to enable the -- our flavor supplier to grow internationally with us. As a private company, they had faced some challenges in many countries and actually having the resources and the expertise to have their flavors get through the regulatory process in these countries and be able to import ingredients, particular ingredients, and supply them in a country and not being an international base but yet their flavors were obviously very, very important and key for us. So we believe that by aligning ourselves with them, we will be able to facilitate and help them on the regulatory side. We have quite a deep bench of staff here who understand regulatory issues and legal issues in the regulatory area. We also obviously -- it's important for us. As we expand into many more countries and many more distant places, we want to really have the opportunity to have our best -- put our best foot forward and have these key flavors come from this supplier and not have to resort to alternative suppliers. With that being said, obviously, we do also still intend to continue to work with our existing suppliers because we want everybody -- we want to, obviously, ensure that we're still able to get cutting edge technology, cutting edge flavors, have everybody stay competitive, whether it's on the AFF side or our independent supplier side. And so for all those reasons, we do believe this transaction to be very, very important for us going forward. 
Thanks, everybody, for your continued interest in the company. We continue to, obviously, believe in the company and our growth strategy and are committed to continuing to develop and to differentiate our brands and to expand the company, both at home and abroad, and in particular, to expand distribution of our products and the strategic -- including the strategic brands through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally. We are particularly excited about the new opportunities that we have going forward with our robust portfolio together with our newly acquired strategic brands.

We are continuing to make good progress with the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers worldwide. We have successfully concluded negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers in many countries and are planning to launch Monster with these bottlers in most of their international markets in the near future. We have substantially completed the transition of Monster in most of the 28 countries serviced by the Coca-Cola Hellenic Group and are currently the process of transitioning the remaining countries. We have successfully launched Monster in Russia and are moving forward with plans to commence production and distribution of Monster in Nigeria through Coca-Cola Hellenic. We have also recently successfully transitioned our Monster brand in both Spain and Portugal to Coca-Cola Iberian Partners. We are continuing to transition a number of countries in Africa to Coca-Cola bottlers. This process will continue through the remainder of 2016. We have also reached agreement with Coca-Cola Içecek for distribution of Monster within the countries which fall within their Coca-Cola territory, which includes Turkey and 10 other countries. We have reached agreement with the Coca-Cola Amatil, which distributes Coca-Cola products in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Fiji. Finally, we have reached agreement with Big, the 100% owned Coca-Cola bottler that operates in a number of international markets for the distribution of Monster in a majority of their markets. 
We've also made good progress in our discussions with FEMSA, AKO and other bottlers operating in South America. Our plans to launch Monster in China are continuing to move forward with the Coca-Cola bottlers there. We received preliminary approval from the Chinese authorities for our Monster Energy formula and are currently awaiting formal approval. We had a successful trial run in China and are currently engaged in additional trial runs. We are still planning to launch Monster in China late in the second quarter of 2016, but the launch could be delayed by various factors including regulatory approvals. We've also made good progress in the repositioning, repackaging and reformulation of many of the Coca-Cola energy brands that were acquired as a result of the Coca-Cola transaction. As announced earlier in the week, we are pleased with our pending acquisition of a concentrated flavor business operated by American Fruits & Flavors in California for $690 million in cash, subject to adjustment. The acquisition agreement was entered into on February 22, 2016, and we expect to close this transaction by the end of the first quarter of 2016. AFF is our principal supplier of concentrated flavors for our Monster Energy drink line. Our purchases from AFF represent approximately 87% of their sales. In 2015, AFF's total net revenues were approximately $168 million and its adjusted operating income was approximately -- sorry, AFF was approximately $87 million. It is our intention that AFF will continue to operate from its existing premises in Southern California and will continue to carry on its business of supplying concentrated flavors to third-party customers as it has in the past. Following the transaction, we will own the vast majority of the proprietary flavors that we use in our Monster Energy drinks including, in particular, the flavors used for our Original Green Monster Energy drink, Lo-Carb Monster Energy and Monster Energy Absolutely Zero, the majority of the flavors that are used in our Java Monster and Ultra lines as well as flavors used in many other Monster Energy drinks. We intend to continue to purchase concentrated flavors from other flavor suppliers who bottle our existing products and new products we develop. Put simply, we intend to operate in the same way as we have in the past to ensure that we are able to develop and secure the best flavors in the future and to continue to excel at innovation. The acquisition of AFF will be immediately accretive to the company from the transactions closing. The location of AFF's facilities in Southern California will facilitate our management of the business and the integration of AFF's business into the Monster organization. We're extremely excited by this acquisition, which aligns us with our principal flavor supplier and will enable us to expand and secure most of our flavors at an economical cost. 
Our board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $1.75 billion of the company's outstanding common stock, which, combined with the current outstanding authorization of $250 million remaining from the September 2015 repurchase program, totals $2 billion. We are planning to move forward with the return of capital in 2016 to our shareholders pursuant to repurchases, which could be effective pursuant to open market transactions and modified Dutch auction tender offer, accelerated share repurchases, privately negotiated cross-sections or otherwise, subject to applicable laws, regulations and approvals. The timing of share repurchases or a modified Dutch auction tender offer will depend on a variety of factors including market conditions and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. 
Obviously, the company is expected to continue to generate cash from operations. In the fourth quarter, sales in the beverage industry in general and of carbonated beverages in particular continue to show weakness. However, the sales of Monster Energy products accelerated in January. In the fourth quarter, the company achieved record growth sales of $743.2 million, up 6.7% from $696.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Net sales were $645.4 million, up 6.6% from $605.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. Net sales in the fourth quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $19.7 million. Net sales were also adversely affected by the buy-in before the price increase effective August 31, 2015, which had an estimated impact of approximately $11 million by destocking in Spain and South Africa by existing international distributors in anticipation of our transition to Coca-Cola Bottlers in these countries and also by a reduction in inventory in Germany during the fourth quarter, all of which had an estimated impact of $11.8 million. In total, such amounts had a negative impact on net sales of approximately $42.5 million in the fourth quarter. The increase in net sales after adjusting for these items would have been approximately 13.6% as compared to the reported increase of 6.6%. 
Our original Green Monster Energy drink continued to perform well at retail. Retail sales of the Ultra line continue to show good growth in the United States during the fourth quarter as did our Java Monster line. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 62.5% as compared to 54.8% for the comparable 2014 fourth quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to increased net sales of the Concentrate segment, which has higher gross margins than the Finished Products segment, the disposal of our nonenergy brands and the price increase on our 16 ounce Monster Energy drinks effective August 31, 2015. Distribution cost as a percentage of net sales were 3.2% as compared to 4.1% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.9% compared to 9.3% in the same quarter a year ago. Sponsorship and endorsement costs, advertising expenses principally for strategic brands, merchandise display costs, social media expenses and commissions, were all higher in the fourth quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. General and administrative costs, including distributed terminations as a percentage of net sales for the 2015 fourth quarter were 11% as compared to 9.5% for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Payroll expenses were up $6.1 million due partially to increased staffing in connection with our acquisition of the strategic brands. Stock-based compensation, which is a noncash item, was $3 million higher in the 2015 fourth quarter as compared to the same quarter last year. Distributed termination costs were $3.3 million higher in the fourth quarter as compared to the 2014 fourth quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing and promotion, ingredients, usage safety and sale of the company's product were $3.1 million higher in the 2015 fourth quarter as compared to the 2014 4th quarter. In addition, other legal costs were $1.8 million higher for the 2015 4th quarter. 
On a pro forma basis, given the effect of the items above, operating income for the quarter would have been approximately 31% higher than the reported operating income for the same quarter in 2014. Our effective tax rate increased from 34.7% to 39.5% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the reduction in the domestic production deduction. On an ongoing basis, we expect that our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36.5%.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico over single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO chain in turn may be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by 1 or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activity should have a -- could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended December 2015, the OXXO 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 12.7% to 13.5% in Great Britain; from 17.8% to 20.3% in France; from 10.6% to 13.6% in Germany.

According to IRI, Monster's market share increased in the 13 weeks to the end of December 2015 from 29.7% to 30.5%. 
I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide for the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in the EMEA vary from country to country. According to Nielsen, for the month of December 2015 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 20.3% as compared to 14.2% last year. And in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of November declined from 5.7% to 3.7% as compared to the same period last year.

For the top 20 EMEA markets, which account for approximately 92% of EMEA Monster volume, Nielsen reports that in the 13 weeks to the end of December 2015, Monster's retail value sales grew 19.3%. According to INTAGE, for the month of December 2015, the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 32.6% to 38.6%. The launch of Monster Energy Ultra in Japan continues to be a positive driver for the brand. Net sales for the Finished Products segment in the fourth quarter, formally the DSD segment but excluding Peace Tea, were negatively impacted by approximately $16 million of foreign currency movements in the fourth quarter and by approximately $74.1 million for the year. Net sales from the Finished Products segment in the fourth quarter were also adversely affected by the buy-in of approximately $11 million before the price increase on August 31, 2015, and by destocking in the amount of approximately $11.8 million in Spain and South Africa and the reduction in inventory in Germany as described above. 
On a pro forma basis, net sales for the Finished Products segment for the fourth quarter after adjustments for these items would have increased 8.5% from $574.8 million to $623.9 million in the quarter. On a pro forma basis, after adjusting for foreign currency movements of $74.1 million and $39.8 million of acceleration of deferred revenues, net sales for the Finished Products segment for the year would have increased 10.3% from $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion. Net sales for the company's new Concentrate segment were negatively impacted by approximately $3.7 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter and by approximately $10.2 million for the year. On a pro forma basis after adjustment from such foreign currency movements, net sales for the Concentrate segment would have been $64.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2015, and $133.5 million for the year. 
As a result of the Coca-Cola transaction, which closed on June 12, 2015, there were no sales for the Other segment during the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to $30.8 million of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2014. And for the full year 2015, net sales for the Other segment was $60.8 million as compared to $150.4 million in 2014. 
Europe, Middle East and Africa net sales in the fourth quarter in euros increased 26.3% and in dollars increased 10.2% over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 44.2% in the same period last year to 53.4% during the quarter. For 2015, net sales in euros increased 30.5% and in dollars increased 8.8% over 2014. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 41.2% in 2014 to 48.4% during 2015. Despite the destocking issues described earlier, EMEA overall is now operating well and we have made good strides in achieving increased sales, distribution levels and in-store execution including securing distribution by Coca-Cola bottlers in new countries and territories within the region. The launch of Mega Monster in 553 mL cans with the resealable lid in limited additional markets in Europe has been successful and is largely incremental to our original Monster 500 ml sized products. Additionally, we have continued the launch of a limited number of SKUs in the Ultra line in a number of countries in Europe with positive initial response. Ultra will be launched in a further 15 markets in Europe in the first half of 2016. Monster sales  depletions from our distribution partners to customers in the fourth quarter of 2015 were up 18.9% in EMEA, and in particular, sales depletions experienced double-digit growth in Spain, Germany and South Africa. In Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden, Monster achieved increased sales gains at retail as well as increased market share. In many international markets where our independent distribution partners anticipated the Monster brand being transitioned to the Coca-Cola network, sales levels were markedly lower compared to last year than sales levels in markets which were already being distributed.-- we were already being distributed by the Coca-Cola bottler system also as compared to last year. We are pleased with the initial sales and distribution gains following the December launch of Monster in Russia. The rollout of Monster in Russia is currently taking place. 
In Asia Pacific, net sales for the quarter increased 52.6% in local currencies and 37.2% in dollars. For the year, net sales increased 45.1% in local currencies and 27% in dollars. Net sales in Mexico, Central and South America and the Caribbean for the quarter increased 28.8% in local currencies and 10.7% in dollars, and for the year, increased 29.8% in local currencies and 15.7% in dollars compared to 2014. Monster sales in Brazil were negatively impacted due largely to the overall difficult economic and market conditions there, together with the uncertainties for distributors relating to the Coca-Cola transaction. In Chile, sales of Monster continue to show good growth. Net sales in the quarter increased 114% over the fourth quarter of last year, and for 2015, increased 29.1% over 2014. In Mexico, net sales for the fourth quarter increased 24.4% in local currency and 5.4% in dollars as compared to the same quarter last year. And in 2015, net sales in Mexico increased 14.2% in local currency and 10% in -- 10.2% in dollars as compared to 2014. In Japan, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 15.3% in local currency and 4.1% in dollars as compared to the same quarter last year. And in 2015, net sales in Japan increased 32.4% in local currency and 13.4% in dollars as compared to 2014. We are moving ahead with production in India and anticipate reentering the market in India later in 2016. 
As mentioned earlier, we are optimistic that we will be able to finalize agreements with Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries in the near future. We are also continuing to evaluate production opportunities with Coca-Cola bottlers both in the U.S. and internationally, which we believe will yield cost reductions. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $2.2 billion compared to $370.3 million at December 31, 2014. Short-term investments of $744.6 million compared to $781.1 million at December 31, 2014. Long-term investments decreased $15.3 million from $42.9 million at December 31, 2014. All auction rate securities have now been redeemed in full and are no longer included in either short- or long-term investments. Days outstanding for account receivables were 43.2 days at December 31, 2015, and 36.4 days at December 31, 2014. Inventories decreased to $156.1 million from $174.6 million at December 31, 2014. Average days of inventory was 58 days at December 31, 2015, which was slightly higher than 57.4 days of inventory at December 31, 2014.
During the 2015 fourth quarter, we launched Ultra Black, which was previously sold last year on a limited time basis through a single convenience and gas chain, but has now been made available to the general public. In the fourth quarter, we also launched Pipeline Punch nationally. In the first quarter of 2016, we launched Salted Caramel Java Monster, and early in the process, we're launching our new Gronk Energy drink. We are planning to launch additional new products in 2016.
Gross sales in January 2016 in dollars were approximately 9.5% higher than in January 2015. In local currencies, gross sales in January 2016 were approximately 12.2% higher than in January 2015. January 2015 gross sales included the old Warehouse division at Peace Tea. We cautioned again that sales in a single month and over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores and should not necessarily be imputed to or brought in as indicative of our results for the full quarter or any future period.
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the propriety formulas for our principal products. This transaction will immediately be accretive to the company's earnings. Two, the board has authorized a new repurchase program of up to $1.75 billion of its equity securities, in addition to the $250 million available under the previously authorized $500 million share repurchase program. Once implemented, the effect of this repurchase program will be to substantially reduce the number of shares of common stock outstanding and thereby enhance earnings on a per share basis. Three, North American and international gross margins remain healthy and continue to improve. Four, the U.S. Nielsen market statistics and equivalent market statistics for many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is invariably growing ahead of the category. Five, the new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales. We believe that the repositioning of our Juice Monster and Punch Monster lines continue to be positive. Six, we are particularly pleased with our performance in our international markets. Seven, we have successfully transitioned a number of companies to Coca-Cola bottlers and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers from the second quarter of 2016. 
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you."

The answer to your second question is the $87 million operating income that we discussed is the operating income in 2015. Some of the customers may in fact choose not to continue with the company. But we account for 87% of the company's business and the business that we place with AFF is indeed profitable to them. So as you model, I think a good chunk of that $87 million could be taken into enhancing operating income for the consolidated organization. But as a result of the other 13%, it's really too premature to say, but the number will be determined in due course."

Our demands are really -- clearly, our demand, apart from our customers, is choppy and that choppiness has been exacerbated during the last 12 -- probably 12 months or so. But because of all these announcements, because of the changes, different bottlers or distributors have different policies in holding inventory. Some bought up extra inventory because they were just, I think, anticipated being canceled and have in their own minds that somehow that would give them a longer period to sell or different opportunities to sell and then you've got to deal with that inventory situation. And there are a lot of independent -- there were independent bottlers and that's part of the issue and there was no consistent pattern. And that really is what has happened. And so obviously, we can only report our revenues as they are and as they come into us and we try and match them as well. And so we believe that the -- literally, if you're looking to the trends, the more important trends are not our reports over the last 3 or 4 quarters but it is the Nielsen numbers, which are showing consistent numbers and shall include growth both in the U.S. and internationally. And that's what keeps us excited and makes us comfortable that -- as to the direction of our brand and our brand is continuing to grow. And so as soon as we are able to actually get through all these transitions, get rid of the uncertainties, we will see long-term growth that we think is a healthy growth for the brand and for the company."

So some of it is that. Some of it is indeed the fact that some of the KO brands have been falling off in market share and that is something that we are addressing. We spoke earlier that we're repositioning a number of their brands. We -- or a number of our brands. We're repackaging them, and we have a number of marketing initiatives going with regard to those brands. So a lot of it is a lot of all of that. But in essence, I think we remain satisfied with the acquisition of the strategic brands, and we remain satisfied with the profitability that those strategic brands are generating to us relative to the purchase consideration that we paid."

And these things does take time to turn this around in different regions of the world. But we are doing that and we've got into it now. We are introducing some new flavors. And as Hilton indicated, our packaging has changed on some of them and we're continuing to make changes. The most important, we've actually decided on some strategic positioning for the brands, and again, those are being changed. I mean, in many cases, one of the higher costs we had was, for example, advertising. There was an advertising campaign that we've committed in order to, in the best interest of the brands, we continue to be responsible for it. It was committed before we took over. But ultimately, we don't believe that, that was really beneficial for the brand and it's not a direction we're going on. So we've changed those directions. So these are the changes that we are making, and long term, we believe we will stabilize and continue to grow these brands but in slightly different way."

So that is a [indiscernible] and that's what we've done throughout Europe and everywhere else. We started with 2 flavors.

One of the things I would like to just perhaps just stress on the call is I think there have been 1 or 2 questions that were just focused as to why we did the transaction now and timing and we have other things, but I just wanted to say that this was an acquisition and the strategy behind buying and getting ownership of our own flavors was something we considered very important and valuable as far back as a decade ago. And we have made approaches repeatedly. We have spent time trying to negotiate. And really, it came about last year that I think the owner was approaching -- getting only close of his 80th birthday. And for the first time after an approach, they decided that they were receptive, the family, to an approach. And obviously, we took the opportunity when we could. It wasn't just spur of the moment. This is something we've been wanting to do for a very long time. And then there has been some other suggestions. You asked whether this is -- people, if we could expect more acquisitions along this line. This isn't -- we don't think so. We're not going to give you any [indiscernible] on anything. But certainly, that is not our intention to get into the flavor business or concentrate business. We're not intending to expand that. This clearly was a very strategic acquisition for a supplier of almost all of our products. And for us, we were able to lock up pretty much most of these revenues or our revenues as we sell -- as we go forward, every additional case of Monster we sell, that will be additional margin that we will be able to basically drop to our bottom line. So we see this as a very low risk and a very strategic acquisition. It's based in California. It's easy to manage. It's not a massive staff. It's not a very capital-intensive business, has a very low capital base, a very low working capital requirement. It is also strategic, we felt, to enable the -- our flavor supplier to grow internationally with us. As a private company, they had faced some challenges in many countries in actually having the resources and the expertise to have their flavors get through the regulatory process in these countries and be able to import ingredients, particular ingredients, and supply them in-country and not being an international base but yet their flavors were obviously very, very important and key for us. So we believe that by aligning ourselves with them, we will be able to facilitate and help them on the regulatory side. We have quite a deep bench of staff here who understand regulatory issues and legal issues in the regulatory area. We also obviously -- it's important for us. As we expand into many more countries and many more distant places, we want to really have the opportunity to have our best -- put our best foot forward and have these key flavors come from this supplier and not have to resort to alternative suppliers. With that being said, obviously, we do also still intend to continue to work with our existing suppliers because we want everybody -- we want to, obviously, ensure that we're still able to get cutting edge technology, cutting edge flavors, have everybody stay competitive, whether it's on the AFF side or our independent supplier side. And so for all those reasons, we do believe this transaction to be very, very important for us going forward. 
Thanks, everybody, for your continued interest in the company. We continue to, obviously, believe in the company and our growth strategy and are committed to continuing to develop and to differentiate our brands and to expand the company, both at home and abroad, and in particular, to expand distribution of our products and the strategic -- including the strategic brands through the Coca-Cola bottler system internationally. We are particularly excited about the new opportunities that we have going forward with our robust portfolio together with our newly acquired strategic brands. Thank you very much for your attendance."

A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. 
At the outset, I should mention that the release of our quarterly results and this call are almost a week earlier than normally scheduled. The reason for this change is that Hilton and I will be attending the Coca-Cola Global System Meeting that starts early next week. We will revert to our normal schedule for the second and subsequent quarters. 
We are continuing to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers worldwide. We have successfully concluded negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers in many countries and are planning to launch Monster with these bottlers in most of their international markets in the near future. As previously reported, we have concluded agreements with Coca-Cola Amatil, which distributes Coca-Cola products in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Fiji. We will be launching Monster in Australia on May 1 and in New Zealand on May 9 with Coca-Cola Amatil. Additionally, as previously reported, we have concluded agreements with the IG, the 100%-owned Coca-Cola bottler that operates in a number of international markets for the distribution of Monster in certain of these markets. Further to these agreements, we are planning to launch Monster on May 13 in Singapore. Our plan to launch Monster in China are continuing to move forward with the Coca-Cola system. In Shanghai, we have received the required product approval and manufacturing license and are planning for production of Monster there. In Beijing, we have received the required product approval and are waiting the manufacturing license. We have commenced the required approval process in Xiamen in Southeast China. We are still planning to launch Monster in China later this year, but as previously discussed, the launch could be delayed by various factors, including regulatory approvals and finalization of distribution agreements. We are targeting a relaunch of Monster in India later this year following discussions with the regulatory authorities. We continue to make good progress in our discussions with FEMSA, AKO and other bottlers operating in South America. We have signed a distribution agreement with the Coca-Cola bottler with [indiscernible] which is controlled by AKO for distribution of Monster Improved and are planning to launch Monster Improved on June 2. We're also planning to launch or transition a number of other international markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the ensuing quarters. 
We continue to make good progress in the repositioning, repackaging and reformulation of many of the Coca-Cola energy brands that were acquired as a result of the Coca-Cola transaction. 
We successfully completed our acquisition of the concentrate and flavor business operated by American Fruits & Flavors for $690 million in cash on April 1, 2016. We remain excited by this acquisition, which aligns us with our principal flavor supplier and will enable us to expand and secure most of our flavors at an economical cost. The integration of the acquired business is proceeding well. 
Consistent with the company's previously announced plan to return capital to shareholders, in 2016, the company currently intends to commence a tender offer in May to purchase up to $2 billion in value of its common stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer at a price range to be specified. The company will fund the tender offer with cash on hand. 
In the first quarter, sales in the beverage industry in general and of carbonated beverages in particular continued to show weakness. However, sales of Monster products accelerated during the quarter. In the first quarter of 2015, in anticipation of the closing of the Coca-Cola transaction, we transitioned approximately 84% of the targeted distribution rights in the U.S. to the Coca-Cola system, with an additional 5% transitioned in May 2015. Consequently, the results of the comparable first quarter of 2015 were impacted by the acceleration of deferred revenue of $39.8 million, distribution termination costs of $206 million and Coca-Cola transaction costs of $3.6 million. Our ensuing discussion compares our 2016 first quarter results with our 2015 first quarter results after adjustment for the acceleration of deferred revenue, distribution termination costs and Coca-Cola transaction costs referred to above. 
In the first quarter, the company achieved gross record sales of $777.5 million, up 16% from $670.4 million in the first quarter of 2015. Net sales were $680.2 million, up 15.9% from $587 million first quarter of 2015. Net sales in the first quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $12.3 million. Our original green energy drink -- Monster Energy drink continues to perform well at retail. Retail sales of the Ultra line continued to show good growth in the United States during the first quarter, as did our Java Monster line. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales were 62.2% as compared to 56.1% for the comparable 2015 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to increased net sales of the Concentrate segment purchase, which has higher gross margins than the Finished Products segment. The disposal of our non-energy brands and the price increase in our 16-ounce Monster Energy drinks effective August 31, 2015. 
Distribution cost as a percentage of net sales were 3.4% as compared to 4.4% in the same quarter last year. 
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.2% compared to 10.6% in the same quarter a year ago. 
Sponsorship and endorsement costs, merchandise supply cost and social media expenses were all higher in the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2015, while commissions were lower. 
General and administrative cost, excluding distributed termination costs and Coca-Cola transaction cost, as a percentage of net sales, 2016 first quarter were 10.6% as compared to 10.8% for the corresponding quarter in 2015. 
Overall expenses were up $1.5 million consisting of $5 million increase in payroll, due partially to increased staff in connection with our acquisition of the strategic brands and an increase in stock-based compensation and noncash item of $3.7 million, which were offset by a reduction of payroll taxes of $7.2 million, following the exercise of certain stock options in the first quarter of 2015. 
Also included in general and administrative cost is amortization of trademarks, a noncash item, of $1.8 million attributable to our acquisition of the strategic brands. 
Distributed termination costs were $3.4 million in the first quarter as compared to $206 million in the 2015 first quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $5.4 million in the 2016 first quarter as compared to $4.9 million in the 2015 first quarter. In addition, other legal costs were $2.4 million higher for the 2016 first quarter. 
Our effective tax rate decreased from an adjusted 38% to 35.8% in the first quarter, primarily due to the domestic production deduction. On an ongoing basis, we expected our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36%. 
Net income was $166.1 million compared to net income of $110.8 million during the first quarter of last year, an increase of 49.9%, higher despite the substantial increase in the number shares on a fully diluted basis from 173.8 million to 206.9 million, following the issuance of shares to Coca-Cola, diluted earnings per share increased to $0.80 after adjusting for distributed termination expense for the first quarter from $0.64 in the 2015 comparable quarter. 
Gross sales to customers outside the United States were $184.4 million in the 2016 first quarter compared to $141 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. 
Net sales to customers outside the United States were $149.1 million in the 2016 first quarter compared to $113 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. As stated earlier, gross sales and net sales to customers outside the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $15.1 million and $12.3 million, respectively. 
Including geographic sales reported are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military customers overseas. 
According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through March 26, 2016, all outlets combined, mainly, convenience, grocery, drug, and merchandise sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 7.1% versus the same period a year ago. Sales in Monster grew 8 -- 10.8% in the 13-week period while sales of [indiscernible] increased 2.5% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 9%. Sales of Red Bull increased 4.1%.

Sales of Monster increased by 9.6% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 5.4% and Full Throttle sales decreased 5%. Sales of Red Bull increased 1.3%, Rockstar was up 12.6%, 5-Hour was up 1.9% and AMP was down 4.5%. 
According to Nielsen, in the 5 weeks ended March 26, 2016, Monster's market share of energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 1.2 points over the same period last year to 35.2%. NOS's share remains the same at 3.7% and Full Throttle share decreased 0.1 of a 0.2 -- 1.1%. [ph] Red Bull share decreased 1.6 points to 35.1%, slightly below Monster's share. Rockstar share was up 0.5 of a -- 7.9%, 5-Hour share was lower by 0.3 points at 8.3%. And M share decreased 0.2 points to 1.8%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended March 26, 2016, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks in dollars in the convenience and gas channel increased 20.6% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 18.4% higher than the same period last year, while Starbucks Double Shot Energy was 25.2% higher. We'd like to mention there have been some changes in the dollar base we used to report in this category. 
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended March 5, 2016, the energy drink category decreased 2%. Monster sales were unchanged versus a year ago and market share increased 0.3 share points to 27.8%. Red Bull sales decreased 1%, and its market share increased 0.7 points to 37.3%. [ph] Rockstar sales decreased 9% and its market share decreased 1.2 points to 18%. 
According to Nielsen, all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 33.1% during the month of February 2016. Monster sales increased 8.3%. Our market share decreased 5.7 points to 25%, again to comparable period last year. Sales of Burn, one of our acquired strategic brands, increased 4.9%, although Burn's market share decreased 1.7 points to 6.5%. Red Bull sales increased 0.7% and its market share decreased by 5.1 points to 15.7%. [ph] [indiscernible] 100 market share increased 14.3 points to 34.9%, while [indiscernible]foods market share decreased 3.4 points to 11.3%. 
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covers single month, which is a short period, but may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively, by sales in our offset convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the offset convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month.  Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended March 2016, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few days for different markets. Monster's retail market share in value, as compared the same period last year, grew from 12.1% to 13% in Great Britain; from 9.3% to 11% in Sweden; from 8.4% to 9.7% in Belgium; from 6.5% to 9% in Norway; from 5.7% to 7% in the Netherlands; and from 18.4% to 20.9% in France. For the 13-week period ended February 2016, according to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.2% to 13.6% in Germany and decreased from 17.5% to 16.4% in South Africa, although value sales were 19.3% higher according to Nielsen. We note that for every [indiscernible] one of those markets that is not transitioned to Coca-Cola bottlers. Monster's retail market share and value for the 13 weeks ending February 2016 in Ireland increased from 7.4% to 8.7% and from 21.5% to 24.8% in Spain. According to IRI, Monster's market share increased -- decreased in the 13 weeks at the end of February 2016 from 29.3% to 29.1%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. 
According to Nielsen for the month of March 2016 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 20.4% as compared to 15.3% last year. And in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of March 2016 declined from 4.7% to 3.1% as compared to the same period last year. In South Korea, for the month of March 2016, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 10% to 18.7% compared to the same period last year. 
According to [indiscernible] for the month of March 2016 in the convenience and store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 33.8% to 39.9%. 
Net sales for the Finished Products segment in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $10.3 million of foreign currency movements in the first quarter. Net sales for the Finished Products segment in the first quarter of 2016 increased 12.3% from $555.7 million to $624.3 million from a comparable period last year after adjustments for acceleration our deferred revenue. Net sales for the company's Concentrates segment were negatively impacted by approximately $2 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. After adjustment for such foreign currency movements, net sales for the Concentrates segment would have been $57.9 million for the first quarter. 
As a result of the Coca-Cola transaction, which closed on June 12, 2015, there were no sales for the Other segment during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $31.3 million of net sales in the first quarter of 2015. 
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the first quarter increased 47.2% in dollars and 58.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 39.4% in the same period last year to 50.2% during the 2016 first quarter. EMEA sales were negatively affected by supply disruptions that were encountered by CCE in Great Britain, Monster's largest market in the EMEA during the quarter, following the implementation of new software. Monster continued to gain momentum and increased market share in Europe in the first quarter. Overall, EMEA is now operating well, and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution, including security, distribution by Coca-Cola bottlers in new countries and territories within the region. 
We are pleased with the launch of Ultra in Europe. We commenced distribution of Ultra in an additional 8 markets in EMEA in the first quarter. Ultra will be launched in 10 additional markets in EMEA in the second quarter of 2016. In particular, in Germany, France, Denmark, Belgium, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden. Once we achieve increased sales gains as well as increased market share. 
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the first quarter increased 93.5% in dollars and 97.7% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales, increased from 31.2% in the same period last year to 45.2% during the 2016 first quarter. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 63.4%, 62.5% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased 283.4% or 312.6% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In Mexico, Central America and South America, net sales for the first quarter decreased 3.2% in dollars and increased 9.2% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 39.8% in the same period last year to 41.1% during 2016 first quarter. Net sales decreased in Brazil largely due to the overall difficult economic and market conditions, together with the ongoing uncertainties for our distributor related to the Coca-Cola transaction. In Mexico, net sales decreased in part due to customers destocking during the quarter and delivery disruptions during the month of March. However, as reported by Nielsen, Monster's sales at retail in Mexico grew during the quarter. 
In Chile, net sales in the quarter increased 52.3% in dollars and 74.9% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. 
As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with planning for local production in India and anticipate reentering the market in India later in 2016. As mentioned earlier, we're optimistic that we will be able to finalize agreements with Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries in the near future. We are also continuing to evaluate production opportunities of Coca-Cola bottlers both in the U.S. and internationally, which we believe will yield cost reductions. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $2.5 billion at March 31, 2016, prior to the close of AFF transaction compared to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $508.2 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased to $7.4 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 48.7 days at March 31, 2016, and 43.2 days at December 31, 2015, compared to 46.4 days at March 31, 2015. 
Inventories increased to $165.9 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 58.1 days at March 31, 2016, which was higher than the 58 days of inventory at December 31, 2015, and lower than the 69.1 days at March 31, 2015. 
During the 2016 first quarter, we launched our new energy drink and salted caramel Java Monster, initial response has been positive. We are planning to launch Mutant, an exciting new beverage that will be positioned as refreshment energized, in the third quarter of 2016. For competitive reasons, we intend to provide further information on this new beverage at the stockholder meeting on June 14. 
As previously disclosed, we have also -- we also have additional products planned for later this year. As this call is a week earlier than usual, we can only provide an estimate for April 2016 gross sales. Based on growth sales through April 28, 2016, we estimate April 2016 gross sales in dollars will be approximately 15% higher than in April 2015. In local currencies, we estimate April 2016 gross sales will be approximately 16% higher than in April 2015. We note that April 2015 sales included the old warehouse segment at Peace Tea and April 2016 includes the Concentrates segment. We caution again that sales over short periods are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of branch increases and promotions in retail stores and should not necessarily be imputed or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter for any future period. 
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for our principal product. This transaction will be accretive to the company's earnings from the closing of the transaction on April 1, 2016. Consistent with the company's previously announced plan to return capital to shareholders in 2016, the company currently intends to commence a tender offer in May to purchase up to $2 billion in value of its common stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer at a price range to be specified. The company will fund the tender offer with cash on hand. While Hilton and I may participate in the offer for asset diversification reasons, we will continue to earn a substantial majority of our current holdings following a successful tender offer. 
North American and international gross margins remained healthy and continue to improve. The U.S. Nielsen market statistics and the equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. The new additions to the Monster family continues to gain momentum and add to the company's sales. We are excited about the prospects for our new Mutant beverage, which we're planning to launch in the third quarter. We are particularly pleased with our performance in our international markets. We have successfully transitioned a number of international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers, and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers from the second quarter of 2016. 
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Please note that we will not be taking any questions with respect to the tender offer on this call. Thank you."

Like you, we also need to understand what the position is with regard to those brands. Some of it is relating to weakness in the brands themselves that we are addressing in various ways. Some of that, of course, is foreign currency. And there's another factor in that -- in certain countries, we have been unable to structure ourselves in a way that we can actually sell concentrate. And what we do in certain countries is we get a royalty from The Coca-Cola Company, which equates to effectively what we would have done had we sold the concentrate. It's a structured setting up various countries to accommodate the concentrate. So there's a whole lot of factors that one has to take into account in evaluating the Concentrate business. So largely, there is some weakness, but we -- we are not -- you are not seeing in these numbers the full extent of the concentrate business because of some of these adjustments that have to take place."

That did affect sales. So we did see a reduction in sales in those countries as a result, we believe, of that. So what we've had to do this, not only just go in and blindly, obviously, reinvesting in marketing, we -- we've had to we look at repositioning these brands and at the same time get the repositioning done both in repackaging and designs and flavors. And then obviously, then we -- we create marketing plans to put those -- that are positioning that we have looked at for these brands, particularly the [indiscernible] are 2 of the large brands that did have some weakness. We've also -- in many ways, we positioned NOS a little bit in the U.S., although we haven't changed packaging. We are going to modernize packaging, coming through now. So this is a long process because there are -- were many brands in many countries and layered on top of our own staffing in our own business obviously in Monster, just takes -- it takes a long time to get a lot of these -- this repositioning done. So we think that's partially the reason for it. And yes, it has been weaker than we had estimated. But we are -- we'll be doing the repositioning, focus and we are starting to see some strong signs. And we do believe that that will continue to be positive. Some of the other brands, although smaller. Again, it's a mixed bag. You can't put it into one category because in some cases the brands offer more and may go away. But in other cases, some the smaller brands are very strong brands. And we are looking for long-term growth from those brands. But again, it's good to be a positioning in a bold not overnight.

And very respectfully, many of them are not used to signing a contract of this nature, which is more akin to a finished product distribution agreement as opposed to a manufacturing concentrate bottler agreement, which puts a lot of more discretion and decisions in the hands of the bottler, whereas we tend to keep or want to keep most of those decisions about global marketing, about some of the local marketing and the number of things. The other thing is that we obviously got to be very cautious that we don't get into a situation we have a large line of products, for example.

So there are bones of contention that keep going up and down between the legal agreements. And we're getting through them. But in many cases, it's really a question of literally educating a bottler in a country with their lawyers about why our agreement is in the form that it's in and why we need the protections. Then the other -- obviously, the other bucket is just -- goes back to the old life, money. How do you share the value chain that's available in the country? And it's just one last thing between us and the bottlers as to how do we get to a fair value share? And in some cases, we are at odds with the bottlers on what we believe we want out of the value share. And we're not going to compromise the value share and take less in order to simply try and get deals done. At -- because we want to move quickly. I mean, what we got to negotiate is going to stay with us for 20 or 30 years or however long the agreements are. So we really do want to have a fair relationship and the [indiscernible] the value chain. Bearing in mind that we do spend and lot more than that is normally done by Coca-Cola Company in a bottler relationship. When they split -- whatever the split is, when they split the value chain, the bottler picks up a lot more of the obligation. In our case, we do. And we don't want to be the position where we split the chain and we end up with still the lion's share of the marketing and other expenses, which aren't really fair. So it's been in negotiation, and we just -- we're getting through them one by one. And I think that's really the color I got on it. If you like to add to it..."

An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated April 29, 2016. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. 
At the outset, I should mention that the release of our quarterly results and this call are almost a week earlier than normally scheduled. The reason for this change is that Hilton and I will be attending the Coca-Cola Global System Meeting that starts early next week. We will revert to our normal schedule for the second and subsequent quarters. 
We are continuing to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers worldwide. We have successfully concluded negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers in many countries and are planning to launch Monster with these bottlers in most of their international markets in the near future. As previously reported, we have concluded agreements with Coca-Cola Amatil, which distributes Coca-Cola products in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Fiji. We will be launching Monster in Australia on May 1, and in New Zealand on May 9 with Coca-Cola Amatil. Additionally, as previously reported, we have concluded agreements with DIG, the 100%-owned Coca-Cola bottler that operates in a number of international markets, for the distribution of Monster in certain of these markets. Further to these agreements, we are planning to launch Monster on May 13 in Singapore. Our plans to launch Monster in China are continuing to move forward with the Coca-Cola system. In Shanghai, we have received the required product approval and manufacturing license, and are planning for production of Monster there. In Beijing, we have received the required product approval and are awaiting the manufacturing license. We have commenced the required approval process in Xiamen in Southeast China. We are still planning to launch Monster in China later this year, but as previously discussed, the launch could be delayed by various factors, including regulatory approvals and finalization of distribution agreements. We are targeting a relaunch of Monster in India later this year, following discussions with the regulatory authorities. We continue to make good progress in our discussions with FEMSA, AKO and other bottlers operating in South America. We have signed a distribution agreement with the Coca-Cola bottler, with Lindley, which is controlled by AKO for distribution of Monster in Peru, and are planning to launch Monster in Peru on June 2. We're also planning to launch or transition a number of other international markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the ensuing quarters. 
We continue to make good progress in the repositioning, repackaging and reformulation of many of the Coca-Cola energy brands that were acquired as a result of the Coca-Cola transaction. 
We successfully completed our acquisition of the concentrate and flavor business operated by American Fruits & Flavors for $690 million in cash on April 1, 2016. We remain excited by this acquisition, which aligns us with our principal flavor supplier, and will enable us to expand and secure most of our flavors at an economical cost. The integration of the acquired business is proceeding well. 
Consistent with the company's previously announced plan to return capital to shareholders, in 2016, the company currently intends to commence a tender offer in May to purchase up to $2 billion in value of its common stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer at a price range to be specified. The company will fund the tender offer with cash on hand. 
In the first quarter, sales in the beverage industry in general, and of carbonated beverages in particular, continued to show weakness. However, sales of Monster products accelerated during the quarter. In the first quarter of 2015, in anticipation of the closing of the Coca-Cola transaction, we transitioned approximately 84% of the targeted distribution rights in the U.S. to the Coca-Cola system, with an additional 5% transitioned in May 2015. Consequently, the results of the comparable first quarter of 2015 were impacted by the acceleration of deferred revenue of $39.8 million, distribution termination costs of $206 million and Coca-Cola transaction costs of $3.6 million. Our ensuing discussion compares our 2016 first quarter results with our 2015 first quarter results after adjustment for the acceleration of deferred revenue, distribution termination costs and Coca-Cola transaction costs referred to above. 
In the first quarter, the company achieved gross record sales of $777.5 million, up 16% from $670.4 million in the first quarter of 2015. Net sales were $680.2 million, up 15.9% from $587 million in the first quarter of 2015. Net sales in the first quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $12.3 million. Our original green energy drink -- Monster Energy drink continues to perform well at retail. Retail sales of the Ultra line continue to show good growth in the United States during the first quarter, as did our Java Monster line. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales were 62.2% as compared to 56.1% for the comparable 2015 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to increased net sales of the Concentrate segment, which has higher gross margins than the Finished Product segment, the disposal of our non-energy brands and the price increase in our 16-ounce Monster Energy drinks effective August 31, 2015. 
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.4% as compared to 4.4% in the same quarter last year. 
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.2% compared to 10.6% in the same quarter a year ago. 
Sponsorship and endorsement costs, merchandise supply cost and social media expenses were all higher in the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2015, while commissions were lower. 
General and administrative costs, excluding distributed termination costs and Coca-Cola transaction costs, as a percentage of net sales in the 2016 first quarter were 10.6% as compared to 10.8% for the corresponding quarter in 2015. 
Overall expenses were up $1.5 million consisting of a $5 million increase in payroll, due partially to increased staffing in connection with our acquisition of the strategic brands and an increase in stock-based compensation and noncash item of $3.7 million, which were offset by a reduction of payroll taxes of $7.2 million, following the exercise of certain stock options in the first quarter of 2015. 
Also included in general and administrative cost is amortization of trademarks, a noncash item, of $1.8 million, attributable to our acquisition of the strategic brands. 
Distributed termination costs were $3.4 million in the first quarter as compared to $206 million in the 2015 first quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $5.4 million in the 2016 first quarter as compared to $4.9 million in the 2015 first quarter. In addition, other legal costs were $2.4 million higher for the 2016 first quarter. 
Our effective tax rate decreased from an adjusted 38% to 35.8% in the first quarter, primarily due to the domestic production deduction. On an ongoing basis, we expect that our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36%. 
Net income was $166.1 million compared to net income of $110.8 million during the first quarter of last year, an increase of 49.9%. However, despite the substantial increase in the number of shares on a fully diluted basis from 173.8 million to 206.9 million, following the issuance of shares to Coca-Cola, diluted earnings per share increased to $0.80 after adjusting for distributed termination expense for the first quarter from $0.64 in the 2015 comparable quarter. 
Gross sales to customers outside the United States were $184.4 million in the 2016 first quarter compared to $141 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. 
Net sales to customers outside the United States were $149.1 million in the 2016 first quarter compared to $113 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. As stated earlier, gross sales and net sales to customers outside the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $15.1 million and $12.3 million, respectively. 
Including geographic sales reported on our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military-ended customers overseas. 
According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through March 26, 2016, all outlets combined, mainly, convenience, grocery, drug, and mass merchandisers sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 7.1% versus the same period a year ago. Sales in Monster grew 8 -- 10.8% in the 13-week period while sales of NOS increased 2.5% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 9%. Sales of Red Bull increased 4.1%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 14.2%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 0.1%. And sales of AMP decreased 8.1%.

Sales of Monster increased by 9.6% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 5.4% and Full Throttle sales decreased 5%. Sales of Red Bull increased 1.3%, Rockstar was up 12.6%, 5-Hour was up 1.9% and AMP was down 4.5%. 
According to Nielsen, in the 5 weeks ended March 26, 2016, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 1.2 points over the same period last year to 35.2%. NOS's share remains the same at 3.7% and Full Throttle share decreased 0.1 point to 1.1%. Red Bull's share decreased 1.6 points to 35.1%, slightly below Monster's share. Rockstar share was up 0.5 point to at 7.9%, 5-Hour share was lower by 0.3 points at 8.3%. And M share decreased 0.2 points to 1.8%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended March 26, 2016, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 20.6% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 18.4% higher than the same period last year, while Starbucks Double Shot Energy was 25.2% higher. We'd like to mention that there have been some changes in the database we use to report on this category. 
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended March 5, 2016, the energy drink category decreased 2%. Monster sales were unchanged versus a year ago and market share increased 0.3 share points to 27.8%. Red Bull sales decreased 1%, and its market share increased 0.7 points to 37.3%. Rockstar sales decreased 9% and its market share decreased 1.2 points to 18%. 
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 33.1% during the month of February 2016. Monster sales increased 8.3%. Our market share decreased 5.7 points to 25% again to comparable period last year. Sales of Burn, one of our acquired strategic brands, increased 4.9%, although Burn's market share decreased 1.7 points to 6.5%. Red Bull sales increased 0.7% and its market share decreased by 5.1 points to 15.7%. Vive 100's market share increased 14.3 points to 34.9%, while Boost's market share decreased 3.4 points to 11.3%. 
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period, but may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively, by sales in our OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month.  Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended March 2016, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few days between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 12.1% to 13% in Great Britain; from 9.3% to 11% in Sweden; from 8.4% to 9.7% in Belgium; from 6.5% to 9% in Norway; from 5.7% to 7% in the Netherlands; and from 18.4% to 20.9% in France. For the 13-week period ended February 2016, according to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period of last year, grew from 11.2% to 13.6% in Germany, and decreased from 17.5% to 16.4% in South Africa, although value sales were 19.3% higher, according to Nielsen. We note that South Africa is one of those markets that has not transitioned to Coca-Cola bottlers. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ending February 2016 in Ireland increased from 7.4% to 8.7%, and from 21.5% to 24.8% in Spain. According to IRI, Monster's market share increased -- decreased in the 13 weeks at the end of February 2016 from 29.3% to 29.1%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. 
According to Nielsen for the month of March 2016 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 20.4% as compared to 15.3% last year.

According to INTAGE for the month of March 2016 in the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 33.8% to 39.9%. 
Net sales for the Finished Products segment in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $10.3 million of foreign currency movements in the first quarter. Net sales for the Finished Products segment in the first quarter of 2016 increased 12.3% from $555.7 million to $624.3 million from a comparable period last year after adjustments for acceleration of deferred revenue. Net sales for the company's Concentrate segment were negatively impacted by approximately $2 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. After adjustment for such foreign currency movements, net sales for the Concentrate segment would have been $57.9 million for the first quarter. 
As a result of the Coca-Cola transaction, which closed on June 12, 2015, there were no sales for the Other segment during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $31.3 million of net sales in the first quarter of 2015. 
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the first quarter increased 47.2% in dollars and 58.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 39.4% in the same period last year to 50.2% during the 2016 first quarter. EMEA sales were negatively affected by supply disruptions that were encountered by CCE in Great Britain, Monster's largest market in the EMEA during the quarter, following the implementation of new software. Monster continued to gain momentum and increased market share in Europe in the first quarter. Overall, EMEA is now operating well, and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution, including securing distribution by Coca-Cola bottlers in new countries and territories within the region. 
We are pleased with the launch of Ultra in Europe. We commenced distribution of Ultra in an additional 8 markets in EMEA in the first quarter. Ultra will be launched in 10 additional markets in EMEA in the second quarter of 2016. In particular, in Germany, France, Denmark, Belgium, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden, once we achieve the increased sales gains as well as increased market share. 
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the first quarter increased 93.5% in dollars and 97.7% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales, increased from 31.2% in the same period last year to 45.2% during the 2016 first quarter. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 63.4%, 62.5% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased 283.4% or 312.6% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In Mexico, Central America and South America, net sales for the first quarter decreased 3.2% in dollars and increased 9.2% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 39.8% in the same period last year to 41.1% during 2016 first quarter. Net sales decreased in Brazil largely due to the overall difficult economic and market conditions, together with the ongoing uncertainties for our distributor relating to the Coca-Cola transaction. In Mexico, net sales decreased in part due to customer destocking during the quarter and delivery disruptions during the month of March. However, as reported by Nielsen, Monster sales at retail in Mexico grew during the quarter. 
In Chile, net sales in the quarter increased 52.3% in dollars and 74.9% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. 
As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with planning for local production in India, and anticipate reentering the market in India later in 2016. As mentioned earlier, we're optimistic that we'll be able to finalize agreements with Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries in the near future. We are also continuing to evaluate production opportunities of Coca-Cola bottlers, both in the U.S. and internationally, which we believe will yield cost reductions. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $2.5 billion at March 31, 2016, prior to the close of the AFF transaction compared to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $508.2 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased to $7.4 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivable were 48.7 days at March 31, 2016, and 43.2 days at December 31, 2015, compared to 46.4 days at March 31, 2015. 
Inventories increased to $165.9 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 58.1 days at March 31, 2016, which was higher than the 58 days of inventory at December 31, 2015, and lower than the 69.1 days at March 31, 2015. 
During the 2016 first quarter, we launched our new [indiscernible] energy drink and salted caramel Java Monster, initial consumer response has been positive. We are planning to launch Mutant, an exciting new beverage that would be positioned as refreshment energized, in the third quarter of 2016. For competitive reasons, we intend to provide further information on this new beverage at the stockholder meeting on June 14. 
As previously disclosed, we have also -- we also have new additional products planned for later this year. As this call is a week earlier than usual, we can only provide an estimate for April 2016 gross sales. Based on growth sales through April 28, 2016, we estimate April 2016 gross sales in dollars will be approximately 15% higher than in April 2015. In local currencies, we estimate April 2016 gross sales will be approximately 16% higher than in April 2015. We note that April 2015 sales included the old warehouse segment and Peace Tea and April 2016 includes the Concentrates segment. We caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of branch increases and promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter for any future period. 
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for our principal product. This transaction will be accretive to the company's earnings from the closing of the transaction on April 1, 2016. Consistent with the company's previously announced plan to return capital to shareholders in 2016, the company currently intends to commence a tender offer in May to purchase up to $2 billion in value of its common stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer at a price range to be specified. The company will fund the tender offer with cash on hand. While Hilton and I may participate in the offer for asset diversification reasons, we will continue to earn a substantial majority of our current holdings following any successful tender offer. 
North American and international gross margins remained healthy and continue to improve. The U.S. Nielsen market statistics and the equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales. We are excited about the prospects for our new Mutant beverage, which we're planning to launch in the third quarter. We are particularly pleased with our performance in our international markets. We have successfully transitioned a number of international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers, and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers from the second quarter of 2016. 
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Please note that we will not be taking any questions with respect to the tender offer on this call. Thank you."

Like you, we also need to understand what the position is with regard to those brands. Some of it is relating to weakness in the brands themselves, that we are addressing in various ways. Some of that, of course, is foreign currency. And there's another factor in that -- in certain countries, we have been unable to structure ourselves in a way that we could actually sell concentrates, and what we do in certain countries is, we get a royalty from The Coca-Cola Company, which equates to effectively what we would have done had we sold the concentrate. It's a structure setting up various countries to accommodate the concentrate business. So there is a whole lot of factors that one has to take into account in evaluating the Concentrate business. So largely, there is some weakness, but we -- we are not -- you are not seeing in these numbers the full extent of the concentrate business because of some of these adjustments that have to take place."

And that did affect sales. So we did see a reduction in sales in those countries as a result, we believe, of that. So what we've had to do is, not only just go in and blindly, obviously, reinvesting in marketing, we -- we've had to relook at how we repositioning these brands and at the same time get the repositioning done, both in repackaging and designs, in flavors. And then obviously, then recreate marketing plans to put those -- the new positioning that we have looked at for these brands, particularly the Burn brand and Relentless are 2 of the large brands that did have some weakness. We've also -- in many ways, we positioned NOS a little bit in the U.S., although we haven't changed packaging. We are going to modernize that packaging, and that's still coming through now. So this is a long process because there are -- we're many brands, in many countries. And layered on top of our own staffing and our own business obviously at Monster, it just takes -- it takes a long time to get a lot of these -- this repositioning done. So we think that's partially the reason for it. And yes, it has been weaker than we had estimated. But we are -- we'll be doing the repositioning, we'd bring some focus in and we are starting to see some strong signs. And we do believe that will continue to be positive. Some of the other brands, although smaller -- again, it's a mixed bag, you can't put it into one category because in some cases, the brands offer more and may go away. But in other cases, some of the smaller brands are very good, very strong brands. And we are actually looking to the long-term growth from those brands. But again, it's going to be a positioning and a build, it's not going to happen overnight. But you know, there are some good, really good brands that we see in the mix that we do believe we will see growth from going forward."

And as a result, it's been important for us to continue to negotiate agreements on terms that we believe are -- and will put us in a position where we can protect ourselves and our brand if things or relationship didn't go as planned. And so the contract that we have agreed to with the Coca-Cola company as a principal, and obviously we now -- you take that to the individual bottlers, they have their own lawyers, they have their own local laws and they have their own view of life. And very respectfully, many of them are not used to signing a contract of this nature, which is more akin to a finished product distribution agreement as opposed to a manufacturing concentrate bottler agreement, which puts a lot of more discretion and decisions in the hands of the bottler, whereas we tend to keep or want to keep most of those decisions about global marketing, about some of the local marketing and the number of things.

And we don't want to be in a position that if the bottler decides he wants to take 1 SKU or 3 SKUs and not the rest, that we are kept out of the market for the rest of the SKU. So there are bones of contention that keep going up and down between the legal agreements. And we're getting through them. But in many cases, it's really a question of literally educating a bottler in a country with their lawyers about why our agreement is in the form that it's in and why we need the protections. Then the other -- obviously, the other bucket is just -- it goes back to the old life, money. How do you share the value chain that's available in the country? And it's just arm wrestling between us and the bottlers as to how do we get to a fair value share? And in some cases, we are at odds with the bottlers on what we believe we want out of the value share. And we're not going to compromise the value share and take less in order to simply try and get the deals done. At -- because we want to move quickly. I mean, what we are going to negotiate is going to stay with us for 20 or 30 years or however long the agreements are. So we really do want to have the fair relationship and the fair share of the value chain. Bearing in mind that we spend and do a lot more than that is normally done by Coca-Cola Company in a bottler relationship. When they split their -- whatever the split is, when they split their value chain, the bottler picks up a lot more of the obligation. In our case, we do. And we don't want to be in a position where we split the chain and we end up with still the lion's share of the marketing and other expenses, which aren't really fair. So it's been a negotiation, and we just -- we're getting through them one by one. And I think that's really the color I've got on it. Hilton, if you would like to add to it..."

And we, as a brand owner, have substantial expenses, have substantial marketing expenses and we have to ensure that after those marketing expenses, we do a good deal for our shareholders. So it is a bit of a hecking but as you can see from the agreements that have been finalized, we're moving forward, and we'll move forward in due course with some of the other bottlers or we won't. And if not, there are other distribution partners that we'll be working with."

An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated April 29, 2016. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. 
At the outset, I should mention that the release of our quarterly results and this call are almost a week earlier than normally scheduled. The reason for this change is that Hilton and I will be attending the Coca-Cola global system meeting that starts early next week. We will revert to our normal schedule for the second and subsequent quarters. 
We are continuing to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers worldwide. We have successfully concluded negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers in many countries and are planning to launch Monster with these bottlers in most of their international markets in the near future. As previously reported, we have concluded agreements with Coca-Cola Amatil, which distributes Coca-Cola products in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Fiji. We will be launching Monster in Australia on May 1 and in New Zealand on May 9 with Coca-Cola Amatil. Additionally, as previously reported, we have concluded agreements with DIG [ph], the 100%-owned Coca-Cola bottler that operates in a number of international markets, for the distribution of Monster in certain of these markets. Further to these agreements, we are planning to launch Monster on May 13 in Singapore. Our plans to launch Monster in China are continuing to move forward with the Coca-Cola system. In Shanghai, we have received the required product approval and manufacturing license and are planning for production of Monster there. In Beijing, we have received the required product approval and are awaiting the manufacturing license. We have commenced the required approval process in Xiamen in Southeast China. We are still planning to launch Monster in China later this year, but as previously discussed, the launch could be delayed by various factors, including regulatory approvals and finalization of distribution agreements. We are targeting a relaunch of Monster in India later this year, following discussions with the regulatory authorities. We continue to make good progress in our discussions with FEMSA, AKO [ph] and other bottlers operating in South America. We have signed a distribution agreement with the Coca-Cola bottler, with Lindley [ph], which is controlled by AKO [ph] for distribution of Monster in Peru, and are planning to launch Monster in Peru on June 2. We're also planning to launch or transition a number of other international markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the ensuing quarters. 
We continue to make good progress in the repositioning, repackaging and reformulation of many of the Coca-Cola energy brands that were acquired as a result of the Coca-Cola transaction. 
We successfully completed our acquisition of the concentrate and flavor business operated by American Fruits & Flavors for $690 million in cash on April 1, 2016. We remain excited by this acquisition, which aligns us with our principal flavor supplier, and will enable us to expand and secure most of our flavors at an economical cost. The integration of the acquired business is proceeding well. 
Consistent with the company's previously announced plan to return capital to shareholders, in 2016, the company currently intends to commence a tender offer in May to purchase up to $2 billion in value of its common stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer at a price range to be specified. The company will fund the tender offer with cash on hand. 
In the first quarter, sales in the beverage industry in general, and of carbonated beverages in particular, continued to show weakness. However, sales of Monster products accelerated during the quarter. In the first quarter of 2015, in anticipation of the closing of the Coca-Cola transaction, we transitioned approximately 84% of the targeted distribution rights in the U.S. to the Coca-Cola system, with an additional 5% transitioned in May 2015. Consequently, the results of the comparable first quarter of 2015 were impacted by the acceleration of deferred revenue of $39.8 million, distribution termination costs of $206 million and Coca-Cola transaction costs of $3.6 million. Our ensuing discussion compares our 2016 first quarter results with our 2015 first quarter results after adjustment for the acceleration of deferred revenue, distribution termination costs and Coca-Cola transaction costs referred to above. 
In the first quarter, the company achieved gross record sales of $777.5 million, up 16% from $670.4 million in the first quarter of 2015. Net sales were $680.2 million, up 15.9% from $587 million in the first quarter of 2015. Net sales in the first quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $12.3 million. Our Original Green energy drink -- Monster Energy drink continued to perform well at retail. Retail sales of the Ultra line continue to show good growth in the United States during the first quarter, as did our Java Monster line. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 62.2% as compared to 56.1% for the comparable 2015 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to increased net sales of the Concentrate segment, which has higher gross margins than the Finished Products segment, the disposal of our non-energy brands and the price increase in our 16-ounce Monster Energy drinks effective August 31, 2015. 
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.4% as compared to 4.4% in the same quarter last year. 
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.2% compared to 10.6% in the same quarter a year ago. 
Sponsorship and endorsement costs, merchandise display costs and social media expenses were all higher in the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2015, while commissions were lower. 
General and administrative costs, excluding distributor termination costs and Coca-Cola transaction costs, as a percentage of net sales in the 2016 first quarter, were 10.6% as compared to 10.8% for the corresponding quarter in 2015. 
Payroll expenses were up $1.5 million consisting of a $5 million increase in payroll, due partially to increased staffing in connection with our acquisition of the strategic brands and an increase in stock-based compensation, a noncash item of $3.7 million, which were offset by a reduction of payroll taxes of $7.2 million, following the exercise of certain stock options in the first quarter of 2015. 
Also included in general and administrative cost is amortization of trademarks, a noncash item of $1.8 million, attributable to our acquisition of the strategic brands. 
Distributor termination costs were $3.4 million in the first quarter as compared to $206 million in the 2015 first quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $5.4 million in the 2016 first quarter as compared to $4.9 million in the 2015 first quarter. In addition, other legal costs were $2.4 million higher for the 2016 first quarter. 
Our effective tax rate decreased from an adjusted 38% to 35.8% in the first quarter, primarily due to the domestic production deduction. On an ongoing basis, we expect that our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36%. 
Net income was $166.1 million compared to net income of $110.8 million during the first quarter of last year, an increase of 49.9%. However, despite the substantial increase in the number of shares on a fully diluted basis from 173.8 million to 206.9 million, following the issuance of shares to Coca-Cola, diluted earnings per share increased to $0.80 after adjusting for distributor termination expense for the first quarter from $0.64 in the 2015 comparable quarter. 
Gross sales to customers outside the United States were $184.4 million in the 2016 first quarter compared to $141 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. 
Net sales to customers outside the United States were $149.1 million in the 2016 first quarter compared to $113 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. As stated earlier, gross sales and net sales to customers outside the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $15.1 million and $12.3 million, respectively. 
Including geographic sales reported on our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through March 26, 2016, all outlets combined, namely, convenience, grocery, drug, and mass merchandisers sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 7.1% versus the same period a year ago. Sales in Monster grew 8 -- 10.8% in the 13-week period while sales of NOS increased 2.5% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 9%. Sales of Red Bull increased 4.1%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 14.2%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 0.1%. And sales of AMP decreased 8.1%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended March 26, 2016, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased 5.9% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 9.6% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 5.4% and Full Throttle sales decreased 5%. Sales of Red Bull increased 1.3%, Rockstar was up 12.6%, 5-Hour was up 1.9% and AMP was down 4.5%. 
According to Nielsen, in the 5 weeks ended March 26, 2016, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 1.2 points over the same period last year to 35.2%. NOS' share remains the same at 3.7% and Full Throttle's share decreased 0.1 point to 1.1%. Red Bull's share decreased 1.6 points to 35.1%, slightly below Monster's share. Rockstar's share was up 0.5 point at 7.9%, 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.3 points at 8.3%. And AMP's share decreased 0.2 points to 1.8%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended March 26, 2016, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 20.6% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 18.4% higher than in the same period last year, while Starbucks Double Shot Energy was 25.2% higher. We'd like to mention that there have been some changes in the database we use to report on this category. 
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended March 5, 2016, the energy drink category decreased 2%. Monster sales were unchanged versus a year ago. Our market share increased 0.3 share points to 27.8%. Red Bull sales decreased 1%, and its market share increased 0.7 points to 37.3%. Rockstar sales decreased 9% and its market share decreased 1.2 points to 18%. 
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 33.1% during the month of February 2016. Monster sales increased 8.3%. Our market share decreased 5.7 points to 25% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn, one of our acquired strategic brands, increased 4.9%, although Burn's market share decreased 1.7 points to 6.5%. Red Bull sales increased 0.7% and its market share decreased by 5.1 points to 15.7%. Vive 100's market share increased 14.3 points to 34.9%, while Boost's market share decreased 3.4 points to 11.3%. 
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended March 2016, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few days between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 12.1% to 13% in Great Britain; from 9.3% to 11% in Sweden; from 8.4% to 9.7% in Belgium; from 6.5% to 9% in Norway; from 5.7% to 7% in the Netherlands; and from 18.4% to 20.9% in France. For the 13-week period ended February 2016, according to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 11.2% to 13.6% in Germany, and decreased from 17.5% to 16.4% in South Africa, although value sales were 19.3% higher, according to Nielsen. We note that South Africa is one of those markets that has not transitioned to Coca-Cola bottlers. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ending February 2016 in Ireland increased from 7.4% to 8.7%, and from 21.5% to 24.8% in Spain. According to IRI, Monster's market share increased -- decreased in the 13 weeks to the end of February 2016 from 29.3% to 29.1%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. 
According to Nielsen for the month of March 2016 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 20.4% as compared to 15.3% last year. And in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of March 2016 declined from 4.7% to 3.1% as compared to the same period last year. In South Korea, for the month of March 2016, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 10% to 18.7% compared to the same period last year. 
According to INTAGE for the month of March 2016 in the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 33.8% to 39.9%. 
Net sales for the Finished Products segment in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $10.3 million of foreign currency movements in the first quarter. Net sales for the Finished Products segment in the first quarter of 2016 increased 12.3% from $555.7 million to $624.3 million from the comparable period last year after adjustments for acceleration of deferred revenue. Net sales for the company's Concentrate segment were negatively impacted by approximately $2 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. After adjustment for such foreign currency movements, net sales for the Concentrate segment would have been $57.9 million for the first quarter. 
As a result of the Coca-Cola transaction, which closed on June 12, 2015, there were no sales for the Other segment during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $31.3 million of net sales in the first quarter of 2015. 
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the first quarter increased 47.2% in dollars and 58.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 39.4% in the same period last year to 50.2% during the 2016 first quarter. EMEA sales were negatively impacted by supply disruptions that were encountered by CCE in Great Britain, Monster's largest market in the EMEA during the quarter, following the implementation of new software. Monster continued to gain momentum and increased market share in Europe in the first quarter. Overall, EMEA is now operating well, and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution, including securing distribution by Coca-Cola bottlers in new countries and territories within the region. 
We are pleased with the launch of Ultra in Europe. We commenced distribution of Ultra in an additional 8 markets in EMEA in the first quarter. Ultra will be launched in 10 additional markets in EMEA in the second quarter of 2016. In particular, in Germany, France, Denmark, Belgium, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden, Monster achieved increased sales gains as well as increased market share. 
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the first quarter increased 93.5% in dollars and 97.7% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales, increased from 31.2% in the same period last year to 45.2% during the 2016 first quarter. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 63.4%, 62.5% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased 283.4% or 312.6% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In Mexico, Central America and South America, net sales for the first quarter decreased 3.2% in dollars and increased 9.2% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 39.8% in the same period last year to 41.1% during 2016 first quarter. Net sales decreased in Brazil largely due to the overall difficult economic and market conditions, together with the ongoing uncertainties for our distributor relating to the Coca-Cola transaction. In Mexico, net sales decreased in part due to customer destocking during the quarter and delivery disruptions during the month of March. However, as reported by Nielsen, Monster sales at retail in Mexico grew during the quarter. 
In Chile, net sales in the quarter increased 52.3% in dollars and 74.9% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. 
As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with planning for local production in India, and anticipate reentering the market in India later in 2016. As mentioned earlier, we're optimistic that we will be able to finalize agreements with Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries in the near future. We are also continuing to evaluate production opportunities with Coca-Cola bottlers, both in the U.S. and internationally, which we believe will yield cost reductions. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $2.5 billion at March 31, 2016, prior to the close of the AFF transaction compared to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $508.2 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased to $7.4 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 48.7 days at March 31, 2016, and 43.2 days at December 31, 2015, compared to 46.4 days at March 31, 2015. 
Inventories increased to $165.9 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 58.1 days at March 31, 2016, which was higher than the 58 days of inventory at December 31, 2015, and lower than the 69.1 days at March 31, 2015. 
During the 2016 first quarter, we launched our new [indiscernible] energy drink and Salted Caramel Java Monster, initial consumer response has been positive. We are planning to launch Mutant, an exciting new beverage that will be positioned as refreshment energized, in the third quarter of 2016. For competitive reasons, we intend to provide further information on this new beverage at the stockholder meeting on June 14. 
As previously disclosed, we have also -- we also have additional new products planned for later this year. As this call is a week earlier than usual, we can only provide an estimate for April 2016 gross sales. Based on gross sales through April 28, 2016, we estimate April 2016 gross sales in dollars will be approximately 15% higher than in April 2015. In local currencies, we estimate April 2016 gross sales will be approximately 16% higher than in April 2015. We note that April 2015 sales included the old Warehouse segment and Peace Tea and April 2016 includes the Concentrates segment. We caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. 
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for our principal product. This transaction will be accretive to the company's earnings from the closing of the transaction on April 1, 2016. Consistent with the company's previously announced plan to return capital to shareholders in 2016, the company currently intends to commence a tender offer in May to purchase up to $2 billion in value of its common stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer at a price range to be specified. The company will fund the tender offer with cash on hand. While Hilton and I may participate in the offer for asset diversification reasons, we will continue to earn a substantial majority of our current holdings following any successful tender offer. 
North American and international gross margins remained healthy and continue to improve. The U.S. Nielsen market statistics and the equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales. We are excited about the prospects for our new Mutant beverage, which we're planning to launch in the third quarter. We are particularly pleased with our performance in our international markets. We have successfully transitioned a number of international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers, and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers from the second quarter of 2016. 
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Please note that we will not be taking any questions with respect to the tender offer on this call. Thank you."

Like you, we also need to understand what the position is with regard to those brands. Some of it is relating to weakness in the brands themselves, that we are addressing in various ways. Some of that, of course, is foreign currency. And there's another factor in that in certain countries, we have been unable to structure ourselves in a way that we could actually sell concentrates, and what we do in certain countries is we get a royalty from The Coca-Cola Company, which equates to effectively what we would have done had we sold the concentrate. It's a structure of setting up various countries to accommodate the concentrate business. So there is a whole lot of factors that one has to take into account in evaluating the concentrate business. So largely, there is some weakness, but we -- we are not -- you are not seeing in these numbers the full extent of the concentrate business because of some of these adjustments that have to take place."

And that did affect sales. So we did see a reduction in sales in those countries as a result, we believe, of that. So what we've had to do is, not only just go in and blindly, obviously, reinvest in marketing, but we've had to relook at how we're repositioning these brands and at the same time get the repositioning done, both in repackaging in designs, in flavors. And then obviously, then recreate marketing plans to put those -- the new positioning that we have looked at for these brands, particularly the Burn brand and Relentless are 2 of the large brands that did have some weakness. We've also in many ways repositioned NOS a little bit in the U.S., although we haven't changed packaging. We are going to modernize that packaging, and that's still coming through now. So this is a long process because there are -- we're many brands, in many countries. And layered on top of our own staffing and our own business obviously at Monster, it just takes -- it takes a long time to get a lot of these -- this repositioning done. So we think that's partially the reason for it. And yes, it has been weaker than we had estimated. But we are -- we've been doing the repositioning, we've been doing some focusing and we are starting to see some strong signs. And we do believe that, that will continue to be positive. Some of the other brands, although smaller -- again, it's a mixed bag, you can't put it into one category because in some cases, the brand's off more and may go away. But in other cases, some of the smaller brands are very good, very strong brands. And we are actually looking to long-term growth from those brands. But again, it's going to be a positioning and a build, it's not going to happen overnight. But you know, there are some good, really good brands that we see in the mix that we do believe we will see growth from going forward."

And so the contract that we have agreed to with The Coca-Cola Company as a principal, and obviously, we now -- you take that to the individual bottlers, they have their own lawyers, they have their own local laws and they have their own view of life. And very respectfully, many of them are not used to signing a contract of this nature, which is more akin to a finished product distribution agreement as opposed to a manufacturing concentrate bottler agreement, which puts a lot of more discretion and decisions in the hands of the bottler, whereas we tend to keep or want to keep most of those decisions about global marketing, about some of the local marketing and a number of things. The other thing is that we obviously got to be very cautious that we don't get into a situation. We have a large line of products, for example. And we don't want to be in a position that if the bottler decides he wants to take 1 SKU or 3 SKUs and not the rest, that we are kept out of the market for the rest of the SKUs. So there are bones of contention that keep going up and down between the legal agreements. And we're getting through them. But in many cases, it's really a question of literally educating a bottler in a country with their lawyers about why our agreement is in the form that it's in and why we need the protections. Then the other -- obviously, the other bucket is just -- it goes back to the old life, money. How do you share the value chain that's available in the country? And it's just arm wrestling between us and the bottlers as to how do we get to a fair value share? And in some cases, we are at odds with the bottlers on what we believe we want out of the value share. And we're not going to compromise the value share and take less in order to simply try and get deals done at -- because we want to move quickly. I mean, what we are going to negotiate is going to stay with us for 20 or 30 years or however long the agreements are. So we really do want to have a fair relationship and a fair share of the value chain. Bearing in mind that we spend and do a lot more than that is normally done by Coca-Cola Company in a bottler relationship. When they split their -- whatever the split is, when they split their value chain, the bottler picks up a lot more of the obligation. In our case, we do. And we don't want to be in a position where we split the chain and we end up with still the lion's share of the marketing and other expenses, which aren't fairly shared. So it's been a negotiation, and we just -- we're getting through them one by one. And I think that's really the color I've got. I don't know, Hilton, if you would like to add to it..."

So it is a bit of a haggling but as you can see from the agreements that have been finalized, we're moving forward, and we'll move forward in due course with some of the other bottlers or we won't. And if not, there are other distribution partners that we'll be working with."

As you all know, sales in the beverage industry in the second quarter continue to be weak on a global basis. We believe that it would be helpful to shareholders on this call to address our results on an adjusted basis, after giving effect to a number of selected items in addition to and not in lieu of our GAAP results. First, the results for the second quarter of 2016 were positively impacted by the accelerated recognition of deferred revenue of $5 million and negatively impacted by the modified [indiscernible] stock repurchase expenses of $1.5 million, AFF Transaction expenses of $3.6 million, as well as distributed termination costs of $25.3 million resulting in a net negative impact on operating income in this quarter of $25.4 million. 
Second, net sales in the 2016 second quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $4.1 million. 
Third, while the results for the comparable second quarter of 2015 were negatively impacted by distributed termination cost of $12.2 million and the Coca-Cola transaction expenses of $11.5 million, the results for that quarter were positively affected by the sale of Monster for $161.5 million during the quarter, which resulted in a net positive impact on operating income for such period of $137.7 million. 
Fourth, we accounted for the AFF Transaction in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Qualification 805 for business combinations. The effect from contribution margin from the AFF raw material cost savings was minimal in the 3 months ended June 30, 2016, as inventory on hand prior to the AFF Transaction, as well as the inventory acquired in the AFF Transaction were recorded as fair value and will not recognize through cost of goods sold until the end of the 2016 second quarter. 
As of June 30, 2016, the company's inventory on hand is recorded at the cost to AFF. As a result, the full extent of the raw material cost savings following the AFF transaction will be recognized in subsequent quarters. As these savings been recognized in full in the current quarter, the raw material cost savings would've been approximately $24 million. In respect of AFF sales to third-party customers after recognizing the fair value adjustment to inventory, $0.6 million was recorded as contribution margin in the quarter. 
Fifth, our modified Dutch auction tender share repurchase was completed on June 15, 2016, and we did not benefit from the lower number of shares in the quarter. Consequently, we believe that these adjustments need to be taken into account in reviewing our results for the quarter. 
Let me turn to the results for the 6 months ended June 2016. The results for the 6 months ended June 2016 were positively impacted by the accelerated recognition of deferred revenue of $5 million and negatively impacted by stock repurchases expenses of $1.6 million, AFF Transaction expenses of $4.5 million, as well as distributed termination cost of $28.7 million resulting in a net negative impact on operating income in such period of $29.8 million. 
The net sales in the first 6 months of 2016 were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $16.4 million. C, the results of the comparable 6 months of 2015 were negatively impacted by distributed termination costs of $218.2 million and the Coca-Cola Company transaction expenses of $15.1 million. But the results were positively affected by accelerated recognition of deferred revenue of $39.8 million and the sale of Monster's Non-Energy business for $161.5 million, which resulted in a net negative impact on operating income for such period of $32.1 million."

Our discussion earlier regarding the AFF raw material cost savings during the quarter is applicable in the same manner and to the same extent to the first half of 2016.

We are continuing to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers worldwide. We have successfully concluded negotiations with minute Coca-Cola bottlers in additional countries and are planning to launch Monster with those bottlers in most of their international markets in the near future. 
In the second quarter, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Peru. We also commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Mexico and Guatemala earlier in the third quarter, and are planning to commencKe distribution in Colombia and Chile later in the third quarter. 
In the fourth quarter, we are also planning to commenced distribution of Monster with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Brazil, Central America and Bolivia. We commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Albania, Iceland, Serbia, Macedonia in the second quarter, and anticipate commencing this distribution of Monster in Ukraine and Montenegro in the third quarter. We successfully position Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers in South Africa in July, and commenced distribution of Monster with additional Coca-Cola bottlers in Africa in the second quarter. 
Over the third quarter, we are planning to launch Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in 8 additional African countries with a number of additional companies in Africa, mainly North Africa to follow in the fourth quarter. We are making good progress in Nigeria with regard to both product registration and co-packing arrangements, which involves the installation of new equipment, specifically designed for the production of Monster. We are targeting the fourth quarter for the launch of Monster in Nigeria. 
We have also completed the registration of our product in Turkey and many other Middle Eastern countries, and are proceeding with the launch of Monster through Coca-Cola bottlers in Turkey and the number of Middle Eastern countries in the third and fourth quarters, as well as a number of other countries in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
In the second quarter, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Australia and New Zealand and Singapore. We are proceeding with the launch of Monster through Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of Central Asian countries in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Our plan to launch Monster within the Coca-Cola system in China are continuing to progress well, and we are currently engaged in the completion of our marketing and promotional plans in connection with the launch. 
Alto we have reached the [indiscernible] stage of you negotiations, we have still not reached final agreement with certain of the Coca-Cola bottlers in China. Subject to agreement on the outstanding terms, we are on schedule to launch Monster in China commencing with certain key areas on a progressive basis at the end of the third quarter and/or early in the fourth quarter. 
We are currently, awaiting approval for our product in India. We are making good progress in the repositioning, repackaging and reformulation of many of the Coca-Cola Energy brands that we acquired as a result of the Coca-Cola transaction. 
As previously the reported, we successfully completed our acquisition of the constant flavor business operated by AFF on April 1, 2016. While the acquisition and ongoing business activity have been in accordance with the expectations, we do not account for the full benefits of the transaction during the quarter as previously discussed. Had we been able to account for the full benefits of the acquisition in determining our cost of goods for the quarter, our cost of goods would have been reduced by a $24 million in the second quarter, resulting in a commensurate increase in our gross profit, less a minimal reduction that was recorded in the quarter. 
We believe that from the third quarter onwards, we will be able to utilize the full benefits of the lower cost of goods for AFF flavors. The company commenced the tender offer in May to purchase up to $2 billion in value of its common stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer. The tender offer resulted in the company's purchase of approximately 12.8 million shares at appropriately $156 per share for. The company accepted tendered shares on June 15, 2016, and as a result what we've been able to obtain, the full benefit of the reduction in its weighted average basic and diluted share capital for the full quarter. Had the repurchase been in effect for the full quarter, the repurchase would've increased net income per share on our basic and diluted share capital by approximately $0.05 per share for the quarter. 
On August 2, 2016, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of of 250 million of the company's outstanding common stock. There are limited sales of Finished Products in the strategic brands acquired from Coca-Cola. As a result, we have decided to rename our segments to address the products sold in those segments. 
Our ensuing discussion compares our 2016 second quarter results with our 2015 second quarter results after adjustment for certain items in both quarters PVC discussed, namely acceleration deferred revenue, distributed termination costs, expenses related to, one, TCC transaction; two, the AFF Transaction, and three, the share repurchase, as well as the gain on the sale of Monster's Non-Energy business. These adjustments are set out in the table in our earnings release and may be helpful to participants to refer to. 
I would like to point out that such adjustments exclude any FX relating to, A, the matter of accounting pursuant to the AFF Transaction in the quarter as oppose to future quarters; and, B, the increased number of shares in the quarter due to the timing of the modified Dutch auction tender offer. 
In the second quarter, the company achieved a record growth sales of $940.9 million, up 19.1% from $789.9 million in the second quarter of 2015. Net sales were $822.5 million, up 18.6% from $693.7 million in the second quarter of 2015. 
Net sales in the second quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $4.1 million. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 62.4% as compared to 56.9% for the comparable 2015 second quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the strategic brands segment, which generally has higher gross margins than the Monster Energy drink segment; two, no sales in the 3 months ended June 30, 2016 of the brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC transaction on June 12, 2015, previously comprised of majority of a former Warehouse segment in the PC brand segment, but generally had lower gross margin than the Monster Energy drink segment; three, lower cost of certain raw materials; and four, the price increase for our 16 ounce Monster product, which was implemented at the end of August 2015. 
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.2% as compared to 4.1% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.3% compared to 10.4% in the same quarter a year ago. Commission to Coca-Cola and increased sponsorship and endorsement costs largely related to the strategic brands were the 2 principal reasons for the increase in selling expenses. Premiums were also higher in the quarter. 
General and administrative cost as a percentage of net sales were 9.7% as compared to 9.5% in the same quarter last year. Payroll expenses were up $5.1 million, primarily to support the strategic brands that we acquired from Coca-Cola and stock-based compensation on a noncash item was $3 million higher, but was partially offset by a reduction in payroll taxes of $3.4 million. 
Distributed termination costs were $25.3 million in the second quarter as compared to $12.2 million in the 2015 second quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $3.8 million in the 2016 second quarter as compared to $3.5 million in the 2015 second quarter. 
Our effective tax rate in the quarter decreased from an adjusted 37% in the 2015 second quarter to 35.3% in the 2016 second quarter, primarily due to the domestic production deduction. 
On an ongoing basis, we expected our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36%. Net income was $203 million in the 2016 second quarter compared to net income of $143.2 million in the 2015 second quarter after taking into account the adjustments previously discussed, an increase of 41.7%. 
Net sales to customers outside of the United States were $242 million in the 2016 second quarter compared to $151.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. Net sales to customers outside the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $4.1 million. Included in the reported geographic sales are our sales of the company's military customers, which are in the United States to the military and their customers overseas.

The Nielsen's statistics for Mexico cover single month, which is a short period, that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during the particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended June 2016, the OXXO 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 12.3% to 13.8% in Great Britain; from 18.7% to 22.7% in France; from 11.4% to 14.5% in Germany; from 21.6% to 24.8% in Spain; from 8.9% to 10.3% in Belgium; from 8.6% to 10.5% in Sweden; from 5.9% to 10.7% in Norway; from 9.7% to 11.7% in the Czech Republic; and from 6% to 7.4% in The Netherlands.

Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 16.7% to 13% in South Africa. 
I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in the EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. 
We also note that South Africa was one of the markets that transitioned to the Coca-Cola bottlers at the beginning of July. According to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in value in Chile increased to 22% in May 2016, compared to 15.6% last year, and Monster's market share in Brazil declined from 3.9% to 2.5% in June 2016, as compared to the same as last year.

Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment for the second quarter of 2016 increased 13.4% from $651.2 million to $738.5 million from the comparable period last year after the adjustments described above. Net sales for the company's strategic brands segment were negatively impacted by approximately $1.5 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. Net sales for the strategic brands segment was $77.4 million for the second quarter as compared to $13 million [ph] in the same quarter last year. 
Net sales in EMEA in the second quarter of 2016 in dollars were 33% higher than in the same period last year. In local currency, net sales in the region was 30% higher than in the same period last year. Gross sales were 31% higher in dollars and 27% higher in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 46.4% in the same period last year to 50.8% during the 2016 second quarter. 
The EMEA sales continue to be negatively impacted during the quarter, while supply disruptions encountered by CCE in Great Britain, Monster's largest market in the EMEA during the first quarter that partially carried over to the second quarter following the implementation of new software. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increased market share in Europe, in particular, in Germany, France, Spain, Great Britain, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, The Czech Republic and The Netherlands. Monster achieved sales gains and continue to increase its market share. However, growth in South Africa was negatively impacted due to anticipated transition to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took effect from July 4, 2016. 
We are pleased with the launch of the Monster Ultra line in the me region, which is now available in 19 European countries and was launched in South Africa in July. We anticipate that the Ultra line will be sold in almost all of our growth in European markets by the end of this year. 
In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the second quarter increased 69.8% in dollars and 64.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 30.9% in the same period last year to 46.1% during the 2016 second quarter.

In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, [indiscernible] and Guam, net sales increased 330% or 239.7% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. And in Singapore, net sales increased 81% or 83.7% in local currency as compared to December last year. 
As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with the planning for local production in India, with a view to reentering the market later in 2016. In Latin America, which includes Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the second quarter increased 0.6% in dollars and increased 9.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. 
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 46.2% in the same period last year to 50% during the 2016 second quarter. Net sales decreased in Brazil, largely due to the overall difficult economic and market conditions, together with the ongoing uncertainties for our distributor relating to the Coca-Cola transaction and the anticipated transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which is now being set for November 1. 
In Mexico, net sales decreased in part due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, customer inventory restocking and the uncertainty relating to the Coca-Cola transition. However, as reported by Nielsen, Monster sales at retail in Mexico grew in the quarter. 
In Chile, net sales in the quarter increased 2.1% in dollars or 11.2% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. As mentioned earlier, we are optimistic that we will be able to finalize agreements with Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries in the near future. We are also continuing to evaluate production opportunities with Coca-Cola bottlers, both in the U.S. and internationally, which we believe will yield cost reductions. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $434.8 million at June 30, 2016 compared to $2.18 million at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $44.3 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased $0 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015. 
Accounts receivables increased to $465.7 million at June 30, 2016 from $353 million at December 31, 2015. Days sales outstanding for accounts receivables were 44.9 days at June 30, 2016 compared to 43.2 days at December 31, 2015 and 42.6 days at June 30, 2015. 
Inventories increased to $174.4 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 50.7 days at June 30, 2016,, which was lower than the 58 days of inventory at December 31, 2015 and the 54.4 days at June 30, 2015. 
As announced at our annual shareholder meeting, we are continuing with our plans to launch Mutant, an exciting new beverage that we positioned as refreshment energized, late in September 2016. As previously announced, we also have additional new products planned for production later this year and are working on additional new projects that we are planning to introduce early into 2017. We estimate July 2016 gross sales in a foreign exchange adjusted basis to be approximately 2% higher than in July 2015. In this regard, we point out that, one, in the U.S., the several countries we had 2 less selling days this year compared to last year, the reduction of 10% in selling days, which will be recognized in August; two, according to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 23, 2016 for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 3.8% versus the same period a year ago, while sales of Monster grew 7.5% in the same period versus a year ago; Three, we caution again of sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted well various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays for timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, such as the upcoming quality promotion. 
Distributor incentives, as well as shipped in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and [indiscernible] the determined their production schedules, which affects the dates in which we invoice such bottlers; and four, for the reasons of factors just discussed are reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month, could not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. 
In conclusion, I'd like to summarizing some recent positive points. One, our position of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the preparatory formulas for our principal product. We believe that we will be able to utilize the full benefits of the transaction through a reduction in operating cost commencing with the third quarter, and that this transition will be accretive to the company's earnings. 
Two, North American and international gross margins remain healthy and continue to improve. 
Three, the U.S. Nielsen market statistics and the equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the Energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. 
Four, the new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales. 
Five, we're excited about the prospects for our new Mutant beverage, which we are planning to launch later in the third quarter.  
Six, we are particularly pleased with our performance in our international markets. 
And seven, finally, we are successfully transition additional international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers, and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the second half of 2016. 
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you."

Secondly, how much is the non-measure or the nontraditional channel really adding to the growth because it looks like the second quarter U.S. number for your DSD business actually came in pretty healthy.

It sounds like you're making progress with the bottlers there in Mexico and Brazil, and just trying to get a sense of is this more of a staged transition where you're going into certain regions within that country with a 1 bottle, and then you roll out to the other bottlers?

And you saw that in the numbers we indicated earlier. Now and I think, Judy, publish numbers over the past couple of months as well and it show that had been a decline. Monster is growing ahead of the category, which, I think, is the important news in the continuing to take share, and that's in all the measured channels. But has been quite interesting is that part of our growth has been coming from the other measures channels and traditionally or historically we sort of grew more in the convenience channel, and we're in now starting to grow we were underrepresented in grocery and drug and some of the other independent channels, and we are starting to pick up higher growth in those channel. So if you look at our Nielsen numbers for convenience and then you look at the all measure gradually growing more in the old measure that the convenience. But, so I thought to be we still believe that the traits a healthy for Monster. If we look at of the gross sales, the key product in the gross sales, Monster Green is still continuing to be positive. We are getting good traction in the Ultra line in the U.S. and internationally as I indicated earlier in the call in Europe. And then generally, we are getting grwoth again in lines ahead sort of level of a little bit like we have. And the juice in line both in growth again. And obviously what's quite exciting is that the job line in fact, in the last 4 weeks, the Java line is generally is in at a higher growth rate than it has been reported and has been sort of in the last quarter. So that's where we feel see the numbers, obviously the nonmeasured channel are also growing. [indiscernible] is an important customer for us, and those channels are growing. And that's why even in relation to July, I did want to mention that we looked at the old measure channel for the 4 weeks because that continues to grow at 7.5%."

Where we've been in countries, and we transitioned, you obviously going in all channels. When you're running into smaller countries, particularly where you bought the bottler with good connections with some of the major channels, modern trade, you are going to independent stores and the modern trade and grocery at the same time. Other markets, we just generally try and focus first on the [indiscernible] and the Independent markets and then go into the market. So you can't -- there's no single formula for all of these markets. There isn't even a single formula for which markets you're going into. These being done on opportunistically on the basis that when we are able to conclude agreements with the Coke bottlers and we're able to properly terminate on notice our existing bucklers if there are bottlers in those markets and we will then go into markets. I mean, you take Argentina, there, we had in going to the market and that market we are at the moment engaged in planning and production and looking at changes being made to the line in order to accommodate our product. And then once that's done, we are working through the value chains with the local Coke bottlers in Argentina, then hopefully we will come to an agreement to the amended planned launch. So that takes a much longer time, and it's a longer planning ponderous than in other countries. So every country is different and while we expect countries A, B and C to be the third quarter, and D, E and F to be the fourth quarter, you may end up with A, B and D the third quarter in C, E and F in the fourth quarter. So it changes literally from month-to-month. So I can't give you a set plan of this on how it's coming in. And again, as to the contribution, it changes differently. Some markets the bottlers get more instant distribution in our sales are at a higher rate, some markets it takes time for the bottlers to get to understand our brand, the velocity, it has a different velocity with additional beverages, it doesn't start off at a high velocity in what would be the normal or ordinary high volume accounts. It needs to be both in the smaller stores where it serve cold and so cold one can at a time. And so sometimes that takes a lot of getting used to by the bottlers, and it takes time for this no magical ramp up at the end of the day you start you have a magical set of things it just takes time in both and continues to bolster, so we're at the station we really are conditioning a lot of markets now and there are different stages, and we have been for some months, and this going to continue to both over the rest of this year and in 2017."

And even if there was some technical hiccups, we could supply product from the Shanghai area, for example, to what of the other areas and produce it there. So those could be issues. We just obviously, we are in the planning stages we just trying to get to the finish that at a couple of issues, on the value chains, on the sharing and basically just some contractual terms. We think we should be there, it started off with a very big list down to a very few items now. So we're quite comfortable, and we will get there.

And again, subject to seasonality, et cetera. But that will be more in line as we go forward. There is a little bit of Finished Products in sales in that sector, which it doesn't -- it really doesn't affect it very much. It's a little bit of noise. If that starts growing a little more, does the may have a bit more of the effect, for example, and the reason we resigned that and putting it out that's why we're putting it into a different sector. For example, in the case of NOS in the U.S. we converge the 22-ounce plastic bottle sort of that unique bottle really practical to have produced and shipped it and on shelves, and we converted that didn't change it to into our 24-ounce resealable can. Then we would launch the 25 receivable can, it is a good product, and it's doing nicely. But that product, the Coca-Cola bottlers who were manufacturing NOS over Concentrate model, do not have the ability to manufacture the 24-ounce cup can. So we are having a manufacturer to supply on the Finished Products basis. So again, up of Summit normally like this, there is a little bit of Finished Products in Germany on strategic products because we changed Relentless into at 355 more slim can. And again, the coke production was producing Relentless in the can before we made the change through the design to the packaging and the pack size didn't have -- I'm not sure, which but to do so, so we are producing it to one of our Coke factories and selling Finished Products. So that might have an effect on your sale proceeds and slightly smaller margins because of just the nature of selling Concentrate at a higher margin but as we think it at the moment that is not a meaningful number in that sector."

As you -- sales in the beverage industry in the second quarter continued to be weak on a global basis. We believe that it would be helpful to shareholders on this call to address our results on an adjusted basis, after giving the effect to a number of selected items in addition to and not in lieu of our GAAP results. First, the results for the second quarter of 2016 were positively impacted by the accelerated recognition of deferred revenue of $5 million and negatively impacted by the modified Dutch tender stock repurchase expenses of $1.5 million, AFF Transaction expenses of $3.6 million as well as distributed termination costs of $25.3 million resulting in a net negative impact on operating income in this quarter of $25.4 million. 
Second, net sales in the 2016 second quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $4.1 million. 
Third, while the results for the comparable second quarter of 2015 were negatively impacted by distributed termination costs of $12.2 million and the Coca-Cola transaction expenses of $11.5 million, the results for that quarter were positively affected by the sale of Monster for $161.5 million during the quarter, which resulted in a net positive impact on operating income for such period of $137.7 million. 
Fourth, we accounted for the AFF Transaction in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 805 for business combinations. The effect on contribution margin from the AFF raw material cost savings was minimal in the 3 months ended June 30, 2016, as inventory on hand prior to the AFF Transaction as well as the inventory acquired in the AFF Transaction were recorded as fair value and will not recognize through cost of goods sold until the end of the 2016 second quarter.  
As of June 30, 2016, the company's inventory on hand is recorded at the cost to AFF. As a result, the full extent of the raw material cost savings following the AFF transaction will be recognized in subsequent quarters. As these savings been recognized in full in the current quarter, the raw material cost savings would've been approximately $24 million. In respect of AFF sales to third-party customers after recognizing the fair value adjustment to inventory, $0.6 million was recorded as contribution margin in the quarter. 
Fifth, our modified Dutch auction tender share repurchase was completed on June 15, 2016, and we did not benefit from the lower number of shares in the quarter. Consequently, we believe that these adjustments need to be taken into account in reviewing our results for the quarter. 
Let me turn to the results for the 6 months ended June 2016. The results for the 6 months ended June 2016, were positively impacted by the accelerated recognition of deferred revenue of $5 million and negatively impacted by stock repurchases expenses of $1.6 million, AFF Transaction expenses of $4.5 million as well as distributed termination costs of $28.7 million, resulting in a net negative impact on operating income in such period of $29.8 million. 
The net sales in the first 6 months of 2016 were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $16.4 million. C, the results of the comparable 6 months of 2015 were negatively impacted by distributed termination costs of $218.2 million and the Coca-Cola Company transaction expenses of $15.1 million. But the results were positively affected by accelerated recognition of deferred revenue of $39.8 million and the sale of Monster's Non-Energy business for $161.5 million, which resulted in a net negative impact on operating income for such period of $32.1 million."

We are continuing to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers worldwide. We have successfully concluded negotiations with many Coca-Cola bottlers in additional countries and are planning to launch Monster with those bottlers in most of their international markets in the near future. 
In the second quarter, we commenced distribution of Monster with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Peru. We also commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Mexico and Guatemala earlier in the third quarter, and are planning to commence distribution in Colombia and Chile later in the third quarter. 
In the fourth quarter, we are also planning to commence distribution of Monster with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Brazil, Central America and Caribbean. We commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Albania, Iceland, Serbia, Macedonia in the second quarter, and anticipate commencing this distribution of Monster in Ukraine and Montenegro in the third quarter. We successfully transitioned Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers in South Africa in July, and commenced distribution of Monster with additional Coca-Cola bottlers in Africa in the second quarter. 
Over the third quarter, we are planning to launch Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in 8 additional African countries with a number of additional companies in Africa, mainly in North Africa to follow in the fourth quarter. We are making good progress in Nigeria with regard to both product registration and co-packing arrangements, which involves the installation of new equipment, specifically designed for the production of Monster. We are targeting the fourth quarter for the launch of Monster in Nigeria. 
We have also completed the registration of our product in Turkey and many other Middle Eastern countries, and are proceeding with the launch of Monster through Coca-Cola bottlers in Turkey and the number of Middle Eastern countries in the third and fourth quarters as well as a number of other countries in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
In the second quarter, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. We are proceeding with the launch of Monster through Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of Central Asian countries in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Our plans to launch Monster within the Coca-Cola system in China are continuing to progress well, and we are currently engaged in the completion of our marketing and promotional plans in connection with the launch. 
Although we have reached an advanced stage of negotiations, we have still not reached final agreement with certain of the Coca-Cola bottlers in China. Subject to agreement on the outstanding terms, we are on schedule to launch Monster in China commencing with certain key areas on a progressive basis at the end of the third quarter and/or early in the fourth quarter. 
We are currently awaiting approval for our product in India. We are making good progress in the repositioning, repackaging and reformulation of many of the Coca-Cola Energy brands that we acquired as a result of the Coca-Cola transaction. 
As previously reported, we successfully completed our acquisition of the concentrate and flavor business operated by AFF on April 1, 2016. While the acquisition and ongoing business activities have been in accordance with the expectations, we do not account for the full benefits of the transaction here in the quarter as previously discussed. Had we been able to account for the full benefits of the acquisition in determining our cost of goods for the quarter, our cost of goods would have been reduced by approximately $24 million in the second quarter, resulting in a commensurate increase in our gross profit, less a minimal reduction that was recorded in the quarter. 
We believe that from the third quarter onwards, we will be able to utilize the full benefits of the lower cost of goods for AFF flavors. The company commenced the tender offer in May to purchase up to $2 billion in value of its common stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer. The tender also resulted in the company's purchase of approximately 12.8 million shares at appropriately $156 per share. The company accepted tendered shares on June 15, 2016, and as a result was unable to obtain the full benefit of the reduction in its weighted average basic and diluted share capital for the full quarter. Had the repurchase been in effect for the full quarter, the repurchase would've increased net income per share on our basic and diluted share capital by approximately $0.05 per share for the quarter. 
On August 2, 2016, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to 250 million of the company's outstanding common stock. There are limited sales of Finished Products in the strategic brands acquired from Coca-Cola. As a result, we have decided to rename our segments to address the products sold in those segments. 
Our ensuing discussion compares our 2016 second quarter results with our 2015 second quarter results after adjustment for certain items in both quarters previously described, namely acceleration of deferred revenue, distributed termination costs, expenses related to: one, the TCCC Transaction; two, the AFF Transaction; and three, the share repurchase as well as the gain on the sale of Monster's Non-Energy business. These adjustments are set out in the table in our earnings release and may be helpful to participants to refer to. 
I would like to point out that such adjustments exclude any effects relating to: A, the matter of accounting pursuant to the AFF Transaction in the quarter as opposed to future quarters; and, B, the increased number of shares in the quarter due to the timing of the modified Dutch auction tender offer. 
In the second quarter, the company achieved record growth sales of $940.9 million, up 19.1% from $789.9 million in the second quarter of 2015. Net sales were $822.5 million, up 18.6% from $693.7 million in the second quarter of 2015. 
Net sales in the second quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $4.1 million. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 62.4% as compared to 56.9% for the comparable 2015 second quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the strategic brands segment, which generally has higher gross margins than the Monster Energy drink segment; two, no sales in the 3 months ended June 30, 2016, of the brands disposed off as a result of the TCCC Transaction on June 12, 2015, previously comprised of majority of the former Warehouse segment in the Peace Tea brand, which generally had lower gross margins than the Monster Energy drink segment; three, lower costs of certain raw materials; and four, the price increase for our 16-ounce Monster product, which was implemented at the end of August 2015. 
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.2% as compared to 4.1% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.3% compared to 10.4% in the same quarter a year ago. Commission to Coca-Cola and increased sponsorship and endorsement costs largely related to the strategic brands were the 2 principal reasons for the increase in selling expenses. Premiums were also higher in the quarter. 
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 9.7% as compared to 9.5% in the same quarter last year. Payroll expenses were up $5.1 million, primarily to support the strategic brands that we acquired from Coca-Cola and stock-based compensation on a noncash item was $3 million higher, but was partially offset by reduction in payroll taxes of $3.4 million. 
Distributed termination costs were $25.3 million in the second quarter as compared to $12.2 million in the 2015 second quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $3.8 million in the 2016 second quarter as compared to $3.5 million in the 2015 second quarter. 
Our effective tax rate in the quarter decreased from an adjusted 37% in the 2015 second quarter to 35.3% in the 2016 second quarter, primarily due to the domestic production deduction. 
On an ongoing basis, we expected our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36%. Net income was $203 million in the 2016 second quarter compared to net income of $143.2 million in the 2015 second quarter after taking into account the adjustments previously discussed, an increase of 41.7%. 
Net sales to customers outside the United States were $242 million in the 2016 second quarter compared to $151.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. Net sales to customers outside the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $4.1 million. 
Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through July 23, 2016, all outlets combined, namely, convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 4.3% versus the same period a year ago. 
Sales in Monster grew 7.2% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS decreased 0.4%. Sales of Full Throttle decreased 8.8%, sales of Red Bull increased 2.3%, sales of Rockstar increased 10.5%, sales of 5-Hour decreased 3.4% and sales of AMP decreased 25.8%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 23, 2016, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 2.5% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 5.9% over the same period last year, while NOS was down 5.2% and Full Throttle sales decreased 7%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 0.3%, Rockstar was up 7%, 5-Hour was down 2.7% and AMP was down 34.1%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 23, 2016, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased by 1.1 points over the same period last year to 35.3%. NOS's share decreased 0.3 points to 3.5% and Full Throttle share decreased 0.1 point to 0.9%. Red Bull's share decreased 0.8 points to 35.5%. Rockstar share was up 0.3 of a point to 7.9%. 5-Hour share was lower by 0.4 of a point to at 8.2%. And AMP share decreased 0.8 of a point to 1.4%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 23, 2016, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 20% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster was 14.2% higher than the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot energy was 28.9% higher. 
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended June 25, 2016, the energy drink category decreased 4%.  Monster sales decreased 2% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 0.4 share points to 28.2%. Red Bull sales decreased 3%, and its market share increased 0.4 points to 38.6%. Rockstar sales decreased 8% and its market share decreased 0.6 points to 18.6%. 
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 36.4% during the month of June. Monster sales increased 4.2%. Our market share decreased 7.6 points to 24.5% against the comparable last year. Sales of Burn, one of our acquired strategic brands, increased 1.8%, although Burn's market share decreased 1.7 points to 4.9%. Red Bull sales decreased to 14.9% and its market share decreased by 7.9 points to 13.1%. Vive 100's market share increased 20.2 points to 41.8%, while Boost's market share decreased 0.4 points to 10%. 
The Nielsen's statistics for Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period, that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in OXXO convenience chain, which dominated the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that maybe undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended June 2016, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 12.3% to 13.8% in Great Britain; from 18.7% to 22.7% in France; from 11.4% to 14.5% in Germany; from 21.6% to 24.8% in Spain; from 8.9% to 10.3% in Belgium; from 8.6% to 10.5% in Sweden; from 5.9% to 10.7% in Norway; from 9.7% to 11.7% in the Czech Republic and from 6% to 7.4% in The Netherlands. 
According to IRI, Monster's marketing increased for the 13 weeks prior to the period ended June 2016, from 27.2% to 27.4%. For the 13-week period ended May 2016 according to Nielsen, Monster's retail market in Ireland grew from 8.2% to 9.6%. Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 16.7% to 13% in South Africa. 
I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in the EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. 
We also note that South Africa was one of the markets that transitioned to the Coca-Cola bottlers at the beginning of July. According to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in value in Chile increased to 22% in May 2016, compared to 15.6% last year. And Monster's market share in Brazil declined from 3.9% to 2.5% in June 2016, as compared to the same period last year. 
In South Korea, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 10.8% to 22.3% in June compared to the same period last year. 
And according to INTAGE, Monster's market share in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 32.7% to 39.2% in June 2016. 
Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment in the second quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $2.6 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment for the second quarter of 2016 increased 13.4% from $651.2 million to $738.5 million from the comparable period last year after the adjustments described above. Net sales for the company's strategic brands segment were negatively impacted by approximately $1.5 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. Net sales for the strategic brands segment was $77.4 million for the second quarter as compared to $13 million in the same quarter last year. 
Net sales in EMEA in the second quarter of 2016 in dollars were 33% higher than in the same period last year. In local currency, net sales in the region was 30% higher than in the same period last year. Gross sales were 31% higher in dollars and 27% higher in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 46.4% in the same period last year to 50.8% during the 2016 second quarter. 
The EMEA sales continued to be negatively impacted during the quarter, while supply disruptions encountered by CCE in Great Britain, Monster's largest market in the EMEA during the first quarter that partially carried over to the second quarter following the implementation of new software. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increased market share in Europe, in particular, in Germany, France, Spain, Great Britain, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, The Czech Republic and The Netherlands. Monster achieved sales gains and continued to increase its market share. However, growth in South Africa was negatively impacted due to anticipated transition to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took effect from July 4, 2016. 
We are pleased with the launch of the Monster Ultra line in the EMEA region, which is now available in 19 European countries and was launched in South Africa in July. We anticipate that the Ultra line will be sold in almost all of our Western European markets by the end of this year. 
In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the second quarter increased 69.8% in dollars and 64.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 30.9% in the same period last year to 46.1% during the 2016 second quarter. 
In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 20.1% or 10.3% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased to 170% or 188.8% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. 
In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales increased 330% or 339.7% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. And in Singapore, net sales increased 81% or 83.7% in local currency as compared to December last year. 
As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with the planning for local production in India, with a view to reentering the market later in 2016. In Latin America, which includes Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the second quarter increased 0.6% in dollars and increased 9.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. 
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 46.2% in the same period last year to 50% during the 2016 second quarter. Net sales decreased in Brazil, largely due to the overall difficult economic and market conditions, together with the ongoing uncertainties for our distributor relating to the Coca-Cola transaction and the anticipated transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which is now being set for November 1. 
In Mexico, net sales decreased in part due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, customer inventory restocking and the uncertainty relating to the Coca-Cola transition. However, as reported by Nielsen, Monster sales at retail in Mexico grew in the quarter. 
In Chile, net sales in the quarter increased 2.1% in dollars or 11.2% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. As mentioned earlier, we are optimistic that we will be able to finalize agreements with Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries in the near future. We are also continuing to evaluate production opportunities with Coca-Cola bottlers, both in the U.S. and internationally, which we believe will yield cost reductions. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $434.8 million at June 30, 2016, compared to $2.18 million at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $44.3 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased $0 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015. 
Accounts receivables increased to $465.7 million at June 30, 2016, from $353 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 44.9 days at June 30, 2016, compared to 43.2 days at December 31, 2015 and 42.6 days at June 30, 2015. 
Inventories increased to $174.4 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 50.7 days at June 30, 2016, which was lower than the 58 days of inventory at December 31, 2015 and the 54.4 days at June 30, 2015. 
As announced at our annual shareholder meeting, we are continuing with our plans to launch Mutant, an exciting new beverage that will be positioned as refreshment energized, late in September 2016. As previously announced, we also have additional new products planned for production later this year and are working on additional new projects that we are planning to introduce early into 2017. We estimate July 2016 gross sales on a foreign exchange adjusted basis to be approximately 2% higher than in July 2015. In this regard, we point out that, one, in the U.S., the several countries we had 2 less selling days this year compared to last year, the reduction of 10% in selling days, which will be recognized in August; two, according to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 23, 2016, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 3.8% versus the same period a year ago, while sales of Monster grew 7.5% in the same period versus a year ago; three, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, such as the upcoming Call of Duty promotion. 
Distributor incentives as well as shipped in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates in which we invoice such bottlers; and four, for the reasons and factors just discussed, we reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month, could not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. 
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the preparatory formulas for our principal product. We believe that we will be able to utilize the full benefits of the transaction through a reduction in operating cost commencing with the third quarter, and that this transition will be accretive to the company's earnings. 
Two, North American and international gross margins remain healthy and continue to improve. 
Three, the U.S. Nielsen market statistics and the equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the Energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. 
Four, the new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales. 
Five, we're excited about the prospects for our new Mutant beverage, which we are planning to launch later in the third quarter. 
Six, we are particularly pleased with our performance in our international markets. 
And seven, finally, we have successfully transitioned additional international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers, and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the second half of 2016. 
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you."

Secondly, how much is the nonmajor or the nontraditional channel really adding to the growth because it looks like the second quarter U.S. number for your DSD business actually came in pretty healthy? And then my second question is just on the Latin America. It sounds like you're making progress with the bottlers there in Mexico and Brazil. I'm just trying to get a sense of, is this more of a staged transition where you're going into certain regions within that country with a 1 bottle, and then you roll out to the other bottlers?

I'm no quite sure how many they are. But okay. Just going back to what, I think, everybody had noticed that there been a slight decline in the monthly or 4-week or 13-week numbers coming out of Nielsen for the category. And you saw that in the numbers, as what we indicated earlier now and I think, Judy, you published numbers over the past couple of months as well and it show there has been a decline. Monster has grown ahead -- is growing ahead of the category, which, I think, is the important news and we're continuing to take share, and that's in all the major channels. What has been quite interesting is that part of our growth has been coming from the other major channels traditionally or historically we sort of grew more in the convenience channel, and we're in now starting to grow. We were underrepresented in grocery and drug and some of the other independent channels, and we are starting to pick up higher growth in those channels. So if you look at our Nielsen numbers for convenience and then you look at all majors, we're actually growing more in all majors than the convenience. But -- so I thought to be -- we still believe that the trends are healthy for Monster. If we look at the gross sales, the key product in the gross sales, Monster Green, is still continuing to be positive. We are getting good traction in the Ultra line in the U.S. and internationally, as I indicated earlier in the call in Europe. And then generally, we are getting growth again in lines ahead sort of level off a little bit like Rehab and the Juice lines, they're both in growth again. And obviously what's quite exciting is the Java line in fact, in the last 4 weeks, the Java line generally is up at a higher growth rate than it has been reported and has been sort of in the last quarter. So that's where we see the numbers. Obviously, the nonmajor channels are also growing. Wal-Mart has been -- is an important customer for us, and those channels are growing. And that's why even in relation to July, I did want to mention that we looked at the all major channels for the 4 weeks because that continues to grow at 7.5%."

And even though they're in different countries that unnecessarily fill up whole country. So ultimately, we spent a lot of time ultimately in negotiating and getting to a deal with FEMSA. Once we're done there, it didn't facilitated moving quite quickly with other bottlers in each of these different countries. So as we indicated in the call, we have transitioned the whole of Mexico to all of the bottlers that comprised the Coca-Cola group in Mexico, and that is really started as of last week. In the case of the planned transition in Brazil, it will be to all of the bottlers at the same time. The whole group of bottlers have signed agreements with us. We're waiting until that all has happened at on time, and we will transition the whole country on November 1. In the case of Chile, there are 2 bottlers, we are going to the whole country. In the case of Brazil -- sorry, Columbia, there may be some small areas, but really it pretty much is FEMSA. We've already transitioned Peru, and we will be transitioning the other countries. So it will be pretty much the whole area. We will also be starting Central America and going to countries at a time in the Caribbean. We will be making that quite extensively, and that's not the same, for example, in which I indicated in China, where we are looking at, at the 3 main bottlers, but we are looking at that in such a been country we're, looking at selected areas and selected operating units first to go into then to launch in the second area with the second bottler, then in the third area, which are large towns, for example, we are looking at focusing in Beijing, in Shanghai and in Guangzhou areas, and then launching and in going to rolling it out to the different BU operating units as we go forward."

Where we've been in countries, and we've transitioned, you obviously are going into all channels. When you're gone into smaller countries, particularly where you got a bottler with good connections with some of the major channels of the modern trade, you are going into independent stores and the modern trade and grocery at the same time. Other markets, we just generally try and focus first on the down the street and the independent markets and then go into the market. So you can't -- there's no single formula for all of these markets. There isn't even a single formula for which markets you're going into. These are being done on opportunistically on the basis that when we are able to conclude agreements with the Coke bottlers, when we're able to properly terminate on due notice to our existing bottlers if there are bottlers in those markets and -- we will then go into markets. I mean, you take Argentina, there, we hadn't gone into the market -- in that market. We are at the moment engaged in planning production and looking at the changes being made to the line in order to accommodate our product. And then once that's done, we are working through the value chains with the local Coke bottlers in Argentina, then hopefully, we will come to an agreement with them and then plan a launch. So that takes a much longer time, and it's a longer planning process than in other countries. So every country is different and while we expect countries A, B and C to be the third quarter, and D, E and F to be the fourth quarter, you may end up with A, B and D in the third quarter and C, E and F in the fourth quarter. So it changes literally from month-to-month. So I can't give you a set plan of this on how it's coming in. And again, as to the contribution, it changes differently. Some markets the bottlers get more instant distribution and our sales are at a higher rate. Some markets, it takes time for the bottlers to get to understand our brand, the velocity. It has a different velocity to traditional beverages, it doesn't start off at a high velocity in what would be the normal or ordinary high volume accounts. It needs to be both in the smaller stores where it served cold and sold cold, 1 can at a time. And so sometimes that takes a lot of getting used to by the bottlers and it takes time. So there is no magical ramp-up the day you start that you have a magical set of things. It just takes time in both and continues to bolster. We're at the stage where we really are transitioning a lot of markets now and there are different stages, and we have been for some months, and there are going to continue to build over the rest of this year and in 2017."

We don't see any problem with that. It's already been approved by 2 independent Chinese authorities or provinces and that should be fine. And even if there was some technical hiccups, we could supply product from the Shanghai area, for example, to one of the other areas and produce it there. So those shouldn't be issues. We just -- obviously, we are in the planning stages. We're just trying to get to the finish line on a couple of issues, on the value chains, on the sharing and basically just some contractual terms. We think we should be, be there. It started off with a very big laundry list and we down to a very few items now. So we're quite comfortable, and we will get there.

But again, subject to seasonality, et cetera. But that will be more in line as we go forward. There is a little bit of Finished Products in sales in that sector, which it doesn't -- it really doesn't affect it very much. It's a little bit of noise. If that starts growing a little more, it obviously may have a bit more of the effect, for example, and the reason we are saying that and pulling it out and that's why we're putting it into the different sector. For example, in the case of NOS in the U.S., we converged the 22-ounce plastic bottle sort of that unique NOS bottle, but it wasn't really practical to have produced and shipped and on shelves, and we converted that and changed it into our 24-ounce resealable can. Then we relaunched the 24-ounce resealable can. It is a good product and it's doing nicely. But that product, the Coca-Cola bottlers who were manufacturing NOS of a Concentrate model, do not have the ability to manufacture the 24-ounce cap-can. So we are having it manufactured and supply on a Finished Products basis. So again, someone normally like this, there is a little bit of Finished Products in Germany on strategic products because we changed Relentless into a 355 ml slim can. And again, the coke production plant that was producing Relentless in a 500 ml can before we made the change through the design to the packaging and the pack size didn't have either the capacity or the ability. I'm not sure, which but, to do so, so we are producing it at one of our Coke factories and selling Finished Products. So that might have an effect on your sale proceeds and slightly smaller margins because of just the nature of selling Concentrate at a higher margin, but as we think at the moment that is not a meaningful number in that sector."

As you -- sales in the beverage industry in the second quarter continued to be weak on a global basis. We believe that it would be helpful to shareholders on this call to address our results on an adjusted basis, after giving the effect to a number of selected items in addition to and not in lieu of our GAAP results. First, the results for the second quarter of 2016 were positively impacted by the accelerated recognition of deferred revenue of $5 million and negatively impacted by the modified Dutch tender stock repurchase expenses of $1.5 million, AFF Transaction expenses of $3.6 million as well as distributed termination costs of $25.3 million resulting in a net negative impact on operating income in this quarter of $25.4 million. 
Second, net sales in the 2016 second quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $4.1 million. 
Third, while the results for the comparable second quarter of 2015 were negatively impacted by distributed termination costs of $12.2 million and the Coca-Cola transaction expenses of $11.5 million, the results for that quarter were positively affected by the sale of Monster for $161.5 million during the quarter, which resulted in a net positive impact on operating income for such period of $137.7 million. 
Fourth, we accounted for the AFF Transaction in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 805 for business combinations. The effect on contribution margin from the AFF raw material cost savings was minimal in the 3 months ended June 30, 2016, as inventory on hand prior to the AFF Transaction as well as the inventory acquired in the AFF Transaction were recorded as fair value and will not recognize through cost of goods sold until the end of the 2016 second quarter.  
As of June 30, 2016, the company's inventory on hand is recorded at the cost to AFF. As a result, the full extent of the raw material cost savings following the AFF transaction will be recognized in subsequent quarters. As these savings been recognized in full in the current quarter, the raw material cost savings would've been approximately $24 million. In respect of AFF sales to third-party customers after recognizing the fair value adjustment to inventory, $0.6 million was recorded as contribution margin in the quarter. 
Fifth, our modified Dutch auction tender share repurchase was completed on June 15, 2016, and we did not benefit from the lower number of shares in the quarter. Consequently, we believe that these adjustments need to be taken into account in reviewing our results for the quarter. 
Let me turn to the results for the 6 months ended June 2016. The results for the 6 months ended June 2016, were positively impacted by the accelerated recognition of deferred revenue of $5 million and negatively impacted by stock repurchases expenses of $1.6 million, AFF Transaction expenses of $4.5 million as well as distributed termination costs of $28.7 million, resulting in a net negative impact on operating income in such period of $29.8 million. 
The net sales in the first 6 months of 2016 were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $16.4 million. C, the results of the comparable 6 months of 2015 were negatively impacted by distributed termination costs of $218.2 million and the Coca-Cola Company transaction expenses of $15.1 million. But the results were positively affected by accelerated recognition of deferred revenue of $39.8 million and the sale of Monster's Non-Energy business for $161.5 million, which resulted in a net negative impact on operating income for such period of $32.1 million."

Our discussion earlier regarding the AFF raw material cost savings during the quarter is applicable in the same manner and to the same extent to the first half of 2016. Consequently, the full extent of the raw material cost savings following the AFF Transaction will be recognized in subsequent quarters. We are continuing to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers worldwide. We have successfully concluded negotiations with many Coca-Cola bottlers in additional countries and are planning to launch Monster with those bottlers in most of their international markets in the near future. 
In the second quarter, we commenced distribution of Monster with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Peru. We also commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Mexico and Guatemala earlier in the third quarter, and are planning to commence distribution in Colombia and Chile later in the third quarter. 
In the fourth quarter, we are also planning to commence distribution of Monster with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Brazil, Central America and Caribbean. We commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Albania, Iceland, Serbia, Macedonia in the second quarter, and anticipate commencing this distribution of Monster in Ukraine and Montenegro in the third quarter. We successfully transitioned Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers in South Africa in July, and commenced distribution of Monster with additional Coca-Cola bottlers in Africa in the second quarter. 
Over the third quarter, we are planning to launch Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in 8 additional African countries with a number of additional companies in Africa, mainly in North Africa to follow in the fourth quarter. We are making good progress in Nigeria with regard to both product registration and co-packing arrangements, which involves the installation of new equipment, specifically designed for the production of Monster. We are targeting the fourth quarter for the launch of Monster in Nigeria. 
We have also completed the registration of our product in Turkey and many other Middle Eastern countries, and are proceeding with the launch of Monster through Coca-Cola bottlers in Turkey and the number of Middle Eastern countries in the third and fourth quarters as well as a number of other countries in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
In the second quarter, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. We are proceeding with the launch of Monster through Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of Central Asian countries in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Our plans to launch Monster within the Coca-Cola system in China are continuing to progress well, and we are currently engaged in the completion of our marketing and promotional plans in connection with the launch. 
Although we have reached an advanced stage of negotiations, we have still not reached final agreement with certain of the Coca-Cola bottlers in China. Subject to agreement on the outstanding terms, we are on schedule to launch Monster in China commencing with certain key areas on a progressive basis at the end of the third quarter and/or early in the fourth quarter. 
We are currently awaiting approval for our product in India. We are making good progress in the repositioning, repackaging and reformulation of many of the Coca-Cola Energy brands that we acquired as a result of the Coca-Cola transaction. 
As previously reported, we successfully completed our acquisition of the concentrate and flavor business operated by AFF on April 1, 2016. While the acquisition and ongoing business activities of AFF have been in accordance with the expectations, we do not account for the full benefits of the transaction here in the quarter as previously discussed. Had we been able to account for the full benefits of the acquisition in determining our cost of goods for the quarter, our cost of goods would have been reduced by approximately $24 million in the second quarter, resulting in a commensurate increase in our gross profit, less a minimal reduction that was recorded in the quarter. 
We believe that from the third quarter onwards, we will be able to utilize the full benefits of the lower cost of goods for AFF flavors. The company commenced the tender offer in May to purchase up to $2 billion in value of its common stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer. The tender also resulted in the company's purchase of approximately 12.8 million shares at a price of $156 per share. The company accepted tendered shares on June 15, 2016, and as a result was unable to obtain the full benefit of the reduction in its weighted average basic and diluted share capital for the full quarter. Had the repurchase been in effect for the full quarter, the repurchase would've increased net income per share on our basic and diluted share capital by approximately $0.05 per share for the quarter. 
On August 2, 2016, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to 250 million of the company's outstanding common stock. There are limited sales of Finished Products in the strategic brands acquired from Coca-Cola. As a result, we have decided to rename our segments to address the products sold in those segments. 
Our ensuing discussion compares our 2016 second quarter results with our 2015 second quarter results after adjustment for certain items in both quarters previously described, namely acceleration of deferred revenue, distributed termination costs, expenses related to: one, the TCCC Transaction; two, the AFF Transaction; and three, the share repurchase as well as the gain on the sale of Monster's Non-Energy business. These adjustments are set out in the table in our earnings release and may be helpful to participants to refer to. 
I would like to point out that such adjustments exclude any effects relating to: A, the matter of accounting pursuant to the AFF Transaction in the quarter as opposed to future quarters; and, B, the increased number of shares in the quarter due to the timing of the modified Dutch auction tender offer. 
In the second quarter, the company achieved record growth sales of $940.9 million, up 19.1% from $789.9 million in the second quarter of 2015. Net sales were $822.5 million, up 18.6% from $693.7 million in the second quarter of 2015. 
Net sales in the second quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $4.1 million. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 62.4% as compared to 56.9% for the comparable 2015 second quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the strategic brands segment, which generally has higher gross margins than the Monster Energy drink segment; two, no sales in the 3 months ended June 30, 2016, of the brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC Transaction on June 12, 2015, previously comprised of majority of the former Warehouse segment in the Peace Tea brand, which generally had lower gross margins than the Monster Energy drink segment; three, lower costs of certain raw materials; and four, the price increase for our 16-ounce Monster product, which was implemented at the end of August 2015. 
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.2% as compared to 4.1% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.3% compared to 10.4% in the same quarter a year ago. Commission to Coca-Cola and increased sponsorship and endorsement costs largely related to the strategic brands were the 2 principal reasons for the increase in selling expenses. Premiums were also higher in the quarter. 
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 9.7% as compared to 9.5% in the same quarter last year. Payroll expenses were up $5.1 million, primarily to support the strategic brands that we acquired from Coca-Cola and stock-based compensation on a noncash item was $3 million higher, but was partially offset by reduction in payroll taxes of $3.4 million. 
Distributed termination costs were $25.3 million in the second quarter as compared to $12.2 million in the 2015 second quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $3.8 million in the 2016 second quarter as compared to $3.5 million in the 2015 second quarter. 
Our effective tax rate in the quarter decreased from an adjusted 37% in the 2015 second quarter to 35.3% in the 2016 second quarter, primarily due to the domestic production deduction. 
On an ongoing basis, we expected our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36%. Net income was $203 million in the 2016 second quarter compared to net income of $143.2 million in the 2015 second quarter after taking into account the adjustments previously discussed, an increase of 41.7%. 
Net sales to customers outside the United States were $200.2 million in the 2016 second quarter compared to $151.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. Net sales to customers outside the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $4.1 million. 
Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through July 23, 2016, all outlets combined, namely, convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 4.3% versus the same period a year ago. 
Sales in Monster grew 7.2% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS decreased 0.4%. Sales of Full Throttle decreased 8.8%, sales of Red Bull increased 2.3%, sales of Rockstar increased 10.5%, sales of 5-Hour decreased 3.4% and sales of AMP decreased 25.8%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 23, 2016, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 2.5% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 5.9% over the same period last year, while NOS was down 5.2% and Full Throttle sales decreased 7%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 0.3%, Rockstar was up 7%, 5-Hour was down 2.7% and AMP was down 34.1%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 23, 2016, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased by 1.1 points over the same period last year to 35.3%. NOS's share decreased 0.3 points to 3.5% and Full Throttle share decreased 0.1 point to 0.9%. Red Bull's share decreased 0.8 points to 35.5%. Rockstar share was up 0.3 of a point to 7.9%. 5-Hour share was lower by 0.4 of a point to at 8.2%. And AMP share decreased 0.8 of a point to 1.4%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 23, 2016, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 20% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster was 14.2% higher than the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot energy was 28.9% higher. 
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended June 25, 2016, the energy drink category decreased 4%.  Monster sales decreased 2% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 0.4 share points to 28.2%. Red Bull sales decreased 3%, and its market share increased 0.4 points to 38.6%. Rockstar sales decreased 8% and its market share decreased 0.6 points to 18.6%. 
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 36.4% during the month of June. Monster sales increased 4.2%. Our market share decreased 7.6 points to 24.5% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn, one of our acquired strategic brands, increased 1.8%, although Burn's market share decreased 1.7 points to 4.9%. Red Bull sales decreased 14.9% and its market share decreased by 7.9 points to 13.1%. Vive 100's market share increased 20.2 points to 41.8%, while Boost's market share decreased 4 points to 10%. 
The Nielsen's statistics for Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period, that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in OXXO convenience chain, which dominated the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended June 2016, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 12.3% to 13.8% in Great Britain; from 18.7% to 22.7% in France; from 11.4% to 14.5% in Germany; from 21.6% to 24.8% in Spain; from 8.9% to 10.3% in Belgium; from 8.6% to 10.5% in Sweden; from 5.9% to 10.7% in Norway; from 9.7% to 11.7% in the Czech Republic and from 6% to 7.4% in The Netherlands. 
According to IRI, Monster's market share in Greece increased for the 13 weeks prior to the period ended June 2016, from 27.2% to 27.4%. For the 13-week period ended May 2016 according to Nielsen, Monster's retail market in Ireland grew from 8.2% to 9.6%. Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 16.7% to 13% in South Africa. 
I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in the EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. 
We also note that South Africa was one of the markets that transitioned to the Coca-Cola bottlers at the beginning of July. According to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in value in Chile increased to 22% in May 2016, compared to 15.6% last year. And Monster's market share in Brazil declined from 3.9% to 2.5% in June 2016, as compared to the same period last year. 
In South Korea, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 10.8% to 22.3% in June compared to the same period last year. 
And according to INTAGE, Monster's market share in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 32.7% to 39.2% in June 2016. 
Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment in the second quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $2.6 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment for the second quarter of 2016 increased 13.4% from $651.2 million to $738.5 million from the comparable period last year after the adjustments described above. Net sales for the company's strategic brands segment were negatively impacted by approximately $1.5 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. Net sales for the strategic brands segment was $77.4 million for the second quarter as compared to $13 million in the same quarter last year. 
Net sales in EMEA in the second quarter of 2016 in dollars were 33% higher than in the same period last year. In local currency, net sales in the region was 30% higher than in the same period last year. Gross sales were 31% higher in dollars and 27% higher in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 46.4% in the same period last year to 50.8% during the 2016 second quarter. 
The EMEA sales continued to be negatively impacted during the quarter, while supply disruptions encountered by CCE in Great Britain, Monster's largest market in the EMEA during the first quarter that partially carried over to the second quarter following the implementation of new software. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increased market share in Europe, in particular, in Germany, France, Spain, Great Britain, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, The Czech Republic and The Netherlands. Monster achieved sales gains and continued to increase its market share. However, growth in South Africa was negatively impacted due to anticipated transition to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took effect from July 4, 2016. 
We are pleased with the launch of the Monster Ultra line in the EMEA region, which is now available in 19 European countries and was launched in South Africa in July. We anticipate that the Ultra line will be sold in almost all of our Western European markets by the end of this year. 
In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the second quarter increased 69.8% in dollars and 64.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 30.9% in the same period last year to 46.1% during the 2016 second quarter. 
In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 20.1% or 10.3% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased to 170% or 188.8% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. 
In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales increased 330% or 339.7% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. And in Singapore, net sales increased 81% or 83.7% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. 
As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with the planning for local production in India, with a view to reentering the market later in 2016. In Latin America, which includes Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the second quarter increased 0.6% in dollars and increased 9.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. 
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 46.2% in the same period last year to 50% during the 2016 second quarter. Net sales decreased in Brazil, largely due to the overall difficult economic and market conditions, together with the ongoing uncertainties for our distributor relating to the Coca-Cola transaction and the anticipated transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which is now being set for November 1. 
In Mexico, net sales decreased in part due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, customer inventory destocking and the uncertainty relating to the Coca-Cola transition. However, as reported by Nielsen, Monster sales at retail in Mexico grew in the quarter. 
In Chile, net sales in the quarter increased 2.1% in dollars or 11.2% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. As mentioned earlier, we are optimistic that we will be able to finalize agreements with Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries in the near future. We are also continuing to evaluate production opportunities with Coca-Cola bottlers, both in the U.S. and internationally, which we believe will yield cost reductions. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $434.8 million at June 30, 2016, compared to $2.18 million at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $44.3 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased $0 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015. 
Accounts receivables increased to $465.7 million at June 30, 2016, from $353 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 44.9 days at June 30, 2016, compared to 43.2 days at December 31, 2015 and 42.6 days at June 30, 2015. 
Inventories increased to $174.4 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 50.7 days at June 30, 2016, which was lower than the 58 days of inventory at December 31, 2015 and the 54.4 days at June 30, 2015. 
As announced at our annual shareholder meeting, we are continuing with our plans to launch Mutant, an exciting new beverage that will be positioned as refreshment energized, late in September 2016. As previously announced, we also have additional new products planned for production later this year and are working on additional new products that we are planning to introduce early in 2017. We estimate July 2016 gross sales on a foreign exchange adjusted basis to be approximately 2% higher than in July 2015. In this regard, we point out that, one, in the U.S. and several countries we had 2 less selling days this year compared to last year, the reduction of 10% in selling days, which will be recognized in August; two, according to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 23, 2016, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 3.8% versus the same period a year ago, while sales of Monster grew 7.5% in the same period versus a year ago; three, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, such as the upcoming Call of Duty promotion. 
Distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates in which we invoice such bottlers; and four, for the reasons and factors just discussed, we reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month, could not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. 
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for our principal product. We believe that we will be able to utilize the full benefits of the transaction through a reduction in operating cost commencing with the third quarter, and that this transaction will be accretive to the company's earnings. 
Two, North American and international gross margins remain healthy and continue to improve. 
Three, the U.S. Nielsen market statistics and the equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the Energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. 
Four, the new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales. 
Five, we're excited about the prospects for our new Mutant beverage, which we are planning to launch later in the third quarter. 
Six, we are particularly pleased with our performance in our international markets. 
And seven, finally, we have successfully transitioned additional international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers, and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the second half of 2016. 
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you."

Secondly, how much is the nonmeasure or the nontraditional channel really adding to the growth because it looks like the second quarter U.S. number for your DSD business actually came in pretty healthy? And then my second question is just on the Latin America. It sounds like you're making progress with the bottlers there in Mexico and Brazil. I'm just trying to get a sense of, is this more of a staged transition where you're going into certain regions within that country with a 1 bottle, and then you roll out to the other bottlers?

I'm not quite sure how many they are. But okay. Just going back to what, I think, everybody had noticed that there been a slight decline in the monthly or 4-week or 13-week numbers coming out of Nielsen for the category. And you saw that in the numbers, as what we indicated earlier now and I think, Judy, you published numbers over the past couple of months as well and it show there has been a decline. Monster has grown ahead -- is growing ahead of the category, which, I think, is the important news and we're continuing to take share, and that's in all the measure channels. What has been quite interesting is that part of our growth has been coming from the other measure channels traditionally or historically we sort of grew more in the convenience channel, and we're are now starting to grow. We were underrepresented in grocery and drug and some of the other independent channels, and we are starting to pick up higher growth in those channels. So if you look at our Nielsen numbers for convenience and then you look at all measured, we're actually growing more in all measured than the convenience. But -- so I thought to be -- we still believe that the trends are healthy for Monster. If we look at the gross sales, the key product in the gross sales, Monster Green, is still continuing to be positive. We are getting good traction in the Ultra line in the U.S. and internationally, as I indicated earlier in the call in Europe. And then generally, we are getting growth again in lines that had sort of leveled off a little bit like Rehab and the Juice lines, they're both in growth again. And obviously what's quite exciting is the Java line in fact, in the last 4 weeks, the Java line generally is up at a higher growth rate than it has been reported and has been sort of in the last quarter.

And even though they're in different countries they don't necessarily fill up whole country. So ultimately, we spent a lot of time ultimately in negotiating and getting to a deal with FEMSA. Once we've done that, it then facilitated moving quite quickly with other bottlers in each of these different countries. So as we indicated in the call, we have transitioned the whole of Mexico to all of the bottlers that comprised the Coca-Cola group in Mexico, and that has already started as of last week. In the case of the planned transition in Brazil, it will be to all of the bottlers at the same time. The whole group of bottlers have signed agreements with us. We're waiting until that all has happened at one time, and we will transition the whole country on November 1. In the case of Chile, there are 2 bottlers, we are going to the whole country. In the case of Brazil -- sorry, Columbia, there may be some small areas or small bottlers, but really it pretty much is FEMSA. We've already transitioned Peru, and we will be transitioning the other countries. So it will be pretty much the whole area. We will also be starting Central America and going to countries at a time in the Caribbean. We will be making that quite extensively, and that's not the same, for example, in which I indicated in China, where we are looking at, at the 3 main bottlers, but we are looking at that is such a big country, we're looking at selected areas and selected operating units first to go into then to launch in the second area with the second bottler, then in the third area, which are large towns, for example, we are looking at focusing in Beijing, in Shanghai and in Guangzhou, those areas and then launching and in going to rolling it out to the different BU operating units as we go forward."

Where we've been in countries, and we've transitioned, you obviously are going into all channels. When you're gone into smaller countries, particularly where you got a bottler with good connections with some of the measure channels of the modern trade, you are going into independent stores and the modern trade and grocery at the same time. Other markets, we just generally try and focus first on the down the street and the independent markets and then go into the market. So you can't -- there's no single formula for all of these markets. There isn't even a single formula for which markets you're going into. These are being done on opportunistically on the basis that when we are able to conclude agreements with the Coke bottlers, when we're able to properly terminate on due notice to our existing bottlers if there are bottlers in those markets and -- we will then go into markets. I mean, you take Argentina, there, we hadn't gone into the market -- in that market we are at the moment engaged in planning production and looking at the changes being made to the line in order to accommodate our product. And then once that's done, we are working through the value chains with the local Coke bottlers in Argentina, then hopefully, we will come to an agreement with them and then plan a launch. So that takes a much longer time, and it's a longer planning process than in other countries. So every country is different and while we expect countries A, B and C to be the third quarter, and D, E and F to be the fourth quarter, you may end up with A, B and D in the third quarter and C, E and F in the fourth quarter. So it changes literally from month-to-month. So I can't give you a set plan of this on how it's coming in. And again, as to the contribution, it changes differently. Some markets the bottlers get more instant distribution and our sales are at a higher rate. Some markets, it takes time for the bottlers to get to understand our brand, the velocity. It has a different velocity to traditional beverages, it doesn't start off at a high velocity in what would be the normal or ordinary high volume accounts. It needs to be bought in the smaller stores where it's served cold and sold cold, 1 can at a time. And so sometimes that takes a lot of getting used to by the bottlers and it takes time. So there is no magical ramp-up the day you start that you have a magical set of things. It just takes time in both and continues to bolster. We're at the stage where we really are transitioning a lot of markets now and there are different stages, and we have been for some months, and there are going to continue to build over the rest of this year and in 2017."

But again, subject to seasonality, et cetera. But that will be more in line as we go forward. There is a little bit of Finished Products in sales in that sector, which it doesn't -- it really doesn't affect it very much. It's a little bit of noise. If that starts growing a little more, it obviously may have a bit more of the effect, for example, and the reason we are saying that and pulling it out and that's why we're putting it into the different sector. For example, in the case of NOS in the U.S., we converted the 22-ounce plastic bottle sort of that unique NOS bottle, but it wasn't really practical to have produced and shipped and on shelves, and we converted that and changed it into our 24-ounce resealable can. Then we relaunched the 24-ounce resealable can. It is a good product and it's doing nicely. But that product, the Coca-Cola bottlers who were manufacturing NOS of a Concentrate model, do not have the ability to manufacture the 24-ounce cap-can. So we are having it manufactured and supply on a Finished Products basis. So again, on some anomalies like this, there is a little bit of Finished Products in Germany on strategic products because we changed Relentless into a 355 ml slim can. And again, the Coke production plant that was producing Relentless in a 500 ml can before we made the change through the design to the packaging and the pack size didn't have either the capacity or the ability. I'm not sure, which but, to do so, so we are producing it at one of our Coke factories and selling Finished Products. So that might have an effect on your sale prices in slightly smaller margins because of just the nature of selling Concentrate at a higher margin, but as we think at the moment that is not a meaningful number in that sector."

And then we do have 1 or 2 additional product -- innovation product lines, one particular one planned for launch towards the end of the year, beginning of next year. But again, depending on simply timing, we may get the products done and shipped at the end of year, but probably will be fully launched in January or late January. So there is the sort of the innovation pipeline going forward. There are a number of individual items that we are still also looking at introducing in this period in the next couple of months -- next 6 months."

As you -- sales in the beverage industry in the second quarter continued to be weak on a global basis. We believe that it would be helpful to shareholders on this call to address our results on an adjusted basis, after giving the effect to a number of selected items in addition to and not in lieu of our GAAP results. First, the results for the second quarter of 2016 were positively impacted by the accelerated recognition of deferred revenue of $5 million and negatively impacted by the modified Dutch tender stock repurchase expenses of $1.5 million, AFF Transaction expenses of $3.6 million as well as distributed termination costs of $25.3 million resulting in a net negative impact on operating income in this quarter of $25.4 million. 
Second, net sales in the 2016 second quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $4.1 million. 
Third, while the results for the comparable second quarter of 2015 were negatively impacted by distributed termination costs of $12.2 million and the Coca-Cola transaction expenses of $11.5 million, the results for that quarter were positively affected by the sale of Monster for $161.5 million during the quarter, which resulted in a net positive impact on operating income for such period of $137.7 million. 
Fourth, we accounted for the AFF Transaction in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 805 for business combinations. The effect on contribution margin from the AFF raw material cost savings was minimal in the 3 months ended June 30, 2016, as inventory on hand prior to the AFF Transaction as well as the inventory acquired in the AFF Transaction were recorded as fair value and will not recognize through cost of goods sold until the end of the 2016 second quarter.  
As of June 30, 2016, the company's inventory on hand is recorded at the cost to AFF. As a result, the full extent of the raw material cost savings following the AFF transaction will be recognized in subsequent quarters. As these savings been recognized in full in the current quarter, the raw material cost savings would've been approximately $24 million. In respect of AFF sales to third-party customers after recognizing the fair value adjustment to inventory, $0.6 million was recorded as contribution margin in the quarter. 
Fifth, our modified Dutch auction tender share repurchase was completed on June 15, 2016, and we did not benefit from the lower number of shares in the quarter. Consequently, we believe that these adjustments need to be taken into account in reviewing our results for the quarter. 
Let me turn to the results for the 6 months ended June 2016. The results for the 6 months ended June 2016, were positively impacted by the accelerated recognition of deferred revenue of $5 million and negatively impacted by stock repurchases expenses of $1.6 million, AFF Transaction expenses of $4.5 million as well as distributed termination costs of $28.7 million, resulting in a net negative impact on operating income in such period of $29.8 million. 
The net sales in the first 6 months of 2016 were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $16.4 million. C, the results of the comparable 6 months of 2015 were negatively impacted by distributed termination costs of $218.2 million and the Coca-Cola Company transaction expenses of $15.1 million. But the results were positively affected by accelerated recognition of deferred revenue of $39.8 million and the sale of Monster's Non-Energy business for $161.5 million, which resulted in a net negative impact on operating income for such period of $32.1 million."

Our discussion earlier regarding the AFF raw material cost savings during the quarter is applicable in the same manner and to the same extent to the first half of 2016. Consequently, the full extent of the raw material cost savings following the AFF Transaction will be recognized in subsequent quarters. We are continuing to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers worldwide. We have successfully concluded negotiations with many Coca-Cola bottlers in additional countries and are planning to launch Monster with those bottlers in most of their international markets in the near future. 
In the second quarter, we commenced distribution of Monster with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Peru. We also commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Mexico and Guatemala earlier in the third quarter, and are planning to commence distribution in Colombia and Chile later in the third quarter. 
In the fourth quarter, we are also planning to commence distribution of Monster with the Coca-Cola bottlers in Brazil, Central America and Caribbean. We commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Albania, Iceland, Serbia, Macedonia in the second quarter, and anticipate commencing this distribution of Monster in Ukraine and Montenegro in the third quarter. We successfully transitioned Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers in South Africa in July, and commenced distribution of Monster with additional Coca-Cola bottlers in Africa in the second quarter. 
Over the third quarter, we are planning to launch Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in 8 additional African countries with a number of additional companies in Africa, mainly in North Africa to follow in the fourth quarter. We are making good progress in Nigeria with regard to both product registration and co-packing arrangements, which involves the installation of new equipment, specifically designed for the production of Monster. We are targeting the fourth quarter for the launch of Monster in Nigeria. 
We have also completed the registration of our product in Turkey and many other Middle Eastern countries, and are proceeding with the launch of Monster through Coca-Cola bottlers in Turkey and the number of Middle Eastern countries in the third and fourth quarters as well as a number of other countries in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
In the second quarter, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Australia, New Zealand and Singapore. We are proceeding with the launch of Monster through Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of Central Asian countries in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Our plans to launch Monster within the Coca-Cola system in China are continuing to progress well, and we are currently engaged in the completion of our marketing and promotional plans in connection with the launch. 
Although we have reached an advanced stage of negotiations, we have still not reached final agreement with certain of the Coca-Cola bottlers in China. Subject to agreement on the outstanding terms, we are on schedule to launch Monster in China commencing with certain key areas on a progressive basis at the end of the third quarter and/or early in the fourth quarter. 
We are currently awaiting approval for our product in India. We are making good progress in the repositioning, repackaging and reformulation of many of the Coca-Cola Energy brands that we acquired as a result of the Coca-Cola transaction. 
As previously reported, we successfully completed our acquisition of the concentrate and flavor business operated by AFF on April 1, 2016. While the acquisition and ongoing business activities of AFF have been in accordance with the expectations, we do not account for the full benefits of the transaction here in the quarter as previously discussed. Had we been able to account for the full benefits of the acquisition in determining our cost of goods for the quarter, our cost of goods would have been reduced by approximately $24 million in the second quarter, resulting in a commensurate increase in our gross profit, less a minimal reduction that was recorded in the quarter. 
We believe that from the third quarter onwards, we will be able to utilize the full benefits of the lower cost of goods for AFF flavors. The company commenced the tender offer in May to purchase up to $2 billion in value of its common stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer. The tender also resulted in the company's purchase of approximately 12.8 million shares at a price of $156 per share. The company accepted tendered shares on June 15, 2016, and as a result was unable to obtain the full benefit of the reduction in its weighted average basic and diluted share capital for the full quarter. Had the repurchase been in effect for the full quarter, the repurchase would've increased net income per share on our basic and diluted share capital by approximately $0.05 per share for the quarter. 
On August 2, 2016, the company's Board of Directors authorized a new repurchase program for the repurchase of up to 250 million of the company's outstanding common stock. There are limited sales of Finished Products in the strategic brands acquired from Coca-Cola. As a result, we have decided to rename our segments to address the products sold in those segments. 
Our ensuing discussion compares our 2016 second quarter results with our 2015 second quarter results after adjustment for certain items in both quarters previously described, namely acceleration of deferred revenue, distributed termination costs, expenses related to: one, the TCCC Transaction; two, the AFF Transaction; and three, the share repurchase as well as the gain on the sale of Monster's Non-Energy business. These adjustments are set out in the table in our earnings release and may be helpful to participants to refer to. 
I would like to point out that such adjustments exclude any effects relating to: A, the matter of accounting pursuant to the AFF Transaction in the quarter as opposed to future quarters; and, B, the increased number of shares in the quarter due to the timing of the modified Dutch auction tender offer. 
In the second quarter, the company achieved record growth sales of $940.9 million, up 19.1% from $789.9 million in the second quarter of 2015. Net sales were $822.5 million, up 18.6% from $693.7 million in the second quarter of 2015. 
Net sales in the second quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $4.1 million. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 62.4% as compared to 56.9% for the comparable 2015 second quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the strategic brands segment, which generally has higher gross margins than the Monster Energy drink segment; two, no sales in the 3 months ended June 30, 2016, of the brands disposed of as a result of the TCCC Transaction on June 12, 2015, previously comprised of majority of the former Warehouse segment in the Peace Tea brand, which generally had lower gross margins than the Monster Energy drink segment; three, lower costs of certain raw materials; and four, the price increase for our 16-ounce Monster product, which was implemented at the end of August 2015. 
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.2% as compared to 4.1% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 11.3% compared to 10.4% in the same quarter a year ago. Commission to Coca-Cola and increased sponsorship and endorsement costs largely related to the strategic brands were the 2 principal reasons for the increase in selling expenses. Premiums were also higher in the quarter. 
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 9.7% as compared to 9.5% in the same quarter last year. Payroll expenses were up $5.1 million, primarily to support the strategic brands that we acquired from Coca-Cola and stock-based compensation on a noncash item was $3 million higher, but was partially offset by reduction in payroll taxes of $3.4 million. 
Distributed termination costs were $25.3 million in the second quarter as compared to $12.2 million in the 2015 second quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $3.8 million in the 2016 second quarter as compared to $3.5 million in the 2015 second quarter. 
Our effective tax rate in the quarter decreased from an adjusted 37% in the 2015 second quarter to 35.3% in the 2016 second quarter, primarily due to the domestic production deduction. 
On an ongoing basis, we expected our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36%. Net income was $203 million in the 2016 second quarter compared to net income of $143.2 million in the 2015 second quarter after taking into account the adjustments previously discussed, an increase of 41.7%. 
Net sales to customers outside the United States were $200.2 million in the 2016 second quarter compared to $151.3 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. Net sales to customers outside the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $4.1 million. 
Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
According to the Nielsen reports for the 13 weeks through July 23, 2016, all outlets combined, namely, convenience, grocery, drug, mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 4.3% versus the same period a year ago. 
Sales in Monster grew 7.2% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS decreased 0.4%. Sales of Full Throttle decreased 8.8%, sales of Red Bull increased 2.3%, sales of Rockstar increased 10.5%, sales of 5-Hour decreased 3.4% and sales of AMP decreased 25.8%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 23, 2016, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased 2.5% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 5.9% over the same period last year, while NOS was down 5.2% and Full Throttle sales decreased 7%. Sales of Red Bull increased by 0.3%, Rockstar was up 7%, 5-Hour was down 2.7% and AMP was down 34.1%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 23, 2016, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots in dollars, increased by 1.1 points over the same period last year to 35.3%. NOS's share decreased 0.3 points to 3.5% and Full Throttle share decreased 0.1 point to 0.9%. Red Bull's share decreased 0.8 points to 35.5%. Rockstar share was up 0.3 of a point to 7.9%. 5-Hour share was lower by 0.4 of a point to at 8.2%. And AMP share decreased 0.8 of a point to 1.4%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 23, 2016, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 20% over the same period last year. Sales of Java Monster was 14.2% higher than the same period last year, while sales of Starbucks Double Shot energy was 28.9% higher. 
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended June 25, 2016, the energy drink category decreased 4%.  Monster sales decreased 2% versus a year ago. Our market share increased 0.4 share points to 28.2%. Red Bull sales decreased 3%, and its market share increased 0.4 points to 38.6%. Rockstar sales decreased 8% and its market share decreased 0.6 points to 18.6%. 
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 36.4% during the month of June. Monster sales increased 4.2%. Our market share decreased 7.6 points to 24.5% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn, one of our acquired strategic brands, increased 1.8%, although Burn's market share decreased 1.7 points to 4.9%. Red Bull sales decreased 14.9% and its market share decreased by 7.9 points to 13.1%. Vive 100's market share increased 20.2 points to 41.8%, while Boost's market share decreased 4 points to 10%. 
The Nielsen's statistics for Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period, that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in OXXO convenience chain, which dominated the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended June 2016, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 12.3% to 13.8% in Great Britain; from 18.7% to 22.7% in France; from 11.4% to 14.5% in Germany; from 21.6% to 24.8% in Spain; from 8.9% to 10.3% in Belgium; from 8.6% to 10.5% in Sweden; from 5.9% to 10.7% in Norway; from 9.7% to 11.7% in the Czech Republic and from 6% to 7.4% in The Netherlands. 
According to IRI, Monster's market share in Greece increased for the 13 weeks prior to the period ended June 2016, from 27.2% to 27.4%. For the 13-week period ended May 2016 according to Nielsen, Monster's retail market in Ireland grew from 8.2% to 9.6%. Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 16.7% to 13% in South Africa. 
I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in the EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. 
We also note that South Africa was one of the markets that transitioned to the Coca-Cola bottlers at the beginning of July. According to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in value in Chile increased to 22% in May 2016, compared to 15.6% last year. And Monster's market share in Brazil declined from 3.9% to 2.5% in June 2016, as compared to the same period last year. 
In South Korea, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 10.8% to 22.3% in June compared to the same period last year. 
And according to INTAGE, Monster's market share in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 32.7% to 39.2% in June 2016. 
Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment in the second quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $2.6 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment for the second quarter of 2016 increased 13.4% from $651.2 million to $738.5 million from the comparable period last year after the adjustments described above. Net sales for the company's strategic brands segment were negatively impacted by approximately $1.5 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. Net sales for the strategic brands segment was $77.4 million for the second quarter as compared to $13 million in the same quarter last year. 
Net sales in EMEA in the second quarter of 2016 in dollars were 33% higher than in the same period last year. In local currency, net sales in the region was 30% higher than in the same period last year. Gross sales were 31% higher in dollars and 27% higher in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 46.4% in the same period last year to 50.8% during the 2016 second quarter. 
The EMEA sales continued to be negatively impacted during the quarter, while supply disruptions encountered by CCE in Great Britain, Monster's largest market in the EMEA during the first quarter that partially carried over to the second quarter following the implementation of new software. Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increased market share in Europe, in particular, in Germany, France, Spain, Great Britain, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, The Czech Republic and The Netherlands. Monster achieved sales gains and continued to increase its market share. However, growth in South Africa was negatively impacted due to anticipated transition to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took effect from July 4, 2016. 
We are pleased with the launch of the Monster Ultra line in the EMEA region, which is now available in 19 European countries and was launched in South Africa in July. We anticipate that the Ultra line will be sold in almost all of our Western European markets by the end of this year. 
In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the second quarter increased 69.8% in dollars and 64.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 30.9% in the same period last year to 46.1% during the 2016 second quarter. 
In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 20.1% or 10.3% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased to 170% or 188.8% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. 
In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales increased 330% or 339.7% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. And in Singapore, net sales increased 81% or 83.7% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. 
As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with the planning for local production in India, with a view to reentering the market later in 2016. In Latin America, which includes Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the second quarter increased 0.6% in dollars and increased 9.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. 
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 46.2% in the same period last year to 50% during the 2016 second quarter. Net sales decreased in Brazil, largely due to the overall difficult economic and market conditions, together with the ongoing uncertainties for our distributor relating to the Coca-Cola transaction and the anticipated transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which is now being set for November 1. 
In Mexico, net sales decreased in part due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, customer inventory destocking and the uncertainty relating to the Coca-Cola transition. However, as reported by Nielsen, Monster sales at retail in Mexico grew in the quarter. 
In Chile, net sales in the quarter increased 2.1% in dollars or 11.2% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. As mentioned earlier, we are optimistic that we will be able to finalize agreements with Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries in the near future. We are also continuing to evaluate production opportunities with Coca-Cola bottlers, both in the U.S. and internationally, which we believe will yield cost reductions. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $434.8 million at June 30, 2016, compared to $2.18 million at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $44.3 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased $0 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015. 
Accounts receivables increased to $465.7 million at June 30, 2016, from $353 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 44.9 days at June 30, 2016, compared to 43.2 days at December 31, 2015 and 42.6 days at June 30, 2015. 
Inventories increased to $174.4 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 50.7 days at June 30, 2016, which was lower than the 58 days of inventory at December 31, 2015 and the 54.4 days at June 30, 2015. 
As announced at our annual shareholder meeting, we are continuing with our plans to launch Mutant, an exciting new beverage that will be positioned as refreshment energized, late in September 2016. As previously announced, we also have additional new products planned for production later this year and are working on additional new products that we are planning to introduce early in 2017. We estimate July 2016 gross sales on a foreign exchange adjusted basis to be approximately 2% higher than in July 2015. In this regard, we point out that, one, in the U.S. and several countries we had 2 less selling days this year compared to last year, the reduction of 10% in selling days, which will be recognized in August; two, according to Nielsen, for the 4 weeks ended July 23, 2016, for all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug and mass merchandisers sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 3.8% versus the same period a year ago, while sales of Monster grew 7.5% in the same period versus a year ago; three, we caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, such as the upcoming Call of Duty promotion. 
Distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates in which we invoice such bottlers; and four, for the reasons and factors just discussed, we reiterate that sales over a short period, such as a single month, could not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. 
In conclusion, I'd like to summarize some recent positive points. One, our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for our principal product. We believe that we will be able to utilize the full benefits of the transaction through a reduction in operating cost commencing with the third quarter, and that this transaction will be accretive to the company's earnings. 
Two, North American and international gross margins remain healthy and continue to improve. 
Three, the U.S. Nielsen market statistics and the equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the Energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. 
Four, the new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales. 
Five, we're excited about the prospects for our new Mutant beverage, which we are planning to launch later in the third quarter. 
Six, we are particularly pleased with our performance in our international markets. 
And seven, finally, we have successfully transitioned additional international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers, and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the second half of 2016. 
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Thank you."

Secondly, how much is the nonmeasure or the nontraditional channel really adding to the growth because it looks like the second quarter U.S. number for your DSD business actually came in pretty healthy? And then my second question is just on the Latin America. It sounds like you're making progress with the bottlers there in Mexico and Brazil. I'm just trying to get a sense of, is this more of a staged transition where you're going into certain regions within that country with a 1 bottle, and then you roll out to the other bottlers?

Just going back to what, I think, everybody had noticed that there been a slight decline in the monthly or 4-week or 13-week numbers coming out of Nielsen for the category. And you saw that in the numbers, as what we indicated earlier now and I think, Judy, you published numbers over the past couple of months as well and it show there has been a decline. Monster has grown ahead -- is growing ahead of the category, which, I think, is the important news and we're continuing to take share, and that's in all the measure channels. What has been quite interesting is that part of our growth has been coming from the other measure channels traditionally or historically we sort of grew more in the convenience channel, and we are now starting to grow. We were underrepresented in grocery and drug and some of the other independent channels, and we are starting to pick up higher growth in those channels. So if you look at our Nielsen numbers for convenience and then you look at all measured, we're actually growing more in all measured than the convenience. But -- so I thought to be -- we still believe that the trends are healthy for Monster. If we look at the gross sales, the key product in the gross sales, Monster Green, is still continuing to be positive. We are getting good traction in the Ultra line in the U.S. and internationally, as I indicated earlier in the call in Europe. And then generally, we are getting growth again in lines that had sort of leveled off a little bit like Rehab and the Juice lines, they're both in growth again. And obviously what's quite exciting is the Java line in fact, in the last 4 weeks, the Java line generally is up at a higher growth rate than it has been reported and has been sort of in the last quarter. So that's where we see the numbers. Obviously, the nonmeasure channels are also growing. Wal-Mart has been -- is an important customer for us, and those channels are growing. And that's why even in relation to July, I did want to mention that we looked at the all measured channels for the 4 weeks because that continues to grow at 7.5%."

Once we've done that, it then facilitated moving quite quickly with other bottlers in each of these different countries. So as we indicated in the call, we have transitioned the whole of Mexico to all of the bottlers that comprised the Coca-Cola group in Mexico, and that has already started as of last week. In the case of the planned transition in Brazil, it will be to all of the bottlers at the same time. The whole group of bottlers have signed agreements with us. We're waiting until that all has happened at one time, and we will transition the whole country on November 1. In the case of Chile, there are 2 bottlers, we are going to the whole country. In the case of Brazil -- sorry, Columbia, there may be some small areas or small bottlers, but really it pretty much is FEMSA. We've already transitioned Peru, and we will be transitioning the other countries. So it will be pretty much the whole area. We will also be starting Central America and going to countries at a time in the Caribbean. We will be making that quite extensively, and that's not the same, for example, in which I indicated in China, where we are looking at, at the 3 main bottlers, but we are looking at that is such a big country, we're looking at selected areas and selected operating units first to go into then to launch in the second area with the second bottler, then in the third area, which are large towns, for example, we are looking at focusing in Beijing, in Shanghai and in Guangzhou, those areas and then launching and in going to rolling it out to the different BU operating units as we go forward."

Where we've been in countries, and we've transitioned, you obviously are going into all channels. When you're gone into smaller countries, particularly where you got a bottler with good connections with some of the measure channels of the modern trade, you are going into independent stores and the modern trade and grocery at the same time. Other markets, we just generally try and focus first on the down the street and the independent markets and then go into the market. So you can't -- there's no single formula for all of these markets. There isn't even a single formula for which markets you're going into. These are being done on opportunistically on the basis that when we are able to conclude agreements with the Coke bottlers, when we're able to properly terminate on due notice to our existing bottlers if there are bottlers in those markets and -- we will then go into markets. I mean, you take Argentina, there, we hadn't gone into the market -- in that market we are at the moment engaged in planning production and looking at the changes being made to the line in order to accommodate our product. And then once that's done, we are working through the value chains with the local Coke bottlers in Argentina, then hopefully, we will come to an agreement with them and then plan a launch. So that takes a much longer time, and it's a longer planning process than in other countries. So every country is different and while we expect countries A, B and C to be the third quarter, and D, E and F to be the fourth quarter, you may end up with A, B and D in the third quarter and C, E and F in the fourth quarter. So it changes literally from month-to-month. So I can't give you a set plan of this on how it's coming in. And again, as to the contribution, it changes differently. Some markets the bottlers get more instant distribution and our sales are at a higher rate. Some markets, it takes time for the bottlers to get to understand our brand, the velocity. It has a different velocity to traditional beverages, it doesn't start off at a high velocity in what would be the normal or ordinary high volume accounts. It needs to be bought in the smaller stores where it's served cold and sold cold, 1 can at a time. And so sometimes that takes a lot of getting used to by the bottlers and it takes time. So there is no magical ramp-up the day you start that you have a magical set of things. It just takes time in both and continues to bolster. We're at the stage where we really are transitioning a lot of markets now and there are different stages, and we have been for some months, and there are going to continue to build over the rest of this year and in 2017."

But again, subject to seasonality, et cetera. But that will be more in line as we go forward. There is a little bit of Finished Products in sales in that sector, which it doesn't -- it really doesn't affect it very much. It's a little bit of noise. If that starts growing a little more, it obviously may have a bit more of the effect, for example, and the reason we are saying that and pulling it out and that's why we're putting it into the different sector. For example, in the case of NOS in the U.S., we converted the 22-ounce plastic bottle sort of that unique NOS bottle, but it wasn't really practical to have produced and shipped and on shelves, and we converted that and changed it into our 24-ounce resealable can. Then we relaunched the 24-ounce resealable can. It is a good product and it's doing nicely. But that product, the Coca-Cola bottlers who were manufacturing NOS of a Concentrate model, do not have the ability to manufacture the 24-ounce cap-can. So we are having it manufactured and supply on a Finished Products basis. So again, on some anomalies like this, there is a little bit of Finished Products in Germany on strategic products because we changed Relentless into a 355 ml slim can. And again, the Coke production plant that was producing Relentless in a 500 ml can before we made the change through the design to the packaging and the pack size didn't have either the capacity or the ability. I'm not sure, which but, to do so, so we are producing it at one of our Coke factories and selling Finished Products. So that might have an effect on your sale prices in slightly smaller margins because of just the nature of selling Concentrate at a higher margin, but as we think at the moment that is not a meaningful number in that sector."

But that's how we read, and we run the business more on a trend basis than a single period of time."

On the gross margin, if I understood you correctly, you had unfavorable impact of $24 million on cost of goods. So the top line was very strong in the quarter, I guess, relative to expectations, the margins came in a bit lower than consensus expectations. But is it fair to say that the gross margin would have been closer to about 66% on sort of pro forma basis adjusting for that and, #1, is that fair? And #2, is that sort of a reasonable expectation going forward here?"

What I can tell you is that in the quarter, because of the accounting and for the consolidation of AFF, we did not get the benefit of the lower cost of goods in this quarter because we had inventory, and they had inventory and everything was related to fair value adjustment. So we do not get the benefit of the, a, lower cost of sales in this quarter. We will get it in subsequent quarters. If you look at what that number should have been had we not had to account for on these fair value adjustment methods, we would've added $24 million to our gross profit. And whatever that percentage is, that's the percentage is."

Again, it may be subject to getting the cooperation and the ability of the bottlers to focus when they get to that holiday season that does become a bit tight. But subject to that, we should be able to get Hydro after, again, later in the fourth quarter. And then we do have 1 or 2 additional product -- innovation product lines, one particular one planned for launch towards the end of the year, beginning of next year. But again, depending on simply timing, we may get the products done and shipped at the end of year, but probably will be fully launched in January or late January.

Sales in the beverage industry in the third quarter continued to be weak on a global basis. In the third quarter, net sales was $788 [ph] million, up 4.1% from $756.6 [ph] million in the third quarter of 2015. The company achieved record growth sales of $913.3 [ph] million, up 5.9% from $862.4 [ph] million in the third quarter of 2015. 
The comparative growth in net sales of $862.4 [ph] million and $756.6 [ph] million, respectively, for the 2015 third quarter were positively impacted by bonds purchases made for the company's customers due to a preannounced price increase effective August 31, 2015, uncertain of the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks. 
The company estimates that both gross and net sales for the 2015 third quarter increased by approximately $12 million and $11 million, respectively, as a result of such advance purchases. 
Gross and net sales for the 2016 third quarter after adjusting the 2015 third quarter comparatives for advance purchases increased by 7.4% and 5.7%, respectively. 
In this regard, I would like to point out that the increase in Monster's net sales for the 2016 third quarter is hurdling a significant increase in the third quarter of 2015 over the prior year's third quarter. 
Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduce growth sales by approximately $4.8 million and net sales by approximately $2.6 million in the 2016 third quarter. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 63.8% [ph] as compared to 61.5% [ph] for the comparable 2015 third quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the cost of goods savings and as a result of the AFF Transaction and product mix. 
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.1% compared to 3.5% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.1% compared to 10.7% in the same quarter a year ago. Increase sponsorship and endorsement across as well as increases in certain other marketing expenses, including marketing, research and social media, with the principal reasons for the increase in selling expenses, in-store demos and premiums were also higher in the quarter. 
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.7% as compared to 8.8% in the same quarter last year. Payroll expenses were up $7.3 million, primarily to support the strategic brands that we acquired from Coca-Cola and stock-based compensation and noncash item was 3.3 higher. Distributive termination costs were $4.7 million in the third quarter as compared to $2.5 [ph] million in the 2015 third quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and safety and sale of the company's products were $4.9 million in the 2016 third quarter as compared to $3.4 million in the 2015 third quarter. 
Legal and professional costs related to the intellectual property matters, particularly in China, were $2.5 million in the 2016 third quarter as compared to $0.8 million in the comparable 2015 third quarter. 
Our effective tax rate in the quarter decreased from 39.4% in the 2015 third quarter to 33.8% in the 2016 third quarter, primarily due in part to a onetime benefit related to a prior period domestic production deduction. 
On an ongoing basis, we expect that our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36%. 
Net income was $191.6 million in the 2016 third quarter compared to net income of $174.6 million in the 2015 third quarter, an increase of 9.8%. 
Net income per diluted share increased 17.5% [ph] to $0.99 in the quarter due in part to a lower share count as a result of the completion of the modified Dutch auction in June 2016. 
The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from $208.1 million at September 30, 2015, to $194.4 million at September 30, 2016. 
We are continuing to make good progress on the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers internationally. 
In the United States, we are continuing to see improvements in our quality of distribution. 
In the third quarter, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Mexico, Colombia and Chile. We commenced with the transition to Coca-Cola bottlers in Brazil earlier this week and will transition Panama and Costa Rica later this month. 
We commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Denmark, Montenegro and Ukraine in the third quarter. 
In July, we successfully transitioned Monster to the Coca-Cola bottlers in South Africa, which occurred at the same time as the restructuring of the Coca-Cola bottlers in South Africa took place. 
After a slow start, we are seeing better execution in South Africa. 
During the quarter, we also commenced distribution of Monster in Botswana and Zimbabwe and transition Swaziland, [indiscernible] and Mauritius. 
Over the fourth quarter, we plan to launch Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in additional African countries. 
We are making good progress in Nigeria with regard to both product registration and co-packing arrangements and are planning to launch Monster by early 2017 in Nigeria. 
In October, we commenced sales of Monster through the Coca-Cola bottlers in Turkey. 
In the fourth quarter, we are planning to launch Monster through Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of central Asian and Middle Eastern countries with further launches to follow in 2017. 
Following the conclusion of negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers in China, we commenced the launch of Monster beginning with Beijing in September and Shanghai and Hunan Province in October. We expect [indiscernible] and potentially other markets to be launched in the fourth quarter and are planning to launch Monster in additional territories in China during 2017. 
We are currently awaiting approval for our products in India. 
As previously reported, we successfully completed our acquisition of a concentrated flavor business operated by an American Foods and Flavors on April 1, 2016. As a result of the AFF Transaction, we achieved raw material cost savings of $23.3 [ph] million in the 2016 third quarter, which were broadly in line with the expectations.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covered single month, which is a short period, that may often be materially influenced positively or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. 
Sales in the OXXO convenience chain, in turn, can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. 
Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended September 2016, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few [ph] weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.9% to 14.2% [ph] in Great Britain; from 19.4% [ph] to 22.6% in France; from 12.3% to 14.9% [ph] in Germany; from 22.2% to 25.6% in Spain; from 8.8% to 10.5% in Belgium; from 9% to 10.5% in Sweden; from 6% to 11% in Norway; from 9.5% to 11.4% in the Czech Republic; and from 6.1% to 6.4% in The Netherlands.

I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by the Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country.

Net sales for the other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $5.7 million in the 2016 [ph] third quarter. There were no sales for the other segment in the comparable 2015 third quarter. 
Continued increases in sales of the ready-to-drink coffee category in the U.S., including our Java Monster line, bode well for the future. However, there exists limited production in the U.S. for such products, which requires rethought process due to the use of fresh mocha and cream. 
Future production capacity constraints, resulting from production and maintenance issues with co-packers, product shortages had been experienced in the industry. We are taking steps to address the issues, but anticipate that it would take a number of months before production availability will be balanced with consumer demand. 
Sales of Java Monster were impacted by such shortages in September and October, and we anticipate that sales will continue to be impacted in the foreseeable future. 
Net sales to customers outside the United States were $190.8 [ph] million in the 2016 third quarter compared to $170.6 [ph] million in the corresponding quarter in 2015.

Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 51.5% [ph] in the same period last year to 50.5% [ph] during the 2016 [ph] third quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 51.5% [ph] in the same period last year to 52.5% [ph] during the 2016 [ph] third quarter in local currencies. 
Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increased market share in Europe. In particular, in Germany, France, Spain, Great Britain, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, the Czech Republic and Ireland, Monster achieved sales gains and continued to increase its market share. 
We are pleased with the performance of the Monster Ultra line in EMEA region, which is now available in 25 European countries and was launched in South Africa in July. We anticipate that the Ultra line will be sold in almost all of our Western European markets by the end of this year. 
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 34.2% in dollars and 20.4% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 49.4% in the same period last year to 46.6% during the 2016 third quarter.

Net sales in the third quarter decreased 15% [ph] in dollars and decreased 66.2% [ph] in local currencies over the same peer last year. This region was impacted by foreign currency exchange rates and higher trade promotions in 2016. 
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 50.3% [ph] in the same period last year to 47.6% during the 2016 [ph] third quarter. 
In Mexico, gross sales increased 3.8% in dollars and 21.5% in local currency in September 2016 [ph]. 
Net sales decreased in part due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and high trade spending in 2016 [ph]. 
However, although Nielsen reported Monster's market share decreased during September 2016, Monster sales at retail in Mexico grew 12.6% during September 2016. 
Net sales decreased in Brazil, largely due to the overall difficult economic and market conditions together with the ongoing uncertainties for our distributor relating to the Coca-Cola transaction and the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1.

In late September, we launched Mutant, an exciting Super Soda in the U.S. that is positioned as refreshment energized in limited convenience stores in certain markets with encouraging early results. We experienced some production challenges with Mutant in early September, which have now been largely resolved, resulting in very limited distribution from Mutant in the quarter. The number of retailers stocking Mutant increased substantially in October. 
We have an additional new product planned for later this year and are working on new product that we are planning to introduce early in 2017 and which includes our new Hydro line that we've previously announced. 
On October 14, 2016, the company announced that its Board of Directors approved a 3.1 stock split of its common stock to be affected in the form of a 200% [ph] stock dividend on November 9, 2016. Each stockholder of record will receive 2 additional shares of common stock who each year of common stock owned at the close of business, Eastern Time on October 26, 2016. 
We estimate October 2016 gross sales on a foreign exchange adjusted basis to be approximately 12.3% higher than in October 2015. In this regard, we point out that according to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended September 24, 2016, 4 [ph] outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the Energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 3.5% versus the same period a year ago, while sales of Monster grew 6.4% in the same period versus a year ago. 
We caution again that sales of this period are often disproportionately of impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores. Distributors in centers as well as shifts in the timing of the Dutch in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. 
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for our principal product. Our ability to utilize the full benefits of the transaction through a reduction in operating costs commenced with the third quarter. This transaction will be accretive to the company's earnings. 
North American and international gross margins remain healthy. The U.S. Nielsen market statistics and the equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow, that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results. While the net difference was unbalanced, not material, unfavorable exchange rates in the U.K., our largest market in EMEA, is negatively affected our EMEA results following Brexit. Similarly, unfavorable currency exchange rates in Mexico also negatively affected our [indiscernible] American results. 
On the other hand, favorable currency results in Japan positively affected our Asia Pacific results. 
The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company sales. We're excited about the prospects for our new Mutant beverage. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets. In particular, I'd like to call out to the launch of Monster in China and the enormous growth potential for us in one of the largest energy drink markets globally. We have successfully transitioned additional international companies to Coca-Cola bottlers, and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the fourth quarter and in 2017. 
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter."

So it really started late in just really starting to ramp up now. But -- and the whole strategy we had with Mutant, just talk about Mutant, generally is we never intended at any time, it's how we launched all of our products. We didn't intend to go out and secure execution and make a big splash on day 1. It's bubbling up. We put into convenience stores. We're being very specific about the way we want to see it placed in the store, and we feel that's important. And the results of us doing that is actually, the feedback we've got is that there is very, very minimal, if any, cannibalization. So we are achieving, we believe, our strategic are protected is to minimalize any cannibalization with Monster energy drinks. And so that is being achieved. We are pretty much across-the-board as getting retailers buy in on our strategy and where it should be placed. There have been a few retailers that have resisted that income basis. And then for that reason, we haven't sold to those retailers. But we pretty much have very, very but acceptance and buy in from retailers.

Sales in the beverage industry in the third quarter continued to be weak on a global basis. In the third quarter, net sales was $788 million, up 4.1% from $756.6 million in the third quarter of 2015. The company achieved record growth sales of $913.3 million, up 5.9% from $862.4 million in the third quarter of 2015. 
The comparative growth in net sales of $862.4 million and $756.6 million, respectively, for the 2015 third quarter were positively impacted by bonds purchase made for the company's customers due to a preannounced price increase effective August 31, 2015, uncertain of the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks. 
The company estimates that both gross and net sales for the 2015 third quarter increased by approximately $12 million and $11 million, respectively, as a result of such advance purchases. 
Gross and net sales for the 2016 third quarter, after adjusting the 2015 third quarter comparatives for advance purchases, increased by 7.4% and 5.7%, respectively. 
In this regard, I would like to point out that the increase in Monster's net sales for the 2016 third quarter is hurdling a significant increase in the third quarter of 2015 over the prior year's third quarter. 
Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced growth sales by approximately $4.8 million and net sales by approximately $2.6 million in the 2016 third quarter. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 63.8% as compared to 61.5% for the comparable 2015 third quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the cost of goods savings and as a result of the AFF Transaction and product mix. 
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.1% compared to 3.5% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.1% compared to 10.7% in the same quarter a year ago. Increase in sponsorship and endorsement across, as well as increases in certain other marketing expenses, including marketing, research and social media with the principal reasons for the increase in selling expenses, in-store demos and premiums were also higher in the quarter. 
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.7% as compared to 8.8% in the same quarter last year. Payroll expenses were up $7.3 million, primarily to support the strategic brands that we acquired from Coca-Cola and stock-based compensation and noncash item was 3.3 higher. Distributor termination costs were $4.7 million in the third quarter as compared to $2.5 million in the 2015 third quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and safety and sale of the company's products were $4.9 million in the 2016 third quarter as compared to $3.4 million in the 2015 third quarter. 
Legal and professional costs related to intellectual property matters, particularly in China, were $2.5 million in the 2016 third quarter as compared to $0.8 million in the comparable 2015 third quarter. 
Our effective tax rate in the quarter decreased from 39.4% in the 2015 third quarter to 33.8% in the 2016 third quarter, primarily due in part to a onetime benefit related to a prior period domestic production deduction. 
On an ongoing basis, we expect that our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36%. 
Net income was $191.6 million in the 2016 third quarter compared to net income of $174.6 million in the 2015 third quarter, an increase of 9.8%. 
Net income per diluted share increased 17.5% to $0.99 in the quarter due in part to a lower share count as a result of the completion of the modified Dutch auction in June 2016. 
The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from $208.1 million at September 30, 2015 to $194.4 million at September 30, 2016. 
We are continuing to make good progress on the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers internationally. In the United States, we are continuing to see improvements in our quality of distribution. 
In the third quarter, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Mexico, Colombia and Chile. We commenced with the transition to Coca-Cola bottlers in Brazil earlier this week and will transition Panama and Costa Rica later this month. We commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Denmark, Montenegro and Ukraine in the third quarter. 
In July, we successfully transitioned Monster to the Coca-Cola bottlers in South Africa, which occurred at the same time as the restructuring of the Coca-Cola bottlers in South Africa took place. 
After a slow start, we are seeing better execution in South Africa. 
During the quarter, we also commenced distribution of Monster in Botswana and Zimbabwe and transition Swaziland, Reunion and Mauritius. Over the fourth quarter, we plan to launch Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in additional African countries. 
We are making good progress in Nigeria with regard to both product registration and co-packing arrangements and are planning to launch Monster by early 2017 in Nigeria. In October, we commenced sales of Monster through the Coca-Cola bottlers in Turkey. 
In the fourth quarter, we are planning to launch Monster through Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of Central Asian and Middle Eastern countries with further launches to follow in 2017. 
Following the conclusion of negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers in China, we commenced the launch of Monster beginning with Beijing in September and Shanghai and Hunan Province in October. We expect Guangzhou, Shenzhen and potentially other markets to be launched in the fourth quarter and are planning to launch Monster in additional territories in China during 2017. 
We are currently awaiting approval for our products in India. 
As previously reported, we successfully completed our acquisition of a concentrated flavor business operated by American Fruits & Flavors on April 1, 2016. As a result of the AFF Transaction, we achieved raw material cost savings of $23.3 million in the 2016 third quarter, which were broadly in line with the expectations.

Sales of Burn, one of our acquired strategic brands, increased 28.4%, although Burn's market share decreased 0.3 points of 1 point to 4.9%. 
Red Bull sales decreased 11.7% and its market share decreased by 6.3 points to 11.7%. Vive 100's market share increased 15.4 points to 44.2%, while Boost's market share decreased 5.9 points to 9.3%. 
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covered a single month, which is a short period, that may often be materially influenced positively or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month.  Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended September 2016, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.9% to 14.2% in Great Britain; from 19.4% to 22.6% in France; from 12.3% to 14.9% in Germany; from 22.2% to 25.6% in Spain; from 8.8% to 10.5% in Belgium; from 9% to 10.5% in Sweden; from 6% to 11% in Norway; from 9.5% to 11.4% in the Czech Republic; and from 6.1% to 6.4% in The Netherlands.

And for the 13-week period ended September 2016 Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 15.6% to 13.1% in South Africa, primarily due to increased distribution of Dragon, our new lower price energy drink, although retail sales of Monster increased. 
I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country-to-country. 
According to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in value in Chile increased to 21.6% in September 2016 as compared to 18.2% last year. And Monster's market share in Brazil declined from 3.9% to 2.6% in September 2016 as compared to the same period last year.

Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $1.6 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment for the third quarter of 2016 increased 3.4% from $686.7 million to $710.1 million from the comparable period last year. 
Net sales for the company's strategic brands segment were negatively impacted by approximately $1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. 
Net sales for the Strategic Brand segment was $72.1 million for the third quarter as compared to $69.9 million in the same quarter last year. 
Net sales for the other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $5.7 million in the 2016 third quarter. There were no sales for the other segment in the comparable 2015 third quarter. 
Continued increases in sales of the ready-to-drink coffee category in the U.S., including our Java Monster line, bode well for the future. However, there exists limited production in the U.S. for such products, which requires a rethought process due to the use of fresh milk and cream. 
Due to production capacity constraints resulting from production and maintenance issues with co-packers, product shortages had been experienced in the industry. We are taking steps to address the issues but anticipate that it will take a number of months before production availability will be balanced with consumer demand. 
Sales of Java Monster were impacted by such shortages in September and October, and we anticipate that sales will continue to be impacted in the foreseeable future. 
Net sales to customers outside the United States were $190.8 million in the 2016 third quarter compared to $170.6 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. 
Net sales to customers outside of the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $2.6 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
Net sales in EMEA in the third quarter of 2016 in dollars were 14% higher than in the same period last year. In local currencies, net sales in the region were 19% higher than in the same period last year. 
The foregoing differences were primarily due to the weakening of the British pound against the U.S. dollar. Gross sales were 11.6% higher in dollars and 18% higher in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 51.5% in the same period last year to 50.5% during the 2016 third quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 51.5% in the same period last year to 52.5% during the 2016 third quarter in local currencies. 
Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increased market share in Europe. In particular, in Germany, France, Spain, Great Britain, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, the Czech Republic and Ireland, Monster achieved sales gains and continue to increase its market share. 
We are pleased with the performance of the Monster Ultra line in EMEA region, which is now available in 25 European countries and was launched in South Africa in July. We anticipate that the Ultra line will be sold in almost all of our Western European markets by the end of this year. 
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 34.2% in dollars and 20.4% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 49.4% in the same period last year to 46.6% during the 2016 third quarter. 
In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 28.2% or 7.2% in local currency, primarily due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar as compared to the same quarter last year. 
We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. 
In Korea -- South Korea, net sales increased 125.7%, 127.2% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. 
In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales increased 22.2% or 19.9% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. In Singapore, net sales increased 109.1% or 111.1% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. 
As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with the planning for local production in India, with a view to reentering the market in 2017. 
In Latin America, which includes Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the third quarter decreased 6.1% in dollars and increased 3.9% in local currencies. Net sales in the third quarter decreased 15% in dollars and decreased 6.2% in local currencies over the same period last year. This region was impacted by foreign currency exchange rates and higher trade promotions in 2016. 
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 50.3% in the same period last year to 47.6% during the 2016 third quarter. 
In Mexico, gross sales increased 3.8% in dollars and 21.5% in local currency in September 2016. Net sales decreased in part due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher trade spending in 2016.
However, although Nielsen reported Monster's market share decreased during September 2016, Monster sales at retail in Mexico grew 12.6% during September 2016. 
Net sales decreased in Brazil, largely due to the overall difficult economic and market conditions together with the ongoing uncertainties for our distributor relating to the Coca-Cola transaction and the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $341.5 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $2.18 million at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $257.7 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased to $9.5 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015. 
Accounts receivable increased to $467.3 million at September 30, 2016, from $353 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 46.5 days at September 30, 2016 compared to 43.2 days at December 31, 2015 and 43 days at September 30, 2015. 
Inventories increased to $167.8 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 53 days at September 30, 2016, compared to 58 days of inventory at December 31, 2015 and 49.4 days at September 30, 2015. 
In late September, we launched Mutant, an exciting super soda in the U.S. that is positioned as refreshment energized, in limited convenience stores in certain markets with encouraging early results. We experienced some production challenges with Mutant in early September, which have now been largely resolved, resulting in very limited distribution for Mutant in the quarter. The number of retailers stocking Mutant increased substantially in October. 
We have an additional new product planned for later this year and are working on new product that we are planning to introduce early in 2017 and which includes our new Hydro line that we've previously announced. 
On October 14, 2016, the company announced that its Board of Directors approved a 3.1 stock split of its common stock to be effected in the form of a 200% stock dividend. On November 9, 2016, each stockholder of record will receive 2 additional shares of common stock for each year of common stock owned at the close of business, Eastern Time on October 26, 2016.  
We estimate October 2016 gross sales on a foreign exchange adjusted basis to be approximately 12.3% higher than in October 2015. In this regard, we point out that according to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended September 24, 2016, all outlets combined namely, convenience, grocery drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the Energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 3.5% versus the same period a year ago, while sales of Monster grew 6.4% in the same period versus a year ago. 
We caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor in centers, as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. 
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for our principal product. Our ability to utilize the full benefits of the transaction, through a reduction in operating costs, commenced with the third quarter. This transaction will be accretive to the company's earnings. 
North American and international gross margins remain healthy. The U.S. Nielsen market statistics and equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow, that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results. While the net difference was unbalanced, not material, unfavorable exchange rates in the U.K., our largest market in EMEA, negatively affected our EMEA results following Brexit. Similarly, unfavorable currency exchange rates in Mexico also negatively affected our [indiscernible] American results. 
On the other hand, favorable currency results in Japan positively affected our Asia Pacific results. 
The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company sales. We're excited about the prospects for our new Mutant beverage. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets. In particular, I'd like to call out the launch of Monster in China and the enormous growth potential for us in one of the largest energy drink markets globally. We have successfully transitioned additional international companies to Coca-Cola bottlers, and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the fourth quarter and in 2017. 
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter."

To date, we've probably secured probably of the order, and it's a very rough guess from what we've discussed with our bottlers, about 50,000 accounts in the areas where we've already launched. We will be going into Guangzhou and Shenzhen pretty much within the next week or so. So we are getting good distribution. We are getting good response to the product. And so we just are very hopeful and excited that we will be able to continue to expand. There is a massive universe of stores available to us. It's a very big country. We are probably, by the end of the year, we should have launched Monster in, probably, areas that will be covered by about 18% of the population or -- and about -- and those areas represent, our estimate at the moment is, about 30%, 33% of the current energy market once we would have got through December. So we just -- it's a big market, and we're obviously planning to do -- there's a little bit of a hiatus between beginning of January and until after Chinese New Year. And once that we're through that, then we're going to start focusing on launching pre-summer in China. Obviously, that will be thrust of our focus."

It varies quite a bit between these stores but whichever way you look at it, the percentages is quite respectable and everybody, including the retailers, have been quite surprised and quite happy with the sell in. The actual level of Mutant that was sold in the quarter, I think there is Mark's questions, one of Mark's questions earlier, it was about $4.5 million in our numbers on a gross basis. So really it started late and it's really just starting to ramp up now. But -- and the whole strategy we had with Mutant, just talking about Mutant, generally is we never intended at any time, it's how we've launched all of our products, we didn't intend to go out and secure execution and make a big splash on day 1. It's bubbling up. We put it into convenience stores. We are being very specific about the way we want to see it placed in the store, and we feel that's important. And the results of us doing that is actually the feedback we've got is that there is very, very minimal, if any, cannibalization. So we are achieving, we believe, our strategic objective is to minimalize any cannibalization with Monster energy drinks. And so that is being achieved. We are pretty much across-the-board getting retailers buy-in on our strategy and where it should be placed. There have been a few retailers that have resisted that and in some cases, for that reason, we haven't sold to those retailers. But we pretty much have very, very broad acceptance and buy-in from retailers. And so far, we're actually very encouraged by the sale rate for a new brand."

Sales in the beverage industry in the third quarter continued to be weak on a global basis. In the third quarter, net sales was $788 million, up 4.1% from $756.6 million in the third quarter of 2015. The company achieved record growth sales of $913.3 million, up 5.9% from $862.4 million in the third quarter of 2015. 
The comparative growth in net sales of $862.4 million and $756.6 million, respectively, for the 2015 third quarter were positively impacted by bonds purchases made for the company's customers due to a preannounced price increase effective August 31, 2015, uncertain of the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks. 
The company estimates that both gross and net sales for the 2015 third quarter increased by approximately $12 million and $11 million, respectively, as a result of such advance purchases. 
Gross and net sales for the 2016 third quarter, after adjusting the 2015 third quarter comparatives for advance purchases, increased by 7.4% and 5.7%, respectively. 
In this regard, I would like to point out that the increase in Monster's net sales for the 2016 third quarter is hurdling a significant increase in the third quarter of 2015 over the prior year's third quarter. 
Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced gross sales by approximately $4.8 million and net sales by approximately $2.6 million in the 2016 third quarter. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 63.8% as compared to 61.5% for the comparable 2015 third quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the cost of goods savings and as a result of the AFF Transaction and product mix. 
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.1% compared to 3.5% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.1% compared to 10.7% in the same quarter a year ago. Increase in sponsorship and endorsement costs, as well as increases in certain other marketing expenses, including marketing, research and social media with the principal reasons for the increase in selling expenses, in-store demos and premiums were also higher in the quarter. 
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.7% as compared to 8.8% in the same quarter last year. Payroll expenses were up $7.3 million, primarily to support the strategic brands that we acquired from Coca-Cola and stock-based compensation, a noncash item, was 3.3 higher. Distributor termination costs were $4.7 million in the third quarter as compared to $2.5 million in the 2015 third quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and safety and sale of the company's products were $4.9 million in the 2016 third quarter as compared to $3.4 million in the 2015 third quarter. 
Legal and professional costs related to intellectual property matters, particularly in China, were $2.5 million in the 2016 third quarter as compared to $0.8 million in the comparable 2015 third quarter. 
Our effective tax rate in the quarter decreased from 39.4% in the 2015 third quarter to 33.8% in the 2016 third quarter, primarily due in part to a onetime benefit related to a prior period domestic production deduction. 
On an ongoing basis, we expect that our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36%. 
Net income was $191.6 million in the 2016 third quarter compared to net income of $174.6 million in the 2015 third quarter, an increase of 9.8%. 
Net income per diluted share increased 17.5% to $0.99 in the quarter due in part to a lower share count as a result of the completion of the modified Dutch auction in June 2016. 
The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from $208.1 million at September 30, 2015 to $194.4 million at September 30, 2016. 
We are continuing to make good progress on the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers internationally. In the United States, we are continuing to see improvements in our quality of distribution. 
In the third quarter, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Mexico, Colombia and Chile. We commenced with the transition to Coca-Cola bottlers in Brazil earlier this week and will transition Panama and Costa Rica later this month. We commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Denmark, Montenegro and Ukraine in the third quarter. 
In July, we successfully transitioned Monster to the Coca-Cola bottlers in South Africa, which occurred at the same time as the restructuring of the Coca-Cola bottlers in South Africa took place. 
After a slow start, we are seeing better execution in South Africa. 
During the quarter, we also commenced distribution of Monster in Botswana and Zimbabwe and transitioned Swaziland, Reunion and Mauritius. Over the fourth quarter, we plan to launch Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in additional African countries. 
We are making good progress in Nigeria with regard to both product registration and co-packing arrangements and are planning to launch Monster by early 2017 in Nigeria. In October, we commenced sales of Monster through the Coca-Cola bottlers in Turkey. 
In the fourth quarter, we are planning to launch Monster through Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of Central Asian and Middle Eastern countries with further launches to follow in 2017. 
Following the conclusion of negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers in China, we commenced the launch of Monster beginning with Beijing in September and Shanghai and Hunan Province in October. We expect Guangzhou, Shenzhen and potentially other markets to be launched in the fourth quarter and are planning to launch Monster in additional territories in China during 2017. 
We are currently awaiting approval for our products in India. 
As previously reported, we successfully completed our acquisition of a concentrated flavor business operated by American Fruits & Flavors on April 1, 2016. As a result of the AFF Transaction, we achieved raw material cost savings of $23.3 million in the 2016 third quarter, which were broadly in line with expectations.

Red Bull sales decreased 11.7% and its market share decreased by 6.3 points to 11.7%. Vive 100's market share increased 15.4 points to 44.2%, while Boost's market share decreased 5.9 points to 9.3%. 
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covered a single month, which is a short period, that may often be materially influenced positively or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month.  Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended September 2016, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.9% to 14.2% in Great Britain; from 19.4% to 22.6% in France; from 12.3% to 14.9% in Germany; from 22.2% to 25.6% in Spain; from 8.8% to 10.5% in Belgium; from 9% to 10.5% in Sweden; from 6% to 11% in Norway; from 9.5% to 11.4% in the Czech Republic; and from 6.1% to 6.4% in The Netherlands.

And for the 13-week period ended September 2016 Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 15.6% to 13.1% in South Africa, primarily due to increased distribution of Dragon, our new lower price energy drink, although retail sales of Monster increased. 
I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country-to-country. 
According to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in value in Chile increased to 21.6% in September 2016 as compared to 18.2% last year.

Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $1.6 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment for the third quarter of 2016 increased 3.4% from $686.7 million to $710.1 million from the comparable period last year. 
Net sales for the company's strategic brands segment were negatively impacted by approximately $1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. 
Net sales for the Strategic Brand segment were $72.1 million for the third quarter as compared to $69.9 million in the same quarter last year. 
Net sales for the other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $5.7 million in the 2016 third quarter. There were no sales for the other segment in the comparable 2015 third quarter. 
Continued increases in sales of the ready-to-drink coffee category in the U.S., including our Java Monster line, bodes well for the future. However, there exists limited production in the U.S. for such products, which requires a retort process due to the use of fresh milk and cream. 
Due to production capacity constraints resulting from production and maintenance issues with co-packers, product shortages had been experienced in the industry. We are taking steps to address the issues but anticipate that it will take a number of months before production availability will be balanced with consumer demand. 
Sales of Java Monster were impacted by such shortages in September and October, and we anticipate that sales will continue to be impacted in the foreseeable future. 
Net sales to customers outside the United States were $190.8 million in the 2016 third quarter compared to $170.6 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. 
Net sales to customers outside of the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $2.6 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
Net sales in EMEA in the third quarter of 2016 in dollars were 14% higher than in the same period last year. In local currencies, net sales in the region were 19% higher than in the same period last year. 
The foregoing differences were primarily due to the weakening of the British pound against the U.S. dollar. Gross sales were 11.6% higher in dollars and 18% higher in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 51.5% in the same period last year to 50.5% during the 2016 third quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 51.5% in the same period last year to 52.5% during the 2016 third quarter in local currencies. 
Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increased market share in Europe. In particular, in Germany, France, Spain, Great Britain, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, the Czech Republic and Ireland, Monster achieved sales gains and continue to increase its market share. 
We are pleased with the performance of the Monster Ultra line in EMEA region, which is now available in 25 European countries and was launched in South Africa in July. We anticipate that the Ultra line will be sold in almost all of our Western European markets by the end of this year. 
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 34.2% in dollars and 20.4% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 49.4% in the same period last year to 46.6% during the 2016 third quarter. 
In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 28.2% or 7.2% in local currency, primarily due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar as compared to the same quarter last year. 
We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. 
In Korea -- South Korea, net sales increased 125.7%, 127.2% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. 
In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales increased 22.2% or 19.9% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. In Singapore, net sales increased 109.1% or 111.1% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. 
As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with the planning for local production in India, with a view to reentering the market in 2017. 
In Latin America, which includes Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the third quarter decreased 6.1% in dollars and increased 3.9% in local currencies. Net sales in the third quarter decreased 15% in dollars and decreased 6.2% in local currencies over the same period last year. This region was impacted by foreign currency exchange rates and higher trade promotions in 2016. 
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 50.3% in the same period last year to 47.6% during the 2016 third quarter. 
In Mexico, gross sales increased 3.8% in dollars and 21.5% in local currency in September 2016. Net sales decreased in part due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher trade spending in 2016.
However, although Nielsen reported Monster's market share decreased during September 2016, Monster sales at retail in Mexico grew 12.6% during September 2016. 
Net sales decreased in Brazil, largely due to the overall difficult economic and market conditions together with the ongoing uncertainties for our distributor relating to the Coca-Cola transaction and the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $341.5 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $2.18 million at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $257.7 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased to $9.5 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015. 
Accounts receivable increased to $467.3 million at September 30, 2016, from $353 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 46.5 days at September 30, 2016 compared to 43.2 days at December 31, 2015 and 43 days at September 30, 2015. 
Inventories increased to $167.8 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 53 days at September 30, 2016, compared to 58 days of inventory at December 31, 2015 and 49.4 days at September 30, 2015. 
In late September, we launched Mutant, an exciting super soda in the U.S. that is positioned as refreshment energized, in limited convenience stores in certain markets with encouraging early results. We experienced some production challenges with Mutant in early September, which have now been largely resolved, resulting in very limited distribution for Mutant in the quarter. The number of retailers stocking Mutant increased substantially in October. 
We have an additional new product planned for later this year and are working on new product that we are planning to introduce early in 2017 and which includes our new Hydro line that we've previously announced. 
On October 14, 2016, the company announced that its Board of Directors approved a 3.1 stock split of its common stock to be effected in the form of a 200% stock dividend. On November 9, 2016, each stockholder of record will receive 2 additional shares of common stock for each year of common stock owned at the close of business, Eastern time on October 26, 2016.  
We estimate October 2016 gross sales on a foreign exchange adjusted basis to be approximately 12.3% higher than in October 2015. In this regard, we point out that according to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended September 24, 2016, for all outlets combined namely, convenience, grocery drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the Energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 3.5% versus the same period a year ago, while sales of Monster grew 6.4% in the same period versus a year ago. 
We caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. 
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for our principal product. Our ability to utilize the full benefits of the transaction, through a reduction in operating costs commensurate with the third quarter. This transaction will be accretive to the company's earnings. 
North American and international gross margins remain healthy. The U.S. Nielsen market statistics and equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results. While the net difference was unbalanced, not material, unfavorable exchange rates in the U.K., our largest market in EMEA, negatively affected our EMEA results following Brexit. Similarly, unfavorable currency exchange rates in Mexico also negatively affected our [indiscernible] American results. 
On the other hand, favorable currency results in Japan positively affected our Asia Pacific results. 
The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company sales. We're excited about the prospects for our new Mutant beverage. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets. In particular, I'd like to call out the launch of Monster in China and the enormous growth potential for us in one of the largest energy drink markets globally. We have successfully transitioned additional international companies to Coca-Cola bottlers, and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the fourth quarter and in 2017. 
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter."

We will be going into Guangzhou and Shenzhen pretty much within the next week or so. So we are getting good distribution. We are getting good response to the product. And so we just are very hopeful and excited that we will be able to continue to expand. There is a massive universe of stores available to us. It's a very big country. We are probably, by the end of the year, we should have launched Monster in, probably, areas that will be covered by about 18% of the population or -- and about -- and those areas represent, our estimate at the moment is, about 30%, 33% of the current energy market once we would have got through December. So we just -- it's a big market, and we're obviously planning to do -- there's a little bit of a -- there will be a bit of a hiatus between the beginning of January and until after Chinese New Year.

But -- and the whole strategy we had with Mutant, just talking about Mutant, generally is we never intended at any time, it's how we've launched all of our products, we didn't intend to go out and secure execution and make a big splash on day 1. It's bubbling up. We put it into convenience stores. We are being very specific about where we want to see it placed in the store, and we feel that's important. And the results of us doing that is actually the feedback we've got is that there is very, very minimal, if any, cannibalization. So we are achieving. We believe, our strategic objective is to minimalize any cannibalization with Monster energy drinks. And so that is being achieved. We are pretty much across-the-board getting retailers buy-in on our strategy and where it should be placed. There have been a few retailers that have resisted that and in some cases, for that reason, we haven't sold to those retailers. But we pretty much have very, very broad acceptance and buy-in from retailers. And so far, we're actually very encouraged by the sale rate for a new brand."

However, we've also got to bear in mind that I think over this period we haven't seen a lot of innovation. Our innovation, we've been dealing with new packaging, different packaging, it's taken some time for us to get our hands around it. And so if you take, for example, Hydro is coming out in, we're looking at the beginning of next year, Mutant really has just hit the shelves, just literally days before the quarter end. And our Caffe Monster product, which we are looking at launching next year, has also -- it'll come through next year some time. We will have to, obviously, deal with the production issues. It's one of the things that will -- one of the challenges we'll face with Caffe Monster. But we think that if you're looking at innovation, it really was probably pretty limited this year and that we think has been one of the reasons. But again, the category is still positive. It's gone up and down over -- in the past, and we do believe that we will continue to see some increase in growth rates next year. But again, this is -- we don't have any crystal ball to be able to do so."

Sales in the beverage industry in the third quarter continued to be weak on a global basis. In the third quarter, net sales was $788 million, up 4.1% from $756.6 million in the third quarter of 2015. The company achieved record growth sales of $913.3 million, up 5.9% from $862.4 million in the third quarter of 2015. 
The comparative growth in net sales of $862.4 million and $756.6 million, respectively, for the 2015 third quarter were positively impacted by bonds purchases made for the company's customers due to a preannounced price increase effective August 31, 2015, uncertain of the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks. 
The company estimates that both gross and net sales for the 2015 third quarter increased by approximately $12 million and $11 million, respectively, as a result of such advance purchases. 
Gross and net sales for the 2016 third quarter, after adjusting the 2015 third quarter comparatives for advance purchases, increased by 7.4% and 5.7%, respectively. 
In this regard, I would like to point out that the increase in Monster's net sales for the 2016 third quarter is hurdling a significant increase in the third quarter of 2015 over the prior year's third quarter. 
Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced gross sales by approximately $4.8 million and net sales by approximately $2.6 million in the 2016 third quarter. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 63.8% as compared to 61.5% for the comparable 2015 third quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the cost of goods savings and as a result of the AFF Transaction and product mix. 
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.1% compared to 3.5% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.1% compared to 10.7% in the same quarter a year ago. Increase in sponsorship and endorsement costs, as well as increases in certain other marketing expenses, including marketing, research and social media with the principal reasons for the increase in selling expenses, in-store demos and premiums were also higher in the quarter. 
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.7% as compared to 8.8% in the same quarter last year. Payroll expenses were up $7.3 million, primarily to support the strategic brands that we acquired from Coca-Cola and stock-based compensation, a noncash item, was 3.3 higher. Distributor termination costs were $4.7 million in the third quarter as compared to $2.5 million in the 2015 third quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and safety and sale of the company's products were $4.9 million in the 2016 third quarter as compared to $3.4 million in the 2015 third quarter. 
Legal and professional costs related to intellectual property matters, particularly in China, were $2.5 million in the 2016 third quarter as compared to $0.8 million in the comparable 2015 third quarter. 
Our effective tax rate in the quarter decreased from 39.4% in the 2015 third quarter to 33.8% in the 2016 third quarter, primarily due in part to a onetime benefit related to a prior period domestic production deduction. 
On an ongoing basis, we expect that our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36%. 
Net income was $191.6 million in the 2016 third quarter compared to net income of $174.6 million in the 2015 third quarter, an increase of 9.8%. 
Net income per diluted share increased 17.5% to $0.99 in the quarter due in part to a lower share count as a result of the completion of the modified Dutch auction in June 2016. 
The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from $208.1 million at September 30, 2015 to $194.4 million at September 30, 2016. 
We are continuing to make good progress on the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers internationally. In the United States, we are continuing to see improvements in our quality of distribution. 
In the third quarter, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Mexico, Colombia and Chile. We commenced with the transition to Coca-Cola bottlers in Brazil earlier this week and will transition Panama and Costa Rica later this month. We commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Denmark, Montenegro and Ukraine in the third quarter. 
In July, we successfully transitioned Monster to the Coca-Cola bottlers in South Africa, which occurred at the same time as the restructuring of the Coca-Cola bottlers in South Africa took place. 
After a slow start, we are seeing better execution in South Africa. 
During the quarter, we also commenced distribution of Monster in Botswana and Zimbabwe and transitioned Swaziland, Reunion and Mauritius. Over the fourth quarter, we plan to launch Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in additional African countries. 
We are making good progress in Nigeria with regard to both product registration and co-packing arrangements and are planning to launch Monster by early 2017 in Nigeria. In October, we commenced sales of Monster through the Coca-Cola bottlers in Turkey. 
In the fourth quarter, we are planning to launch Monster through Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of Central Asian and Middle Eastern countries with further launches to follow in 2017. 
Following the conclusion of negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers in China, we commenced the launch of Monster beginning with Beijing in September and Shanghai and Hunan Province in October. We expect Guangzhou, Shenzhen and potentially other markets to be launched in the fourth quarter and are planning to launch Monster in additional territories in China during 2017. 
We are currently awaiting approval for our products in India. 
As previously reported, we successfully completed our acquisition of a concentrated flavor business operated by American Fruits & Flavors on April 1, 2016. As a result of the AFF Transaction, we achieved raw material cost savings of $23.3 million in the 2016 third quarter, which were broadly in line with expectations. 
According to Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through September 24, 2016 all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 3.5% versus the same period a year ago. 
Sales of Monster grew 6.4% in the 13-week period, while sales of NOS increased 2.4% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 8.2%. Sales of Red Bull increased 2.4%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 3.8%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 4.9%, and sales of AMP decreased 13.2%.

NOS' share remained the same at 3.9% and Full Throttle's share decreased 0.1 points to 1%. Red Bull's share decreased 0.3 points to 35%. Rockstar share was down 0.1 points to 7.9%. 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.5 points at 7.6%, and AMP share decreased 0.6 points to 1.5%.

Red Bull sales decreased 4% and its market share increased 0.2 points to 39.2%. Rockstar sales decreased 11% and its market share decreased 1.2 points to 15.6%.
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the Energy Drink category grew 36.3% during the month of September 2016. Monster sales increased 12.6%. Our market share in value decreased 4.7 points to 22.3% against the comparable period last year. 
Sales of Burn, one of our acquired strategic brands, increased 28.4%, although Burn's market share decreased 0.3 points to 4.9%. 
Red Bull sales decreased 11.7% and its market share decreased by 6.3 points to 11.7%. Vive 100's market share increased 15.4 points to 44.2%, while Boost's market share decreased 5.9 points to 9.3%. 
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covered a single month, which is a short period, that may often be materially influenced positively or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended September 2016, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.9% to 14.2% in Great Britain; from 19.4% to 22.6% in France; from 12.3% to 14.9% in Germany; from 22.2% to 25.6% in Spain; from 8.8% to 10.5% in Belgium; from 9% to 10.5% in Sweden; from 6% to 11% in Norway; from 9.5% to 11.4% in the Czech Republic; and from 6.1% to 6.4% in The Netherlands.

For the 13-week period ended August 2016, according to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in Ireland grew from 8.6% to 11.2%. And for the 13-week period ended September 2016 Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 15.6% to 13.1% in South Africa, primarily due to increased distribution of Dragon, our new lower price energy drink, although retail sales of Monster increased. 
I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country-to-country. 
According to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in value in Chile increased to 21.6% in September 2016 as compared to 18.2% last year. And Monster's market share in Brazil declined from 3.9% to 2.6% in September 2016 as compared to the same period last year. In South Korea, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 10.7% to 23.7% in September compared to the same period last year.

Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $1.6 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment for the third quarter of 2016 increased 3.4% from $686.7 million to $710.1 million from the comparable period last year. 
Net sales for the company's strategic brands segment were negatively impacted by approximately $1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. 
Net sales for the Strategic Brand segment were $72.1 million for the third quarter as compared to $69.9 million in the same quarter last year. 
Net sales for the other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $5.7 million in the 2016 third quarter. There were no sales for the other segment in the comparable 2015 third quarter. 
Continued increases in sales of the ready-to-drink coffee category in the U.S., including our Java Monster line, bodes well for the future. However, there exists limited production in the U.S. for such products, which requires a retort process due to the use of fresh milk and cream. 
Due to production capacity constraints resulting from production and maintenance issues with co-packers, product shortages had been experienced in the industry. We are taking steps to address the issues but anticipate that it will take a number of months before production availability will be balanced with consumer demand. 
Sales of Java Monster were impacted by such shortages in September and October, and we anticipate that sales will continue to be impacted in the foreseeable future. 
Net sales to customers outside the United States were $190.8 million in the 2016 third quarter compared to $170.6 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. 
Net sales to customers outside of the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $2.6 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
Net sales in EMEA in the third quarter of 2016 in dollars were 14% higher than in the same period last year. In local currencies, net sales in the region were 19% higher than in the same period last year. 
The foregoing differences were primarily due to the weakening of the British pound against the U.S. dollar. Gross sales were 11.6% higher in dollars and 18% higher in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 51.5% in the same period last year to 50.5% during the 2016 third quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 51.5% in the same period last year to 52.5% during the 2016 third quarter in local currencies. 
Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increased market share in Europe. In particular, in Germany, France, Spain, Great Britain, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, the Czech Republic and Ireland, Monster achieved sales gains and continue to increase its market share. 
We are pleased with the performance of the Monster Ultra line in EMEA region, which is now available in 25 European countries and was launched in South Africa in July. We anticipate that the Ultra line will be sold in almost all of our Western European markets by the end of this year. 
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 34.2% in dollars and 20.4% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 49.4% in the same period last year to 46.6% during the 2016 third quarter. 
In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 28.2% or 7.2% in local currency, primarily due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar as compared to the same quarter last year. 
We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. 
In Korea -- South Korea, net sales increased 125.7%, 127.2% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. 
In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales increased 22.2% or 19.9% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. In Singapore, net sales increased 109.1% or 111.1% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. 
As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with the planning for local production in India, with a view to reentering the market in 2017. 
In Latin America, which includes Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the third quarter decreased 6.1% in dollars and increased 3.9% in local currencies. Net sales in the third quarter decreased 15% in dollars and decreased 6.2% in local currencies over the same period last year. This region was impacted by foreign currency exchange rates and higher trade promotions in 2016. 
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 50.3% in the same period last year to 47.6% during the 2016 third quarter. 
In Mexico, gross sales increased 3.8% in dollars and 21.5% in local currency in September 2016. Net sales decreased in part due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher trade spending in 2016.
However, although Nielsen reported Monster's market share decreased during September 2016, Monster sales at retail in Mexico grew 12.6% during September 2016. 
Net sales decreased in Brazil, largely due to the overall difficult economic and market conditions together with the ongoing uncertainties for our distributor relating to the Coca-Cola transaction and the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $341.5 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $2.18 million at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $257.7 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased to $9.5 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015. 
Accounts receivable increased to $467.3 million at September 30, 2016, from $353 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 46.5 days at September 30, 2016 compared to 43.2 days at December 31, 2015 and 43 days at September 30, 2015. 
Inventories increased to $167.8 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 53 days at September 30, 2016, compared to 58 days of inventory at December 31, 2015 and 49.4 days at September 30, 2015. 
In late September, we launched Mutant, an exciting super soda in the U.S. that is positioned as refreshment energized, in limited convenience stores in certain markets with encouraging early results. We experienced some production challenges with Mutant in early September, which have now been largely resolved, resulting in very limited distribution for Mutant in the quarter. The number of retailers stocking Mutant increased substantially in October. 
We have an additional new product planned for later this year and are working on new product that we are planning to introduce early in 2017 and which includes our new Hydro line that we've previously announced. 
On October 14, 2016, the company announced that its Board of Directors approved a 3.1 stock split of its common stock to be effected in the form of a 200% stock dividend. On November 9, 2016, each stockholder of record will receive 2 additional shares of common stock for each year of common stock owned at the close of business, Eastern time on October 26, 2016. 
We estimate October 2016 gross sales on a foreign exchange adjusted basis to be approximately 12.3% higher than in October 2015. In this regard, we point out that according to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended September 24, 2016, for all outlets combined namely, convenience, grocery drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the Energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 3.5% versus the same period a year ago, while sales of Monster grew 6.4% in the same period versus a year ago. 
We caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. 
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for our principal product. Our ability to utilize the full benefits of the transaction, through a reduction in operating costs commensurate with the third quarter. This transaction will be accretive to the company's earnings. 
North American and international gross margins remain healthy. The U.S. Nielsen market statistics and equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results. While the net difference was unbalanced, not material, unfavorable exchange rates in the U.K., our largest market in EMEA, negatively affected our EMEA results following Brexit. Similarly, unfavorable currency exchange rates in Mexico also negatively affected our [indiscernible] American results. 
On the other hand, favorable currency results in Japan positively affected our Asia Pacific results. 
The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company sales. We're excited about the prospects for our new Mutant beverage. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets. In particular, I'd like to call out the launch of Monster in China and the enormous growth potential for us in one of the largest energy drink markets globally. We have successfully transitioned additional international companies to Coca-Cola bottlers, and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the fourth quarter and in 2017. 
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter."

We will be going into Guangzhou and Shenzhen pretty much within the next week or so. So we are getting good distribution. We are getting good response to the product. And so we just are very hopeful and excited that we will be able to continue to expand. There is a massive universe of stores available to us. It's a very big country. We are probably, by the end of the year, we should have launched Monster in, probably, areas that will be covered by about 18% of the population or -- and about -- and those areas represent, our estimate at the moment is, about 30%, 33% of the current energy market once we would have got through December.

But -- and the whole strategy we had with Mutant, just talking about Mutant, generally is we never intended at any time, it's how we've launched all of our products, we didn't intend to go out and secure execution and make a big splash on day 1. It's bubbling up. We put it into convenience stores. We are being very specific about where we want to see it placed in the store, and we feel that's important. And the results of us doing that is actually the feedback we've got is that there is very, very minimal, if any, cannibalization. So we are achieving. We believe, our strategic objective is to minimalize any cannibalization with Monster energy drinks. And so that is being achieved. We are pretty much across-the-board getting retailers buy-in on our strategy and where it should be placed. There have been a few retailers that have resisted that and in some cases, for that reason, we haven't sold to those retailers.

Sales in the beverage industry in the third quarter continued to be weak on a global basis. In the third quarter, net sales was $788 million, up 4.1% from $756.6 million in the third quarter of 2015. The company achieved record growth sales of $913.3 million, up 5.9% from $862.4 million in the third quarter of 2015. 
The comparative growth in net sales of $862.4 million and $756.6 million, respectively, for the 2015 third quarter were positively impacted by bonds purchases made for the company's customers due to a preannounced price increase effective August 31, 2015, uncertain of the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks. 
The company estimates that both gross and net sales for the 2015 third quarter increased by approximately $12 million and $11 million, respectively, as a result of such advance purchases. 
Gross and net sales for the 2016 third quarter, after adjusting the 2015 third quarter comparatives for advance purchases, increased by 7.4% and 5.7%, respectively. 
In this regard, I would like to point out that the increase in Monster's net sales for the 2016 third quarter is hurdling a significant increase in the third quarter of 2015 over the prior year's third quarter. 
Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced gross sales by approximately $4.8 million and net sales by approximately $2.6 million in the 2016 third quarter. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 63.8% as compared to 61.5% for the comparable 2015 third quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the cost of goods savings and as a result of the AFF Transaction and product mix. 
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.1% compared to 3.5% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.1% compared to 10.7% in the same quarter a year ago. Increase in sponsorship and endorsement costs, as well as increases in certain other marketing expenses, including marketing, research and social media with the principal reasons for the increase in selling expenses, in-store demos and premiums were also higher in the quarter. 
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.7% as compared to 8.8% in the same quarter last year. Payroll expenses were up $7.3 million, primarily to support the strategic brands that we acquired from Coca-Cola and stock-based compensation, a noncash item, was 3.3 higher. Distributor termination costs were $4.7 million in the third quarter as compared to $2.5 million in the 2015 third quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and safety and sale of the company's products were $4.9 million in the 2016 third quarter as compared to $3.4 million in the 2015 third quarter. 
Legal and professional costs related to intellectual property matters, particularly in China, were $2.5 million in the 2016 third quarter as compared to $0.8 million in the comparable 2015 third quarter. 
Our effective tax rate in the quarter decreased from 39.4% in the 2015 third quarter to 33.8% in the 2016 third quarter, primarily due in part to a onetime benefit related to a prior period domestic production deduction. 
On an ongoing basis, we expect that our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36%. 
Net income was $191.6 million in the 2016 third quarter compared to net income of $174.6 million in the 2015 third quarter, an increase of 9.8%. 
Net income per diluted share increased 17.5% to $0.99 in the quarter due in part to a lower share count as a result of the completion of the modified Dutch auction in June 2016. 
The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from $208.1 million at September 30, 2015 to $194.4 million at September 30, 2016. 
We are continuing to make good progress on the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers internationally. In the United States, we are continuing to see improvements in our quality of distribution. 
In the third quarter, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Mexico, Colombia and Chile. We commenced with the transition to Coca-Cola bottlers in Brazil earlier this week and will transition Panama and Costa Rica later this month. We commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Denmark, Montenegro and Ukraine in the third quarter. 
In July, we successfully transitioned Monster to the Coca-Cola bottlers in South Africa, which occurred at the same time as the restructuring of the Coca-Cola bottlers in South Africa took place. 
After a slow start, we are seeing better execution in South Africa. 
During the quarter, we also commenced distribution of Monster in Botswana and Zimbabwe and transitioned Swaziland, Reunion and Mauritius. Over the fourth quarter, we plan to launch Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in additional African countries. 
We are making good progress in Nigeria with regard to both product registration and co-packing arrangements and are planning to launch Monster by early 2017 in Nigeria. In October, we commenced sales of Monster through the Coca-Cola bottlers in Turkey. 
In the fourth quarter, we are planning to launch Monster through Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of Central Asian and Middle Eastern countries with further launches to follow in 2017. 
Following the conclusion of negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers in China, we commenced the launch of Monster beginning with Beijing in September and Shanghai and Hunan Province in October. We expect Guangzhou, Shenzhen and potentially other markets to be launched in the fourth quarter and are planning to launch Monster in additional territories in China during 2017. 
We are currently awaiting approval for our products in India. 
As previously reported, we successfully completed our acquisition of a concentrated flavor business operated by American Fruits & Flavors on April 1, 2016. As a result of the AFF Transaction, we achieved raw material cost savings of $23.3 million in the 2016 third quarter, which were broadly in line with expectations. 
According to Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through September 24, 2016 all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 3.5% versus the same period a year ago.

Sales of Burn, one of our acquired strategic brands, increased 28.4%, although Burn's market share decreased 0.3 points to 4.9%. 
Red Bull sales decreased 11.7% and its market share decreased by 6.3 points to 11.7%. Vive 100's market share increased 15.4 points to 44.2%, while Boost's market share decreased 5.9 points to 9.3%. 
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covered a single month, which is a short period, that may often be materially influenced positively or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended September 2016, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.9% to 14.2% in Great Britain; from 19.4% to 22.6% in France; from 12.3% to 14.9% in Germany; from 22.2% to 25.6% in Spain; from 8.8% to 10.5% in Belgium; from 9% to 10.5% in Sweden; from 6% to 11% in Norway; from 9.5% to 11.4% in the Czech Republic; and from 6.1% to 6.4% in The Netherlands.

For the 13-week period ended August 2016, according to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in Ireland grew from 8.6% to 11.2%. And for the 13-week period ended September 2016 Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 15.6% to 13.1% in South Africa, primarily due to increased distribution of Dragon, our new lower price energy drink, although retail sales of Monster increased. 
I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country-to-country. 
According to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in value in Chile increased to 21.6% in September 2016 as compared to 18.2% last year. And Monster's market share in Brazil declined from 3.9% to 2.6% in September 2016 as compared to the same period last year.

And according to INTAGE, Monster's market share in value in the convenience store channel in Japan grew from 39.2% to 41.7% in September 2016.
According to IRI, in Australia, Monster's market share in value grew from 3.5% to 6% in September 2016. And in New Zealand, Monster's market share in value grew from 2.2% to 6% for the last 4 weeks ending October 2, 2016 versus the same period last year. 
Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $1.6 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment for the third quarter of 2016 increased 3.4% from $686.7 million to $710.1 million from the comparable period last year. 
Net sales for the company's strategic brands segment were negatively impacted by approximately $1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. 
Net sales for the Strategic Brand segment were $72.1 million for the third quarter as compared to $69.9 million in the same quarter last year. 
Net sales for the other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $5.7 million in the 2016 third quarter. There were no sales for the other segment in the comparable 2015 third quarter. 
Continued increases in sales of the ready-to-drink coffee category in the U.S., including our Java Monster line, bodes well for the future. However, there exists limited production in the U.S. for such products, which requires a retort process due to the use of fresh milk and cream. 
Due to production capacity constraints resulting from production and maintenance issues with co-packers, product shortages had been experienced in the industry. We are taking steps to address the issues but anticipate that it will take a number of months before production availability will be balanced with consumer demand. 
Sales of Java Monster were impacted by such shortages in September and October, and we anticipate that sales will continue to be impacted in the foreseeable future. 
Net sales to customers outside the United States were $190.8 million in the 2016 third quarter compared to $170.6 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. 
Net sales to customers outside of the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $2.6 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
Net sales in EMEA in the third quarter of 2016 in dollars were 14% higher than in the same period last year. In local currencies, net sales in the region were 19% higher than in the same period last year. 
The foregoing differences were primarily due to the weakening of the British pound against the U.S. dollar. Gross sales were 11.6% higher in dollars and 18% higher in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 51.5% in the same period last year to 50.5% during the 2016 third quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 51.5% in the same period last year to 52.5% during the 2016 third quarter in local currencies. 
Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increased market share in Europe. In particular, in Germany, France, Spain, Great Britain, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, the Czech Republic and Ireland, Monster achieved sales gains and continue to increase its market share. 
We are pleased with the performance of the Monster Ultra line in EMEA region, which is now available in 25 European countries and was launched in South Africa in July. We anticipate that the Ultra line will be sold in almost all of our Western European markets by the end of this year. 
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 34.2% in dollars and 20.4% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 49.4% in the same period last year to 46.6% during the 2016 third quarter. 
In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 28.2% or 7.2% in local currency, primarily due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar as compared to the same quarter last year. 
We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. 
In Korea -- South Korea, net sales increased 125.7%, 127.2% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. 
In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales increased 22.2% or 19.9% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. In Singapore, net sales increased 109.1% or 111.1% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. 
As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with the planning for local production in India, with a view to reentering the market in 2017. 
In Latin America, which includes Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the third quarter decreased 6.1% in dollars and increased 3.9% in local currencies. Net sales in the third quarter decreased 15% in dollars and decreased 6.2% in local currencies over the same period last year. This region was impacted by foreign currency exchange rates and higher trade promotions in 2016. 
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 50.3% in the same period last year to 47.6% during the 2016 third quarter. 
In Mexico, gross sales increased 3.8% in dollars and 21.5% in local currency in September 2016. Net sales decreased in part due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher trade spending in 2016.
However, although Nielsen reported Monster's market share decreased during September 2016, Monster sales at retail in Mexico grew 12.6% during September 2016. 
Net sales decreased in Brazil, largely due to the overall difficult economic and market conditions together with the ongoing uncertainties for our distributor relating to the Coca-Cola transaction and the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $341.5 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $2.18 million at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $257.7 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased to $9.5 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015. 
Accounts receivable increased to $467.3 million at September 30, 2016, from $353 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 46.5 days at September 30, 2016 compared to 43.2 days at December 31, 2015 and 43 days at September 30, 2015. 
Inventories increased to $167.8 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 53 days at September 30, 2016, compared to 58 days of inventory at December 31, 2015 and 49.4 days at September 30, 2015. 
In late September, we launched Mutant, an exciting super soda in the U.S. that is positioned as refreshment energized, in limited convenience stores in certain markets with encouraging early results. We experienced some production challenges with Mutant in early September, which have now been largely resolved, resulting in very limited distribution for Mutant in the quarter. The number of retailers stocking Mutant increased substantially in October. 
We have an additional new product planned for later this year and are working on new product that we are planning to introduce early in 2017 and which includes our new Hydro line that we've previously announced. 
On October 14, 2016, the company announced that its Board of Directors approved a 3.1 stock split of its common stock to be effected in the form of a 200% stock dividend. On November 9, 2016, each stockholder of record will receive 2 additional shares of common stock for each year of common stock owned at the close of business, Eastern time on October 26, 2016. 
We estimate October 2016 gross sales on a foreign exchange adjusted basis to be approximately 12.3% higher than in October 2015. In this regard, we point out that according to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended September 24, 2016, for all outlets combined namely, convenience, grocery drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the Energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 3.5% versus the same period a year ago, while sales of Monster grew 6.4% in the same period versus a year ago. 
We caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. 
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for our principal product. Our ability to utilize the full benefits of the transaction, through a reduction in operating costs commensurate with the third quarter. This transaction will be accretive to the company's earnings. 
North American and international gross margins remain healthy. The U.S. Nielsen market statistics and equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results. While the net difference was unbalanced, not material, unfavorable exchange rates in the U.K., our largest market in EMEA, negatively affected our EMEA results following Brexit. Similarly, unfavorable currency exchange rates in Mexico also negatively affected our Latin American results. 
On the other hand, favorable currency results in Japan positively affected our Asia Pacific results. 
The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company sales. We're excited about the prospects for our new Mutant beverage. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets. In particular, I'd like to call out the launch of Monster in China and the enormous growth potential for us in one of the largest energy drink markets globally. We have successfully transitioned additional international companies to Coca-Cola bottlers, and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the fourth quarter and in 2017. 
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter."

We will be going into Guangzhou and Shenzhen pretty much within the next week or so. So we are getting good distribution. We are getting good response to the product. And so we just are very hopeful and excited that we will be able to continue to expand. There is a massive universe of stores available to us. It's a very big country. We are probably, by the end of the year, we should have launched Monster in, probably, areas that will be covered by about 18% of the population or -- and about -- and those areas represent, our estimate at the moment is, about 30%, 33% of the current energy market once we would have got through December.

It varies quite a bit between these stores, but whichever way you look at it, the percentages is quite respectable and everybody, including the retailers, have been quite surprised and quite happy with the sell in. The actual level of Mutant that was sold in the quarter, I think that is Mark's questions, one of Mark's questions earlier, was about $4.5 million in our numbers on a gross basis. So really it started late and it's really just starting to ramp up now. But -- and the whole strategy we had with Mutant, just talking about Mutant, generally is we never intended at any time, it's how we've launched all of our products, we didn't intend to go out and secure execution and make a big splash on day 1. It's bubbling up. We put it into convenience stores. We are being very specific about where we want to see it placed in the store, and we feel that's important. And the results of us doing that is actually the feedback we've got is that there is very, very minimal, if any, cannibalization. So we are achieving. We believe, our strategic objective is to minimalize any cannibalization with Monster energy drinks. And so that is being achieved. We are pretty much across-the-board getting retailers buy-in on our strategy and where it should be placed. There have been a few retailers that have resisted that and in some cases, for that reason, we haven't sold to those retailers. But we pretty much have very, very broad acceptance and buy-in from retailers. And so far, we're actually very encouraged by the sale rate for a new brand."

And our Caffe Monster product, which we are looking at launching next year, has also -- it'll come through next year some time. We will have to, obviously, deal with the production issues. It's one of the things that will -- one of the challenges we'll face with Caffe Monster. But we think that if you're looking at innovation, it really was probably pretty limited this year and that we think has been one of the reasons. But again, the category is still positive.

Sales in the beverage industry in the third quarter continued to be weak on a global basis. In the third quarter, net sales was $788 million, up 4.1% from $756.6 million in the third quarter of 2015. The company achieved record growth sales of $913.3 million, up 5.9% from $862.4 million in the third quarter of 2015. 
The comparative growth in net sales of $862.4 million and $756.6 million, respectively, for the 2015 third quarter were positively impacted by bonds purchases made for the company's customers due to a preannounced price increase effective August 31, 2015, uncertain of the company's Monster Energy brand energy drinks. 
The company estimates that both gross and net sales for the 2015 third quarter increased by approximately $12 million and $11 million, respectively, as a result of such advance purchases. 
Gross and net sales for the 2016 third quarter, after adjusting the 2015 third quarter comparatives for advance purchases, increased by 7.4% and 5.7%, respectively. 
In this regard, I would like to point out that the increase in Monster's net sales for the 2016 third quarter is hurdling a significant increase in the third quarter of 2015 over the prior year's third quarter. 
Unfavorable currency exchange rates reduced gross sales by approximately $4.8 million and net sales by approximately $2.6 million in the 2016 third quarter. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 63.8% as compared to 61.5% for the comparable 2015 third quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the cost of goods savings and as a result of the AFF Transaction and product mix. 
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.1% compared to 3.5% in the same quarter last year. Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 12.1% compared to 10.7% in the same quarter a year ago. Increase in sponsorship and endorsement costs, as well as increases in certain other marketing expenses, including marketing, research and social media with the principal reasons for the increase in selling expenses, in-store demos and premiums were also higher in the quarter. 
General and administrative costs as a percentage of net sales were 11.7% as compared to 8.8% in the same quarter last year. Payroll expenses were up $7.3 million, primarily to support the strategic brands that we acquired from Coca-Cola and stock-based compensation, a noncash item, was 3.3 higher. Distributor termination costs were $4.7 million in the third quarter as compared to $2.5 million in the 2015 third quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage and safety and sale of the company's products were $4.9 million in the 2016 third quarter as compared to $3.4 million in the 2015 third quarter. 
Legal and professional costs related to intellectual property matters, particularly in China, were $2.5 million in the 2016 third quarter as compared to $0.8 million in the comparable 2015 third quarter. 
Our effective tax rate in the quarter decreased from 39.4% in the 2015 third quarter to 33.8% in the 2016 third quarter, primarily due in part to a onetime benefit related to a prior period domestic production deduction. 
On an ongoing basis, we expect that our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36%. 
Net income was $191.6 million in the 2016 third quarter compared to net income of $174.6 million in the 2015 third quarter, an increase of 9.8%. 
Net income per diluted share increased 17.5% to $0.99 in the quarter due in part to a lower share count as a result of the completion of the modified Dutch auction in June 2016. 
The weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding decreased from $208.1 million at September 30, 2015 to $194.4 million at September 30, 2016. 
We are continuing to make good progress on the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers internationally. In the United States, we are continuing to see improvements in our quality of distribution. 
In the third quarter, we commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Mexico, Colombia and Chile. We commenced with the transition to Coca-Cola bottlers in Brazil earlier this week and will transition Panama and Costa Rica later this month. We commenced distribution of Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in Denmark, Montenegro and Ukraine in the third quarter. 
In July, we successfully transitioned Monster to the Coca-Cola bottlers in South Africa, which occurred at the same time as the restructuring of the Coca-Cola bottlers in South Africa took place. 
After a slow start, we are seeing better execution in South Africa. 
During the quarter, we also commenced distribution of Monster in Botswana and Zimbabwe and transitioned Swaziland, Reunion and Mauritius. Over the fourth quarter, we plan to launch Monster with Coca-Cola bottlers in additional African countries. 
We are making good progress in Nigeria with regard to both product registration and co-packing arrangements and are planning to launch Monster by early 2017 in Nigeria. In October, we commenced sales of Monster through the Coca-Cola bottlers in Turkey. 
In the fourth quarter, we are planning to launch Monster through Coca-Cola bottlers in a number of Central Asian and Middle Eastern countries with further launches to follow in 2017. 
Following the conclusion of negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers in China, we commenced the launch of Monster beginning with Beijing in September and Shanghai and Hunan Province in October. We expect Guangzhou, Shenzhen and potentially other markets to be launched in the fourth quarter and are planning to launch Monster in additional territories in China during 2017. 
We are currently awaiting approval for our products in India. 
As previously reported, we successfully completed our acquisition of a concentrated flavor business operated by American Fruits & Flavors on April 1, 2016. As a result of the AFF Transaction, we achieved raw material cost savings of $23.3 million in the 2016 third quarter, which were broadly in line with expectations. 
According to Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through September 24, 2016 all outlets combined, namely convenience, grocery, drug merchandisers, sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 3.5% versus the same period a year ago.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico covered a single month, which is a short period, that may often be materially influenced positively or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended September 2016, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few weeks between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value as compared to the same period last year grew from 11.9% to 14.2% in Great Britain; from 19.4% to 22.6% in France; from 12.3% to 14.9% in Germany; from 22.2% to 25.6% in Spain; from 8.8% to 10.5% in Belgium; from 9% to 10.5% in Sweden; from 6% to 11% in Norway; from 9.5% to 11.4% in the Czech Republic; and from 6.1% to 6.4% in The Netherlands.

And for the 13-week period ended September 2016 Monster's retail market share in value decreased, however, from 15.6% to 13.1% in South Africa, primarily due to increased distribution of Dragon, our new lower price energy drink, although retail sales of Monster increased. 
I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country-to-country.

Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment in the third quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $1.6 million of foreign currency movements. Net sales for the Monster Energy drink segment for the third quarter of 2016 increased 3.4% from $686.7 million to $710.1 million from the comparable period last year. 
Net sales for the company's strategic brands segment were negatively impacted by approximately $1 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. 
Net sales for the Strategic Brand segment were $72.1 million for the third quarter as compared to $69.9 million in the same quarter last year. 
Net sales for the other segment, which includes third-party sales made by AFF, were $5.7 million in the 2016 third quarter. There were no sales for the other segment in the comparable 2015 third quarter. 
Continued increases in sales of the ready-to-drink coffee category in the U.S., including our Java Monster line, bodes well for the future. However, there exists limited production in the U.S. for such products, which requires a retort process due to the use of fresh milk and cream. 
Due to production capacity constraints resulting from production and maintenance issues with co-packers, product shortages had been experienced in the industry. We are taking steps to address the issues but anticipate that it will take a number of months before production availability will be balanced with consumer demand. 
Sales of Java Monster were impacted by such shortages in September and October, and we anticipate that sales will continue to be impacted in the foreseeable future. 
Net sales to customers outside the United States were $190.8 million in the 2016 third quarter compared to $170.6 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. 
Net sales to customers outside of the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $2.6 million. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
Net sales in EMEA in the third quarter of 2016 in dollars were 14% higher than in the same period last year. In local currencies, net sales in the region were 19% higher than in the same period last year. 
The foregoing differences were primarily due to the weakening of the British pound against the U.S. dollar. Gross sales were 11.6% higher in dollars and 18% higher in local currencies. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 51.5% in the same period last year to 50.5% during the 2016 third quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from 51.5% in the same period last year to 52.5% during the 2016 third quarter in local currencies. 
Monster is continuing to gain momentum and increased market share in Europe. In particular, in Germany, France, Spain, Great Britain, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, the Czech Republic and Ireland, Monster achieved sales gains and continue to increase its market share. 
We are pleased with the performance of the Monster Ultra line in EMEA region, which is now available in 25 European countries and was launched in South Africa in July. We anticipate that the Ultra line will be sold in almost all of our Western European markets by the end of this year. 
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the third quarter increased 34.2% in dollars and 20.4% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 49.4% in the same period last year to 46.6% during the 2016 third quarter. 
In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 28.2% or 7.2% in local currency, primarily due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar as compared to the same quarter last year. 
We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. 
In Korea -- South Korea, net sales increased 125.7%, 127.2% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. 
In Oceana, which includes Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Guam, net sales increased 22.2% or 19.9% in local currencies as compared to the same quarter last year. In Singapore, net sales increased 109.1% or 111.1% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. 
As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with the planning for local production in India, with a view to reentering the market in 2017. 
In Latin America, which includes Mexico and the Caribbean, gross sales in the third quarter decreased 6.1% in dollars and increased 3.9% in local currencies. Net sales in the third quarter decreased 15% in dollars and decreased 6.2% in local currencies over the same period last year. This region was impacted by foreign currency exchange rates and higher trade promotions in 2016. 
Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales decreased from 50.3% in the same period last year to 47.6% during the 2016 third quarter. 
In Mexico, gross sales increased 3.8% in dollars and 21.5% in local currency in September 2016. Net sales decreased in part due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher trade spending in 2016.
However, although Nielsen reported Monster's market share decreased during September 2016, Monster sales at retail in Mexico grew 12.6% during September 2016. 
Net sales decreased in Brazil, largely due to the overall difficult economic and market conditions together with the ongoing uncertainties for our distributor relating to the Coca-Cola transaction and the transition of Monster to Coca-Cola bottlers, which took place on November 1. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $341.5 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $2.18 million at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $257.7 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased to $9.5 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015. 
Accounts receivable increased to $467.3 million at September 30, 2016, from $353 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 46.5 days at September 30, 2016 compared to 43.2 days at December 31, 2015 and 43 days at September 30, 2015. 
Inventories increased to $167.8 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 53 days at September 30, 2016, compared to 58 days of inventory at December 31, 2015 and 49.4 days at September 30, 2015. 
In late September, we launched Mutant, an exciting super soda in the U.S. that is positioned as refreshment energized, in limited convenience stores in certain markets with encouraging early results. We experienced some production challenges with Mutant in early September, which have now been largely resolved, resulting in very limited distribution for Mutant in the quarter. The number of retailers stocking Mutant increased substantially in October. 
We have an additional new product planned for later this year and are working on new product that we are planning to introduce early in 2017 and which includes our new Hydro line that we've previously announced. 
On October 14, 2016, the company announced that its Board of Directors approved a 3.1 stock split of its common stock to be effected in the form of a 200% stock dividend. On November 9, 2016, each stockholder of record will receive 2 additional shares of common stock for each year of common stock owned at the close of business, Eastern time on October 26, 2016. 
We estimate October 2016 gross sales on a foreign exchange adjusted basis to be approximately 12.3% higher than in October 2015. In this regard, we point out that according to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended September 24, 2016, for all outlets combined namely, convenience, grocery drug and mass merchandisers, sales in dollars in the Energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 3.5% versus the same period a year ago, while sales of Monster grew 6.4% in the same period versus a year ago. 
We caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives, as well as shifts in the timing of production in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. 
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for our principal product. Our ability to utilize the full benefits of the transaction, through a reduction in operating costs commensurate with the third quarter. This transaction will be accretive to the company's earnings. 
North American and international gross margins remain healthy. The U.S. Nielsen market statistics and equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. Currency exchange rates continue to affect our results. While the net difference was unbalanced, not material, unfavorable exchange rates in the U.K., our largest market in EMEA, negatively affected our EMEA results following Brexit. Similarly, unfavorable currency exchange rates in Mexico also negatively affected our Latin American results. 
On the other hand, favorable currency results in Japan positively affected our Asia Pacific results. 
The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company sales. We're excited about the prospects for our new Mutant beverage. We are pleased with our performance in our international markets. In particular, I'd like to call out the launch of Monster in China and the enormous growth potential for us in one of the largest energy drink markets globally. We have successfully transitioned additional international companies to Coca-Cola bottlers, and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the fourth quarter and in 2017. 
I'd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter."

We will be going into Guangzhou and Shenzhen pretty much within the next week or so. So we are getting good distribution. We are getting good response to the product. And so we just are very hopeful and excited that we will be able to continue to expand. There is a massive universe of stores available to us. It's a very big country. We are probably, by the end of the year, we should have launched Monster in, probably, areas that will be covered by about 18% of the population or -- and about -- and those areas represent, our estimate at the moment is, about 30%, 33% of the current energy market once we would have got through December. So we just -- it's a big market, and we're obviously planning to do -- there's a little bit of a -- there will be a bit of a hiatus between the beginning of January and until after Chinese New Year.

So really it started late and it's really just starting to ramp up now. But -- and the whole strategy we had with Mutant, just talking about Mutant, generally is we never intended at any time, it's how we've launched all of our products, we didn't intend to go out and secure execution and make a big splash on day 1. It's bubbling up. We put it into convenience stores. We are being very specific about where we want to see it placed in the store, and we feel that's important. And the results of us doing that is actually the feedback we've got is that there is very, very minimal, if any, cannibalization. So we are achieving. We believe, our strategic objective is to minimalize any cannibalization with Monster energy drinks. And so that is being achieved. We are pretty much across-the-board getting retailers buy-in on our strategy and where it should be placed. There have been a few retailers that have resisted that and in some cases, for that reason, we haven't sold to those retailers. But we pretty much have very, very broad acceptance and buy-in from retailers. And so far, we're actually very encouraged by the sale rate for a new brand."

Our innovation, we've been dealing with new packaging, different packaging, it's taken some time for us to get our hands around it. And so if you take, for example, Hydro is coming out in, we're looking at the beginning of next year, Mutant really has just hit the shelves, just literally days before the quarter end. And our Caffe Monster product, which we are looking at launching next year, has also -- it'll come through next year some time. We will have to, obviously, deal with the production issues. It's one of the things that will -- one of the challenges we'll face with Caffe Monster. But we think that if you're looking at innovation, it really was probably pretty limited this year and that we think has been one of the reasons. But again, the category is still positive. It's gone up and down over -- in the past, and we do believe that we will continue to see some increase in growth rates next year. But again, this is -- we don't have any crystal ball to be able to do so."

An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated April 29, 2016. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. 
At the outset, I should mention that the release of our quarterly results and this call are almost a week earlier than normally scheduled. The reason for this change is that Hilton and I will be attending the Coca-Cola global system meeting that starts early next week. We will revert to our normal schedule for the second and subsequent quarters. 
We are continuing to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers worldwide. We have successfully concluded negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers in many countries and are planning to launch Monster with these bottlers in most of their international markets in the near future. As previously reported, we have concluded agreements with Coca-Cola Amatil, which distributes Coca-Cola products in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Fiji. We will be launching Monster in Australia on May 1 and in New Zealand on May 9 with Coca-Cola Amatil. Additionally, as previously reported, we have concluded agreements with DIG [ph], the 100%-owned Coca-Cola bottler that operates in a number of international markets, for the distribution of Monster in certain of these markets. Further to these agreements, we are planning to launch Monster on May 13 in Singapore. Our plans to launch Monster in China are continuing to move forward with the Coca-Cola system. In Shanghai, we have received the required product approval and manufacturing license and are planning for production of Monster there. In Beijing, we have received the required product approval and are awaiting the manufacturing license. We have commenced the required approval process in Xiamen in Southeast China. We are still planning to launch Monster in China later this year, but as previously discussed, the launch could be delayed by various factors, including regulatory approvals and finalization of distribution agreements. We are targeting a relaunch of Monster in India later this year, following discussions with the regulatory authorities. We continue to make good progress in our discussions with FEMSA, AKO [ph] and other bottlers operating in South America. We have signed a distribution agreement with the Coca-Cola bottler, with Lindley [ph], which is controlled by AKO [ph] for distribution of Monster in Peru, and are planning to launch Monster in Peru on June 2. We're also planning to launch or transition a number of other international markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the ensuing quarters. 
We continue to make good progress in the repositioning, repackaging and reformulation of many of the Coca-Cola energy brands that were acquired as a result of the Coca-Cola transaction. 
We successfully completed our acquisition of the concentrate and flavor business operated by American Fruits & Flavors for $690 million in cash on April 1, 2016. We remain excited by this acquisition, which aligns us with our principal flavor supplier, and will enable us to expand and secure most of our flavors at an economical cost. The integration of the acquired business is proceeding well. 
Consistent with the company's previously announced plan to return capital to shareholders, in 2016, the company currently intends to commence a tender offer in May to purchase up to $2 billion in value of its common stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer at a price range to be specified. The company will fund the tender offer with cash on hand. 
In the first quarter, sales in the beverage industry in general, and of carbonated beverages in particular, continued to show weakness. However, sales of Monster products accelerated during the quarter. In the first quarter of 2015, in anticipation of the closing of the Coca-Cola transaction, we transitioned approximately 84% of the targeted distribution rights in the U.S. to the Coca-Cola system, with an additional 5% transitioned in May 2015. Consequently, the results of the comparable first quarter of 2015 were impacted by the acceleration of deferred revenue of $39.8 million, distribution termination costs of $206 million and Coca-Cola transaction costs of $3.6 million. Our ensuing discussion compares our 2016 first quarter results with our 2015 first quarter results after adjustment for the acceleration of deferred revenue, distribution termination costs and Coca-Cola transaction costs referred to above. 
In the first quarter, the company achieved gross record sales of $777.5 million, up 16% from $670.4 million in the first quarter of 2015. Net sales were $680.2 million, up 15.9% from $587 million in the first quarter of 2015. Net sales in the first quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $12.3 million. Our Original Green energy drink -- Monster Energy drink continued to perform well at retail. Retail sales of the Ultra line continue to show good growth in the United States during the first quarter, as did our Java Monster line. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 62.2% as compared to 56.1% for the comparable 2015 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to increased net sales of the Concentrate segment, which has higher gross margins than the Finished Products segment, the disposal of our non-energy brands and the price increase in our 16-ounce Monster Energy drinks effective August 31, 2015. 
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.4% as compared to 4.4% in the same quarter last year. 
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.2% compared to 10.6% in the same quarter a year ago. 
Sponsorship and endorsement costs, merchandise display costs and social media expenses were all higher in the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2015, while commissions were lower. 
General and administrative costs, excluding distributor termination costs and Coca-Cola transaction costs, as a percentage of net sales in the 2016 first quarter, were 10.6% as compared to 10.8% for the corresponding quarter in 2015. 
Payroll expenses were up $1.5 million consisting of a $5 million increase in payroll, due partially to increased staffing in connection with our acquisition of the strategic brands and an increase in stock-based compensation, a noncash item of $3.7 million, which were offset by a reduction of payroll taxes of $7.2 million, following the exercise of certain stock options in the first quarter of 2015. 
Also included in general and administrative cost is amortization of trademarks, a noncash item of $1.8 million, attributable to our acquisition of the strategic brands. 
Distributor termination costs were $3.4 million in the first quarter as compared to $206 million in the 2015 first quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $5.4 million in the 2016 first quarter as compared to $4.9 million in the 2015 first quarter. In addition, other legal costs were $2.4 million higher for the 2016 first quarter. 
Our effective tax rate decreased from an adjusted 38% to 35.8% in the first quarter, primarily due to the domestic production deduction. On an ongoing basis, we expect that our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36%. 
Net income was $166.1 million compared to net income of $110.8 million during the first quarter of last year, an increase of 49.9%. However, despite the substantial increase in the number of shares on a fully diluted basis from 173.8 million to 206.9 million, following the issuance of shares to Coca-Cola, diluted earnings per share increased to $0.80 after adjusting for distributor termination expense for the first quarter from $0.64 in the 2015 comparable quarter. 
Gross sales to customers outside the United States were $184.4 million in the 2016 first quarter compared to $141 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. 
Net sales to customers outside the United States were $149.1 million in the 2016 first quarter compared to $113 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. As stated earlier, gross sales and net sales to customers outside the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $15.1 million and $12.3 million, respectively. 
Including geographic sales reported on our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through March 26, 2016, all outlets combined, namely, convenience, grocery, drug, and mass merchandisers sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 7.1% versus the same period a year ago. Sales in Monster grew 8 -- 10.8% in the 13-week period while sales of NOS increased 2.5% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 9%. Sales of Red Bull increased 4.1%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 14.2%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 0.1%. And sales of AMP decreased 8.1%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended March 26, 2016, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased 5.9% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 9.6% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 5.4% and Full Throttle sales decreased 5%. Sales of Red Bull increased 1.3%, Rockstar was up 12.6%, 5-Hour was up 1.9% and AMP was down 4.5%. 
According to Nielsen, in the 5 weeks ended March 26, 2016, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 1.2 points over the same period last year to 35.2%. NOS' share remains the same at 3.7% and Full Throttle's share decreased 0.1 point to 1.1%. Red Bull's share decreased 1.6 points to 35.1%, slightly below Monster's share. Rockstar's share was up 0.5 point at 7.9%, 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.3 points at 8.3%. And AMP's share decreased 0.2 points to 1.8%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended March 26, 2016, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 20.6% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 18.4% higher than in the same period last year, while Starbucks Double Shot Energy was 25.2% higher. We'd like to mention that there have been some changes in the database we use to report on this category. 
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended March 5, 2016, the energy drink category decreased 2%. Monster sales were unchanged versus a year ago. Our market share increased 0.3 share points to 27.8%. Red Bull sales decreased 1%, and its market share increased 0.7 points to 37.3%. Rockstar sales decreased 9% and its market share decreased 1.2 points to 18%. 
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 33.1% during the month of February 2016. Monster sales increased 8.3%. Our market share decreased 5.7 points to 25% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn, one of our acquired strategic brands, increased 4.9%, although Burn's market share decreased 1.7 points to 6.5%. Red Bull sales increased 0.7% and its market share decreased by 5.1 points to 15.7%. Vive 100's market share increased 14.3 points to 34.9%, while Boost's market share decreased 3.4 points to 11.3%. 
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended March 2016, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few days between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 12.1% to 13% in Great Britain; from 9.3% to 11% in Sweden; from 8.4% to 9.7% in Belgium; from 6.5% to 9% in Norway; from 5.7% to 7% in the Netherlands; and from 18.4% to 20.9% in France. For the 13-week period ended February 2016, according to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 11.2% to 13.6% in Germany, and decreased from 17.5% to 16.4% in South Africa, although value sales were 19.3% higher, according to Nielsen. We note that South Africa is one of those markets that has not transitioned to Coca-Cola bottlers. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ending February 2016 in Ireland increased from 7.4% to 8.7%, and from 21.5% to 24.8% in Spain. According to IRI, Monster's market share increased -- decreased in the 13 weeks to the end of February 2016 from 29.3% to 29.1%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. 
According to Nielsen for the month of March 2016 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 20.4% as compared to 15.3% last year. And in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of March 2016 declined from 4.7% to 3.1% as compared to the same period last year. In South Korea, for the month of March 2016, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 10% to 18.7% compared to the same period last year. 
According to INTAGE for the month of March 2016 in the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 33.8% to 39.9%. 
Net sales for the Finished Products segment in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $10.3 million of foreign currency movements in the first quarter. Net sales for the Finished Products segment in the first quarter of 2016 increased 12.3% from $555.7 million to $624.3 million from the comparable period last year after adjustments for acceleration of deferred revenue. Net sales for the company's Concentrate segment were negatively impacted by approximately $2 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. After adjustment for such foreign currency movements, net sales for the Concentrate segment would have been $57.9 million for the first quarter. 
As a result of the Coca-Cola transaction, which closed on June 12, 2015, there were no sales for the Other segment during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $31.3 million of net sales in the first quarter of 2015. 
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the first quarter increased 47.2% in dollars and 58.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 39.4% in the same period last year to 50.2% during the 2016 first quarter. EMEA sales were negatively impacted by supply disruptions that were encountered by CCE in Great Britain, Monster's largest market in the EMEA during the quarter, following the implementation of new software. Monster continued to gain momentum and increased market share in Europe in the first quarter. Overall, EMEA is now operating well, and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution, including securing distribution by Coca-Cola bottlers in new countries and territories within the region. 
We are pleased with the launch of Ultra in Europe. We commenced distribution of Ultra in an additional 8 markets in EMEA in the first quarter. Ultra will be launched in 10 additional markets in EMEA in the second quarter of 2016. In particular, in Germany, France, Denmark, Belgium, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden, Monster achieved increased sales gains as well as increased market share. 
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the first quarter increased 93.5% in dollars and 97.7% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales, increased from 31.2% in the same period last year to 45.2% during the 2016 first quarter. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 63.4%, 62.5% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased 283.4% or 312.6% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In Mexico, Central America and South America, net sales for the first quarter decreased 3.2% in dollars and increased 9.2% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 39.8% in the same period last year to 41.1% during 2016 first quarter. Net sales decreased in Brazil largely due to the overall difficult economic and market conditions, together with the ongoing uncertainties for our distributor relating to the Coca-Cola transaction. In Mexico, net sales decreased in part due to customer destocking during the quarter and delivery disruptions during the month of March. However, as reported by Nielsen, Monster sales at retail in Mexico grew during the quarter. 
In Chile, net sales in the quarter increased 52.3% in dollars and 74.9% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. 
As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with planning for local production in India, and anticipate reentering the market in India later in 2016. As mentioned earlier, we're optimistic that we will be able to finalize agreements with Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries in the near future. We are also continuing to evaluate production opportunities with Coca-Cola bottlers, both in the U.S. and internationally, which we believe will yield cost reductions. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $2.5 billion at March 31, 2016, prior to the close of the AFF transaction compared to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $508.2 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased to $7.4 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 48.7 days at March 31, 2016, and 43.2 days at December 31, 2015, compared to 46.4 days at March 31, 2015. 
Inventories increased to $165.9 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 58.1 days at March 31, 2016, which was higher than the 58 days of inventory at December 31, 2015, and lower than the 69.1 days at March 31, 2015. 
During the 2016 first quarter, we launched our new Gronk energy drink and Salted Caramel Java Monster, initial consumer response has been positive. We are planning to launch Mutant, an exciting new beverage that will be positioned as refreshment energized, in the third quarter of 2016. For competitive reasons, we intend to provide further information on this new beverage at the stockholder meeting on June 14. 
As previously disclosed, we have also -- we also have additional new products planned for later this year. As this call is a week earlier than usual, we can only provide an estimate for April 2016 gross sales. Based on gross sales through April 28, 2016, we estimate April 2016 gross sales in dollars will be approximately 15% higher than in April 2015. In local currencies, we estimate April 2016 gross sales will be approximately 16% higher than in April 2015. We note that April 2015 sales included the old Warehouse segment and Peace Tea and April 2016 includes the Concentrates segment. We caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. 
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for our principal product. This transaction will be accretive to the company's earnings from the closing of the transaction on April 1, 2016. Consistent with the company's previously announced plan to return capital to shareholders in 2016, the company currently intends to commence a tender offer in May to purchase up to $2 billion in value of its common stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer at a price range to be specified. The company will fund the tender offer with cash on hand. While Hilton and I may participate in the offer for asset diversification reasons, we will continue to earn a substantial majority of our current holdings following any successful tender offer. 
North American and international gross margins remained healthy and continue to improve. The U.S. Nielsen market statistics and the equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales. We are excited about the prospects for our new Mutant beverage, which we're planning to launch in the third quarter. We are particularly pleased with our performance in our international markets. We have successfully transitioned a number of international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers, and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers from the second quarter of 2016. 
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Please note that we will not be taking any questions with respect to the tender offer on this call. Thank you."

In other words, is there a way to sort of think about it, split out by the bigger brands and maybe even comment on some of those smaller brands that could be getting discontinued?"

Like you, we also need to understand what the position is with regard to those brands. Some of it is relating to weakness in the brands themselves, that we are addressing in various ways. Some of that, of course, is foreign currency. And there's another factor in that in certain countries, we have been unable to structure ourselves in a way that we could actually sell concentrates, and what we do in certain countries is we get a royalty from The Coca-Cola Company, which equates to effectively what we would have done had we sold the concentrate. It's a structure of setting up various countries to accommodate the concentrate business. So there is a whole lot of factors that one has to take into account in evaluating the concentrate business. So largely, there is some weakness, but we -- we are not -- you are not seeing in these numbers the full extent of the concentrate business because of some of these adjustments that have to take place."

And that did affect sales. So we did see a reduction in sales in those countries as a result, we believe, of that. So what we've had to do is, not only just go in and blindly, obviously, reinvest in marketing, but we've had to relook at how we're repositioning these brands and at the same time get the repositioning done, both in repackaging in designs, in flavors. And then obviously, then recreate marketing plans to put those -- the new positioning that we have looked at for these brands, particularly the Burn brand and Relentless are 2 of the large brands that did have some weakness. We've also in many ways repositioned NOS a little bit in the U.S., although we haven't changed packaging. We are going to modernize that packaging, and that's still coming through now. So this is a long process because there are -- we're many brands, in many countries. And layered on top of our own staffing and our own business obviously at Monster, it just takes -- it takes a long time to get a lot of these -- this repositioning done. So we think that's partially the reason for it. And yes, it has been weaker than we had estimated. But we are -- we've been doing the repositioning, we've been doing some focusing and we are starting to see some strong signs. And we do believe that, that will continue to be positive. Some of the other brands, although smaller -- again, it's a mixed bag, you can't put it into one category because in some cases, the brand's off more and may go away. But in other cases, some of the smaller brands are very good, very strong brands. And we are actually looking to long-term growth from those brands. But again, it's going to be a positioning and a build, it's not going to happen overnight. But you know, there are some good, really good brands that we see in the mix that we do believe we will see growth from going forward."

But there is the emergence of a low-cost brand, Vive 100, in the market that have been very aggressive. And they have really expanded the market. So -- and that's why when we look at the market, we say our market share has decreased, but it is of a very much increased market and maybe a little bit different, and then we had a debate earlier as to, does Vive 100 really fit into the category?

One bucket is, although we are -- we've -- we're trying to get -- have ourselves the whole spirit of the deal is that we would become more integrated into the Coca-Cola system, we are still nevertheless an independent, publicly traded company. And as a result, it's been important for us to continue to negotiate agreements on terms that we believe are -- will put us in a position where we can protect ourselves and our brand if things or relationships didn't go as planned. And so the contract that we have agreed to with The Coca-Cola Company as a principal, and obviously, we now -- you take that to the individual bottlers, they have their own lawyers, they have their own local laws and they have their own view of life. And very respectfully, many of them are not used to signing a contract of this nature, which is more akin to a finished product distribution agreement as opposed to a manufacturing concentrate bottler agreement, which puts a lot of more discretion and decisions in the hands of the bottler, whereas we tend to keep or want to keep most of those decisions about global marketing, about some of the local marketing and a number of things. The other thing is that we obviously got to be very cautious that we don't get into a situation. We have a large line of products, for example. And we don't want to be in a position that if the bottler decides he wants to take 1 SKU or 3 SKUs and not the rest, that we are kept out of the market for the rest of the SKUs. So there are bones of contention that keep going up and down between the legal agreements. And we're getting through them. But in many cases, it's really a question of literally educating a bottler in a country with their lawyers about why our agreement is in the form that it's in and why we need the protections. Then the other -- obviously, the other bucket is just -- it goes back to the old life, money. How do you share the value chain that's available in the country? And it's just arm wrestling between us and the bottlers as to how do we get to a fair value share? And in some cases, we are at odds with the bottlers on what we believe we want out of the value share. And we're not going to compromise the value share and take less in order to simply try and get deals done at -- because we want to move quickly. I mean, what we are going to negotiate is going to stay with us for 20 or 30 years or however long the agreements are. So we really do want to have a fair relationship and a fair share of the value chain. Bearing in mind that we spend and do a lot more than that is normally done by Coca-Cola Company in a bottler relationship. When they split their -- whatever the split is, when they split their value chain, the bottler picks up a lot more of the obligation. In our case, we do. And we don't want to be in a position where we split the chain and we end up with still the lion's share of the marketing and other expenses, which aren't fairly shared. So it's been a negotiation, and we just -- we're getting through them one by one. And I think that's really the color I've got. I don't know, Hilton, if you would like to add to it..."

And we, as a brand owner, have substantial expenses, have substantial marketing expenses and we have to ensure that after those marketing expenses, we do a good deal for our shareholders. So it is a bit of a haggling but as you can see from the agreements that have been finalized, we're moving forward, and we'll move forward in due course with some of the other bottlers or we won't. And if not, there are other distribution partners that we'll be working with."

An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated April 29, 2016. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. 
At the outset, I should mention that the release of our quarterly results and this call are almost a week earlier than normally scheduled. The reason for this change is that Hilton and I will be attending the Coca-Cola global system meeting that starts early next week. We will revert to our normal schedule for the second and subsequent quarters. 
We are continuing to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers worldwide. We have successfully concluded negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers in many countries and are planning to launch Monster with these bottlers in most of their international markets in the near future. As previously reported, we have concluded agreements with Coca-Cola Amatil, which distributes Coca-Cola products in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Fiji. We will be launching Monster in Australia on May 1 and in New Zealand on May 9 with Coca-Cola Amatil. Additionally, as previously reported, we have concluded agreements with DIG [ph], the 100%-owned Coca-Cola bottler that operates in a number of international markets, for the distribution of Monster in certain of these markets. Further to these agreements, we are planning to launch Monster on May 13 in Singapore. Our plans to launch Monster in China are continuing to move forward with the Coca-Cola system. In Shanghai, we have received the required product approval and manufacturing license and are planning for production of Monster there. In Beijing, we have received the required product approval and are awaiting the manufacturing license. We have commenced the required approval process in Xiamen in Southeast China. We are still planning to launch Monster in China later this year, but as previously discussed, the launch could be delayed by various factors, including regulatory approvals and finalization of distribution agreements. We are targeting a relaunch of Monster in India later this year, following discussions with the regulatory authorities. We continue to make good progress in our discussions with FEMSA, AKO [ph] and other bottlers operating in South America. We have signed a distribution agreement with the Coca-Cola bottler, with Lindley [ph], which is controlled by AKO [ph] for distribution of Monster in Peru, and are planning to launch Monster in Peru on June 2. We're also planning to launch or transition a number of other international markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the ensuing quarters. 
We continue to make good progress in the repositioning, repackaging and reformulation of many of the Coca-Cola energy brands that were acquired as a result of the Coca-Cola transaction. 
We successfully completed our acquisition of the concentrate and flavor business operated by American Fruits & Flavors for $690 million in cash on April 1, 2016. We remain excited by this acquisition, which aligns us with our principal flavor supplier, and will enable us to expand and secure most of our flavors at an economical cost. The integration of the acquired business is proceeding well. 
Consistent with the company's previously announced plan to return capital to shareholders, in 2016, the company currently intends to commence a tender offer in May to purchase up to $2 billion in value of its common stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer at a price range to be specified. The company will fund the tender offer with cash on hand. 
In the first quarter, sales in the beverage industry in general, and of carbonated beverages in particular, continued to show weakness. However, sales of Monster products accelerated during the quarter. In the first quarter of 2015, in anticipation of the closing of the Coca-Cola transaction, we transitioned approximately 84% of the targeted distribution rights in the U.S. to the Coca-Cola system, with an additional 5% transitioned in May 2015. Consequently, the results of the comparable first quarter of 2015 were impacted by the acceleration of deferred revenue of $39.8 million, distribution termination costs of $206 million and Coca-Cola transaction costs of $3.6 million. Our ensuing discussion compares our 2016 first quarter results with our 2015 first quarter results after adjustment for the acceleration of deferred revenue, distribution termination costs and Coca-Cola transaction costs referred to above. 
In the first quarter, the company achieved gross record sales of $777.5 million, up 16% from $670.4 million in the first quarter of 2015. Net sales were $680.2 million, up 15.9% from $587 million in the first quarter of 2015. Net sales in the first quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $12.3 million. Our Original Green energy drink -- Monster Energy drink continued to perform well at retail. Retail sales of the Ultra line continue to show good growth in the United States during the first quarter, as did our Java Monster line. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 62.2% as compared to 56.1% for the comparable 2015 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to increased net sales of the Concentrate segment, which has higher gross margins than the Finished Products segment, the disposal of our non-energy brands and the price increase in our 16-ounce Monster Energy drinks effective August 31, 2015. 
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.4% as compared to 4.4% in the same quarter last year. 
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.2% compared to 10.6% in the same quarter a year ago. 
Sponsorship and endorsement costs, merchandise display costs and social media expenses were all higher in the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2015, while commissions were lower. 
General and administrative costs, excluding distributor termination costs and Coca-Cola transaction costs, as a percentage of net sales in the 2016 first quarter, were 10.6% as compared to 10.8% for the corresponding quarter in 2015. 
Payroll expenses were up $1.5 million consisting of a $5 million increase in payroll, due partially to increased staffing in connection with our acquisition of the strategic brands and an increase in stock-based compensation, a noncash item of $3.7 million, which were offset by a reduction of payroll taxes of $7.2 million, following the exercise of certain stock options in the first quarter of 2015. 
Also included in general and administrative cost is amortization of trademarks, a noncash item of $1.8 million, attributable to our acquisition of the strategic brands. 
Distributor termination costs were $3.4 million in the first quarter as compared to $206 million in the 2015 first quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $5.4 million in the 2016 first quarter as compared to $4.9 million in the 2015 first quarter. In addition, other legal costs were $2.4 million higher for the 2016 first quarter. 
Our effective tax rate decreased from an adjusted 38% to 35.8% in the first quarter, primarily due to the domestic production deduction. On an ongoing basis, we expect that our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36%. 
Net income was $166.1 million compared to net income of $110.8 million during the first quarter of last year, an increase of 49.9%. However, despite the substantial increase in the number of shares on a fully diluted basis from 173.8 million to 206.9 million, following the issuance of shares to Coca-Cola, diluted earnings per share increased to $0.80 after adjusting for distributor termination expense for the first quarter from $0.64 in the 2015 comparable quarter. 
Gross sales to customers outside the United States were $184.4 million in the 2016 first quarter compared to $141 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. 
Net sales to customers outside the United States were $149.1 million in the 2016 first quarter compared to $113 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. As stated earlier, gross sales and net sales to customers outside the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $15.1 million and $12.3 million, respectively. 
Including geographic sales reported on our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through March 26, 2016, all outlets combined, namely, convenience, grocery, drug, and mass merchandisers sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 7.1% versus the same period a year ago. Sales in Monster grew 8 -- 10.8% in the 13-week period while sales of NOS increased 2.5% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 9%. Sales of Red Bull increased 4.1%. Sales of Rockstar increased by 14.2%. Sales of 5-Hour decreased 0.1%. And sales of AMP decreased 8.1%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended March 26, 2016, sales in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased 5.9% over the same period last year. Sales of Monster increased by 9.6% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 5.4% and Full Throttle sales decreased 5%. Sales of Red Bull increased 1.3%, Rockstar was up 12.6%, 5-Hour was up 1.9% and AMP was down 4.5%. 
According to Nielsen, in the 5 weeks ended March 26, 2016, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 1.2 points over the same period last year to 35.2%. NOS' share remains the same at 3.7% and Full Throttle's share decreased 0.1 point to 1.1%. Red Bull's share decreased 1.6 points to 35.1%, slightly below Monster's share. Rockstar's share was up 0.5 point at 7.9%, 5-Hour's share was lower by 0.3 points at 8.3%. And AMP's share decreased 0.2 points to 1.8%. 
According to Nielsen, for the 5 weeks ended March 26, 2016, sales of Energy Plus Coffee drinks, in dollars, in the convenience and gas channel increased 20.6% over the same period last year. Java Monster was 18.4% higher than in the same period last year, while Starbucks Double Shot Energy was 25.2% higher. We'd like to mention that there have been some changes in the database we use to report on this category. 
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended March 5, 2016, the energy drink category decreased 2%. Monster sales were unchanged versus a year ago. Our market share increased 0.3 share points to 27.8%. Red Bull sales decreased 1%, and its market share increased 0.7 points to 37.3%. Rockstar sales decreased 9% and its market share decreased 1.2 points to 18%. 
According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 33.1% during the month of February 2016. Monster sales increased 8.3%. Our market share decreased 5.7 points to 25% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn, one of our acquired strategic brands, increased 4.9%, although Burn's market share decreased 1.7 points to 6.5%. Red Bull sales increased 0.7% and its market share decreased by 5.1 points to 15.7%. Vive 100's market share increased 14.3 points to 34.9%, while Boost's market share decreased 3.4 points to 11.3%. 
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended March 2016, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few days between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 12.1% to 13% in Great Britain; from 9.3% to 11% in Sweden; from 8.4% to 9.7% in Belgium; from 6.5% to 9% in Norway; from 5.7% to 7% in the Netherlands; and from 18.4% to 20.9% in France. For the 13-week period ended February 2016, according to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 11.2% to 13.6% in Germany, and decreased from 17.5% to 16.4% in South Africa, although value sales were 19.3% higher, according to Nielsen. We note that South Africa is one of those markets that has not transitioned to Coca-Cola bottlers. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ending February 2016 in Ireland increased from 7.4% to 8.7%, and from 21.5% to 24.8% in Spain. According to IRI, Monster's market share increased -- decreased in the 13 weeks to the end of February 2016 from 29.3% to 29.1%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. 
According to Nielsen for the month of March 2016 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 20.4% as compared to 15.3% last year. And in Brazil, Monster's market share for the month of March 2016 declined from 4.7% to 3.1% as compared to the same period last year. In South Korea, for the month of March 2016, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 10% to 18.7% compared to the same period last year. 
According to INTAGE for the month of March 2016 in the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 33.8% to 39.9%. 
Net sales for the Finished Products segment in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $10.3 million of foreign currency movements in the first quarter. Net sales for the Finished Products segment in the first quarter of 2016 increased 12.3% from $555.7 million to $624.3 million from the comparable period last year after adjustments for acceleration of deferred revenue. Net sales for the company's Concentrate segment were negatively impacted by approximately $2 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. After adjustment for such foreign currency movements, net sales for the Concentrate segment would have been $57.9 million for the first quarter. 
As a result of the Coca-Cola transaction, which closed on June 12, 2015, there were no sales for the Other segment during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $31.3 million of net sales in the first quarter of 2015. 
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the first quarter increased 47.2% in dollars and 58.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 39.4% in the same period last year to 50.2% during the 2016 first quarter. EMEA sales were negatively impacted by supply disruptions that were encountered by CCE in Great Britain, Monster's largest market in the EMEA during the quarter, following the implementation of new software. Monster continued to gain momentum and increased market share in Europe in the first quarter. Overall, EMEA is now operating well, and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution, including securing distribution by Coca-Cola bottlers in new countries and territories within the region. 
We are pleased with the launch of Ultra in Europe. We commenced distribution of Ultra in an additional 8 markets in EMEA in the first quarter. Ultra will be launched in 10 additional markets in EMEA in the second quarter of 2016. In particular, in Germany, France, Denmark, Belgium, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden, Monster achieved increased sales gains as well as increased market share. 
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the first quarter increased 93.5% in dollars and 97.7% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales, increased from 31.2% in the same period last year to 45.2% during the 2016 first quarter. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 63.4%, 62.5% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased 283.4% or 312.6% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In Mexico, Central America and South America, net sales for the first quarter decreased 3.2% in dollars and increased 9.2% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 39.8% in the same period last year to 41.1% during 2016 first quarter. Net sales decreased in Brazil largely due to the overall difficult economic and market conditions, together with the ongoing uncertainties for our distributor relating to the Coca-Cola transaction. In Mexico, net sales decreased in part due to customer destocking during the quarter and delivery disruptions during the month of March. However, as reported by Nielsen, Monster sales at retail in Mexico grew during the quarter. 
In Chile, net sales in the quarter increased 52.3% in dollars and 74.9% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. 
As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with planning for local production in India, and anticipate reentering the market in India later in 2016. As mentioned earlier, we're optimistic that we will be able to finalize agreements with Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries in the near future. We are also continuing to evaluate production opportunities with Coca-Cola bottlers, both in the U.S. and internationally, which we believe will yield cost reductions. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $2.5 billion at March 31, 2016, prior to the close of the AFF transaction compared to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $508.2 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased to $7.4 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 48.7 days at March 31, 2016, and 43.2 days at December 31, 2015, compared to 46.4 days at March 31, 2015. 
Inventories increased to $165.9 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 58.1 days at March 31, 2016, which was higher than the 58 days of inventory at December 31, 2015, and lower than the 69.1 days at March 31, 2015. 
During the 2016 first quarter, we launched our new Gronk energy drink and Salted Caramel Java Monster, initial consumer response has been positive. We are planning to launch Mutant, an exciting new beverage that will be positioned as refreshment energized, in the third quarter of 2016. For competitive reasons, we intend to provide further information on this new beverage at the stockholder meeting on June 14. 
As previously disclosed, we have also -- we also have additional new products planned for later this year. As this call is a week earlier than usual, we can only provide an estimate for April 2016 gross sales. Based on gross sales through April 28, 2016, we estimate April 2016 gross sales in dollars will be approximately 15% higher than in April 2015. In local currencies, we estimate April 2016 gross sales will be approximately 16% higher than in April 2015. We note that April 2015 sales included the old Warehouse segment and Peace Tea and April 2016 includes the Concentrates segment. We caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. 
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for our principal product. This transaction will be accretive to the company's earnings from the closing of the transaction on April 1, 2016. Consistent with the company's previously announced plan to return capital to shareholders in 2016, the company currently intends to commence a tender offer in May to purchase up to $2 billion in value of its common stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer at a price range to be specified. The company will fund the tender offer with cash on hand. While Hilton and I may participate in the offer for asset diversification reasons, we will continue to earn a substantial majority of our current holdings following any successful tender offer. 
North American and international gross margins remained healthy and continue to improve. The U.S. Nielsen market statistics and the equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales. We are excited about the prospects for our new Mutant beverage, which we're planning to launch in the third quarter. We are particularly pleased with our performance in our international markets. We have successfully transitioned a number of international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers, and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers from the second quarter of 2016. 
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Please note that we will not be taking any questions with respect to the tender offer on this call. Thank you."

In other words, is there a way to sort of think about it, split out by the bigger brands and maybe even comment on some of those smaller brands that could be getting discontinued?"

Like you, we also need to understand what the position is with regard to those brands. Some of it is relating to weakness in the brands themselves, that we are addressing in various ways. Some of that, of course, is foreign currency. And there's another factor in that in certain countries, we have been unable to structure ourselves in a way that we could actually sell concentrates, and what we do in certain countries is we get a royalty from The Coca-Cola Company, which equates to effectively what we would have done had we sold the concentrate. It's a structure of setting up various countries to accommodate the concentrate business. So there is a whole lot of factors that one has to take into account in evaluating the concentrate business. So largely, there is some weakness, but we -- we are not -- you are not seeing in these numbers the full extent of the concentrate business because of some of these adjustments that have to take place."

And that did affect sales. So we did see a reduction in sales in those countries as a result, we believe, of that. So what we've had to do is, not only just go in and blindly, obviously, reinvest in marketing, but we've had to relook at how we're repositioning these brands and at the same time get the repositioning done, both in repackaging in designs, in flavors. And then obviously, then recreate marketing plans to put those -- the new positioning that we have looked at for these brands, particularly the Burn brand and Relentless are 2 of the large brands that did have some weakness. We've also in many ways repositioned NOS a little bit in the U.S., although we haven't changed packaging. We are going to modernize that packaging, and that's still coming through now. So this is a long process because there are -- we're many brands, in many countries. And layered on top of our own staffing and our own business obviously at Monster, it just takes -- it takes a long time to get a lot of these -- this repositioning done. So we think that's partially the reason for it. And yes, it has been weaker than we had estimated. But we are -- we've been doing the repositioning, we've been doing some focusing and we are starting to see some strong signs. And we do believe that, that will continue to be positive. Some of the other brands, although smaller -- again, it's a mixed bag, you can't put it into one category because in some cases, the brand's off more and may go away. But in other cases, some of the smaller brands are very good, very strong brands. And we are actually looking to long-term growth from those brands. But again, it's going to be a positioning and a build, it's not going to happen overnight. But you know, there are some good, really good brands that we see in the mix that we do believe we will see growth from going forward."

But there is the emergence of a low-cost brand, Vive 100, in the market that have been very aggressive. And they have really expanded the market. So -- and that's why when we look at the market, we say our market share has decreased, but it is of a very much increased market and maybe a little bit different, and then we had a debate earlier as to, does Vive 100 really fit into the category?

One bucket is, although we are -- we've -- we're trying to get -- have ourselves the whole spirit of the deal is that we would become more integrated into the Coca-Cola system, we are still nevertheless an independent, publicly traded company. And as a result, it's been important for us to continue to negotiate agreements on terms that we believe are -- will put us in a position where we can protect ourselves and our brand if things or relationships didn't go as planned. And so the contract that we have agreed to with The Coca-Cola Company as a principal, and obviously, we now -- you take that to the individual bottlers, they have their own lawyers, they have their own local laws and they have their own view of life. And very respectfully, many of them are not used to signing a contract of this nature, which is more akin to a finished product distribution agreement as opposed to a manufacturing concentrate bottler agreement, which puts a lot of more discretion and decisions in the hands of the bottler, whereas we tend to keep or want to keep most of those decisions about global marketing, about some of the local marketing and a number of things. The other thing is that we obviously got to be very cautious that we don't get into a situation. We have a large line of products, for example. And we don't want to be in a position that if the bottler decides he wants to take 1 SKU or 3 SKUs and not the rest, that we are kept out of the market for the rest of the SKUs. So there are bones of contention that keep going up and down between the legal agreements. And we're getting through them. But in many cases, it's really a question of literally educating a bottler in a country with their lawyers about why our agreement is in the form that it's in and why we need the protections. Then the other -- obviously, the other bucket is just -- it goes back to the old life, money. How do you share the value chain that's available in the country? And it's just arm wrestling between us and the bottlers as to how do we get to a fair value share? And in some cases, we are at odds with the bottlers on what we believe we want out of the value share. And we're not going to compromise the value share and take less in order to simply try and get deals done at -- because we want to move quickly. I mean, what we are going to negotiate is going to stay with us for 20 or 30 years or however long the agreements are. So we really do want to have a fair relationship and a fair share of the value chain. Bearing in mind that we spend and do a lot more than that is normally done by Coca-Cola Company in a bottler relationship. When they split their -- whatever the split is, when they split their value chain, the bottler picks up a lot more of the obligation. In our case, we do. And we don't want to be in a position where we split the chain and we end up with still the lion's share of the marketing and other expenses, which aren't fairly shared.

So it is a bit of a haggling but as you can see from the agreements that have been finalized, we're moving forward, and we'll move forward in due course with some of the other bottlers or we won't. And if not, there are other distribution partners that we'll be working with."

An explanation of the non-GAAP measure of gross sales and certain expenditures, which may be mentioned during the course of this call, is provided in the notes designated with asterisks in the condensed consolidated statements of income and other information attached to the earnings release dated April 29, 2016. A copy of this information is also available on our website at monsterbevcorp.com in the Financial Information section. 
At the outset, I should mention that the release of our quarterly results and this call are almost a week earlier than normally scheduled. The reason for this change is that Hilton and I will be attending the Coca-Cola global system meeting that starts early next week. We will revert to our normal schedule for the second and subsequent quarters. 
We are continuing to make good progress in the implementation of our strategic alignment with Coca-Cola bottlers worldwide. We have successfully concluded negotiations with Coca-Cola bottlers in many countries and are planning to launch Monster with these bottlers in most of their international markets in the near future. As previously reported, we have concluded agreements with Coca-Cola Amatil, which distributes Coca-Cola products in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Fiji. We will be launching Monster in Australia on May 1 and in New Zealand on May 9 with Coca-Cola Amatil. Additionally, as previously reported, we have concluded agreements with DIG [ph], the 100%-owned Coca-Cola bottler that operates in a number of international markets, for the distribution of Monster in certain of these markets. Further to these agreements, we are planning to launch Monster on May 13 in Singapore. Our plans to launch Monster in China are continuing to move forward with the Coca-Cola system. In Shanghai, we have received the required product approval and manufacturing license and are planning for production of Monster there. In Beijing, we have received the required product approval and are awaiting the manufacturing license. We have commenced the required approval process in Xiamen in Southeast China. We are still planning to launch Monster in China later this year, but as previously discussed, the launch could be delayed by various factors, including regulatory approvals and finalization of distribution agreements. We are targeting a relaunch of Monster in India later this year, following discussions with the regulatory authorities. We continue to make good progress in our discussions with FEMSA, AKO [ph] and other bottlers operating in South America. We have signed a distribution agreement with the Coca-Cola bottler, with Lindley [ph], which is controlled by AKO [ph] for distribution of Monster in Peru, and are planning to launch Monster in Peru on June 2. We're also planning to launch or transition a number of other international markets to Coca-Cola bottlers in the ensuing quarters. 
We continue to make good progress in the repositioning, repackaging and reformulation of many of the Coca-Cola energy brands that were acquired as a result of the Coca-Cola transaction. 
We successfully completed our acquisition of the concentrate and flavor business operated by American Fruits & Flavors for $690 million in cash on April 1, 2016. We remain excited by this acquisition, which aligns us with our principal flavor supplier, and will enable us to expand and secure most of our flavors at an economical cost. The integration of the acquired business is proceeding well. 
Consistent with the company's previously announced plan to return capital to shareholders, in 2016, the company currently intends to commence a tender offer in May to purchase up to $2 billion in value of its common stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer at a price range to be specified. The company will fund the tender offer with cash on hand. 
In the first quarter, sales in the beverage industry in general, and of carbonated beverages in particular, continued to show weakness. However, sales of Monster products accelerated during the quarter. In the first quarter of 2015, in anticipation of the closing of the Coca-Cola transaction, we transitioned approximately 84% of the targeted distribution rights in the U.S. to the Coca-Cola system, with an additional 5% transitioned in May 2015. Consequently, the results of the comparable first quarter of 2015 were impacted by the acceleration of deferred revenue of $39.8 million, distribution termination costs of $206 million and Coca-Cola transaction costs of $3.6 million. Our ensuing discussion compares our 2016 first quarter results with our 2015 first quarter results after adjustment for the acceleration of deferred revenue, distribution termination costs and Coca-Cola transaction costs referred to above. 
In the first quarter, the company achieved gross record sales of $777.5 million, up 16% from $670.4 million in the first quarter of 2015. Net sales were $680.2 million, up 15.9% from $587 million in the first quarter of 2015. Net sales in the first quarter were adversely affected by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $12.3 million. Our Original Green energy drink -- Monster Energy drink continued to perform well at retail. Retail sales of the Ultra line continue to show good growth in the United States during the first quarter, as did our Java Monster line. 
Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 62.2% as compared to 56.1% for the comparable 2015 first quarter. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales was largely attributable to increased net sales of the Concentrate segment, which has higher gross margins than the Finished Products segment, the disposal of our non-energy brands and the price increase in our 16-ounce Monster Energy drinks effective August 31, 2015. 
Distribution costs as a percentage of net sales were 3.4% as compared to 4.4% in the same quarter last year. 
Selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were 10.2% compared to 10.6% in the same quarter a year ago. 
Sponsorship and endorsement costs, merchandise display costs and social media expenses were all higher in the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of 2015, while commissions were lower. 
General and administrative costs, excluding distributor termination costs and Coca-Cola transaction costs, as a percentage of net sales in the 2016 first quarter, were 10.6% as compared to 10.8% for the corresponding quarter in 2015. 
Payroll expenses were up $1.5 million consisting of a $5 million increase in payroll, due partially to increased staffing in connection with our acquisition of the strategic brands and an increase in stock-based compensation, a noncash item of $3.7 million, which were offset by a reduction of payroll taxes of $7.2 million, following the exercise of certain stock options in the first quarter of 2015. 
Also included in general and administrative cost is amortization of trademarks, a noncash item of $1.8 million, attributable to our acquisition of the strategic brands. 
Distributor termination costs were $3.4 million in the first quarter as compared to $206 million in the 2015 first quarter. Regulatory matters and litigation concerning the advertising, marketing, promotion, ingredients, usage, safety and sale of the company's products were $5.4 million in the 2016 first quarter as compared to $4.9 million in the 2015 first quarter. In addition, other legal costs were $2.4 million higher for the 2016 first quarter. 
Our effective tax rate decreased from an adjusted 38% to 35.8% in the first quarter, primarily due to the domestic production deduction. On an ongoing basis, we expect that our normalized tax rate will be approximately 36%. 
Net income was $166.1 million compared to net income of $110.8 million during the first quarter of last year, an increase of 49.9%. However, despite the substantial increase in the number of shares on a fully diluted basis from 173.8 million to 206.9 million, following the issuance of shares to Coca-Cola, diluted earnings per share increased to $0.80 after adjusting for distributor termination expense for the first quarter from $0.64 in the 2015 comparable quarter. 
Gross sales to customers outside the United States were $184.4 million in the 2016 first quarter compared to $141 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. 
Net sales to customers outside the United States were $149.1 million in the 2016 first quarter compared to $113 million in the corresponding quarter in 2015. As stated earlier, gross sales and net sales to customers outside the United States were higher in local currencies by approximately $15.1 million and $12.3 million, respectively. 
Including geographic sales reported on our sales to the company's military customers, which are delivered in the United States and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas. 
According to the Nielsen report for the 13 weeks through March 26, 2016, all outlets combined, namely, convenience, grocery, drug, and mass merchandisers sales in dollars in the energy drink category, including energy shots, increased by 7.1% versus the same period a year ago. Sales in Monster grew 8 -- 10.8% in the 13-week period while sales of NOS increased 2.5% and sales of Full Throttle decreased 9%. Sales of Red Bull increased 4.1%.

Sales of Monster increased by 9.6% over the same period last year, while NOS was up 5.4% and Full Throttle sales decreased 5%. Sales of Red Bull increased 1.3%, Rockstar was up 12.6%, 5-Hour was up 1.9% and AMP was down 4.5%. 
According to Nielsen, in the 5 weeks ended March 26, 2016, Monster's market share of the energy drink category in the convenience and gas channel, including energy shots, in dollars, increased by 1.2 points over the same period last year to 35.2%.

Java Monster was 18.4% higher than in the same period last year, while Starbucks Double Shot Energy was 25.2% higher. We'd like to mention that there have been some changes in the database we use to report on this category. 
According to Nielsen, in the convenience and gas channel in Canada, for the 12 weeks ended March 5, 2016, the energy drink category decreased 2%. Monster sales were unchanged versus a year ago. Our market share increased 0.3 share points to 27.8%. Red Bull sales decreased 1%, and its market share increased 0.7 points to 37.3%.

According to Nielsen, for all outlets combined in Mexico, the energy drink category grew 33.1% during the month of February 2016. Monster sales increased 8.3%. Our market share decreased 5.7 points to 25% against the comparable period last year. Sales of Burn, one of our acquired strategic brands, increased 4.9%, although Burn's market share decreased 1.7 points to 6.5%. Red Bull sales increased 0.7% and its market share decreased by 5.1 points to 15.7%. Vive 100's market share increased 14.3 points to 34.9%, while Boost's market share decreased 3.4 points to 11.3%. 
The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover a single month, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that may be undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. 
According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended March 2016, the actual 13-week periods vary by a few days between different markets. Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 12.1% to 13% in Great Britain; from 9.3% to 11% in Sweden; from 8.4% to 9.7% in Belgium; from 6.5% to 9% in Norway; from 5.7% to 7% in the Netherlands; and from 18.4% to 20.9% in France. For the 13-week period ended February 2016, according to Nielsen, Monster's retail market share in value, as compared to the same period last year, grew from 11.2% to 13.6% in Germany, and decreased from 17.5% to 16.4% in South Africa, although value sales were 19.3% higher, according to Nielsen. We note that South Africa is one of those markets that has not transitioned to Coca-Cola bottlers. Monster's retail market share in value for the 13 weeks ending February 2016 in Ireland increased from 7.4% to 8.7%, and from 21.5% to 24.8% in Spain. According to IRI, Monster's market share increased -- decreased in the 13 weeks to the end of February 2016 from 29.3% to 29.1%. I would like to point out that the Nielsen and IRI numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide because the channels read by Nielsen and IRI in EMEA vary from country to country. 
According to Nielsen for the month of March 2016 in Chile, Monster's retail market share in value increased to 20.4% as compared to 15.3% last year.

In South Korea, for the month of March 2016, Monster's retail market share in value increased from 10% to 18.7% compared to the same period last year. 
According to INTAGE for the month of March 2016 in the convenience store channel in Japan, Monster's market share grew from 33.8% to 39.9%. 
Net sales for the Finished Products segment in the first quarter were negatively impacted by approximately $10.3 million of foreign currency movements in the first quarter. Net sales for the Finished Products segment in the first quarter of 2016 increased 12.3% from $555.7 million to $624.3 million from the comparable period last year after adjustments for acceleration of deferred revenue. Net sales for the company's Concentrate segment were negatively impacted by approximately $2 million of foreign currency movements in the quarter. After adjustment for such foreign currency movements, net sales for the Concentrate segment would have been $57.9 million for the first quarter. 
As a result of the Coca-Cola transaction, which closed on June 12, 2015, there were no sales for the Other segment during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to $31.3 million of net sales in the first quarter of 2015. 
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, net sales in the first quarter increased 47.2% in dollars and 58.6% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 39.4% in the same period last year to 50.2% during the 2016 first quarter. EMEA sales were negatively impacted by supply disruptions that were encountered by CCE in Great Britain, Monster's largest market in the EMEA during the quarter, following the implementation of new software. Monster continued to gain momentum and increased market share in Europe in the first quarter. Overall, EMEA is now operating well, and we have made good strides in achieving increased distribution levels and in-store execution, including securing distribution by Coca-Cola bottlers in new countries and territories within the region. 
We are pleased with the launch of Ultra in Europe. We commenced distribution of Ultra in an additional 8 markets in EMEA in the first quarter. Ultra will be launched in 10 additional markets in EMEA in the second quarter of 2016. In particular, in Germany, France, Denmark, Belgium, Hungary, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden, Monster achieved increased sales gains as well as increased market share. 
In Asia Pacific, net sales in the first quarter increased 93.5% in dollars and 97.7% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region, as a percentage of net sales, increased from 31.2% in the same period last year to 45.2% during the 2016 first quarter. In Japan, net sales in the quarter increased 63.4%, 62.5% in local currency, as compared to the same quarter last year. We continue to experience strong performance in Japan. In South Korea, net sales increased 283.4% or 312.6% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. In Mexico, Central America and South America, net sales for the first quarter decreased 3.2% in dollars and increased 9.2% in local currencies over the same period last year. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales increased from 39.8% in the same period last year to 41.1% during 2016 first quarter. Net sales decreased in Brazil largely due to the overall difficult economic and market conditions, together with the ongoing uncertainties for our distributor relating to the Coca-Cola transaction. In Mexico, net sales decreased in part due to customer destocking during the quarter and delivery disruptions during the month of March. However, as reported by Nielsen, Monster sales at retail in Mexico grew during the quarter. 
In Chile, net sales in the quarter increased 52.3% in dollars and 74.9% in local currency as compared to the same quarter last year. 
As previously mentioned, we are moving ahead with planning for local production in India, and anticipate reentering the market in India later in 2016. As mentioned earlier, we're optimistic that we will be able to finalize agreements with Coca-Cola bottlers in numerous countries in the near future. We are also continuing to evaluate production opportunities with Coca-Cola bottlers, both in the U.S. and internationally, which we believe will yield cost reductions. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $2.5 billion at March 31, 2016, prior to the close of the AFF transaction compared to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2015. Short-term investments were $508.2 million compared to $744.6 million at December 31, 2015. Long-term investments decreased to $7.4 million from $15.3 million at December 31, 2015. Days outstanding for accounts receivables were 48.7 days at March 31, 2016, and 43.2 days at December 31, 2015, compared to 46.4 days at March 31, 2015. 
Inventories increased to $165.9 million from $156.1 million at December 31, 2015. Average days of inventory was 58.1 days at March 31, 2016, which was higher than the 58 days of inventory at December 31, 2015, and lower than the 69.1 days at March 31, 2015. 
During the 2016 first quarter, we launched our new Gronk energy drink and Salted Caramel Java Monster, initial consumer response has been positive. We are planning to launch Mutant, an exciting new beverage that will be positioned as refreshment energized, in the third quarter of 2016. For competitive reasons, we intend to provide further information on this new beverage at the stockholder meeting on June 14. 
As previously disclosed, we have also -- we also have additional new products planned for later this year. As this call is a week earlier than usual, we can only provide an estimate for April 2016 gross sales. Based on gross sales through April 28, 2016, we estimate April 2016 gross sales in dollars will be approximately 15% higher than in April 2015. In local currencies, we estimate April 2016 gross sales will be approximately 16% higher than in April 2015. We note that April 2015 sales included the old Warehouse segment and Peace Tea and April 2016 includes the Concentrates segment. We caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches and the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, and should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for the full quarter or any future period. 
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. Our acquisition of AFF is exciting and represents an important milestone for the company through the ownership of the proprietary formulas for our principal product. This transaction will be accretive to the company's earnings from the closing of the transaction on April 1, 2016. Consistent with the company's previously announced plan to return capital to shareholders in 2016, the company currently intends to commence a tender offer in May to purchase up to $2 billion in value of its common stock through a modified Dutch auction tender offer at a price range to be specified. The company will fund the tender offer with cash on hand. While Hilton and I may participate in the offer for asset diversification reasons, we will continue to earn a substantial majority of our current holdings following any successful tender offer. 
North American and international gross margins remained healthy and continue to improve. The U.S. Nielsen market statistics and the equivalent market statistics from many countries around the world show that the energy category is continuing to grow, and that Monster is generally growing ahead of the category. The new additions to the Monster family continue to gain momentum and add to the company's sales. We are excited about the prospects for our new Mutant beverage, which we're planning to launch in the third quarter. We are particularly pleased with our performance in our international markets. We have successfully transitioned a number of international countries to Coca-Cola bottlers, and we have reached an advanced stage to transition many more markets to Coca-Cola bottlers from the second quarter of 2016. 
I would like to open the floor to questions about the quarter and the year. Please note that we will not be taking any questions with respect to the tender offer on this call. Thank you."

In other words, is there a way to sort of think about it, split out by the bigger brands and maybe even comment on some of those smaller brands that could be getting discontinued?"

Like you, we also need to understand what the position is with regard to those brands. Some of it is relating to weakness in the brands themselves, that we are addressing in various ways. Some of that, of course, is foreign currency. And there's another factor in that in certain countries, we have been unable to structure ourselves in a way that we could actually sell concentrates, and what we do in certain countries is we get a royalty from The Coca-Cola Company, which equates to effectively what we would have done had we sold the concentrate. It's a structure of setting up various countries to accommodate the concentrate business. So there is a whole lot of factors that one has to take into account in evaluating the concentrate business. So largely, there is some weakness, but we -- we are not -- you are not seeing in these numbers the full extent of the concentrate business because of some of these adjustments that have to take place."

And that did affect sales. So we did see a reduction in sales in those countries as a result, we believe, of that. So what we've had to do is, not only just go in and blindly, obviously, reinvest in marketing, but we've had to relook at how we're repositioning these brands and at the same time get the repositioning done, both in repackaging in designs, in flavors. And then obviously, then recreate marketing plans to put those -- the new positioning that we have looked at for these brands, particularly the Burn brand and Relentless are 2 of the large brands that did have some weakness. We've also in many ways repositioned NOS a little bit in the U.S., although we haven't changed packaging. We are going to modernize that packaging, and that's still coming through now. So this is a long process because there are -- we're many brands, in many countries. And layered on top of our own staffing and our own business obviously at Monster, it just takes -- it takes a long time to get a lot of these -- this repositioning done. So we think that's partially the reason for it. And yes, it has been weaker than we had estimated. But we are -- we've been doing the repositioning, we've been doing some focusing and we are starting to see some strong signs. And we do believe that, that will continue to be positive. Some of the other brands, although smaller -- again, it's a mixed bag, you can't put it into one category because in some cases, the brand's off more and may go away. But in other cases, some of the smaller brands are very good, very strong brands. And we are actually looking to long-term growth from those brands. But again, it's going to be a positioning and a build, it's not going to happen overnight. But you know, there are some good, really good brands that we see in the mix that we do believe we will see growth from going forward."

So -- and that's why when we look at the market, we say our market share has decreased, but it is of a very much increased market and maybe a little bit different, and then we had a debate earlier as to, does Vive 100 really fit into the category?

One bucket is, although we are -- we've -- we're trying to get -- have ourselves the whole spirit of the deal is that we would become more integrated into the Coca-Cola system, we are still nevertheless an independent, publicly traded company. And as a result, it's been important for us to continue to negotiate agreements on terms that we believe are -- will put us in a position where we can protect ourselves and our brand if things or relationships didn't go as planned. And so the contract that we have agreed to with The Coca-Cola Company as a principal, and obviously, we now -- you take that to the individual bottlers, they have their own lawyers, they have their own local laws and they have their own view of life. And very respectfully, many of them are not used to signing a contract of this nature, which is more akin to a finished product distribution agreement as opposed to a manufacturing concentrate bottler agreement, which puts a lot of more discretion and decisions in the hands of the bottler, whereas we tend to keep or want to keep most of those decisions about global marketing, about some of the local marketing and a number of things. The other thing is that we obviously got to be very cautious that we don't get into a situation. We have a large line of products, for example. And we don't want to be in a position that if the bottler decides he wants to take 1 SKU or 3 SKUs and not the rest, that we are kept out of the market for the rest of the SKUs. So there are bones of contention that keep going up and down between the legal agreements. And we're getting through them. But in many cases, it's really a question of literally educating a bottler in a country with their lawyers about why our agreement is in the form that it's in and why we need the protections. Then the other -- obviously, the other bucket is just -- it goes back to the old life, money. How do you share the value chain that's available in the country? And it's just arm wrestling between us and the bottlers as to how do we get to a fair value share? And in some cases, we are at odds with the bottlers on what we believe we want out of the value share. And we're not going to compromise the value share and take less in order to simply try and get deals done at -- because we want to move quickly. I mean, what we are going to negotiate is going to stay with us for 20 or 30 years or however long the agreements are. So we really do want to have a fair relationship and a fair share of the value chain. Bearing in mind that we spend and do a lot more than that is normally done by Coca-Cola Company in a bottler relationship. When they split their -- whatever the split is, when they split their value chain, the bottler picks up a lot more of the obligation. In our case, we do. And we don't want to be in a position where we split the chain and we end up with still the lion's share of the marketing and other expenses, which aren't fairly shared. So it's been a negotiation, and we just -- we're getting through them one by one. And I think that's really the color I've got. I don't know, Hilton, if you would like to add to it..."

In terms of -- on commercial terms for us and a fair agreement for the bottler. And often, the bottler feels he's entitled to more. And we, as a brand owner, have substantial expenses, have substantial marketing expenses and we have to ensure that after those marketing expenses, we do a good deal for our shareholders. So it is a bit of a haggling but as you can see from the agreements that have been finalized, we're moving forward, and we'll move forward in due course with some of the other bottlers or we won't. And if not, there are other distribution partners that we'll be working with."
