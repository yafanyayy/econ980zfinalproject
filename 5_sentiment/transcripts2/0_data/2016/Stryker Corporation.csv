Joining me today are Bill Jellison, our CFO; Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations; and Glenn Boehnlein will be taking over for Bill on April",824,"Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Stryker's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bill Jellison, our CFO; Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations; and Glenn Boehnlein will be taking over for Bill on April 1. Following my opening comments, Katherine will provide an update on MAKO, while Bill will offer more details on our quarterly results before turning to questions and answers.
For the 6.4% increase in organic sales in Q4, we continue to deliver on our goal of driving top line growth at the high end of med tech. This marks the 11th consecutive quarter where Stryker delivered 5% or better organic sales growth, demonstrating strong consistency over time. Our diversified sales footprint has, once again, proven to be a key component of our growth strategy as all of our segments, Orthopaedics, MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Spine, posted good results in the quarter. This performance has underscored the strength of our sales and marketing execution and our innovation engine, which is characterized by healthy R&D investments and a focused and disciplined M&A effort.
Approximately 70% of our sales are derived from our U.S. businesses, which, once again, led growth, posting an impressive gain of approximately 8%. I'm also pleased with the growing momentum out of Europe, including strong Q4 results, benefiting from the shift in Transatlantic Operating Model at the beginning of 2015. We are building on the success as we start 2016, with Canada rolling into the model and the other regions now reporting to our Group Presidents, Tim [indiscernible] and David Floyd. 
Our international growth of roughly 4% in constant currency was, once again, impacted by soft performances in China and Brazil. However, as you've seen, we have demonstrated the ability to offset isolated geographic softness through strength in our larger markets. 
Turning to earnings. Our adjusted EPS for Q4 of $1.56 is at the high-end of our revised range of $1.53 to $1.56, primarily driven by the strong top line. The balance of the P&L came in as expected, which Bill will over in his section. 
Looking ahead to 2016, we expect our sales momentum to continue and are targeting organic sales growth for the year of 5% to 6%. This takes into account expected softness in emerging markets for a good portion of the year. 
In addition, the 2-year suspension of the Med Device Tax provides us with the opportunity to bolster investments that will help drive sales growth and innovation, as we plan to invest the majority of for these temporary benefit. 
We are also continuing on our path toward driving greater cost efficiencies, which is a multiyear opportunity. Over the past year, we have been focused on identifying and prioritizing the key target areas for cost reduction within our organization. As we shifted to 2016, we are moving toward project implementation under the leadership of Group President, Lani Carpenter [ph]. We have identified significant areas of savings centered around optimizing our planned network, rationalizing our product lines, professionalizing our indirect procurement in a similar manner as we have done with direct materials to moving to a common ERP system and driving more shared services. Given our history of decentralization, there's considerable authority ahead of us in this program. We believe a methodical and deliberate approach these efforts will allow us to preserve the Stryker's competitive differentiation in the areas of sales, marketing, R&D and business development while helping to ensure we are consistently delivering P&L leverage. This is reflected in our 2016 adjusted EPS range of $5.50 to $5.70 a share. This is an increase of approximately 7.5% to 11.5% versus 2015, and it includes a negative foreign exchange impact of $0.12 to $0.13 a share. 
Finally, I'd like to take a moment to extend my thanks and appreciation to Bill Jellison, who's announced his plans to retire following an impressive 36 career -- 36-year career, the last 3 of which have been with Stryker. Bill was able to quickly move toward implementing a layered hedging program, which has proven to be successful at mitigating our transactional FX exposure. In addition, he helped execute in a number of acquisitions associate of the establishment of a European regional headquarters that's enabled significant savings and has also helped to shape our comprehensive cost reduction program. He's accomplishments have meaningfully contributed to our success and were achieved while enabling our internal talent pool to develop, including Glenn Boehnlein, who's been promoted to CFO effective April 1. Glenn has been with Stryker in various financial results leadership role since 2003, most recently serving as Group CFO for the MedSurg and Neurotechnology group. His group represents roughly half the company and has been a consistent force behind our strong results. I am confident in Glenn's stability in coordination with the broader financial organization to help build on our strong momentum. 
Before turning the call over to Katherine, I've asked Glenn to make a few comments. Glenn?"

The combination enables surgeons to use a best-in-class hip implant surgeon and patient.
[Audio Gap]
For 2016, we are focused on continuing to drive adoption with our current indications, which we believe offers considerable opportunity to drive ongoing robot placements. 
We are also excited about the potential for the total knee indication with our flagship Triathlon system. This year, our efforts will be centered around gaining user experience with key opinion leaders to help ensure an optimal rollout as we look to full commercial release in 2017. We believe the commercial launch, which will be aided by podium presentations from the early users group, will be in place as we head into next year.

[indiscernible] Stryker with strong cultural fit in personal fit from the first week I joined the company. 
We ended 2015 at the high-end of both our initial sales and earnings guidance that was set at the beginning of the year. As we look at 2016 and set our initial guidance, I am confident that our sales momentum, strong product portfolio and pipeline and the cost containment initiatives that we are driving position us well for the future. I look forward to ensuring a smooth transition with Glenn and entering another stage of my life. I will continue to engage actively and in many of my passions, travel with my family and friends and explore additional Board opportunities. I want to thank you all of you for your support. 
So turning to our financial performance. Sales grew 3.7% in the quarter, including a negative 3.2% impact from foreign currency translation. Constant currency sales growth was 7%, which includes organic growth of 6.4%. 
GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.38 per share versus $0.68 last year in the fourth quarter, while adjusted earnings per share were $1.56 a share for the quarter versus $1.44 per share in the fourth quarter last year. This quarter's EPS includes negative impacts of roughly $0.04 per share from foreign exchange, which was in line with our guidance. Most currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar continue to be weaker than last year in the same period. The weaker euro and Swiss franc, along with our layered hedging program, helped to mitigate some of the impact in the quarter, as many of our products are manufactured in Europe, which helped improve our gross margin rates in the period. However, significant weakening in foreign currency rates in emerging markets and the continued weakness of the Japanese yen, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, where we have minimal manufacturing, negatively impacted our gross margins and operating results in those regions. The most significant non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter were amortization, restructuring charges and a net reduction in the charge associated with the voluntary recall of the Rejuvenate ABG II modular Hips Stem as we resolved some insurance matters in the quarter, which more than offset the additional charge in the period. 
As I have mentioned previously, the charges we have recorded related to the Rejuvenate and ABG II recall represents a minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve this manner, and the charges may increase or decrease over time as additional facts become available and our assumptions more refined. 
In the fourth quarter, our organic growth rate was 6.4%, including 8.1% growth in unit volumes and mix, with price negatively impacting sales by 1.7%. Acquisitions added 0.6%, while FX had a negative 3.2% impact due to significant weakness in both the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar compared to the same period last year. 
Full year 2015 constant currency sales growth were 7%, and organic growth was 6.1%. 
Looking at our segments. Orthopaedics represented 42% of our sales in the quarter, and sales of Orthopaedic products grew 3.3% as reported and 7.1% in constant currency. U.S. Orthopaedic sales grew 9.7% in the quarter. 
Trauma and Extremities had another excellent quarter in the U.S., with sales increasing 13.6%, led by strong growth in Foot & Ankle, which, again, grew approximately 20% for both the fourth quarter and full year. 
U.S. Hips and Knees continued their strong performance of 6.4% and 9.1% organic growth, respectively, in the quarter. These sales were bolstered by increased adoption of recent titanium 3D-printed products. 
Our International Orthopaedic business grew 2.4% in constant currency, as sales growth continued to be negatively impacted by weakness in China and Brazil. However, our International Knee business grew 5.5% in constant currency in the quarter. 
Finally, we sold 31 MAKO units in the quarter and 72 units in the full year. 
Next, our MedSurg segment represented approximately 40% of our total sales, and sales of MedSurg products grew 3% as reported and 5.6% in constant currency. These results were led by growth in our Instruments and Medical business, both of which had strong mid-single-digit percentage growth in constant currency. 
Endoscopy also posted mid-single-digit percentage growth in constant currency in the period on the back of our new camera offering, which was launched in December. All 3 of these large MedSurg businesses continued to manage pricing decisions effectively, with modest price declines of less than 0.5% for the year. 
Our final segment, Neurotechnology and Spine, represented 18% of sales and delivered another good quarter. Sales of Neurotechnology and Spine products grew 6.5% as reported and 9.9% in constant currency. Growth in this segment was led by our Neurotechnology business, which had double-digit growth in the high teens in constant currency in the fourth quarter and grew high teens in the U.S. Spine sales had mid-single-digit percentage growth in constant currency in the period and had high single-digit growth in the U.S. This marks our third consecutive quarter of strong growth in U.S. Spine. Spine also has a new 3D-printed interbody device launching in 2016, which we believe will be a very exciting product for the market, helping us to continue this positive trend. 
In looking at our operational performance, gross margin as a percent of sales on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter was 67.2% compared to 65.8% in the fourth quarter last year. When compared to the same period last year, the rate was positively impacted by solid operational improvements, product mix and FX rates despite the negative FX impact on earnings per share. 
Price had a negative impact as pricing was lower by 1.7% in the period. Our gross margin as a percentage of sales was 66.5% or 50 basis points higher than last year. 
Research and development expenses increased by 20 basis points to 6% of sales in the fourth quarter compared to 5.8% in the same period last year. 
On an adjusted basis, selling, general and administrative expenses represented 33.7% of sales in the fourth quarter compared to 32.4% in the same period last year. As expected, these expenses were higher for the year as we increased spending to support the cost structure of our European regional headquarters in Amsterdam and our transatlantic operating model. We are confident in our ability to leverage these expenses in 2016 as we continue to drive a number of key cost initiatives even as we reinvest some of the savings from the suspension of the Medical Device Tax. 
Operating margin as a percentage of sales on an adjusted basis were 27.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 27.6% in the same period last year. The full year adjusted operating margin rate was 24.9%, nearly flat compared to last year. During the year, we invested in our European regional headquarters and the establishment of our transatlantic operating model, which reduced the stronger operating margins for the year. 
Other expense in the fourth quarter was $36 million. This increase in expense resulted primarily from higher net interest expense due to increased borrowings and foreign currency exchange transactional losses in the fourth quarter. This is generally consistent with the run rate for this category. 
Our reported tax rate for the fourth quarter was 14.7%, while the adjusted effective tax rate was 16.6% for the fourth quarter compared to 22.6% in the same period last year. The fourth quarter effective tax rate benefited from the renewal of the tax extenders, which was contemplated in our guidance. The full year adjusted effective tax rate was 17.3% compared to 22.3% last year, as we realized the benefits from our global tax structure in European regional headquarters in Amsterdam. 
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $4.1 billion of cash and marketable securities, approximately 50% of it now held in the U.S. We also had $4 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. 
From an asset management standpoint, accounts receivable days ended the quarter 55, relatively unchanged from last year. Days of inventory finished the quarter at 165, which was an increase of 5 days compared to last year. 
Turning to cash flow. Our cash flow from operations for 2015 were $900 million compared to $1.8 billion last year. But as previously mentioned, we made significant payments earlier this year associated with our Rejuvenate and ABG II recall settlement of $1.2 billion, most of which occurred in the third quarter. Approximately 50% of the funding of the Rejuvenate liability is being sourced from OUS cash. We also repatriated a total of $1.8 billion in 2015, including approximately $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $270 million in 2015 compared to $233 million last year. 
Finally, regarding share repurchases. In 2015, we repurchased approximately $700 million of our common stock or approximately 7.5 million shares at an average price of approximately $94.67. We have authorization for another $1.9 billion available for repurchase under our current authorization. 
Based on our strong performance in 2015 and assessment of the current economic and market conditions, we are projecting constant currency and organic sales growth in a range of 5% to 6% for 2016 and expect to be at the low end of that range in the first quarter, as we are still anticipating impacts of the market conditions in the emerging markets, especially China and Brazil. 
If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate net sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 1% for 2016. We also expect continued unfavorable price reductions of 1.5% to 2%, consistent with the pricing environment experienced in 2015. 
Due to the suspension of the Med Tech Tax, we will also provide some additional visibility to our projected margin rates for 2016. 
Both gross margin and operating income margins are projected to be at least 50 basis points higher in 2016 in total. The benefit from the suspension of the Med Tech Tax will directly benefit our gross profit rate. However, R&D will run slightly higher in 2016, and our SG&A rate will only show modest improvement for the full year, as we expect to reinvest the majority of the benefit we receive into these areas, offsetting much of our cost reductions in '16. As such, our gross margin rate improvements will be the driver of our operating margin rate in 2016. We expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate in 2016 will continue to be approximately 17% to 17.5%. 
Capital expenditures are expected to be $400 million to $450 million in 2016, as we continue to invest in our operations and IT infrastructure to support future growth. Based on the current foreign exchange rates, we expect 2016 to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.12 to $0.13 for the full year and approximately $0.03 for the first quarter. This negative impact is largely driven by the translational component of foreign exchange, which we do not hedge. The transactional impact of foreign exchange on earnings is being offset somewhat by both natural and real hedges, which we continue to layer into our operations. 
Finally, our guidance for adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2016 is $5.50 to $5.70 for the full year and $1.17 to $1.22 for the first quarter. 
Thanks for your support, and we'd be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time."

We do expect some modest level of improvement still in the broader operating expense category, but the investment is primarily taking place in both areas, probably about maybe 20 basis points or so of an impact on the R&D-related side and the remainder kind of in the SG&A area. I'd say that with the cost initiatives that we've got in place that you would have seen obviously better leverage there, but with the reinvestment, that will slow that down at least this year. But we should still be showing obviously some very, very solid gross margin rates improvement, and we should be getting good drop was still in the operating income line for that. As it relates to the buybacks, yes, we did jump out to about $700 million in this year. As you can see, our cash has continued to stay very strong. We were able to bring back some additional cash. We have about $2 billion here in the U.S. at this point. And as far as our guidance is concerned, you should expect that we commented before that we've got the authorization out there. We expect to complete that over kind of a 2- to 3-year period of time,barring any sizable acquisitions. And hopefully, as having mesenchyme options are absolutely still our first and foremost kind of attention within that space, and we expect to be very active as we move forward.

So we provide you guidance this year we show super the manifold levers of the EPS line. Coming off the year, we just delivered leverage if you didn't have the $0.12 to $0.13 a share of negative FX, we'd be giving EPS in the 10% to 14% range. So that's pretty meaningful leverage on the sales of 5% to 6%. So you should expect us to continue to drive meaningful leverage. That's the goal of the constant program. As we've said before, there is significant opportunities in the hundreds of millions of dollars. And as we get to drive those savings, we'll obviously if there's quick opportunists to invest, will invest some of those dollars and some of those dollars will fall to the bottom line. So but I didn't have a magical number and as it also depends on as the years progress, what types of deals we do, how that affects our margin profile. So I think, each year, you will expect us to give the kind of guidance we are giving you this year, nice, robust organic growth and a nice amount of leverage to the bottom line.

But I guess, what's changing? Does the application get a lot easier? are people putting out the benefits of the hip? I mean, what's driving uptick in against what was historical viewed as sort of like that the greatest application for the robot?"

So out build you the iterations of the software were a little bit clunky, and it requires quite a bit more registration time to register in the software system. So that's just the next trust that some of the surgeons are a little bit frustrated with. Over the time, both prior to our acquisition and subsequent to our acquisition, we've made some enhancements of the software to make it a little bit more user-friendly. That's been one factor for sure. I think the most compelling factor is it's showing the surgeons the free and post x-rays that they put the Hip exactly where they want to put it. And I think even the surgeons had some hesitations when they see their pre and post x-rays, they are just -- it's a very compelling visual for them to understand before they weren't doing that. They weren't able to get that same type of consistency. And that's starting to resonate with a lot of surgeons. And now being able to put our implants in addition with easier-to-use software and to get that kind of outcome, it's like all things have changed, right? Change doesn't occur to everybody at the same time. Some people are early the adopters. Some people, frankly, will never adopt. There are just beset in our airways. But what we're seeing is the middle of the bell curve is starting to shift its mindset. And frankly, the more that robotics is talked about, in the community at large, we find that actually a very positive thing because we really believe we have a terrific system, and we're obviously continuing to invest in that system going forward."

The quick summary is the 3D printing metal is very different than sort of the way you think about 3D printing plastic having it on a desk and office and cracking up 3D-printed but express a metal is much more competent. It's explosive. It requires a lot of extra programming just don't buy a machine that sort of offer to the races. It's a lot more complicated than that. So we spend a lot of time working on this for many, many years. And so we have a lot of know-how and how to program machines and optimizing machines. And so there's a lot of factors that go into it, to be able to create. And different types of machines work better for smaller products than larger products. So it's difficult for me to just summarize in a short time. I'd just say it's more complicated than plastics or other things that you read about in the mainstream press.

But Europe had a mid-single-digit growth year, and it improved progressively from the first quarter to the fourth quarter. So that kind of uptick is, frankly, ahead of where we expected it to be. It's been masked a little bit because of the sluggishness out of China, so that has dampened our international sales. But it's been a really great success. I'm excited about what I'm seeing across our businesses in Europe. Some of the divisions to call Pastor and others but the Extremities and others and Endoscopy now starting to see some nice uptick in Instruments and spread to worse both the end of the year. So more to come in Europe we made a number of investments over the course of the year. Those investments are now taking hold, and I think you'll start to see Europe become a division that delivers better top line and starts to deliver some leverage going forward. We've added Canada, so those are now directly managed. A Division President has direct P&L accountability for Canada, the U.S. and Europe. The other regions, we haven't yet folded into the model, but by eliminating the Group President of international role, we know have them reporting directly to our business Group President. So it just increases speed and connectivity from our regions to come straight to a Group President. Over time, we'll see whether those countries will roll into this model, but we don't want to run too fast to fully integrated complete global business units, especially with my the slide China doors of different our Japan. But we're very pleased with the progress so far taking out that position nothing about cost reduction that was 100% just to increase speed and productivity of those countries to our businesses."

Joining me today are Bill Jellison, our CFO; Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations; and Glenn Boehnlein, who will be taking over for Bill on",822,"Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Stryker's fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are Bill Jellison, our CFO; Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations; and Glenn Boehnlein, who will be taking over for Bill on April 1. Following my opening comments, Katherine will provide an update on MAKO, while Bill will offer more details on our quarterly results before turning to questions and answers.
With a 6.4% increase in organic sales in Q4, we continue to deliver on our goal of driving top line growth at the high-end of med tech. This marks the 11th consecutive quarter where Stryker delivered 5% or better organic sales growth, demonstrating strong consistency over time. Our diversified sales footprint has once again proven to be a key component of our growth strategy as all of our segments, Orthopaedics, MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Spine, posted good results in the quarter. These performances underscore the strength of our sales and marketing execution and our innovation engine, which is characterized by healthy R&D investments and a focused and disciplined M&A effort.
Approximately 70% of our sales are derived from our U.S. businesses, which once again led growth, posting an impressive gain of approximately 8%. I am also pleased with the growing momentum out of Europe, including strong Q4 results benefiting from the shift to the Transatlantic Operating Model at the beginning of 2015. We are building on this success as we start 2016 with Canada rolling into the model and the other regions now reporting to our Group Presidents, Tim Scannell and David Floyd. Our international growth of roughly 4% in constant currency was once again impacted by soft performances in China and Brazil. However, as you've seen, we have demonstrated the ability to offset isolated geographic softness through strength in our larger markets.
Turning to earnings. Our adjusted EPS for Q4 of $1.56 is at the high-end of our revised range of $1.53 to $1.56 primarily driven by the strong top line. The balance of the P&L came in as expected, which Bill will over in his section. Looking ahead to 2016, we expect our sales momentum to continue and are targeting organic sales growth for the year of 5% to 6%. This takes into account expected softness in emerging markets for a good portion of the year.
In addition, the 2-year suspension of the med device tax provides us with the opportunity to bolster investments that will help drive sales growth and innovation as we plan to invest the majority of this temporary benefit. We are also continuing on our path toward driving greater cost efficiencies, which is a multiyear opportunity. Over the past year, we have been focused on identifying and prioritizing the key target areas for cost reduction within our organization.
As we shifted to 2016, we are moving toward project implementation under the leadership of Group President Lonny Carpenter. We have identified significant areas of savings centered around optimizing our plant network, rationalizing our product lines, professionalizing our indirect procurement in a similar manner as we have done with direct materials, moving to a common ERP system and driving more shared services.
given our history of decentralization, there's considerable opportunity ahead of us in this program. We believe a methodical and deliberate approach to these efforts will allow us to preserve Stryker's competitive differentiation in the areas of sales, marketing, R&D and business development while helping to ensure we are consistently delivering P&L leverage. This is reflected in our 2016 adjusted EPS range of $5.50 to $5.70 a share. This is an increase of approximately 7.5% to 11.5% versus 2015, and it includes a negative foreign exchange impact of $0.12 to $0.13 a share.
Finally, I'd like to take a moment to extend my thanks and appreciation to Bill Jellison, who has announced his plans to retire following an impressive 36 career -- 36-year career, the last 3 of which have been with Stryker. Bill was able to quickly move toward implementing a layered hedging program, which has proven to be successful at mitigating our transactional FX exposure. In addition, he helped execute on a number of acquisitions, facilitated the establishment of our European regional headquarters that's enabled significant savings and has also helped to shape our comprehensive cost reduction program.
These accomplishments have meaningfully contributed to our success and were achieved while enabling our internal talent pools to develop, including Glenn Boehnlein, who has been promoted to CFO effective April 1. Glenn has been with Stryker in various financial leadership roles since 2003, most recently serving as Group CFO for the MedSurg and Neurotechnology group. This group represents roughly half the company and has been a consistent force behind our strong results. I am confident in Glenn's ability in coordination with the broader finance organization to help build on our strong momentum.
Before turning the call over to Katherine, I've asked Glenn to make a few comments. Glenn?"

The focus of my comments today will be to provide an update on MAKO. 2015 was a year of building momentum for MAKO's robotic-assisted surgery as we continue to leverage our considerable sales and marketing infrastructure to help drive sales. We are particularly pleased with the increased demand for the hip indication, which has been augmented by combining the robotic technology with our proven portfolio of Stryker hip systems. The combination enables surgeons to use a best-in-class hip implant with a long-term proven clinical history on a robotic-assisted platform which helps drive consistency, enhance surgeon and patient experience and we believe over time, clinically demonstrated benefits. In total, we sold 31 robots globally in the quarter, 24 of which were in the U.S., which represents a solid ramp from the start of the year and a significant jump year-over-year from 20 in the fourth quarter of 2014. For 2016, we are focused on continuing to drive adoption with our current indications, which we believe offers considerable opportunity to drive ongoing robot placements.
We are also excited about the potential for the Total Knee indication with our flagship Triathlon system. This year, our efforts will be centered around gaining user experience with key opinion leaders to help ensure an optimal rollout as we look to full commercial release in 2017. We believe the commercial launch, which will be aided by podium presentations from the early users group, will be in place as we head into next year.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill."

I'd like to start up by saying I've enjoyed working with Kevin and everyone at Stryker, especially the entire finance organization who have made significant contributions over the last few years helping the company deliver on its financial results. 
[Audio Gap] coming to Stryker with a strong cultural fit and personal fit from the first week that I joined the company.
We ended 2015 at the high-end of both our initial sales and earnings guidance that was set at the beginning of the year. As we look at 2016 and set our initial guidance, I am confident that our sales momentum, strong product portfolio and pipeline and the cost containment initiatives we are driving position us well for the future. I look forward to ensuring a smooth transition with Glenn and entering another stage in my life. I will continue to engage actively in many of my passions, travel with my family and friends and explore additional board opportunities. I want to thank all of you for your support.
So turning to our financial performance. Sales grew 3.7% in the quarter, including a negative 3.2% impact from foreign currency translation. Constant currency sales growth was 7%, which includes organic growth of 6.4%.
GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.38 per share versus $0.68 last year in the fourth quarter, while adjusted earnings per share were $1.56 a share for the quarter versus $1.44 per share in the fourth quarter last year. This quarter's EPS includes negative impacts of roughly $0.04 per share from foreign exchange, which was in line with our guidance.
Most currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar continue to be weaker than last year in the same period. The weaker euro and Swiss franc, along with our layered hedging program, helped to mitigate some of the impact in the quarter as many of our products are manufactured in Europe, which helped improve our gross margin rates in the period. However, significant weakening in foreign currency rates in emerging markets and the continued weakness of the Japanese yen, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, where we have minimal manufacturing, negatively impacted our gross margins and operating results in those regions.
The most significant non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter were amortization, restructuring charges and a net reduction in the charge associated with the voluntary recall of the Rejuvenate, ABG II modular hip stem as we resolved some insurance matters in the quarter, which more than offset the additional charge in the period. As I have mentioned previously, the charges we have recorded related to the Rejuvenate and ABG II recall represents a minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve this manner, and the charges may increase or decrease over time as additional facts become available and our assumptions more refined.
In the fourth quarter, our organic growth rate was 6.4%, including 8.1% growth in unit volumes and mix with price negatively impacting sales by 1.7%. Acquisitions added 0.6%, while FX had a negative 3.2% impact due to significant weakness in both the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar compared to the same period last year. Full year 2015 constant currency sales growth were 7%, and organic growth was 6.1%.
Looking at our segments. Orthopaedics represented 42% of our sales in the quarter, and sales of Orthopaedic products grew 3.3% as reported and 7.1% in constant currency. U.S. Orthopaedic sales grew 9.7% in the quarter. Trauma and Extremities had another excellent quarter in the U.S. with sales increasing 13.6% led by strong growth in Foot & Ankle, which again grew approximately 20% for both the fourth quarter and full year. U.S. Hips and Knees continued their strong performance of 6.4% and 9.1% organic growth, respectively, in the quarter. These sales were bolstered by increased adoption of recent titanium 3D-printed products.
Our International Orthopaedic business grew 2.4% in constant currency as sales growth continued to be negatively impacted by weakness in China and Brazil. However, our International Knee business grew 5.5% in constant currency in the quarter. Finally, we sold 31 MAKO units in the quarter and 72 units in the full year.
Next, our MedSurg segment represented approximately 40% of our total sales, and sales of MedSurg products grew 3% as reported and 5.6% in constant currency. These results were led by growth in our Instruments and Medical business, both of which had strong mid-single-digit percentage growth in constant currency. Endoscopy also posted mid-single-digit percentage growth in constant currency in the period on the back of our new camera offering, which was launched in December. All 3 of these large MedSurg businesses continued to manage pricing decisions effectively with modest price declines of less than 0.5% for the year.
Our final segment, Neurotechnology and Spine, represented 18% of sales and delivered another good quarter. Sales of Neurotechnology and Spine products grew 6.5% as reported and 9.9% in constant currency. Growth in this segment was led by our Neurotechnology business, which had double-digit growth in the high teens in constant currency in the fourth quarter and grew high teens in the U.S. Spine sales had mid-single-digit percentage growth in constant currency in the period and had high single-digit growth in the U.S. This marks our third consecutive quarter of strong growth in U.S. Spine. Spine also has a new 3D-printed interbody device launching in 2016, which we believe will be a very exciting product for the market, helping us to continue this positive trend.
In looking at our operational performance, gross margin as a percent of sales on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter was 67.2% compared to 65.8% in the fourth quarter last year. When compared to the same period last year, the rate was positively impacted by solid operational improvements, product mix and FX rates despite the negative FX impact on earnings per share.
Price had a negative impact as pricing was lower by 1.7% in the period. Our gross margin as a percentage of sales was 66.5% or 50 basis points higher than last year. Research and development expenses increased by 20 basis points to 6% of sales in the fourth quarter compared to 5.8% in the same period last year.
On an adjusted basis, selling, general and administrative expenses represented 33.7% of sales in the fourth quarter compared to 32.4% in the same period last year. As expected, these expenses were higher for the year as we increased spending to support the cost structure of our European regional headquarters in Amsterdam and our Transatlantic Operating Model. We are confident in our ability to leverage these expenses in 2016 as we continue to drive a number of key cost initiatives even as we reinvest some of the savings from the suspension of the medical device tax.
Operating margin as a percentage of sales on an adjusted basis were 27.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 27.6% in the same period last year. The full year adjusted operating margin rate was 24.9%, nearly flat compared to last year. During the year, we invested in our European regional headquarters and the establishment of our Transatlantic Operating Model, which reduced the stronger operating margins for the year.
Other expense in the fourth quarter was $36 million. This increase in expense resulted primarily from higher net interest expense due to increased borrowings and foreign currency exchange transactional losses in the fourth quarter. This is generally consistent with the run rate for this category.
Our reported tax rate for the fourth quarter was 14.7%, while the adjusted effective tax rate was 16.6% for the fourth quarter compared to 22.6% in the same period last year. The fourth quarter effective tax rate benefited from the renewal of the tax extenders, which was contemplated in our guidance. The full year adjusted effective tax rate was 17.3% compared to 22.3% last year as we realized the benefits from our global tax structure and European regional headquarters in Amsterdam.
Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $4.1 billion of cash and marketable securities, approximately 50% of it now held in the U.S. We also had $4 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. From an asset management standpoint, accounts receivable days ended the quarter at 55, relatively unchanged from last year. Days in inventory finished the quarter at 165, which was an increase of 5 days compared to last year.
Turning to cash flow. Our cash flow from operations for 2015 were $900 million compared to $1.8 billion last year. But as previously mentioned, we made significant payments earlier this year associated with our Rejuvenate and ABG II recall settlement of $1.2 billion, most of which occurred in the third quarter. Approximately 50% of the funding of the Rejuvenate liability is being sourced from OUS cash. We also repatriated a total of $1.8 billion in 2015, including approximately $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $270 million in 2015 compared to $233 million last year.
Finally, regarding share repurchases. In 2015, we repurchased approximately $700 million of our common stock or approximately 7.5 million shares at an average price of approximately $94.67. We have authorization for another $1.9 billion available for repurchase under our current authorization.
Based on our strong performance in 2015 and assessment of the current economic and market conditions, we are projecting constant currency and organic sales growth in a range of 5% to 6% for 2016 and expect to be at the low end of that range in the first quarter as we are still anticipating impacts of market conditions in the emerging markets, especially China and Brazil. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate net sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 1% for 2016. We also expect continued unfavorable price reductions of 1.5% to 2% consistent with the pricing environment experienced in 2015.
Due to the suspension of the med tech tax, we will also provide some additional visibility to our projected margin rates for 2016. Both gross margin and operating income margins are projected to be at least 50 basis points higher in 2016 in total. The benefit from the suspension of the med tech tax will directly benefit our gross profit rate. However, R&D will run slightly higher in 2016, and our SG&A rate will only show modest improvement for the full year as we expect to reinvest the majority of the benefit we receive into these areas, offsetting much of our cost reductions in '16.
As such, our gross margin rate improvements will be the driver of our operating margin rate in 2016. We expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate in 2016 will continue to be approximately 17% to 17.5%. Capital expenditures are expected to be $400 million to $450 million in 2016 as we continue to invest in our operations and our IT infrastructure to support future growth.
Based on the current foreign exchange rates, we expect 2016 to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.12 to $0.13 for the full year and approximately $0.03 for the first quarter. This negative impact is largely driven by the translational component of foreign exchange, which we do not hedge. The transactional impact of foreign exchange on earnings is being offset somewhat by both natural and real hedges, which we continue to layer into our operations. Finally, our guidance for adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2016 is $5.50 to $5.70 for the full year and $1.17 to $1.22 for the first quarter.
Thanks for your support, and we'd be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time."

So one, you started to talk about the cost transformation initiatives in greater detail in San Francisco. And in the 2016 guidance, you're basically assuming no SG&A leverage, and that's part of what you're talking about reinvesting back in the business with the benefit of the med tech tax helping the gross margin line. So can you just talk a little bit about where you're going to incrementally invest if that will show up in SG&A or will all show up in R&D? And then second, the acceleration of the share buyback, and acceleration maybe is not the right term, but you bought back more stock than you had been buying back in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about what's in your 2016 guidance for capital deployment?"

We do expect some modest level of improvement still in the broader operating expense category, but the reinvestment is primarily taking place in both areas, probably about maybe 20 basis points or so of an impact on the R&D-related side and the remainder kind of in the SG&A area. I'd say that with the cost initiatives that we've got in place that you would have seen obviously better leverage there. But with the reinvestment, that will slow that down at least this year. But we should still be showing obviously some very, very solid gross margin rate improvement, and we should be getting good drop here still in the operating income line for that. As it relates to the buybacks, yes, we did jump that up to about $700 million in this year. As you can see, our cash has continued to stay very strong. We were able to bring back some additional cash. We have about $2 billion here in the U.S. at this point. And as far as our guidance is concerned, you should expect that -- we commented before that we've got the authorization out there. We expect to complete that over kind of a 2- to 3-year period of time, barring any sizable acquisitions. And hopefully, as Kevin mentioned, acquisitions are absolutely still our first and foremost kind of attention within that space, and we expect to be very active as we move forward, but those are all based on timing situations, right? So -- but that is still our #1 focus."

There's -- we've said before, there's significant opportunities in the hundreds of millions of dollars. And as we get drive those savings, we'll obviously, if there's great opportunities to invest, we'll invest some of those dollars and some of those dollars will fall to the bottom line. So -- but I don't have a magical number, and I think it also depends on as the years progress, what types of deals that we do, how that affects our margin profile.

It's a nice mix of both existing Stryker customers but also new accounts that we're able to get into with the robots. So we're really pleased with the placement as well as having a number of them outside the U.S. I would really just emphasize, 2016 is about really working to make sure we are optimally set up for full commercial launch in '17 for the Total Knee. So we are not expecting any real impact from that this year. We have a lot of work to do to optimize the training protocol. We're going to work with key opinion leaders both on the robotics side as well as KOLs with our Triathlon system to make sure we're meshing those observational studies to really fine-tune the training protocol. We didn't have to  train our own sales force, do the upgrades in the system. So there's a lot of work to be done to make sure when we go into full commercial launch, we are set to really optimize that and have a presence at the podium.

So I would say that all of the divisions have opportunities. There's clearly some areas that we would focus on a little bit more than others. So you've seen our Spine business really start to turn based on focused investments in R&D. We've had 3 great quarters in a row in the U.S. We still have to take a lot of those products outside the U.S. But I would say that would be an area where organic development and spending is really paying off for us, so you could expect more in that area. Sports medicine for us is a business that's growing very fast. It's relatively small within Stryker. That's also an area of interest; Neurotechnology as well as Extremities. I would say I picked those 4 right off the top of my head, but I would tell you, we have a long list. And if my other division presidents are listening on the call, I know that they are preparing ideas for me as well. And we'll obviously look at all the ideas and determine which ones we think can really provide value for us. We're not going to just spend for the sake of spending. In a company as big as Stryker is with the decentralized focus, we're seeing that innovation delivers. And I cited one example of 3D printing where I think we're seeing it have an impact on 2 different divisions of Stryker, our Knee business as well as Spine. And we have a huge lineup of other divisions with ideas and prototypes to get into 3D-printed titanium products. So I would say that those are sort of the top-of-mind areas of focus, but all the divisions are lining up and we'll be very selective as we march through that.

So on MAKO, just a couple of maybe broader questions on how you're positioning the platform. Robotics has been kind of a market development project for a while, oftentimes dealing with surgeons and helping them get more comfortable with this new technology, maybe changing the way surgery is done over the longterm. But at what point does this become, or has it already become, an opportunity to drive better contracting for you across your implant lines, greater share or utilization multiline contracting driven by the merits of the system and the technology? And I have a couple of quick follow-ups."

So look, what I'd tell you the first iterations of the Hip software were a little bit clunky, and it requires quite a bit more registration time to register in the software system. So that's just an extra step that some of the surgeons are a little bit frustrated with. Over time, both prior to our acquisition and subsequent to our acquisition, we've made some enhancements of the software to make it a little bit more user-friendly. That's been one factor for sure. I think the most compelling factor is showing the surgeons on the pre and post x-rays that they put the Hip exactly where they want to put it. And I think even though surgeons that had some hesitations when they see the pre and post x-rays, they are just -- it's a very compelling visual for them to understand. Before they weren't doing that. They weren't able to get that same type of consistency. And that's starting to resonate with a lot of surgeons. And now being able to put our implants in addition with easier-to-use software and to get that kind of outcome, it's like all things have changed, right? Change doesn't occur to everybody at the same time. Some people are early adopters. Some people, frankly, will never adopt. They'll just be set in their airways. But what we're seeing is the middle of the bell curve is starting to shift its mindset. And frankly, the more that robotics is talked about in the community at large, we find that actually a very positive thing because we really believe we have a terrific system, and we're obviously continuing to invest in that system going forward."

The reason I paused is to get into all the technology on 3D-printing would be -- would take a long time. The quick summary is the 3D printing metal is very different than sort of the way you think about 3D printing plastic having it on a desk in an office and cranking up 3D-printed products. So metal is much more complicated. It's explosive. It requires a lot of extra programming. You just don't buy a machine and sort of just off to the races. It's a lot more complicated than that. And so we spent a lot of time. We've been working on this for many, many years. And so we have a lot of know-how on how to program the machines and optimize the machines. And so there's a lot of factors that go into it to be able to create. And different types of machines work better for smaller products than larger products. So it's difficult for me to just summarize in a short time. I'd just say that it's more complicated than plastics or other things that you read about in the mainstream press.

And so we feel we'll be in good shape, and it's not a Big Bang launch. We're going to do division by division, region by region, and there'll be a steady cadence. So even if something does start to wobble a little bit, it should have very, very little impact."

The core growth is our big systems, right, our Triathlon, our Accolade. That's where the core amount of our sales comes from. But this gives a little extra boost to -- and put some little bit of jump in our sales force step, gives them something new to talk to their customer about. So as an example, our revision business lagged, our market share lagged our primary business in Knees by about 5 or 6 market share points. So even in a Stryker friendly account, sometimes they would go to a competitive -- a competitor to do their revision procedure. Now that we have what we consider best-in-class revision cones, not only do we keep that business, that surgeon stays with Stryker, we gain that sales. But they now have something that they can go  talk to a competitive surgeon about.  So I would say it's not a huge contributor, but it's an extra shot in the arm. So with robotics and 3D printing, we believe we have the lead on both of those areas. And those are things we can talk about that differentiate us from our competition. So again, not even today robotics is not a huge component of our growth or our actual dollar sales, but we believe they are the ones that are causing that extra piece of growth and a different view of Stryker for the future. Over time, I expect robotics and 3D printing to take on a more important portion of our overall sales. And they'll be sustainable and sticky if we have something that the competition doesn't have."

We had a really -- our international growth doesn't look fantastic, so you don't see it. But Europe had a mid-single-digit growth year, and it improved progressively from the first quarter to the fourth quarter. So that kind of uptick is frankly ahead of where I'd expected it to be. It's been masked a little bit because of the sluggishness out of China, so that has dampened our international sales. But it's been a really great success. I'm excited about what I'm seeing across our businesses in Europe. Some of the divisions took off faster than others like Trauma and Extremities and Endoscopy took off really quickly. And now I'm starting to see some nice uptake in Instruments and Spine towards the end of the year. So more to come in Europe. We made a number of investments over the course of the year. Those investments are now taking hold. And I think you'll start to see Europe become a division that delivers better top line and starts to deliver some leverage going forward. We've added Canada, so those are now directly managed. A Division President has direct P&L accountability for Canada, the U.S. and Europe. The other regions, we haven't yet folded into the model, but by eliminating the Group President of international role, they -- we now have them reporting directly to our business Group President. So it just increases speed and connectivity from our regions to come straight to a Group President. Over time, we'll see whether those countries will roll into this model, but we don't want to run too fast to fully integrated complete global business units, especially with markets like China that are so different, or Japan. But we're very pleased with the progress so far. Taking out that position was nothing about cost reduction. That was 100% just to increase speed and connectivity of those countries to our businesses."

So on the ERP side of the equation, from an investment perspective, we won't see the first implementations really for about another 1.5 years or so.

As far as the cost side of the equation goes, we would not expect that to be a big blip once we get to kind of the stabilized level that we've got kind of this -- in 2016 year. But moving forward, in fact, if anything, as those systems are implemented, we would expect some of the benefits. Plus with the CTG [ph] initiatives that we've got kicked off, those will continue to roll in at different points throughout different years. We do have multi hundreds of millions of dollars targeted for that. Keep in mind as well that we have price downs in the $150 million to $200 million range that we need to be working to offset. And then, as far as the impacts associated with the investment, again, that should be pretty consistent as we're moving forward beyond 2016."

Joining me today are Bill Jellison, our CFO; Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations; and Glenn Boehnlein, who will be taking over for Bill on",822,"Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Stryker's fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are Bill Jellison, our CFO; Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations; and Glenn Boehnlein, who will be taking over for Bill on April 1. Following my opening comments, Katherine will provide an update on MAKO, while Bill will offer more details on our quarterly results before turning to questions and answers.
With a 6.4% increase in organic sales in Q4, we continue to deliver on our goal of driving top line growth at the high-end of med tech. This marks the 11th consecutive quarter where Stryker delivered 5% or better organic sales growth, demonstrating strong consistency over time. Our diversified sales footprint has once again proven to be a key component of our growth strategy as all of our segments, Orthopaedics, MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Spine, posted good results in the quarter. These performances underscore the strength of our sales and marketing execution and our innovation engine, which is characterized by healthy R&D investments and a focused and disciplined M&A effort.
Approximately 70% of our sales are derived from our U.S. businesses, which once again led growth, posting an impressive gain of approximately 8%. I am also pleased with the growing momentum out of Europe, including strong Q4 results benefiting from the shift to the Transatlantic Operating Model at the beginning of 2015. We are building on this success as we start 2016 with Canada rolling into the model and the other regions now reporting to our Group Presidents, Tim Scannell and David Floyd. Our international growth of roughly 4% in constant currency was once again impacted by soft performances in China and Brazil. However, as you've seen, we have demonstrated the ability to offset isolated geographic softness through strength in our larger markets.
Turning to earnings. Our adjusted EPS for Q4 of $1.56 is at the high-end of our revised range of $1.53 to $1.56 primarily driven by the strong top line. The balance of the P&L came in as expected, which Bill will cover in his section. Looking ahead to 2016, we expect our sales momentum to continue and are targeting organic sales growth for the year of 5% to 6%. This takes into account expected softness in emerging markets for a good portion of the year.
In addition, the 2-year suspension of the med device tax provides us with the opportunity to bolster investments that will help drive sales growth and innovation as we plan to invest the majority of this temporary benefit. We are also continuing on our path toward driving greater cost efficiencies, which is a multiyear opportunity. Over the past year, we have been focused on identifying and prioritizing the key target areas for cost reduction within our organization.
As we shift into 2016, we are moving toward project implementation under the leadership of Group President Lonny Carpenter. We have identified significant areas of savings centered around optimizing our plant network, rationalizing our product lines, professionalizing our indirect procurement in a similar manner as we have done with direct materials, moving to a common ERP system and driving more shared services.
Given our history of decentralization, there's considerable opportunity ahead of us in this program. We believe a methodical and deliberate approach to these efforts will allow us to preserve Stryker's competitive differentiation in the areas of sales, marketing, R&D and business development while helping to ensure we are consistently delivering P&L leverage. This is reflected in our 2016 adjusted EPS range of $5.50 to $5.70 a share. This is an increase of approximately 7.5% to 11.5% versus 2015, and it includes a negative foreign exchange impact of $0.12 to $0.13 a share.
Finally, I'd like to take a moment to extend my thanks and appreciation to Bill Jellison, who has announced his plan to retire following an impressive 36 career -- 36-year career, the last 3 of which have been with Stryker. Bill was able to quickly move toward implementing a layered hedging program, which has proven to be successful at mitigating our transactional FX exposure. In addition, he helped execute on a number of acquisitions, facilitated the establishment of our European regional headquarters that's enabled significant savings and has also helped to shape our comprehensive cost reduction program.
These accomplishments have meaningfully contributed to our success and were achieved while enabling our internal talent pools to develop, including Glenn Boehnlein, who has been promoted to CFO effective April 1. Glenn has been with Stryker in various financial leadership roles since 2003, most recently serving as Group CFO for the MedSurg and Neurotechnology group. This group represents roughly half the company and has been a consistent force behind our strong results. I am confident in Glenn's ability in coordination with the broader finance organization to help build on our strong momentum.
Before turning the call over to Katherine, I've asked Glenn to make a few comments. Glenn?"

The focus of my comments today will be to provide an update on MAKO. 2015 was a year of building momentum for MAKO's robotic-assisted surgery as we continue to leverage our considerable sales and marketing infrastructure to help drive sales. We are particularly pleased with the increased demand for the hip indication, which has been augmented by combining the robotic technology with our proven portfolio of Stryker hip systems. The combination enables surgeons to use a best-in-class hip implant with a long-term proven clinical history on a robotic-assisted platform which helps drive consistency, enhance surgeon and patient experience and, we believe over time, clinically demonstrated benefits. In total, we sold 31 robots globally in the quarter, 24 of which were in the U.S., which represents a solid ramp from the start of the year and a significant jump year-over-year from 20 in the fourth quarter of 2014. For 2016, we are focused on continuing to drive adoption with our current indications, which we believe offer considerable opportunity to drive ongoing robot placements.
We are also excited about the potential for the Total Knee indication with our flagship Triathlon system. This year, our efforts will be centered around gaining user experience with key opinion leaders to help ensure an optimal rollout as we look to full commercial release in 2017. We believe the commercial launch, which will be aided by podium presentations from the early users group, will be in place as we head into next year.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill."

I'd like to start off by saying I've enjoyed working with Kevin and everyone at Stryker, especially the entire finance organization who have made significant contributions over the last few years helping the company deliver on its financial results. 
Coming to Stryker was a strong cultural fit and personal fit from the first week that I joined the company.
We ended 2015 at the high-end of both our initial sales and earnings guidance that was set at the beginning of the year. As we look at 2016 and set our initial guidance, I am confident that our sales momentum, strong product portfolio and pipeline and the cost containment initiatives we are driving position us well for the future. I look forward to ensuring a smooth transition with Glenn and entering another stage in my life. I will continue to engage actively in many of my passions, travel with my family and friends and explore additional board opportunities. I want to thank all of you for your support.
So turning to our financial performance. Sales grew 3.7% in the quarter, including a negative 3.2% impact from foreign currency translation. Constant currency sales growth was 7%, which includes organic growth of 6.4%.
GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.38 per share versus $0.68 last year in the fourth quarter, while adjusted earnings per share were $1.56 a share for the quarter versus $1.44 per share in the fourth quarter last year. This quarter's EPS includes negative impacts of roughly $0.04 per share from foreign exchange, which was in line with our guidance.
Most currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar continued to be weaker than last year in the same period. The weaker euro and Swiss franc, along with our layered hedging program, helped to mitigate some of the impact in the quarter as many of our products are manufactured in Europe, which helped improve our gross margin rates in the period. However, significant weakening in foreign currency rates in emerging markets and the continued weakness of the Japanese yen, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, where we have minimal manufacturing, negatively impacted our gross margins and operating results in those regions.
The most significant non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter were amortization, restructuring charges and a net reduction in the charge associated with the voluntary recall of the Rejuvenate, ABG II modular hip stem as we resolved some insurance matters in the quarter, which more than offset the additional charge in the period. As I have mentioned previously, the charges we have recorded related to the Rejuvenate and ABG II recall represents the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve this manner, and the charges may increase or decrease over time as additional facts become available and our assumptions more refined.
In the fourth quarter, our organic growth rate was 6.4%, including 8.1% growth in unit volumes and mix, with price negatively impacting sales by 1.7%. Acquisitions added 0.6%, while FX had a negative 3.2% impact due to significant weakness in both the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar compared to the same period last year. Full year 2015 constant currency sales growth were 7%, and organic growth was 6.1%.
Looking at our segments. Orthopaedics represented 42% of our sales in the quarter, and sales of Orthopaedic products grew 3.3% as reported and 7.1% in constant currency. U.S. Orthopaedic sales grew 9.7% in the quarter. Trauma and Extremities had another excellent quarter in the U.S. with sales increasing 13.6% led by strong growth in Foot & Ankle, which again grew approximately 20% for both the fourth quarter and full year. U.S. Hips and Knees continued their strong performance of 6.4% and 9.1% organic growth, respectively, in the quarter. These sales were bolstered by increased adoption of recent titanium 3D-printed products.
Our International Orthopaedic business grew 2.4% in constant currency as sales growth continued to be negatively impacted by weakness in China and Brazil. However, our International Knee business grew 5.5% in constant currency in the quarter. Finally, we sold 31 MAKO units in the quarter and 72 units in the full year.
Next, our MedSurg segment represented approximately 40% of our total sales, and sales of MedSurg products grew 3% as reported and 5.6% in constant currency. These results were led by growth in our Instruments and Medical business, both of which had strong mid-single-digit percentage growth in constant currency. Endoscopy also posted mid-single-digit percentage growth in constant currency in the period on the back of our new camera offering, which was launched in December. All 3 of these large MedSurg businesses continued to manage pricing decisions effectively with modest price declines of less than 0.5% for the year.
Our final segment, Neurotechnology and Spine, represented 18% of sales and delivered another good quarter. Sales of Neurotechnology and Spine products grew 6.5% as reported and 9.9% in constant currency. Growth in this segment was led by our Neurotechnology business, which had double-digit growth in the high teens in constant currency in the fourth quarter and grew high teens in the U.S. Spine sales had mid-single-digit percentage growth in constant currency in the period and had high single-digit growth in the U.S. This marks our third consecutive quarter of strong growth in U.S. Spine. Spine also has a new 3D-printed interbody device launching in 2016, which we believe will be a very exciting product for the market, helping us to continue this positive trend.
In looking at our operational performance, gross margin as a percent of sales on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter was 67.2% compared to 65.8% in the fourth quarter last year. When compared to the same period last year, the rate was positively impacted by solid operational improvements, product mix and FX rates despite the negative FX impact on earnings per share.
Price had a negative impact as pricing was lower by 1.7% in the period. Our gross margin as a percentage of sales was 66.5% or 50 basis points higher than last year. Research and development expenses increased by 20 basis points to 6% of sales in the fourth quarter compared to 5.8% in the same period last year.
On an adjusted basis, selling, general and administrative expenses represented 33.7% of sales in the fourth quarter compared to 32.4% in the same period last year. As expected, these expenses were higher for the year as we increased spending to support the cost structure of our European regional headquarters in Amsterdam and our Transatlantic Operating Model. We are confident in our ability to leverage these expenses in 2016 as we continue to drive a number of key cost initiatives even as we reinvest some of the savings from the suspension of the medical device tax.
Operating margin as a percentage of sales on an adjusted basis were 27.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 27.6% in the same period last year. The full year adjusted operating margin rate was 24.9%, nearly flat compared to last year. During the year, we invested in our European regional headquarters and the establishment of our Transatlantic Operating Model, which reduced the stronger operating margins for the year.
Other expense in the fourth quarter was $36 million. This increase in expense resulted primarily from higher net interest expense due to increased borrowings and foreign currency exchange transactional losses in the fourth quarter. This is generally consistent with the run rate for this category.
Our reported tax rate for the fourth quarter was 14.7%, while the adjusted effective tax rate was 16.6% for the fourth quarter compared to 22.6% in the same period last year. The fourth quarter effective tax rate benefited from the renewal of the tax extenders, which was contemplated in our guidance. The full year adjusted effective tax rate was 17.3% compared to 22.3% last year as we realized the benefits from our global tax structure and European regional headquarters in Amsterdam.
Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $4.1 billion of cash and marketable securities, approximately 50% of it now held in the U.S. We also had $4 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. From an asset management standpoint, accounts receivable days ended the quarter at 55, relatively unchanged from last year. Days in inventory finished the quarter at 165, which was an increase of 5 days compared to last year.
Turning to cash flow. Our cash flow from operations for 2015 were $900 million compared to $1.8 billion last year. But as previously mentioned, we made significant payments earlier this year associated with our Rejuvenate and ABG II recall settlement of $1.2 billion, most of which occurred in the third quarter. Approximately 50% of the funding of the Rejuvenate liability is being sourced from OUS cash. We also repatriated a total of $1.8 billion in 2015, including approximately $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $270 million in 2015 compared to $233 million last year.
Finally, regarding share repurchases. In 2015, we repurchased approximately $700 million of our common stock or approximately 7.5 million shares at an average price of approximately $94.67. We have authorization for another $1.9 billion available for repurchase under our current authorization.
Based on our strong performance in 2015 and assessment of the current economic and market conditions, we are projecting constant currency and organic sales growth in a range of 5% to 6% for 2016 and expect to be at the low end of that range in the first quarter as we are still anticipating impacts of market conditions in the emerging markets, especially China and Brazil. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate net sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 1% for 2016. We also expect continued unfavorable price reductions of 1.5% to 2% consistent with the pricing environment experienced in 2015.
Due to the suspension of the med tech tax, we will also provide some additional visibility to our projected margin rates for 2016. Both gross margin and operating income margins are projected to be at least 50 basis points higher in 2016 in total. The benefit from the suspension of the med tech tax will directly benefit our gross profit rate. However, R&D will run slightly higher in 2016, and our SG&A rate will only show modest improvement for the full year as we expect to reinvest the majority of the benefit we receive into these areas, offsetting much of our cost reductions in '16.
As such, our gross margin rate improvements will be the driver of our operating margin rate in 2016. We expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate in 2016 will continue to be approximately 17% to 17.5%. Capital expenditures are expected to be $400 million to $450 million in 2016 as we continue to invest in our operations and our IT infrastructure to support future growth.
Based on the current foreign exchange rates, we expect 2016 to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.12 to $0.13 for the full year and approximately $0.03 for the first quarter. This negative impact is largely driven by the translational component of foreign exchange, which we do not hedge. The transactional impact of foreign exchange on earnings is being offset somewhat by both natural and real hedges, which we continue to layer into our operations. Finally, our guidance for adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2016 is $5.50 to $5.70 for the full year and $1.17 to $1.22 for the first quarter.
Thanks for your support, and we'd be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time."

So there's absolutely 0 change to our operating mode, and I'm expecting a very smooth transition. You can see that we have a whole quarter of overlap, and Bill is still going to be around in this community and available to help us as needed. So I would tell you that you should expect more of the same from Stryker, and this should be a very seamless change."

We do expect some modest level of improvement still in the broader operating expense category, but the reinvestment is primarily taking place in both areas, probably about maybe 20 basis points or so of an impact on the R&D-related side and the remainder kind of in the SG&A area. I'd say that with the cost initiatives that we've got in place that you would have seen obviously better leverage there. But with the reinvestment, that will slow that down at least this year. But we should still be showing obviously some very, very solid gross margin rate improvement, and we should be getting good drops here still in the operating income line for that. As it relates to the buybacks, yes, we did jump that up to about $700 million in this year. As you can see, our cash has continued to stay very strong. We were able to bring back some additional cash. We have about $2 billion here in the U.S. at this point. And as far as our guidance is concerned, you should expect that -- we commented before that we've got the authorization out there. We expect to complete that over kind of a 2- to 3-year period of time, barring any sizable acquisitions. And hopefully, as Kevin mentioned, acquisitions are absolutely still our first and foremost kind of attention within that space, and we expect to be very active as we move forward, but those are all based on timing situations, right?

There's -- we've said before, there's significant opportunities, in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

So we are not expecting any real impact from that this year. We have a lot of work to do to optimize the training protocol. We're going to work with key opinion leaders both on the robotics side as well as KOLs with our Triathlon system to make sure we're meshing those observational studies to really fine-tune the training protocol.

So I would say that all of the divisions have opportunities. There's clearly some areas that we would focus on a little bit more than others. So you've seen our Spine business really start to turn based on focused investments in R&D. We've had 3 great quarters in a row in the U.S. We still have to take a lot of those products outside the U.S. But I would say that would be an area where organic development and spending is really paying off for us, so you can expect more in that area. Sports medicine for us is a business that's growing very fast. It's relatively small within Stryker. That's also an area of interest; Neurotechnology as well as Extremities. I would say -- I picked those 4 right off the top of my head, but I would tell you, we have a long list. And if my other division presidents are listening on the call, I know that they are preparing ideas for me as well. And we'll obviously look at all the ideas and determine which ones we think can really provide value for us. We're not going to just spend for the sake of spending. In a company as big as Stryker is with the decentralized focus, we're seeing that innovation delivers. And I cited one example of 3D printing where I think we're seeing it have an impact on 2 different divisions of Stryker, our Knee business as well as Spine. And we have a huge lineup of other divisions with ideas and prototypes to get into 3D-printed titanium products. So I would say that those are sort of the top-of-mind areas of focus, but all the divisions are lining up and we'll be very selective as we march through that.

Clearly, next year, we're set up for some more impactful products that when you think about MAKO and the Total Knee and expect them to be on a clear trajectory as taking meaningful market share as we work our way through '17. Ischemic is one more of those more transformational opportunities. There's a lot of market development that still needs to take place there around the patient path, referral systems, hospital -- inter-hospital transfers. So we talked about that being a multiyear process, but clearly seeing some very good growth rates but off of a still small base. But I would really think about this year as a typical Stryker story.

So look, what I'd tell you, the first iterations of the Hip software were a little bit clunky, and it requires quite a bit more registration time to register -- get the register in the software system. So that's just an extra step that some of the surgeons are a little bit frustrated with. Over time, both prior to our acquisition and subsequent to our acquisition, we've made some enhancements of the software to make it a little bit more user-friendly. That's been one factor for sure. I think the most compelling factor is showing the surgeons on the pre and post x-rays that they put the Hip exactly where they want to put it. And I think even those surgeons that had some hesitations, when they see the pre and post x-rays, they are just -- it's a very compelling visual for them to understand. Before they weren't doing that. They weren't able to get that same type of consistency. And that's starting to resonate with a lot of surgeons. And now being able to put our implants in addition with easier-to-use software and to get that kind of outcome, it's like all things have changed, right? Change doesn't occur to everybody at the same time. Some people are early adopters. Some people, frankly, will never adopt. They'll just be set in their ways. But what we're seeing is the middle of the bell curve is starting to shift its mindset. And frankly, the more that robotics is talked about in the community at large, we find that actually a very positive thing because we really believe we have a terrific system, and we're obviously continuing to invest in that system going forward."

The reason I pause is to get into all the technology on 3D-printing would be -- would take a long time. The quick summary is that 3D printing metal is very different than sort of the way you think about 3D printing plastic -- having it on a desk in an office and cranking up 3D-printed products. So metal is much more complicated. It's explosive. It requires a lot of extra programming. You just don't buy a machine and sort of just off to the races. It's a lot more complicated than that. And so we spent a lot of time. We've been working on this for many, many years. And so we have a lot of know-how on how to program the machines and optimize the machines. And so there's a lot of factors that go into it to be able to create. And different types of machines work better for smaller products than larger products. So it's difficult for me to just summarize in a short time. I'd just say that it's more complicated than plastics or other things that you read about in the mainstream press.

But clearly, we continue to believe based on everything we've seen that it's going to be postacute care.

We're also going to be doing observational studies with key opinion leaders who have a lot of familiarity with the Triathlon system so we can mesh those 2 data sets and really put us in a position to have a presence at the podiums in 2017, not '16. So we think combining the full commercial launch and being in a position in 2017 for those initial users, those key opinion leaders to talk about their experience and how they were able to optimize both the robot as well as our Triathlon will help drive the adoption. We're going to continue to collect additional clinical data, but that is going to take a number of years. This is really focused around observational studies to help optimize the training protocol."

Certainly, 1488 had terrific resolution, but we've improved the backlighting and some of the image clarity for certain procedures like ENT that -- so our product works well in a wide variety of procedures. But there are certain procedures where the lighting just wasn't quite as optimized. And we made some nice enhancements there, so across the range of procedures, surgeons are all going to have a delightful experience, whereas, in the past, it was not necessarily across every specialty. So that's the first thing. Second thing is we have ICG built into our light source, which we've never had before. So with a press of a button, you can light up the organs, just -- I'm sure you're familiar with ICG with a competitive product out there. But this is not -- doesn't require extra piece of capital. It's built right into the existing light source, easy for the surgeons to use, which is wonderful. It also includes another product for GYN that lights up parts of the anatomy to -- so it's really a safe surgery launch. It enables safe surgery with enhanced visualization. And we just launched it in December, so we don't have a huge amount of sales yet, but I would say the early clinical feedback has been very positive. So I do expect Endoscopy to have a better year in 2016 than they did in 2015."

That sent a terrific signal to the organization of the kind of commitment we're making. It will be a measured launch, so it will take a number of years before complete, and we're starting off with our Instruments division. And we're going to continue -- we have a steady march planned. We have an IT leader who's partnering with a business leader who has a -- was previous -- at a previous large med tech company doing exactly this kind of an implementation over the past few years. So we believe it's all about talent, staffing the right people who know our business. And we're going to do our best, obviously, to mitigate the risk. We had a painful experience in Japan a couple of years ago. I can tell you the approach of this project is radically different to the approach we used in that project. And so we feel we'll be in good shape, and it's not a Big Bang launch. We're going to do division by division, region by region, and there'll be a steady cadence. So even if something does start to wobble a little bit, it should have very, very little impact."

The core growth is our big systems, right, our Triathlon, our Accolade. That's where the core amount of our sales comes from. But this gives a little extra boost to -- and puts a little bit of jump in our sales force step, gives them something new to talk to their customer about. So as an example, our revision business lagged, our market share lagged our primary business in Knees by about 5 or 6 market share points. So even in a Stryker-friendly account, sometimes they would go to a competitive -- a competitor to do their revision procedure. Now that we have what we consider best-in-class revision cones, not only do we keep that business, that surgeon stays with Stryker, we gain that sales. But they now have something that they can go talk to a competitive surgeon about.  So I would say it's not a huge contributor, but it's an extra shot in the arm. So with robotics and 3D printing, we believe we have the lead on both of those areas. And those are things we can talk about that differentiate us from our competition. So again, not even today robotics -- is not a huge component of our growth or our actual dollar sales, but we believe they are the ones that are causing that extra piece of growth and a different view of Stryker for the future. Over time, I expect robotics and 3D printing to take on a more important portion of our overall sales. And they'll be sustainable and sticky if we have something that the competition doesn't have."

We had a really -- our international growth doesn't look fantastic, so you don't see it. But Europe had a mid-single-digit growth year, and it improved progressively from the first quarter to the fourth quarter. So that kind of uptick is frankly ahead of where I'd expected it to be. It's been masked a little bit because of the sluggishness out of China, so that has dampened our international sales. But it's been a really great success. I'm excited about what I'm seeing across our businesses in Europe. Some of the divisions took off faster than others, like Trauma and Extremities and Endoscopy took off really quickly. And now I'm starting to see some nice uptake in Instruments and Spine towards the end of the year. So more to come in Europe. We made a number of investments over the course of the year. Those investments are now taking hold. And I think you'll start to see Europe become a division that delivers better top line and starts to deliver some leverage going forward. We've added Canada, so those are now directly managed. A Division President has direct P&L accountability for Canada, the U.S. and Europe. The other regions we haven't yet folded into the model, but by eliminating the Group President of international role, they -- we now have them reporting directly to our business Group President. So it just increases speed and connectivity from our regions to come straight to a Group President. Over time, we'll see whether those countries will roll into this model, but we don't want to run too fast to fully integrated complete global business units, especially with markets like China that are so different, or Japan. But we're very pleased with the progress so far. Taking out that position was nothing about cost reduction. That was 100% just to increase speed and connectivity of those countries to our businesses."

Europe really picked up quickly. So as you move to a transatlantic model, I was very encouraged by our Trauma success in Europe. We have not been nearly as successful in Europe as we have been in the United States. And we do now have the same products which are all approved. So I think -- I expect more commercial success in Europe as well as Japan. Now some of those products take a little longer to get approved in Japan. So I think that once those products start to arrive we'll start to see more of an uptake in Japan as well. But I would say we're in a very good position in that business.

But moving forward, in fact, if anything, as those systems are implemented, we would expect some of the benefits. Plus with the CTG initiative that we've got kicked off, those will continue to roll in at different points throughout different years. We do have multi hundreds of millions of dollars targeted for that. Keep in mind as well that we have price downs in the $150 million to $200 million range that we need to be working to offset.

Joining me today are Bill Jellison, our CFO; Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations; and Glenn Boehnlein, who will be taking over for Bill on",822,"Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Stryker's fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are Bill Jellison, our CFO; Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations; and Glenn Boehnlein, who will be taking over for Bill on April 1. Following my opening comments, Katherine will provide an update on MAKO, while Bill will offer more details on our quarterly results before turning to questions and answers.
With a 6.4% increase in organic sales in Q4, we continue to deliver on our goal of driving top line growth at the high-end of med tech. This marks the 11th consecutive quarter where Stryker delivered 5% or better organic sales growth, demonstrating strong consistency over time. Our diversified sales footprint has once again proven to be a key component of our growth strategy as all of our segments, Orthopaedics, MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Spine, posted good results in the quarter. These performances underscore the strength of our sales and marketing execution and our innovation engine, which is characterized by healthy R&D investments and a focused and disciplined M&A effort.
Approximately 70% of our sales are derived from our U.S. businesses, which once again led growth, posting an impressive gain of approximately 8%. I am also pleased with the growing momentum out of Europe, including strong Q4 results benefiting from the shift to the Transatlantic Operating Model at the beginning of 2015. We are building on this success as we start 2016 with Canada rolling into the model and the other regions now reporting to our Group Presidents, Tim Scannell and David Floyd. Our international growth of roughly 4% in constant currency was once again impacted by soft performances in China and Brazil. However, as you've seen, we have demonstrated the ability to offset isolated geographic softness through strength in our larger markets.
Turning to earnings. Our adjusted EPS for Q4 of $1.56 is at the high-end of our revised range of $1.53 to $1.56 primarily driven by the strong top line. The balance of the P&L came in as expected, which Bill will cover in his section. Looking ahead to 2016, we expect our sales momentum to continue and are targeting organic sales growth for the year of 5% to 6%. This takes into account expected softness in emerging markets for a good portion of the year.
In addition, the 2-year suspension of the med device tax provides us with the opportunity to bolster investments that will help drive sales growth and innovation as we plan to invest the majority of this temporary benefit. We are also continuing on our path toward driving greater cost efficiencies, which is a multiyear opportunity. Over the past year, we have been focused on identifying and prioritizing the key target areas for cost reduction within our organization.
As we shift into 2016, we are moving toward project implementation under the leadership of Group President Lonny Carpenter. We have identified significant areas of savings centered around optimizing our plant network, rationalizing our product lines, professionalizing our indirect procurement in a similar manner as we have done with direct materials, moving to a common ERP system and driving more shared services.
Given our history of decentralization, there's considerable opportunity ahead of us in this program. We believe a methodical and deliberate approach to these efforts will allow us to preserve Stryker's competitive differentiation in the areas of sales, marketing, R&D and business development while helping to ensure we are consistently delivering P&L leverage. This is reflected in our 2016 adjusted EPS range of $5.50 to $5.70 a share. This is an increase of approximately 7.5% to 11.5% versus 2015, and it includes a negative foreign exchange impact of $0.12 to $0.13 a share.
Finally, I'd like to take a moment to extend my thanks and appreciation to Bill Jellison, who has announced his plan to retire following an impressive 36 career -- 36-year career, the last 3 of which have been with Stryker. Bill was able to quickly move toward implementing a layered hedging program, which has proven to be successful at mitigating our transactional FX exposure. In addition, he helped execute on a number of acquisitions, facilitated the establishment of our European regional headquarters that's enabled significant savings and has also helped to shape our comprehensive cost reduction program.
These accomplishments have meaningfully contributed to our success and were achieved while enabling our internal talent pools to develop, including Glenn Boehnlein, who has been promoted to CFO effective April 1. Glenn has been with Stryker in various financial leadership roles since 2003, most recently serving as Group CFO for the MedSurg and Neurotechnology group. This group represents roughly half the company and has been a consistent force behind our strong results. I am confident in Glenn's ability in coordination with the broader finance organization to help build on our strong momentum.
Before turning the call over to Katherine, I've asked Glenn to make a few comments. Glenn?"

The focus of my comments today will be to provide an update on MAKO. 2015 was a year of building momentum for MAKO's robotic-assisted surgery as we continue to leverage our considerable sales and marketing infrastructure to help drive sales. We are particularly pleased with the increased demand for the hip indication, which has been augmented by combining the robotic technology with our proven portfolio of Stryker hip systems. The combination enables surgeons to use a best-in-class hip implant with a long-term proven clinical history on a robotic-assisted platform which helps drive consistency, enhance surgeon and patient experience and, we believe over time, clinically demonstrated benefits. In total, we sold 31 robots globally in the quarter, 24 of which were in the U.S., which represents a solid ramp from the start of the year and a significant jump year-over-year from 20 in the fourth quarter of 2014. For 2016, we are focused on continuing to drive adoption with our current indications, which we believe offer considerable opportunity to drive ongoing robot placements.
We are also excited about the potential for the Total Knee indication with our flagship Triathlon system. This year, our efforts will be centered around gaining user experience with key opinion leaders to help ensure an optimal rollout as we look to full commercial release in 2017. We believe the commercial launch, which will be aided by podium presentations from the early users group, will be in place as we head into next year.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill."

I'd like to start off by saying I've enjoyed working with Kevin and everyone at Stryker, especially the entire finance organization who have made significant contributions over the last few years helping the company deliver on its financial results. 
Coming to Stryker was a strong cultural fit and personal fit from the first week that I joined the company.
We ended 2015 at the high-end of both our initial sales and earnings guidance that was set at the beginning of the year. As we look at 2016 and set our initial guidance, I am confident that our sales momentum, strong product portfolio and pipeline and the cost containment initiatives we are driving position us well for the future. I look forward to ensuring a smooth transition with Glenn and entering another stage in my life. I will continue to engage actively in many of my passions, travel with my family and friends and explore additional board opportunities. I want to thank all of you for your support.
So turning to our financial performance. Sales grew 3.7% in the quarter, including a negative 3.2% impact from foreign currency translation. Constant currency sales growth was 7%, which includes organic growth of 6.4%.
GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.38 per share versus $0.68 last year in the fourth quarter, while adjusted earnings per share were $1.56 a share for the quarter versus $1.44 per share in the fourth quarter last year. This quarter's EPS includes negative impacts of roughly $0.04 per share from foreign exchange, which was in line with our guidance.
Most currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar continued to be weaker than last year in the same period. The weaker euro and Swiss franc, along with our layered hedging program, helped to mitigate some of the impact in the quarter as many of our products are manufactured in Europe, which helped improve our gross margin rates in the period. However, significant weakening in foreign currency rates in emerging markets and the continued weakness of the Japanese yen, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, where we have minimal manufacturing, negatively impacted our gross margins and operating results in those regions.
The most significant non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter were amortization, restructuring charges and a net reduction in the charge associated with the voluntary recall of the Rejuvenate, ABG II modular hip stem as we resolved some insurance matters in the quarter, which more than offset the additional charge in the period. As I have mentioned previously, the charges we have recorded related to the Rejuvenate and ABG II recall represents the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve this manner, and the charges may increase or decrease over time as additional facts become available and our assumptions more refined.
In the fourth quarter, our organic growth rate was 6.4%, including 8.1% growth in unit volumes and mix, with price negatively impacting sales by 1.7%. Acquisitions added 0.6%, while FX had a negative 3.2% impact due to significant weakness in both the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar compared to the same period last year. Full year 2015 constant currency sales growth were 7%, and organic growth was 6.1%.
Looking at our segments. Orthopaedics represented 42% of our sales in the quarter, and sales of Orthopaedic products grew 3.3% as reported and 7.1% in constant currency. U.S. Orthopaedic sales grew 9.7% in the quarter. Trauma and Extremities had another excellent quarter in the U.S. with sales increasing 13.6% led by strong growth in Foot & Ankle, which again grew approximately 20% for both the fourth quarter and full year. U.S. Hips and Knees continued their strong performance of 6.4% and 9.1% organic growth, respectively, in the quarter. These sales were bolstered by increased adoption of recent titanium 3D-printed products.
Our International Orthopaedic business grew 2.4% in constant currency as sales growth continued to be negatively impacted by weakness in China and Brazil. However, our International Knee business grew 5.5% in constant currency in the quarter. Finally, we sold 31 MAKO units in the quarter and 72 units in the full year.
Next, our MedSurg segment represented approximately 40% of our total sales, and sales of MedSurg products grew 3% as reported and 5.6% in constant currency. These results were led by growth in our Instruments and Medical business, both of which had strong mid-single-digit percentage growth in constant currency. Endoscopy also posted mid-single-digit percentage growth in constant currency in the period on the back of our new camera offering, which was launched in December. All 3 of these large MedSurg businesses continued to manage pricing decisions effectively with modest price declines of less than 0.5% for the year.
Our final segment, Neurotechnology and Spine, represented 18% of sales and delivered another good quarter. Sales of Neurotechnology and Spine products grew 6.5% as reported and 9.9% in constant currency. Growth in this segment was led by our Neurotechnology business, which had double-digit growth in the high teens in constant currency in the fourth quarter and grew high teens in the U.S. Spine sales had mid-single-digit percentage growth in constant currency in the period and had high single-digit growth in the U.S. This marks our third consecutive quarter of strong growth in U.S. Spine. Spine also has a new 3D-printed interbody device launching in 2016, which we believe will be a very exciting product for the market, helping us to continue this positive trend.
In looking at our operational performance, gross margin as a percent of sales on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter was 67.2% compared to 65.8% in the fourth quarter last year. When compared to the same period last year, the rate was positively impacted by solid operational improvements, product mix and FX rates despite the negative FX impact on earnings per share.
Price had a negative impact as pricing was lower by 1.7% in the period. Our gross margin as a percentage of sales was 66.5% or 50 basis points higher than last year. Research and development expenses increased by 20 basis points to 6% of sales in the fourth quarter compared to 5.8% in the same period last year.
On an adjusted basis, selling, general and administrative expenses represented 33.7% of sales in the fourth quarter compared to 32.4% in the same period last year. As expected, these expenses were higher for the year as we increased spending to support the cost structure of our European regional headquarters in Amsterdam and our Transatlantic Operating Model. We are confident in our ability to leverage these expenses in 2016 as we continue to drive a number of key cost initiatives even as we reinvest some of the savings from the suspension of the medical device tax.
Operating margin as a percentage of sales on an adjusted basis were 27.4% in the fourth quarter compared to 27.6% in the same period last year. The full year adjusted operating margin rate was 24.9%, nearly flat compared to last year. During the year, we invested in our European regional headquarters and the establishment of our Transatlantic Operating Model, which reduced the stronger operating margins for the year.
Other expense in the fourth quarter was $36 million. This increase in expense resulted primarily from higher net interest expense due to increased borrowings and foreign currency exchange transactional losses in the fourth quarter. This is generally consistent with the run rate for this category.
Our reported tax rate for the fourth quarter was 14.7%, while the adjusted effective tax rate was 16.6% for the fourth quarter compared to 22.6% in the same period last year. The fourth quarter effective tax rate benefited from the renewal of the tax extenders, which was contemplated in our guidance. The full year adjusted effective tax rate was 17.3% compared to 22.3% last year as we realized the benefits from our global tax structure and European regional headquarters in Amsterdam.
Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $4.1 billion of cash and marketable securities, approximately 50% of it now held in the U.S. We also had $4 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. From an asset management standpoint, accounts receivable days ended the quarter at 55, relatively unchanged from last year. Days in inventory finished the quarter at 165, which was an increase of 5 days compared to last year.
Turning to cash flow. Our cash flow from operations for 2015 were $900 million compared to $1.8 billion last year. But as previously mentioned, we made significant payments earlier this year associated with our Rejuvenate and ABG II recall settlement of $1.2 billion, most of which occurred in the third quarter. Approximately 50% of the funding of the Rejuvenate liability is being sourced from OUS cash. We also repatriated a total of $1.8 billion in 2015, including approximately $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $270 million in 2015 compared to $233 million last year.
Finally, regarding share repurchases. In 2015, we repurchased approximately $700 million of our common stock or approximately 7.5 million shares at an average price of approximately $94.67. We have authorization for another $1.9 billion available for repurchase under our current authorization.
Based on our strong performance in 2015 and assessment of the current economic and market conditions, we are projecting constant currency and organic sales growth in a range of 5% to 6% for 2016 and expect to be at the low end of that range in the first quarter as we are still anticipating impacts of market conditions in the emerging markets, especially China and Brazil. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate net sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 1% for 2016. We also expect continued unfavorable price reductions of 1.5% to 2% consistent with the pricing environment experienced in 2015.
Due to the suspension of the med tech tax, we will also provide some additional visibility to our projected margin rates for 2016. Both gross margin and operating income margins are projected to be at least 50 basis points higher in 2016 in total. The benefit from the suspension of the med tech tax will directly benefit our gross profit rate. However, R&D will run slightly higher in 2016, and our SG&A rate will only show modest improvement for the full year as we expect to reinvest the majority of the benefit we receive into these areas, offsetting much of our cost reductions in '16.
As such, our gross margin rate improvements will be the driver of our operating margin rate in 2016. We expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate in 2016 will continue to be approximately 17% to 17.5%. Capital expenditures are expected to be $400 million to $450 million in 2016 as we continue to invest in our operations and our IT infrastructure to support future growth.
Based on the current foreign exchange rates, we expect 2016 to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.12 to $0.13 for the full year and approximately $0.03 for the first quarter. This negative impact is largely driven by the translational component of foreign exchange, which we do not hedge. The transactional impact of foreign exchange on earnings is being offset somewhat by both natural and real hedges, which we continue to layer into our operations. Finally, our guidance for adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2016 is $5.50 to $5.70 for the full year and $1.17 to $1.22 for the first quarter.
Thanks for your support, and we'd be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time."

We do expect some modest level of improvement still in the broader operating expense category, but the reinvestment is primarily taking place in both areas, probably about maybe 20 basis points or so of an impact on the R&D-related side and the remainder kind of in the SG&A area. I'd say that with the cost initiatives that we've got in place that you would have seen obviously better leverage there. But with the reinvestment, that will slow that down at least this year. But we should still be showing obviously some very, very solid gross margin rate improvement, and we should be getting good drops here still in the operating income line for that. As it relates to the buybacks, yes, we did jump that up to about $700 million in this year. As you can see, our cash has continued to stay very strong. We were able to bring back some additional cash. We have about $2 billion here in the U.S. at this point. And as far as our guidance is concerned, you should expect that -- we commented before that we've got the authorization out there. We expect to complete that over kind of a 2- to 3-year period of time, barring any sizable acquisitions. And hopefully, as Kevin mentioned, acquisitions are absolutely still our first and foremost kind of attention within that space, and we expect to be very active as we move forward, but those are all based on timing situations, right?

There's -- we've said before, there's significant opportunities, in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

We're going to work with key opinion leaders both on the robotics side as well as KOLs with our Triathlon system to make sure we're meshing those observational studies to really fine-tune the training protocol.

So all of the products we've launched thus far that are 3D-printed are all innovative new products. In the case of the spine product and the cementless product, it allows for bony in growth because they're porous materials and getting very good feedback from our customers. For the foreseeable future, at least the next 3, 4 years or so, our focus is really on innovative new products and not replacing our existing products with 3D-printed products. The pipeline of innovative new geometries that can't be made without 3D printing is the area of focus. So it's not about trying to replace our products and drive down costs. Over time, 10 years from now, that could be the case. But in the near to mid-term, it's really focused on innovative new products."

Ischemic is one more of those more transformational opportunities. There's a lot of market development that still needs to take place there around the patient path, referral systems, hospital -- inter-hospital transfers. So we talked about that being a multiyear process, but clearly seeing some very good growth rates but off of a still small base. But I would really think about this year as a typical Stryker story.

So look, what I'd tell you, the first iterations of the Hip software were a little bit clunky, and it requires quite a bit more registration time to register -- get the register in the software system. So that's just an extra step that some of the surgeons are a little bit frustrated with. Over time, both prior to our acquisition and subsequent to our acquisition, we've made some enhancements of the software to make it a little bit more user-friendly. That's been one factor for sure. I think the most compelling factor is showing the surgeons on the pre and post x-rays that they put the Hip exactly where they want to put it. And I think even those surgeons that had some hesitations, when they see the pre and post x-rays, they are just -- it's a very compelling visual for them to understand. Before they weren't doing that. They weren't able to get that same type of consistency. And that's starting to resonate with a lot of surgeons. And now being able to put our implants in addition with easier-to-use software and to get that kind of outcome, it's like all things have changed, right? Change doesn't occur to everybody at the same time. Some people are early adopters. Some people, frankly, will never adopt. They'll just be set in their ways. But what we're seeing is the middle of the bell curve is starting to shift its mindset. And frankly, the more that robotics is talked about in the community at large, we find that actually a very positive thing because we really believe we have a terrific system, and we're obviously continuing to invest in that system going forward."

The quick summary is that 3D printing metal is very different than sort of the way you think about 3D printing plastic -- having it on a desk in an office and cranking up 3D-printed products. So metal is much more complicated. It's explosive. It requires a lot of extra programming. You just don't buy a machine and sort of just off to the races. It's a lot more complicated than that. And so we spent a lot of time. We've been working on this for many, many years. And so we have a lot of know-how on how to program the machines and optimize the machines. And so there's a lot of factors that go into it to be able to create. And different types of machines work better for smaller products than larger products. So it's difficult for me to just summarize in a short time. I'd just say that it's more complicated than plastics or other things that you read about in the mainstream press.

There is absolutely no change in the statement I made before. I still intend to put the balance sheet to work. The reason we got the extra share buyback approval level was just in case deals don't get over the line or drag on for extended periods of time, we would start to step up the buybacks. But you should expect us to continue to be a very active acquirer. But you've seen in the past, right, sometimes, some years, there's 1 or 2 deals and other years you see many more deals. So our level of activity hasn't changed. I still see many exciting prospects out there. And so we're staying the course with the existing strategy."

But there are certain procedures where the lighting just wasn't quite as optimized. And we made some nice enhancements there, so across the range of procedures, surgeons are all going to have a delightful experience, whereas, in the past, it was not necessarily across every specialty. So that's the first thing. Second thing is we have ICG built into our light source, which we've never had before. So with a press of a button, you can light up the organs, just -- I'm sure you're familiar with ICG with a competitive product out there. But this is not -- doesn't require extra piece of capital. It's built right into the existing light source, easy for the surgeons to use, which is wonderful. It also includes another product for GYN that lights up parts of the anatomy to -- so it's really a safe surgery launch. It enables safe surgery with enhanced visualization. And we just launched it in December, so we don't have a huge amount of sales yet, but I would say the early clinical feedback has been very positive. So I do expect Endoscopy to have a better year in 2016 than they did in 2015."

That sent a terrific signal to the organization of the kind of commitment we're making. It will be a measured launch, so it will take a number of years before complete, and we're starting off with our Instruments division. And we're going to continue -- we have a steady march planned. We have an IT leader who's partnering with a business leader who has a -- was previous -- at a previous large med tech company doing exactly this kind of an implementation over the past few years. So we believe it's all about talent, staffing the right people who know our business. And we're going to do our best, obviously, to mitigate the risk. We had a painful experience in Japan a couple of years ago. I can tell you the approach of this project is radically different to the approach we used in that project. And so we feel we'll be in good shape, and it's not a Big Bang launch. We're going to do division by division, region by region, and there'll be a steady cadence.

The core growth is our big systems, right, our Triathlon, our Accolade. That's where the core amount of our sales comes from. But this gives a little extra boost to -- and puts a little bit of jump in our sales force step, gives them something new to talk to their customer about. So as an example, our revision business lagged, our market share lagged our primary business in Knees by about 5 or 6 market share points. So even in a Stryker-friendly account, sometimes they would go to a competitive -- a competitor to do their revision procedure. Now that we have what we consider best-in-class revision cones, not only do we keep that business, that surgeon stays with Stryker, we gain that sales. But they now have something that they can go talk to a competitive surgeon about.  So I would say it's not a huge contributor, but it's an extra shot in the arm. So with robotics and 3D printing, we believe we have the lead on both of those areas. And those are things we can talk about that differentiate us from our competition. So again, not even today robotics -- is not a huge component of our growth or our actual dollar sales, but we believe they are the ones that are causing that extra piece of growth and a different view of Stryker for the future. Over time, I expect robotics and 3D printing to take on a more important portion of our overall sales. And they'll be sustainable and sticky if we have something that the competition doesn't have."

We had a really -- our international growth doesn't look fantastic, so you don't see it. But Europe had a mid-single-digit growth year, and it improved progressively from the first quarter to the fourth quarter. So that kind of uptick is frankly ahead of where I'd expected it to be. It's been masked a little bit because of the sluggishness out of China, so that has dampened our international sales. But it's been a really great success. I'm excited about what I'm seeing across our businesses in Europe. Some of the divisions took off faster than others, like Trauma and Extremities and Endoscopy took off really quickly. And now I'm starting to see some nice uptake in Instruments and Spine towards the end of the year. So more to come in Europe. We made a number of investments over the course of the year. Those investments are now taking hold. And I think you'll start to see Europe become a division that delivers better top line and starts to deliver some leverage going forward. We've added Canada, so those are now directly managed. A Division President has direct P&L accountability for Canada, the U.S. and Europe. The other regions we haven't yet folded into the model, but by eliminating the Group President of international role, they -- we now have them reporting directly to our business Group President. So it just increases speed and connectivity from our regions to come straight to a Group President. Over time, we'll see whether those countries will roll into this model, but we don't want to run too fast to fully integrated complete global business units, especially with markets like China that are so different, or Japan. But we're very pleased with the progress so far. Taking out that position was nothing about cost reduction.

Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, who assumed the role of CFO, effective April 1; and Katherine Owen, the VP of Strategy and Investor Relations. 
For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by an M&A update from Katherine. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A.
We are pleased with our start to the year, as Q1 organic sales growth of 6.1% came in above our expectations, with strong performances across all 3 segments: Orthopaedics, MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Spine. The performance was led by continued new product introductions and strong sales and marketing execution. 
Geographically, Q1 was powered by ongoing momentum in the U.S., with sales growth of 8.9%. As expected, growth was challenged outside the U.S., given the tough year-over-year comparisons in emerging markets, where growth started to slow in the second quarter of last year. Challenges still exist in emerging markets, although the year-over-year impact should ease in the back half of the year.
We continued to have good performance in Europe, Japan and Australia. Our strategy of business unit specialization with dedicated sales forces, marketing and R&D continued to be a differentiating factor in the sustainability of our above-market growth.
Consistent R&D investment has generated strong internal product pipelines across the company, and we continue to augment them with acquisitions. We are thrilled to welcome Sage, Physio-Control and Synergistics to Stryker and believe that the addition of these companies will further strengthen our businesses. 
Looking at the P&L, we are building on 2015's success and delivered solid adjusted earnings growth of 11.7%, despite modest foreign currency headwinds.
This improvement stemmed from the strong top line and year-over-year gross margin expansion. Importantly, we continued to invest heavily in R&D in both absolute dollars and as a percent of sales. Our cost transformation for growth efforts are in the early stages of and are multi-year in nature, and we are starting to realize benefits. 
Overall, we are confident in our stated goal of achieving sales at the high end of medtech, with ongoing earnings leverage, and believe our Q1 results position us well for 2016.

My comments today will focus on providing an update on MAKO, along with the 2 larger M&A deals we recently closed on: Sage and Physio-Control. 
With respect to MAKO, we sold 7 robots during the quarter globally, which is in line with the same period a year ago. As many of you know, capital sales tend to be the strongest in the fourth quarter and also can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. We are highly encouraged by order trends, which reinforces the growing interest in demand for the MAKO robotic system, fueled by the expanded indication and planned launch of the Total Knee system, where we continue to target full commercial rollout in 2017. There is no change to our launch plan for the Total Knee, which will focus throughout 2016 on working with key opinion leaders to optimize the training protocol and gather observational data that will help to frame the anticipated benefits, all of which will ensure a strong podium presence at key orthopaedic meetings and so we move throughout 2017. 
In Q1, we were also encouraged by the robust procedure growth in both partial knees and hips using MAKO.
Turning to the recent M&A activity. In early April, we closed on both Sage and Physio-Control, which will be integrated into our Medical division. Starting with Sage, our focus will be to ensure the continuation of strong double-digit top line growth that the company has had a long history of achieving. With their market-leading product portfolio focused on clinically supported innovation, product ease-of-use and strong sales support, we believe Sage can continue to drive both market expansion and share gains in the prevention of hospital acquired conditions. Given our existing global footprint, which includes strong and broad sales and marketing support, we believe that, over time, Stryker and can drive adoption of the Sage portfolio outside the U.S., where revenue today is limited as the company had historically focused its investments in the U.S. market. 
Regarding Physio-Control, we believe we have significant opportunities over time to drive both sales and earnings synergies, given our combined presence in the prehospital setting. In the near term, both businesses will operate largely independently, with a focus on their respective 2016 targets and planned key new product launches.
Importantly, for both Sage and Physio-Control, we have identified and put in place a highly experienced integration team, which, given our BD history, should help ensure a smooth integration. 
As we move through the first 12 months postclosing of both Sage and Physio-Control, we will provide you with the pro forma quarterly growth rates for each to help provide visibility regarding our execution and of their top line contribution. There is no change to our previously announced expected accretion from both these transactions to adjusted EPS in 2016 and 2017 of $0.07 and $0.15 and $0.18, respectively. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn."

My comments on today's will focus on the financial results and key drivers of our first quarter performance. 
Our detailed financial results have been provided in various schedules included in today's press release. As to our overall performance, our constant currency organic sales growth of 6.1% exceeded the high end of our full year expectations and came in better than our expectations at the start of the quarter. The growth, based on the same number of selling days, reflected strong U.S. volume and mix of 10.2%, marginally offset pricing, which was slightly negative at 1.3%.
Adjusted EPS of $1.24 increased 11.7% from 2015, primarily driven by our strong top line growth and favorable margin performance. Foreign exchange unfavorably impacted EPS by $0.02 per share, roughly in line with our guidance.
Looking at our segment highlights. Orthopaedics constant currency growth was 4.6%, which was led by U.S. Orthopaedics growth of 7.9%, reflecting continued, strong sales in our Trauma and Extremity business, which grew 11%; and a 9% increase in Knees, reflecting continued momentum from our last quarter and the successful of our Triathlon products, driven by our titanium revision [indiscernible], our cementless knee product as well as new customer adoption of our MAKO uni platform.
We are now seeing an acceleration of our revision in planned sales, where previously our market share lagged our overall Total Knee share. Partially offsetting the strong U is orthopaedic performance was the continued challenging markets in China and Brazil, which contributed to the negative 1.4% constant currency decline in international. 
Overall, our first quarter results continue to reflect strong momentum across our Orthopaedics portfolio. 
Our MedSurg segment, with constant currency growth of 4.6%, also demonstrated strong momentum with U.S. growth of 7.6%. Instruments had solid U.S. growth of 10.2%, with good performance in their waste management products. 
Endoscopy's new 1588 camera, which features enhanced visualization that broadens the applicable surge applications, was a primary driver for the division's solid performance and will continue to be a growth engine in 2016. 
Lastly, Medical's growth, which was up against a tough year-over-year comparable, benefited from strong demand for its market-leading structure and ambulance Scott [ph] products, which underscore the strength of its portfolio and the overall health and stability of hospital capital budgets that we're seeing in the market. 
As with Orthopaedics, MedSurg also experienced challenges in emerging markets, primarily China. We expect this to continue as we work through our distributors to drive demand and reduce the buildup of their inventories, recognizing comparisons will also ease as we move through 2016.
All in all, our MedSurg businesses saw healthy order growth in the first quarter and should be well positioned to continue their momentum. 
Turning to Neurotechnology and Spine. The impressive year-end momentum achieved by this group continued in the first quarter with 13.1% constant currency growth. Neurotechnology's 21% growth was highlighted by the developing market for device-based treatment of ischemic stroke. While there's still considerable market develop and require, we are highly encouraged by the potential for this segment and our 3 [indiscernible] retriever technology. As one of 2 majors retrievers on the market, combined with compelling clinical data underscoring the efficacy of these devices, such as the MR CLEAN study, Stryker's well positioned for growth in Neurovascular. 
We also continue to see excellent performance in our Neuro Powered Instruments business, led by strong growth in their signature drill products released last year. 
We also are encouraged by the solid showing of Spine, up 5.8% in the U.S., as new product launches, included and limiting launch of our 3 D-printed interbody device, are clearly having an impact. Neurotechnology and Spine continue to benefit from a new product pipeline resulting from robust R&D investment over the past few years. 
I will now focus on our first quarter operating highlights, starting with gross margin, which, on an adjusted basis, increased 240 basis points to 68%. Of this improvement, roughly 1/4 relates to the 2-year suspension of the Medical Device Tax, while the remainder reflects a favorable mix and favorable foreign exchange, partly offset by negative pricing. 
As for operating expenses, we continue to focus on 
internal innovation with R&D at 6.4% of sales, which is in line with our overall target spend. On an adjusted basis, SG&A increased to 37.4% of sales versus 35.9% in the prior period, which was driven by increased selling activity, anticipated spending related to our new ERP deployment efforts and reinvestment in the Medical Device Tax. 
Looking ahead, we expect SG&A on a full year basis to be comparable to 2015. Overall, our operating margin increased 90 basis points, reflecting solid top line growth and favorable mix and gross margins, offset slightly by higher SG&A for the quarter.
Lastly, some financial highlights on the Other Income and Expense. Other expenses increased due to higher net interest expense related to increased borrowings during the quarter, primarily to fund our recently completed Sage and Physio-Control a acquisitions. Net interest expense will continue to be higher than Q1, as our borrowing occurred at the end of Q1. Our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 17.4% reflects the benefits of our global tax structure and the permanent renewal of certain tax extenders, which was included in our guidance.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with $7.5 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 72% [ph] was held in the U.S. This balance reflects $3.5 billion of proceeds related to our previously mentioned that offerings, which is included in the $7.5 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, $4.1 billion of cash was used to fund the Sage and Physio-Control acquisitions. 
Turning to cash flow. Our cash flow from operations for 2015 was $2 billion compared to $4 billion last year, as we made $0.1 billion of payments associated with our Rejuvenate and ABG II recall. 
Approximately 50% of the funding for the Rejuvenate liability is being sourced from OUS cash. 
Finally, as we have previously announced, we suspended our share repurchases for the remainder of the year. 
With that, I will move on to our guidance. Based on our first quarter performance, we now expect our full year organic sales growth to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.5% for 2016. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate net sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 1% for 2016. 
We also expect continued unfavorable price reductions in the range of 1.5% to 2%, consistent with the pricing environment we experienced in 2015. 
Finally, our guidance for adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2016 now stands in the range of $5.65 to $5.80 for the full year and $1.33 to $1.38 for the second quarter. 
And now I will open up the call for Q&A."

It's on the market outside the U.S. It's in clinical in the U.S, probably still a year or 2 before a U.S. market launch of that product, but that will clearly be an important product launch, given that these captured a portion of the coil market, where they're applicable. And then, continuing to invest in the ischemic stroke, although Kennedy, what can happen over the next few years in the ischemic segment has more to do with market development, as Glenn mentioned, in his comments. On MAKO, nothing that I would bring out to suggest of placements will get harder.

So we did sell in the revision market, but we didn't maintain the same level of market share that we do in our prior knees, roughly 6 points.

We also have cementless knees, which is growing demand that's true, our launch of our 3D printed titanium baseplate come up baseplate portion of our Knee system. That's a second factor.

We launched a slew of new products, and those are being well adopted in the marketplace. I would say, price continue to be pressured. Spine is the most pressured pricing division within Stryker. And we believe that our price is roughly in line with the market.

We were also granted conveners status by CMS last year as part of the bundled payments DTCI a program. And we are actively risk --- taking risk with 5 institutions across multiple hospitals on the payment bundling, managing over $55 million in episode spend. With CGR, third-parties like us are not allowed to operate as a convener anymore with that Medicare program. But our Stryker Performance Solution is still providing consulting services to hospitals to help them address the challenges at managing the bundle. So we have a lot of experience. We're continuing to help and consult with our customers. And then what I'd tell you is that the initial focus is really much more on the postacute care, that's where most the majority of the cost of the procedure is and the biggest opportunity in the short term addressing postacute care. But having this division, which is headquartered in Chicago, has been a key asset for us.

The other key is this is not just about time. We believe to eventually improve the patient experience. We're going to have a more reproducible surgery because there tends to be tremendous variation, particularly with lower-volume surgeons. We think we can improve muscle disruption and things that add to the fact that close to 30% of knee patients are dissatisfied with the procedure. It's really not just about time.

I do believe bundled care and bundled payments will increase. It's a good thing for the overall health care system. It will address a lot of costs that need to be reduced, frankly, in the case of Hip and Knee procedure. There is an over prescriptive today on the postacute. There's a lot of costs, and we've seen, when we work with hospitals on their service line profitability, that's the area that we tend to focus on the most.

Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, who assumed the role of CFO, effective April 1; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations. 
For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by an M&A update from Katherine. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A.
We are pleased with our start to the year, as Q1 organic sales growth of 6.1% came in above our expectations, with strong performances across all 3 segments: Orthopaedics, MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Spine. The performance was led by continued new product introductions, and strong sales and marketing execution. 
Geographically, Q1 was powered by ongoing momentum in the U.S., with sales growth of 8.9%. As expected, growth was challenged outside the U.S., given the tough year-over-year comparisons in emerging markets, where growth started to slow in the second quarter of last year. Challenges still exist in emerging markets, although the year-over-year impact should ease in the back half of the year.
We continue to have good performance in Europe, Japan and Australia. Our strategy of business unit specialization with dedicated sales forces, marketing and R&D continued to be a differentiating factor in the sustainability of our above-market growth.
Consistent R&D investment has generated strong internal product pipelines across the company, and we continue to augment them with acquisitions. We are thrilled to welcome Sage, Physio-Control and Synergistics to Stryker, and believe that the addition of these companies will further strengthen our businesses. 
Looking at the P&L, we are building on 2015's success, and delivered solid adjusted earnings growth of 11.7%, despite modest foreign currency headwinds.
This improvement stemmed from the strong top line and year-over-year gross margin expansion. Importantly, we continue to invest heavily in R&D in both absolute dollars and as a percent of sales. Our cost transformation for growth efforts are in the early stages and are multi-year in nature, and we are starting to realize benefits. 
Overall, we are confident in our stated goal of achieving sales at the high end of medtech, with ongoing earnings leverage, and believe our Q1 results position us well for 2016.
I will now turn the call over to Katherine."

My comments today will focus on providing an update on MAKO, along with the 2 larger M&A deals we recently closed on: Sage and Physio-Control. 
With respect to MAKO, we sold 7 robots during the quarter globally, which is in line with the same period a year ago. As many of you know, capital sales tend to be the strongest in the fourth quarter, and also can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. We are highly encouraged by order trends, which reinforces the growing interest in demand for the MAKO robotic system, fueled by the expanded indication and planned launch of the Total Knee system, where we continue to target full commercial rollout in 2017. There is no change to our launch plan for the Total Knee, which will focus throughout 2016 on working with key opinion leaders to optimize the training protocol and gather observational data that will help to frame the anticipated benefits, all of which will ensure a strong podium presence at key orthopaedic meetings as we move throughout 2017. 
In Q1, we were also encouraged by the robust procedure growth in both partial knees and hips using MAKO.
Turning to the recent M&A activity. In early April, we closed on both Sage and Physio-Control, which will be integrated into our Medical division. Starting with Sage, our focus will be to ensure the continuation of strong double-digit top line growth that the company has had a long history of achieving. With their market-leading product portfolio, focus on clinically supported innovation, product ease-of-use and strong sales support, we believe Sage can continue to drive both market expansion and share gains in the prevention of hospital-acquired conditions. Given our existing global footprint, which includes strong and broad sales and marketing support, we believe that, over time, Stryker can help drive adoption of the Sage portfolio outside the U.S., where revenue today is limited as the company had historically focused its investments in the U.S. market. 
Regarding Physio-Control, we believe we have significant opportunities over time to drive both sales and earnings synergies, given our combined presence in the prehospital setting. In the near term, both businesses will operate largely independently, with a focus on their respective 2016 targets and planned key new product launches.
Importantly, for both Sage and Physio-Control, we have identified and put in place a highly experienced integration team, which given our BD history, should help ensure a smooth integration. 
As we move through the first 12 months postclosing of both Sage and Physio-Control, we will provide you with the pro forma quarterly growth rates for each, to help provide visibility regarding our execution and their top line contribution. There's no change to our previously announced expected accretion from both these transactions to adjusted EPS in 2016 and 2017 of $0.07 and $0.15 to $0.18, respectively. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn."

My comments on today's call will focus on the financial results and key drivers of our first quarter performance. Our detailed financial results have been provided in the various schedules included in today's press release. As to our",1149,"Thanks, Katherine. My comments on today's call will focus on the financial results and key drivers of our first quarter performance. 
Our detailed financial results have been provided in the various schedules included in today's press release. As to our overall performance, our constant currency organic sales growth of 6.1% exceeded the high end of our full year expectations, and came in better than our expectations at the start of the quarter. The growth, based on the same number of selling days, reflected strong U.S. volume and mix of 10.2%, marginally offset by pricing, which was slightly negative at 1.3%.
Adjusted EPS of $1.24 increased 11.7% from 2015, primarily driven by our strong top line growth and favorable margin performance. Foreign exchange unfavorably impacted EPS by $0.02 per share, roughly in line with our guidance.
Looking at our segment highlights. Orthopaedics constant currency growth was 4.6%, which was led by U.S. Orthopaedics growth of 7.9%, reflecting continued strong sales in our Trauma and Extremity business, which grew 11%; and a 9% increase in Knees, reflecting continued momentum from our last quarter, and the success of our Triathlon products, driven by our titanium revision cones, our cementless knee products as well as, new customer adoption of our MAKO uni platform.
We are now seeing an acceleration in our revision in planned sales, where previously our market share lagged our overall Total Knee share. Partly offsetting the strong U.S. orthopaedic performance was the continued challenging markets in China and Brazil, which contributed to the negative 1.4% constant currency decline in international. 
Overall, our first quarter results continue to reflect strong momentum across our Orthopaedics portfolio. 
Our MedSurg segment, with constant currency growth of 4.6%, also demonstrated strong momentum, with U.S. growth of 7.6%. Instruments had solid U.S. growth of 10.2%, with good performance in their waste management products. 
Endoscopy's new 1588 camera, which features enhanced visualization, that broadens the applicable surgical applications, was a primary driver for the division's solid performance, and will continue to be a growth engine in 2016. 
Lastly, Medical's growth, which was up against a tough year-over-year comparable, benefited from strong demand for its market-leading structure and ambulance cot products, which underscore the strength of its portfolio and the overall health and stability of hospital capital budgets that we're seeing in the market. 
As with Orthopaedics, MedSurg also experienced challenges in emerging markets, primarily China. We expect this to continue as we work through our distributors to drive demand and reduce the buildup of their inventories. Recognizing comparisons will also ease as we move through 2016.
All in all, our MedSurg businesses saw healthy order growth in the first quarter, and should be well positioned to continue their momentum. 
Turning to Neurotechnology and Spine. The impressive year-end momentum achieved by this group continued in the first quarter with 13.1% constant currency growth. Neurotechnology's 21% growth was highlighted by the developing market for device-based treatment of ischemic stroke. While there's still considerable market development required, we are highly encouraged by the potential for this segment and our Trevo Stentriever technology. As one of the 2 majors Stentrievers on the market, combined with compelling clinical data underscoring the efficacy of these devices, such as the MR CLEAN study, Stryker is well-positioned for growth in Neurovascular. 
We also continue to see excellent performance in our Neuro-Powered Instruments business, led by strong growth in their signature drill products released last year. 
We also are encouraged by the solid showing Upper Spine, up 5.8% in the U.S., as new product launches, included in our limiting launch of our 3D-printed interbody device, are clearly having an impact. Neurotechnology and Spine continue to benefit from a new product pipeline resulting from robust R&D investment over the past few years. 
I will now focus on our first quarter operating highlights, starting with gross margin, which, on an adjusted basis, increased 240 basis points to 68%. Of this improvement, roughly 1/4 relates to the 2-year suspension of the Medical Device Tax, while the remainder reflects a favorable mix and favorable foreign exchange, partly offset by negative pricing. 
As for our operating expenses, we continue to focus on internal innovation, with R&D at 6.4% of sales, which is in line with our overall target spend. On an adjusted basis, SG&A increased to 37.4% of sales versus 35.9% in the prior period, which was driven by increased selling activity, anticipated spending related to our new ERP deployment efforts and reinvestment in the Medical Device Tax. 
Looking ahead, we expect SG&A on a full year basis to be comparable to 2015. Overall, our operating margin increased 90 basis points, reflecting solid top line growth and favorable mix and gross margins, offset slightly by higher SG&A for the quarter.
Lastly, some financial highlights on the Other Income and Expense. Other expenses increased due to higher net interest expense related to increased borrowings during the quarter, primarily to fund our recently completed Sage and Physio-Control acquisitions. Net interest expense will continue to be higher than Q1, as our borrowing occurred at the end of Q1. Our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 17.4% reflects the benefits of our global tax structure and the permanent renewal of certain tax extenders, which was included in our guidance.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with $7.5 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 72% was held in the U.S. This balance reflects $3.5 billion of proceeds related to our previously mentioned debt offering, which is included in the $7.5 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, $4.1 billion of cash was used to fund the Sage and Physio-Control acquisitions. 
Turning to cash flow. Our cash flow from operations for 2015 was $2 billion compared to $4 billion last year, as we made $0.1 billion of payments associated with our Rejuvenate and ABG II recall. 
Approximately 50% of the funding for the Rejuvenate liability is being sourced from OUS cash. 
Finally, as we have previously announced, we have suspended our share repurchases for the remainder of the year. 
With that, I will move on to our guidance. Based on our first quarter performance, we now expect our full year organic sales growth to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.5% for 2016. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate net sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 1% for 2016. 
We also expect continued unfavorable price reductions in the range of 1.5% to 2%, consistent with the pricing environment we experienced in 2015. 
Finally, our guidance for adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2016 now stands in the range of $5.65 to $5.80 for the full year, and $1.33 to $1.38 for the second quarter. 
And now I will open up the call for Q&A."

So within Neurotech, the bulk of the revenue, it's still from the hemorrhagic side, and we continue to launch next generation of the coil, different sizes, different shapes and continue to launch into additional geographies. And we are the market leader in that segment of the market. We do have a flow diverter. It's on the market outside the U.S. It's in clinicals in the U.S, we're probably still a year or 2 before U.S. market launch of that product, but that will clearly be an important product launch, given that it captured a portion of the coil market, where they're applicable. And then, continuing to invest in ischemic stroke, although candidly, a lot of what's going to have to happen over the next few years in the ischemic segment has more to do with market development, as Glenn mentioned in his comments. On MAKO, nothing that I would bring up to suggest that replacements will get harder. If anything, the economic and value proposition associated with the robot, as we move toward full commercial launch of the Total Knee indication, only gets greater. So -- and we expect to see continued strong demand. As we've talked about this year, it's really focused on training. So that's going to be to ensure an optimal rollout, and to make sure the initial user experience is as positive as it can be. But we would assume continued momentum. And as I mentioned, we're really pleased with our incoming order trends."

And that was clearly the biggest contributor to the strong performance in Neurovascular. But equally pleased with the performance of our Neuro Powered Instruments, which are having fantastic growth, very strong double-digit growth with our signature drills, which compete with one of the other major players, and we're taking significant market share with those products as well as our Sonopet product.

We had a great fourth quarter with around 9% growth in the U.S., and another 9% in the first quarter. And certainly, revision's part of it. And we've launched these new 3D printed cones in the middle of last year. And cones are very important part of the procedure. They don't generate huge revenue by themselves, but you get the pull-through of the implant when you use the cones. Our market share was roughly 6 share points below what it was in primary knees and revision. So we did sell in the revision market, but we didn't maintain the same level of market share that we do with our primary knees, roughly 6 points. So we're really excited about the gain. We'll gain those 6 points back and then potentially, even well beyond that, because we really believe we now have the best-in-class cones for revision procedures. We also have cementless knees, which is growing, and that's through our launch of our 3D printed titanium baseplate, the baseplate portion of our Knee system. That's a second factor. Third factor is really great sales force execution -- marketing programs and sales force execution. So it's hard for me to describe which of those 3 is the greater. I would say all 3 contributed to a very strong showing in knees, and it's the second quarter in a row. And I really believe we're building momentum and that we'll continue to perform well in Knees through the course of the year."

We were also granted Convener status by CMS last year as part of the bundled payment, BPCI program.

They're going to be much closer to time-neutral, but it's also why we wanted to spend our time on the training protocol to really look at ways that we can optimize this with this first-generation product. The other key is this is not just about time. We believe we're going to truly improve the patient experience, we're going to have a more reproducible surgery because there tends to be tremendous variation, particularly with lower-volume surgeons. We think we can improve muscle disruption and things that add to the fact that close to 30% of knee patients are dissatisfied with the procedure. So it's really not just about time, it's truly about having experience that's better for the surgeon, better for the patient. And over time, we believe the outcome's data will support that."

So irrespective of the type of payment, whether it's a single-payer system like in France, a two-tier system like in the U.K. or whether where we are now, it's a bundled payment system. So the method of payment is less interesting to us, frankly. If we deliver value and prove that value, we will win in the marketplace. And frankly, when you look at a bundle, again, the implant price, and even with a robot, if you factor in the robot and that's still not the majority of the procedure costs. So there's a lot of room to optimize beyond just the implant. And we really believe if we deliver that excellent experience and they have better outcomes, that we'll be able to win in the marketplace."

I heard the comments on the ankle performance. In the quarter, it sounds like that was strong.

But with us not getting a carveout on a total ankle replacement code, which I don't think anybody really expected that we would, again, this year, but as you look at the episode of care costs on Ankle being higher than Hips and knees, but being reimbursed at those same rates, and as we go into this bundled payment environment, you think there's any bias or any kind of skew away from ankles that hospitals would maybe take just as their costs are higher but reimbursement is the same, with -- being paid under those Hip and Knee codes?"

And I think -- and Medicare is going to be looking at high-volume procedures and moving them into the bundle. Total ankle is a very small part of the total market. But it's still, Fusion is still the standard of care. Ankles are growing very fast but from a very small base. So I'm not -- I really don't see this hitting the radar screen, at least, not for a few years back for Medicare. They've got a lot of other procedures they're going to focus on. I do believe bundled care and bundled payments will increase. It's a good thing for the overall health care system. It will address a lot of costs that need to be reduced, frankly, in the case of Hip and Knee procedure. There is an overprescription today on the post-acute. There's a lot of costs, and we've seen, when we work with hospitals on their service line profitability, that's the area that we tend to focus on the most. So I think we're a long way away from bundled payments having a big impact on Total Ankle, and frankly, it's a better outcome. So Fusion is -- was a standard of care in some of the joint replacements a long time ago, and that's been replaced by Total Prosthesis, and Total Ankle will be a better outcome. Of course, like everything in health care, finding payments and getting procedures reimbursed always goes through its ups and downs. But if you have a better outcome, eventually, it'll get paid. So I don't really see a headwind for that, at least not in the next few years."

But I would say it's just a continuation. That camera launch was December. It really was mid-December last year, the 1588, and we're getting great customer feedback. So that will continue going into this year. Sports medicine is launching a number of products. Spine, the 3D-printed implant, the interbody device, great feedback, but a very small number of surgeons, put those in, in the first quarter, so we'll expand that launch over the course of the year. So I wouldn't point to one single product. It's just typical of Stryker. We tend to have our growth spread across a wide variety of products.

Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, who assumed the role of CFO, effective April 1; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations. 
For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by an M&A update from Katherine. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A.
We are pleased with our start to the year, as Q1 organic sales growth of 6.1% came in above our expectations, with strong performances across all 3 segments: Orthopaedics, MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Spine. The performance was led by continued new product introductions, and strong sales and marketing execution. 
Geographically, Q1 was powered by ongoing momentum in the U.S., with sales growth of 8.9%. As expected, growth was challenged outside the U.S., given the tough year-over-year comparisons in emerging markets, where growth started to slow in the second quarter of last year. Challenges still exist in emerging markets, although the year-over-year impact should ease in the back half of the year.
We continue to have good performance in Europe, Japan and Australia. Our strategy of business unit specialization with dedicated sales forces, marketing and R&D continue to be a differentiating factor in the sustainability of our above-market growth.
Consistent R&D investment has generated strong internal product pipelines across the company, and we continue to augment them with acquisitions. We are thrilled to welcome Sage, Physio-Control and Synergestics (sic) [Synergetics] to Stryker, and believe that the addition of these companies will further strengthen our businesses. 
Looking at the P&L, we are building on 2015's success, and delivered solid adjusted earnings growth of 11.7%, despite modest foreign currency headwinds.
This improvement stemmed from the strong top line and year-over-year gross margin expansion. Importantly, we continue to invest heavily in R&D in both absolute dollars and as a percent of sales. Our cost transformation for growth efforts are in the early stages and are multi-year in nature, and we are starting to realize benefits. 
Overall, we are confident in our stated goal of achieving sales at the high end of medtech with ongoing earnings leverage and believe our Q1 results position us well for 2016.
I will now turn the call over to Katherine."

My comments today will focus on providing an update on MAKO, along with the 2 larger M&A deals we recently closed on: Sage and Physio-Control. 
With respect to MAKO, we sold 7 robots during the quarter, globally, which is in line with the same period a year ago. As many of you know, capital sales tend to be the strongest in the fourth quarter, and also can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. We are highly encouraged by order trends, which reinforces the growing interest in demand for the MAKO robotic system, fueled by the expanded indications and planned launch of the Total Knee system, where we continue to target full commercial rollout in 2017. There is no change to our launch plan for the Total Knee, which will focus throughout 2016 on working with key opinion leaders to optimize the training protocol and gather observational data that will help to frame the anticipated benefits, all of which will ensure a strong podium presence at key orthopaedic meetings as we move throughout 2017. 
In Q1, we were also encouraged by the robust procedure growth in both partial knees and hips using MAKO.
Turning to the recent M&A activity. In early April, we closed on both Sage and Physio-Control, which will be integrated into our Medical division. Starting with Sage, our focus will be to ensure the continuation of strong double-digit top line growth that the company has had a long history of achieving. With their market-leading product portfolio, focus on clinically supported innovation, product ease-of-use and strong sales support, we believe Sage can continue to drive both market expansion and share gains in the prevention of hospital-acquired conditions. Given our existing global footprint, which includes strong and broad sales and marketing support, we believe that over time Stryker can help drive adoption of the Sage portfolio outside the U.S., where revenue today is limited as the company had historically focused its investments in the U.S. market. 
Regarding Physio-Control, we believe we have significant opportunities over time to drive both sales and earnings synergies, given our combined presence in the prehospital setting. In the near term, both businesses will operate largely independently, with a focus on their respective 2016 targets and planned key new product launches.
Importantly, for both Sage and Physio-Control, we have identified and put in place a highly experienced integration team, which given our BD history, should help ensure a smooth integration. 
As we move through the first 12 months postclosing of both Sage and Physio-Control, we will provide you with the pro forma quarterly growth rates for each, to help provide visibility regarding our execution and their top line contribution. There's no change to our previously announced expected accretion from both these transactions to adjusted EPS in 2016 and 2017 of $0.07 and $0.15 to $0.18, respectively. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn."

My comments on today's call will focus on the financial results and key drivers of our first quarter performance. Our detailed financial results have been provided in the various schedules included in today's press release. As to our",1150,"Thanks, Katherine. My comments on today's call will focus on the financial results and key drivers of our first quarter performance. 
Our detailed financial results have been provided in the various schedules included in today's press release. As to our overall performance, our constant currency organic sales growth of 6.1% exceeded the high end of our full year expectations and came in better than our expectations at the start of the quarter. The growth, based on the same number of selling days, reflected strong U.S. volume and mix of 10.2%, marginally offset by pricing, which was slightly negative at 1.3%.
Adjusted EPS of $1.24 increased 11.7% from 2015, primarily driven by our strong top line growth and favorable margin performance. Foreign exchange unfavorably impacted EPS by $0.02 per share, roughly in line with our guidance.
Looking at our segment highlights. Orthopaedics constant currency growth was 4.6%, which was led by U.S. Orthopaedics growth of 7.9%, reflecting continued strong sales in our Trauma and Extremity business, which grew 11%; and a 9% increase in Knees, reflecting continued momentum from our last quarter; and the success of our Triathlon products, driven by our Tritanium revision cones, our cementless knee products as well as new customer adoption of our MAKO uni platform.
We are now seeing an acceleration in our revision implant sales, where previously our market share lagged our overall Total Knee share. Partly offsetting the strong U.S. orthopaedic performance was the continued challenging markets in China and Brazil, which contributed to the negative 1.4% constant currency decline in international. 
Overall, our first quarter results continue to reflect strong momentum across our Orthopaedics portfolio. 
Our MedSurg segment, with constant currency growth of 4.6%, also demonstrated strong momentum, with U.S. growth of 7.6%. Instruments had solid U.S. growth of 10.2%, with good performance in their waste management products. 
Endoscopy's new 1588 camera, which features enhanced visualization that broadens the applicable surgical applications, was a primary driver for the division's solid performance and will continue to be a growth engine in 2016. 
Lastly, Medical's growth, which was up against a tough year-over-year comparable, benefited from strong demand for its market-leading stretcher and ambulance cot products, which underscored the strength of its portfolio and the overall health and stability of hospital capital budgets that we're seeing in the market. 
As with Orthopaedics, MedSurg also experienced challenges in emerging markets, primarily China. We expect this to continue as we work through our distributors to drive demand and reduce the buildup of their inventories, recognizing comparisons will also ease as we move through 2016.
All in all, our MedSurg businesses saw healthy order growth in the first quarter, and should be well positioned to continue their momentum. 
Turning to Neurotechnology and Spine. The impressive year-end momentum achieved by this group continued in the first quarter with 13.1% constant currency growth. Neurotechnology's 21% growth was highlighted by the developing market for device-based treatment of ischemic stroke. While there's still considerable market development required, we are highly encouraged by the potential for this segment and our Trevo Stentriever technology. As 1 of 2 major stentrievers on the market, combined with compelling clinical data underscoring the efficacy of these devices such as the MR CLEAN study, Stryker is well-positioned for growth in Neurovascular. 
We also continue to see excellent performance in our Neuro-Powered Instruments business led by strong growth in their signature drill products released last year. 
We also are encouraged by the solid showing up -- for Spine, up 5.8% in the U.S., as new product launches included in a limiting launch of our 3D-printed interbody device, are clearly having an impact. Neurotechnology and Spine continue to benefit from a new product pipeline resulting from robust R&D investment over the past few years. 
I will now focus on our first quarter operating highlights, starting with gross margin, which, on an adjusted basis, increased 240 basis points to 68%. Of this improvement, roughly 1/4 relates to the 2-year suspension of the Medical Device Tax, while the remainder reflects a favorable mix and favorable foreign exchange, partly offset by negative pricing. 
As for our operating expenses, we continue to focus on internal innovation, with R&D at 6.4% of sales, which is in line with our overall target spend. On an adjusted basis, SG&A increased to 37.4% of sales versus 35.9% in the prior period, which was driven by increased selling activity, anticipated spending related to our new ERP deployment efforts and reinvestment in the Medical Device Tax. 
Looking ahead, we expect SG&A on a full year basis to be comparable to 2015. Overall, our operating margin increased 90 basis points, reflecting solid top line growth and favorable mix and gross margins offset slightly by higher SG&A for the quarter.
Lastly, some financial highlights on the other income and expense. Other expenses increased due to higher net interest expense related to increased borrowings during the quarter, primarily to fund our recently completed Sage and Physio-Control acquisitions. Net interest expense will continue to be higher than Q1, as our borrowing occurred at the end of Q1. Our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 17.4% reflects the benefits of our global tax structure and the permanent renewal of certain tax extenders, which was included in our guidance.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with $7.5 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 72% [ph] was held in the U.S. This balance reflects $3.5 billion of proceeds related to our previously mentioned debt offering, which is included in the $7.5 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, $4.1 billion of cash was used to fund the Sage and Physio-Control acquisitions. 
Turning to cash flow. Our cash flow from operations for 2015 was $2 billion compared to $4 billion last year, as we made $0.1 billion of payments associated with our Rejuvenated and ABG II recall. 
Approximately 50% of the funding for the Rejuvenate liability is being sourced from OUS cash. 
Finally, as we have previously announced, we have suspended our share repurchases for the remainder of the year. 
With that, I will move on to our guidance. Based on our first quarter performance, we now expect our full year organic sales growth to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.5% for 2016. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate net sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 1% for 2016. 
We also expect continued unfavorable price reductions in the range of 1.5% to 2%, consistent with the pricing environment we experienced in 2015. 
Finally, our guidance for adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2016 now stands in the range of $5.65 to $5.80 for the full year, and $1.33 to $1.38 for the second quarter. 
And now I will open up the call for Q&A."

So within Neurotech, the bulk of the revenue is still from the hemorrhagic side, and we continue to launch next generation of the coils, different sizes, different shapes and continue to launch into additional geographies. And we are the market leader in that segment of the market. We do have a flow diverter. It's on the market outside the U.S. It's in clinicals in the U.S. We're probably still a year or 2 before U.S. market launch of that product, but that will clearly be an important product launch, given that they've captured a portion of the coil market where they're applicable. And then, continuing to invest in ischemic stroke, although candidly, a lot of what's going to have to happen over the next few years in the ischemic segment has more to do with market development, as Glenn mentioned in his comments. On MAKO, nothing that I would bring up to suggest that placements will get harder. If anything, the economic and value proposition associated with the robot, as we move toward full commercial launch of the Total Knee indication, only gets greater. So we expect to see continued strong demand. As we've talked about this year  is really focused on training. So that's going to be to ensure an optimal rollout, and to make sure the initial user experience is as positive as it can be. But we would assume continued momentum. And as I mentioned, we're really pleased with incoming order trends."

And that was clearly the biggest contributor to the strong performance in Neurovascular. But equally pleased with the performance of our Neuro Powered Instruments, which are having fantastic growth, very strong double-digit growth with our signature drills, which compete with one of the other major players, and we're taking significant market share with those products as well as our Sonopet product. So very, very strong performance, both in Neurovascular as well as the Neuro Powered Instruments. And even our Craniomaxillofacial business, the third of our Neuro businesses, is enjoying double-digit growth. So across the Neuro portfolio, we're really performing very well.

We had a great fourth quarter with around 9% growth in the U.S., and another 9% in the first quarter. And certainly, revision's part of it. And we've launched these new 3D printed cones in the middle of last year. And cones are a very important part of the procedure. They don't generate huge revenue by themselves, but you get the pull-through of the implant when you use the cones. Our market share was, roughly, 6 share points below what it was in primary knees and revision. So we did sell in the revision market, but we didn't maintain the same level of market share that we do with our primary knees: roughly, 6 points. So we're really excited about being able to gain those 6 points back and then, potentially, even grow beyond that. Because we really believe we now have the best-in-class cones for revision procedures. We also have cementless knees, which is growing, and that's through our launch of our 3D printed Tritanium baseplate: the baseplate portion of our knee system. That's a second factor. Third factor is really great sales force execution -- marketing programs and sales force execution. So it's hard for me to describe which of those 3 is the greater. I would say all 3 contributed to a very strong showing in knees, and it's the second quarter in a row. And I really believe we're building momentum and that we'll continue to perform well in knees through the course of the year."

A really high-volume surgeon doing hundreds of knee replacements a year is going to -- this is going to be time-additive. For the lower-volume surgeon, they're going to be much closer to time-neutral, but it's also why we wanted to spend our time on the training protocol to really look at ways that we can optimize this with this first-generation product. The other key is this is not just about time. We believe we're going to truly improve the patient experience, we're going to have a more reproducible surgery because there tends to be tremendous variation, particularly with lower-volume surgeons. We think we can improve muscle disruption and things that add to the fact that close to 30% of knee patients are dissatisfied with the procedure. So it's really not just about time. It's truly about having experience that's better for the surgeon, better for the patient. And over time, we believe the outcomes data will support that."

When we see unemployment come down, we tend to see a lot more joint replacement, and specifically, knees. So hips really hurt even when you lie down at night. Knees, you can defer. And so we see that as a very good proxy. That's much more of a proxy than anything to do with ACA. So we really believe we've got a stable market that will continue to be stable for not just the next quarter, but for the next year or 2 years.

So I'm not -- I really don't see this hitting the radar screen, at least, not for a few years for Medicare. They've got a lot of other procedures they're going to focus on. I do believe bundled care and bundled payments will increase. It's a good thing for the overall health care system. It will address a lot of costs that need to be reduced. Frankly, in the case of hip and knee procedure there is an overprescription today on the post-acute. There's a lot of costs, and we've seen, when we work with hospitals on their service line profitability that's the area that we tend to focus on the most. So I think we're a long way away from bundled payments having a big impact on total ankle, and frankly, it's a better outcome. So Fusion is -- was a standard of care in some of the joint replacements a long time ago, and that's been replaced by total prosthesis, and total ankle will be a better outcome. Of course, like everything in health care, finding payments and getting procedures reimbursed always goes through its ups and downs. But if you have a better outcome, eventually, it'll get paid.

So that will continue going into this year. Sports medicine is launching a number of products.

Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A.
With Q2 organic sales growth of 6.6%, we continue to demonstrate the strength of Stryker's diversified revenue base, which is allowing us to consistently deliver sales growth at the high-end of med tech. This quarter, our growth was powered by robust performance in MedSurg and Neurotechnology, while Orthopaedics was in line. Our decentralized business model is enabling us to drive innovation and strong sales and marketing execution.
On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by the U.S., up 9%, while sales outside the U.S. were up 2%, which is continuing to be impacted by ongoing challenges in China.
Beyond the top line achievements, Q2 was highlighted by strong operational expense leverage, that reflects our focus on driving cost transformation across divisions and geographies. As previously mentioned, we have a significant opportunity to deliver greater G&A leverage on a multi-year basis with initiatives such as indirect spending, product lifecycle management and the optimization of our IT systems. As we are starting to see the impact from these initiatives, it underscores our conviction of delivering leverage earnings gains. Based on our first half performance, we now look for full year organic sales growth of 6% to 6.5% and adjusted per-share earnings of $5.78 to $5.80 a share.

Good afternoon, I'm excited about participating in today's call and providing you with perspectives regarding our recent acquisitions of Sage products and Physio-Control. I will begin with Sage products as we reiterate the strategic rationale which drove this acquisition. As we are articulating in February, Sage complements Stryker Medical's portfolio of innovative ICU and MedSurg products with disposables targeted and reducing events. It also provides access to an important adjacent market that expands our hospital product offerings and improves our mix of single use versus capital products. Sages' approach to innovation focus is on demonstrating superior clinical outcomes, which underscore the benefits of their products driving customer adoption and loyalty. These innovation efforts have resulted in unique and highly-trusted brands, which are essential part of nurses daily interactions with patients and hospital ICUs and MedSurg units. Sages is #1 in all the segments it serves, and we believe that in North America alone, Sage's products address the segment totaling approximately $1.4 billion.
Turning to the financials for Sage, given that we closed the transaction in April 1, we are able to share a full quarter of sales results. Sage's performance was strong in Q2 with sales growth of roughly 9%. This performance was achieved while contending with an unexpected supply interruption during the quarter that was one-time in nature, and has been resolved. Without the supply interruption, Sage's growth in Q2 would've been approximately 14%.
Sage's success has been fueled by the commitment to innovation, which is resulted in a long history of successful new product introductions, including the-recently launched Airtap products. Using proprietary air resistance technology, Airtap enables caregivers to provide exceptional care by a begin the turning and boosting of patients, while the patients remain in bed. Airtap enhances safety as it requires 80% less force to boost patients versus a typically used draw sheet.
With respect to integration, plans are underway to expand our manufacturing capacity beginning in 2018 to support expected growth. Moreover, our businesses are working to create activity to accelerate revenue in areas such as key account and brands strategies.
Our international focus will begin with Europe, where Sage has experienced some initial success and Canada, where they have done very well. Beyond these markets, we're working to prioritize countries, which value proven clinical solutions that eliminates never events. We are excited by the cultural similarities and positive chemistry between Stryker and Sage, and expect double-digit revenue growth in the second half.
Turning to Physio-Control. I would like to also reinforce the strategic rationale that led us to acquire this company. As we described in mid-February, Physio-Control complement Stryker Medicals portfolio of innovative and differentiated prehospital and hospital products as Physio-Control is a leader in the development, manufacturer and sales of defibrillators and monitors, Beatty's, and CPR-assist devices. We are excited by the synergistic benefits and market strength that resulted from the combination of Physio-Control with our Medical division. Importantly, the vast majority of Physio-Control sales call points overlap with our Medical division call points. Physio-Control holds the #1 or #2 share position at every major segment it serves. We believe that on a global basis, Physio-Control's products address segments sold in approximately $1.7 billion.
With Stryker's market-leading power in [indiscernible] and power low list system, coupled with Physio-Control's suite of defibrillators, monitors and related products, our solution set is extensive. Our existing EMS franchise enjoyed tremendous success in recent years, with growth significantly higher than the market and Stryker as a whole. Physio-Control's business has an attractive mix of 60% capital and 40% recurring business compared to our EMS business, which is nearly 100% capital. In addition, Physio-Control has an impressive in their incompetency in a robust pipeline of products that have recently begun to launched with additional product launches slated for the next several years.
We expect this refreshed product portfolio in the combination of our organizations to result in continued strong sales momentum, integrator profitable deleverage in the future.
As a reminder, we closed the Physio transaction on April 5. The pro forma of Q2 sales grew roughly 9%. On the integration front, our teams are focused on determining the optimal organizational design that best serves our common EMS and hospital customers. In addition, Physio has a significant international structure and our Medical division is assessing opportunities to drive growth by leveraging Physio's international market knowledge, strength and operational infrastructure. We expect high single-digit growth from the Physio-Control business in the second half. With these 2 acquisitions, the Medical division is now bigger, stronger, better diversified geographically and has more base business. Encouragingly, Medical had a strong organic Q2 growth result while integrating these 2 acquisitions.
This concludes my overview commentary on Sage and Physio-Control. Glenn will now discuss our Q2 financials in more detail."

Interest related to the recent bond offering unfavorably impacted EPS by $0.05 per share and foreign exchange unfavorably impacted EPS by $0.03 during the quarter.
Looking at our segment highlights. Orthopaedics delivered positive currency growth of 4.8% and organic growth of 4.5%. The top line was led by U.S. Orthopaedics gains of 5.9%, highlighted by a 9.5% increase in trauma and extremities, and a 6.8% growth in knees as momentum continued for our 3D-printed titanium provision cones in our cement-less knee products. U.S. hips posted low single-digit growth due to softness in the revision market.
Orthopaedics international delivered constant currency growth of 2.9%, led by a strong performance in our European Me business. Lastly, we placed 17 MAKO units during the quarter. Overall, our second quarter results continue to reflect strong momentum across our Orthopaedics portfolio.
Our MedSurg segment's constant currency growth was 34.2%, including the impact of the recent acquisitions of Sage and Physio. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, our MedSurg business posted organic growth of 8.5%. Our U.S. MedSurg business continued their strong momentum with organic growth of 11.1%. Instruments had solid US growth of 8%, with strong performance in our power tools business, highlighted by double-digit gains in our micropower tools. Endoscopy continued its momentum from Q1, with U.S. growth of 10.8%, driven by continued success of our 15 88 aimed video platform. Excluding the impact of the Sage and Physio acquisitions, Medical had U.S. growth of 16.9%, driven by continued performance of its power cost products as well as solid performance of our med business.
Internationally, MedSurg organic sales were down, 0.5% for the quarter, reflecting ongoing challenges in China, primarily related to the distributor destocking. We expect this to continue throughout 2016 as we work with our distributors to drive and customer demand and reduce the buildup in their inventories.
Neurotechnology and Spine close in constant currency growth of 9% and organic growth of 7.5%, with continued strong momentum in our neuro tech businesses, which increased 14.4%, while Spine was up 1%. As with our other businesses, U.S. neuro tech growth was robust at 15.6%, which reflects the continued strong demand for our Neurovascular products, the 3 [indiscernible] retriever and target coil, our Neuro Powered Instruments and our Craniomaxillofacial vexation products. Our U.S. Spine business grew 4.8%, despite experiencing product supply issues, but continued to see good demand for our newer 3D-printed titanium products. We expect these supply issues to remain into the fourth quarter.
Internationally, neuro tech constant currency growth of 12.3% reflects the broader market momentum for the 3 [indiscernible] retriever and target coils products. Spines international growth was dampened by the aforementioned product supplies issues and continued challenges in China.
Moving on to General operating highlights. Our gross margin on an adjusted basis was roughly flat at 66.2%, down 180 basis points sequentially. We had another quarter of strong impact from our focus on operational efficiencies, including improved productivity and absorption. This was offset by the full impact of our recent acquisitions, including certain accounting reclassification between gross margin and SG&A to align the Stryker policies, sales mix and negative pricing. As for our operating expenses, we continue to focus on internal innovation with R&D spending of 6.4% of sales.
On an adjusted basis, SG&A for the quarter was 34.9%, which was favorable by 120 basis points as compared to the prior year. The improvement reflects the favorable impact of SG&A leverage from our recent acquisitions, the previously mentioned reclassification of certain expenses, our sales mix and continued focus on our operating expense improvements to our CTG program. For the quarter, acquisitions contributed roughly half of our SG&A improvement. Combined, these factors drove a 100 basis points year-over-year increase in our adjusted operating margin to 24.8%.
Lastly, I provide some highlights on our other income expenses. Other expenses increased due to higher net interest expense related to increased borrowings at the end of the first quarter. We anticipate that future quarterly interest expense will be roughly $30 million, which is consistent with this quarter. Our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 17.6% reflects the benefits of our global tax structure, partially offset by the impact of higher U.S.-based income from our recent acquisitions.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with $3.5 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which, approximately 38% was held in the U.S. Total debt on the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter was $7.6 billion.
Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $671 million. Finally, as we have previously announced at the end of Q1, we suspended our share repurchases for the remainder of the year.
In terms of guidance, based on our second quarter performance, we expect our full year organic sales growth to be in the range of 6% to 6.5% versus 2016. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate net sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 1% for 2016. With negative pricing being in the range of 1.5% to 2%. Lastly, our guidance for adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2016 now stands in the range of $5.70 to $5.80 for the full year, and we expect the third quarter to be in the range of $1.33 to $1.38.
And now, I will open up the call for Q&A."

First of all, if you look at the sequential drop in margin, Q1 to Q2, roughly 180 basis points. I mean, Q2 was really impacted by mix, especially but not just sales mix but by adding in the acquisitions. It's early. Acquisitions are off to a solid start, but that's going to impact gross margin for the rest of the year. And impacted more than just product, we made some reclassifications to harmonize Sage and Physio accounting account and packages with our accounting practices. The centuries shifted some SG&A expenses up to gross margin in order to sort of a line that would howl Stryker does the accounting. It's pretty common that we do that. We don't get a chance to really see it until we really climb into the integration work. So that's one of the things that came out. And then on top of that, I really see to reiterate that there's a lot of other things that make our margin move around, not just price but FX, geographic mix really impacted and all of those are pretty hard to forecast to sort of a single point estimate.

Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker CFO; Tim Scannell, Group President, MedSurg & Neurotechnology; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Tim with an update on our 2 recent acquisitions, Sage and Physio-Control. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A.
With Q2 organic sales growth of 6.6%, we continue to demonstrate the strength of Stryker's diversified revenue base, which is allowing us to consistently deliver sales growth at the high end of med tech. This quarter, our growth was powered by robust performance in MedSurg & Neurotechnology, while Orthopaedics was in line. Our decentralized business model is enabling us to drive innovation and strong sales and marketing execution. On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by the U.S., up 9%, while sales outside the U.S. were up 2%, which is continuing to be impacted by ongoing challenges in China.
Beyond the top line achievement, Q2 was highlighted by strong operational expense leverage that reflects our focus on driving cost transformation across divisions and geographies. As previously mentioned, we have a significant opportunity to deliver greater G&A leverage on a multi-year basis, with initiatives such as indirect spending, product life cycle management and the optimization of our IT systems. As we are starting to see the impact from these initiatives, it underscores our conviction of delivering leveraged earning gains. Based on our first half performance, we now look for full year organic sales growth of 6% to 6.5% and adjusted per share earnings of $ 5.70 to $5.80 a share.
I will now turn the call over to Tim."

I'm excited about participating in today's call and providing you with perspectives regarding our recent acquisitions of Sage Products and Physio-Control. I will begin with Sage Products and reiterate the strategic rationa",793,"Thanks, Kevin. Good afternoon. I'm excited about participating in today's call and providing you with perspectives regarding our recent acquisitions of Sage Products and Physio-Control. 
I will begin with Sage Products and reiterate the strategic rationale which drove this acquisition. As we articulated in February, Sage complements Stryker Medical's portfolio of innovative ICU and MedSurg products, with disposables targeted at reducing never events. It also provides access to an important adjacent market that expands our hospital product offerings and improves our mix of single-use versus capital products. Sage's approach to innovation focuses on demonstrating superior clinical outcomes, which underscore the benefits of their products, driving customer adoption and loyalty. These innovation efforts have resulted in unique and highly trusted brands, which are an essential part of nurses' daily interactions with patients and hospital ICUs and MedSurg units. Sage is #1 in all the segments it serves, and we believe that in North America alone, Sage's products address a segment totaling approximately $1.4 billion.
Turning to the financials for Sage. Given that we closed the transaction on April 1, we are able to share a full quarter of sales results. Sage's performance was strong in Q2, with sales growth of roughly 9%. This performance was achieved while contending with an unexpected supply interruption during the quarter that was onetime in nature and has been resolved. Without the supply interruption, Sage's growth in Q2 would have been approximately 14%.
Sage's success has been fueled by their commitment to innovation, which has resulted in a long history of successful new product introductions, including the recently launched AirTAP product. Using proprietary air-assisted technology, AirTAP enables caregivers to provide exceptional care by aiding in the turning and boosting of patients while the patients remain in bed. AirTAP enhances caregiver safety as it requires 80% less force to boost patients versus the typically used drawsheet.
With respect to integration, plans are underway to expand our manufacturing capacity beginning in 2018 to support expected growth. Moreover, our businesses are working to coordinate activities to accelerate revenue in areas such as key account and brand strategies. Our international focus will begin with Europe, where Sage has experienced some initial success, and Canada, where they have done very well. Beyond these markets, we are working to prioritize countries which value proven clinical solutions that eliminate never events. We are excited by the cultural similarities and positive chemistry between Stryker and Sage and expect double-digit revenue growth in the second half.
Turning to Physio-Control. I would like to also reinforce the strategic rationale that led us to acquire this company. As we described in mid-February, Physio-Control complements Stryker Medical's portfolio of innovative and differentiated prehospital and hospital products as Physio-Control is the leader in the development, manufacture and sale of defibrillators and monitors, AEDs and CPR-assist devices. We are excited by the synergistic benefits and market strength that resulted from the combination of Physio-Control with our Medical division. Importantly, the vast majority of Physio-Control sales call points overlap with our Medical division call points. Physio-Control holds the #1 or #2 share position at every major segment it serves. We believe that on a global basis, Physio-Control's products address segments totaling approximately $1.7 billion.
With Stryker's market-leading power cot and Power-LOAD lift system coupled with Physio-Control's suite of defibrillators, monitors and related products, our solution set is extensive. Our existing EMS franchise has enjoyed tremendous success in recent years, with growth significantly higher than the market and Stryker as a whole. Physio-Control's business has an attractive mix of 60% capital and 40% recurring business compared to our EMS business, which is nearly 100% capital. In addition, Physio-Control has an impressive enduring competency and a robust pipeline of products that have recently begun to launched, with additional product launches slated for the next several years. We expect this refreshed product portfolio and the combination of our organizations to result in continued strong sales momentum and greater profitability leverage in the future.
As a reminder, we closed the Physio transaction on April 5. Pro forma Q2 sales grew roughly 9%. On the integration front, our teams are focused on determining the optimal organizational design that best serves our common EMS and hospital customers. In addition, Physio has a significant international structure and our Medical division is assessing opportunities to drive growth by leveraging Physio's international market knowledge, strength and operational infrastructure. We expect high single-digit growth from the Physio-Control business in the second half. 
With these 2 acquisitions, the Medical division is now bigger, stronger, better diversified geographically and has more base business. Encouragingly, Medical had a strong organic Q2 growth result, well integrating these 2 acquisitions.
This concludes my overview commentary on Sage and Physio-Control. Glenn will now discuss our Q2 financials in more detail."

I will focus my comments today on our financial results and key drivers of our second quarter performance. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release.For the quarter, our organic sales growth of 6.6% exceeded",1061,"Thanks, Tim. I will focus my comments today on our financial results and key drivers of our second quarter performance. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release.
For the quarter, our organic sales growth of 6.6% exceeded the high end of the range of our full year expectations despite a tough year-over-year comparison, with growth of 6.9% in the year ago quarter. The quarter included one additional selling day compared to prior year, and consistent with our previous communications, the additional selling day equates to approximately 1% of additional growth. Pricing in the quarter was down 1.3% from the prior year, trending modestly better than we expected. During the quarter, we continued to see strong U.S. sales with organic growth of 8.6%, while international sales posted organic growth of 2%, reflecting continued destocking challenges in China. Our adjusted EPS of $1.39 increased 15.8% from the prior year, primarily driven by our strong top line growth, including the impact from the acquisitions completed in the quarter. Interest related to the recent bond offering unfavorably impacted EPS by $0.05 per share, and foreign exchange unfavorably impacted EPS by $0.03 during the quarter.
Looking at our segment highlights. Orthopaedics delivered constant currency growth of 4.8% and organic growth of 4.5%. The top line was led by U.S. Orthopaedics gains of 5.9%, highlighted by a 9.5% increase in Trauma and Extremities and a 6.8% growth in Knees as momentum continued for our 3D-printed titanium revision cone in our cementless knee products. U.S. Hips posted low single-digit growth due to softness in the revision market. Orthopaedics international delivered constant currency growth of 2.9%, led by a strong performance in our European Knee business. Lastly, we placed 17 MAKO units during the quarter. Overall, our second quarter results continue to reflect strong momentum across our Orthopaedics portfolio.
Our MedSurg segment's constant currency growth was 34.2%, including the impact of the recent acquisitions of Sage and Physio. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, our MedSurg business posted organic growth of 8.5%. Our U.S. MedSurg business continued their strong momentum with organic growth of 11.1%. Instruments had solid US growth of 8%, with strong performance in our power tools business, highlighted by double-digit gains in our micro power tools. Endoscopy continued its momentum from Q1, with U.S. growth of 10.8%, driven by continued success of our 1588 AIM video platform. Excluding the impact of the Sage and Physio acquisitions, Medical had U.S. growth of 16.9%, driven by continued performance of its power cot products as well as solid performance of our bed business. Internationally, MedSurg organic sales were down, 0.5% for the quarter, reflecting ongoing challenges in China primarily related to the distributor destocking. We expect this to continue throughout 2016 as we work with our distributors to drive end customer demand and reduce the buildup in their inventories.
Neurotechnology and Spine posted constant currency growth of 9% and organic growth of 7.5%, with continued strong momentum in our neurotech businesses, which increased 14.4%, while Spine was up 1%. As with our other businesses, U.S. neurotech growth was robust at 15.6%, which reflects the continued strong demand for our Neurovascular products, the Trevo stent retriever and Target Coil, our Neuro Powered Instruments and our craniomaxillofacial fixation products. Our U.S. Spine business grew 4.8% despite experiencing product supply issues but continues to see good demand for our new 3D-printed titanium products. We expect these supply issues to remain into the fourth quarter. Internationally, neurotech constant currency growth of 12.3% reflects the broader market momentum for the Trevo stent retriever and Target Coil products. Spine's international growth was dampened by the aforementioned product supplies issues and continued challenges in China.
Moving on to general operating highlights. Our gross margin on an adjusted basis was roughly flat at 66.2%, down 180 basis points sequentially. We had another quarter of strong impact from our focus on operational efficiencies, including improved productivity and absorption. This was offset by the full impact of our recent acquisitions, including certain accounting reclassifications between gross margin and SG&A to align with Stryker policy, sales mix and negative pricing. 
As for our operating expenses, we continue to focus on internal innovation, with R&D spending of 6.4% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A for the quarter was 34.9%, which was favorable by 120 basis points as compared to the prior year. The improvement reflects the favorable impact of SG&A leverage from our recent acquisitions, the previously mentioned reclassification of certain expenses, our sales mix and continued focus on our operating expense improvements through our CPG program. For the quarter, acquisitions contributed roughly half of our SG&A improvement. Combined, these factors drove a 100 basis point year-over-year increase in our adjusted operating margin to 24.8%.
Lastly, I will provide some highlights on our other income expenses. Other expenses increased due to higher net interest expense related to increased borrowings at the end of the first quarter. We anticipate that future quarterly interest expense will be roughly $30 million, which is consistent with this quarter. Our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 17.6% reflects the benefits of our global tax structure, partially offset by the impact of higher U.S.-based income from our recent acquisitions.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with $3.5 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 38% was held in the U.S. Total debt on the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter was $7.6 billion.
Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $671 million. Finally, as we had previously announced at the end of Q1, we suspended our share repurchases for the remainder of the year.
In terms of guidance, based on our second quarter performance, we expect our full year organic sales growth to be in the range of 6% to 6.5% versus 2016. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate net sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 1% for 2016, with negative pricing being in the range of 1.5% to 2%. Lastly, our guidance for adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2016 now stands in the range of $5.70 to $5.80 for the full year, and we expect the third quarter to be in the range of $1.33 to $1.38.
And now we'll open up the call for Q&A."

Hips, as you pointed out, is -- was a little softer this quarter, but we've lead the market certainly in the U.S. for multiple years in our Hip business and it's just one quarter. So there is, for me, no concern there. We see these changes from quarter to quarter. And as you've seen, our -- the resiliency of our top line, quarter after quarter over the past 3 or 4 years, has been very steady. So yes, there were a bit of swings this quarter but nothing that causes me any reason for concern. I mean, we have very, very strong divisions across the company."

It really reinforces why you've heard us say over and over, we really focus on rolling 4 quarter trends because we see this quarter-to-quarter variability that, taken as a whole when you look back, doesn't mean anything significant in terms of changes and underlying fundamentals. And we're not seeing anything different in this quarter other than it was obviously a weaker-than-normal quarter versus Q1 being a stronger-than-normal quarter. In terms of CJRs, it went to effect April 1. We haven't seen any impact. I think it's simply too early. As you know, there's no penalty until after the first full year. So it's just simply too early, but nothing has played out yet in terms of a significant change or impact on the market."

And then lastly, as it relates to the deals, it sounds like things are going well. Tim, previously, you guys have suggested that $0.15 to $0.18 of accretion in 2017 was a good preliminary estimate.

First of all, if you look at the sequential drop in margin, Q1 to Q2, roughly 180 basis points, I mean, Q2 was really impacted by mix especially, but not just sales mix but by adding in the acquisitions. It's early. Acquisitions are off to a solid start, but that's going to impact gross margin for the rest of the year. And it impacted more than just product. We made some reclassifications to harmonize Sage and Physio accounting practices with our accounting practices. And this essentially shifted some SG&A expenses up to gross margin in order to sort of align them with how Stryker does the accounting. It's pretty common that we do that, and we don't get a chance to really see it until we really climb into the integration work. So that's one of the things that came out. And then on top of that, I really just need to reiterate that there's a lot of other things that make our margin move around, not just price but FX, geographic mix really impact it. And all of those are pretty hard to forecast to a -- to sort of a single-point estimate. As I think about for the rest of the year and what you should maybe think about for your model, I think we'll be in the range of this 67% range, but understand that it could trend above or below that based on all of those factors that I mentioned."

This is obviously going to be one of the variables that gets factored in as we go through our 2017 budgeting process.

How much of that flow through to the bottom line, how much of that we reinvest as we think about the opportunities in front of us, all of that will get factored in and will be evident when we give the range. So I wouldn't want to say it's a one for one, just throw it all on top of a normal earnings number because we have to look at the opportunities for reinvestment, recognizing, obviously, it's also incremental accretion.

Their core visualization business is performing exceptionally well with the 1588 camera. The communications business is doing well, and the sports business is doing well there as well. I would point back to a couple of deals we did in 2014, Berchtold and Pivot. These both are kind of in the mainstream now of being integrated, and our team is fully in line with their products. So the Berchtold lights, booms and tables have sold well this year. The Pivot products have done very well in our hands as well. And over at Stryker Instruments, this has been a steady, strong performer over time. Their personal protection and fluid waste management businesses were real highlights in the quarter. We do expect a strong second half there as they'll be launching their Neptune 3 fluid waste management system in the coming days. So I think across the board, we were strong. I would also frankly note that Sustainability business had a strong quarter and they've done well at recent product launches. And importantly, reprocessed products from Stryker have been embraced as a high-quality solution by our hospital customers despite the fact that that's a challenging and difficult market. I would tell you that now, there wasn't really any sentiment in favor of Stryker as a result of these deals.

We also have, for a number of years now, had a Flex Financial Group within the Stryker organization. And our MAKO group is using that to leverage their expertise to offer different options to our customers, whether they want to buy outright or lease.

Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker CFO; Tim Scannell, Group President, MedSurg & Neurotechnology; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Tim with an update on our 2 recent acquisitions, Sage and Physio-Control. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A.
With Q2 organic sales growth of 6.6%, we continue to demonstrate the strength of Stryker's diversified revenue base, which is allowing us to consistently deliver sales growth at the high end of med tech. This quarter, our growth was powered by robust performance in MedSurg & Neurotechnology, while Orthopaedics was in line. Our decentralized business model is enabling us to drive innovation and strong sales and marketing execution. On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by the U.S., up 9%, while sales outside the U.S. were up 2%, which is continuing to be impacted by ongoing challenges in China.
Beyond the top line achievement, Q2 was highlighted by strong operational expense leverage that reflects our focus on driving cost transformation across divisions and geographies. As previously mentioned, we have a significant opportunity to deliver greater G&A leverage on a multi-year basis, with initiatives such as indirect spending, product life cycle management and the optimization of our IT systems. As we are starting to see the impact from these initiatives, it underscores our conviction of delivering leveraged earning gains. Based on our first half performance, we now look for full year organic sales growth of 6% to 6.5% and adjusted per share earnings of $ 5.70 to $5.80 a share.
I will now turn the call over to Tim."

I'm excited about participating in today's call and providing you with perspectives regarding our recent acquisitions of Sage Products and Physio-Control. I will begin with Sage Products and reiterate the strategic rationa",793,"Thanks, Kevin. Good afternoon. I'm excited about participating in today's call and providing you with perspectives regarding our recent acquisitions of Sage Products and Physio-Control. 
I will begin with Sage Products and reiterate the strategic rationale which drove this acquisition. As we articulated in February, Sage complements Stryker Medical's portfolio of innovative ICU and MedSurg products, with disposables targeted at reducing never events. It also provides access to an important adjacent market that expands our hospital product offerings and improves our mix of single-use versus capital products. Sage's approach to innovation focuses on demonstrating superior clinical outcomes, which underscore the benefits of their products, driving customer adoption and loyalty. These innovation efforts have resulted in unique and highly trusted brands, which are an essential part of nurses' daily interactions with patients and hospital ICUs and MedSurg units. Sage is #1 in all the segments it serves, and we believe that in North America alone, Sage's products address a segment totaling approximately $1.4 billion.
Turning to the financials for Sage. Given that we closed the transaction on April 1, we are able to share a full quarter of sales results. Sage's performance was strong in Q2, with sales growth of roughly 9%. This performance was achieved while contending with an unexpected supply interruption during the quarter that was onetime in nature and has been resolved. Without the supply interruption, Sage's growth in Q2 would have been approximately 14%.
Sage's success has been fueled by their commitment to innovation, which has resulted in a long history of successful new product introductions, including the recently launched AirTAP product. Using proprietary air-assisted technology, AirTAP enables caregivers to provide exceptional care by aiding in the turning and boosting of patients while the patients remain in bed. AirTAP enhances caregiver safety as it requires 80% less force to boost patients versus the typically used drawsheet.
With respect to integration, plans are underway to expand our manufacturing capacity beginning in 2018 to support expected growth. Moreover, our businesses are working to coordinate activities to accelerate revenue in areas such as key account and brand strategies. Our international focus will begin with Europe, where Sage has experienced some initial success, and Canada, where they have done very well. Beyond these markets, we are working to prioritize countries which value proven clinical solutions that eliminate never events. We are excited by the cultural similarities and positive chemistry between Stryker and Sage and expect double-digit revenue growth in the second half.
Turning to Physio-Control. I would like to also reinforce the strategic rationale that led us to acquire this company. As we described in mid-February, Physio-Control complements Stryker Medical's portfolio of innovative and differentiated prehospital and hospital products as Physio-Control is the leader in the development, manufacture and sale of defibrillators and monitors, AEDs and CPR-assist devices. We are excited by the synergistic benefits and market strength that resulted from the combination of Physio-Control with our Medical division. Importantly, the vast majority of Physio-Control sales call points overlap with our Medical division call points. Physio-Control holds the #1 or #2 share position at every major segment it serves. We believe that on a global basis, Physio-Control's products address segments totaling approximately $1.7 billion.
With Stryker's market-leading power cot and Power-LOAD lift system coupled with Physio-Control's suite of defibrillators, monitors and related products, our solution set is extensive. Our existing EMS franchise has enjoyed tremendous success in recent years, with growth significantly higher than the market and Stryker as a whole. Physio-Control's business has an attractive mix of 60% capital and 40% recurring business compared to our EMS business, which is nearly 100% capital. In addition, Physio-Control has an impressive enduring competency and a robust pipeline of products that have recently begun to launched, with additional product launches slated for the next several years. We expect this refreshed product portfolio and the combination of our organizations to result in continued strong sales momentum and greater profitability leverage in the future.
As a reminder, we closed the Physio transaction on April 5. Pro forma Q2 sales grew roughly 9%. On the integration front, our teams are focused on determining the optimal organizational design that best serves our common EMS and hospital customers. In addition, Physio has a significant international structure and our Medical division is assessing opportunities to drive growth by leveraging Physio's international market knowledge, strength and operational infrastructure. We expect high single-digit growth from the Physio-Control business in the second half. 
With these 2 acquisitions, the Medical division is now bigger, stronger, better diversified geographically and has more base business. Encouragingly, Medical had a strong organic Q2 growth result, well integrating these 2 acquisitions.
This concludes my overview commentary on Sage and Physio-Control. Glenn will now discuss our Q2 financials in more detail."

I will focus my comments today on our financial results and key drivers of our second quarter performance. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release.For the quarter, our organic sales growth of 6.6% exceeded",1061,"Thanks, Tim. I will focus my comments today on our financial results and key drivers of our second quarter performance. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release.
For the quarter, our organic sales growth of 6.6% exceeded the high end of the range of our full year expectations despite a tough year-over-year comparison, with growth of 6.9% in the year ago quarter. The quarter included one additional selling day compared to prior year, and consistent with our previous communications, the additional selling day equates to approximately 1% of additional growth. Pricing in the quarter was down 1.3% from the prior year, trending modestly better than we expected. During the quarter, we continued to see strong U.S. sales with organic growth of 8.6%, while international sales posted organic growth of 2%, reflecting continued destocking challenges in China. Our adjusted EPS of $1.39 increased 15.8% from the prior year, primarily driven by our strong top line growth, including the impact from the acquisitions completed in the quarter. Interest related to the recent bond offering unfavorably impacted EPS by $0.05 per share, and foreign exchange unfavorably impacted EPS by $0.03 during the quarter.
Looking at our segment highlights. Orthopaedics delivered constant currency growth of 4.8% and organic growth of 4.5%. The top line was led by U.S. Orthopaedics gains of 5.9%, highlighted by a 9.5% increase in Trauma and Extremities and a 6.8% growth in Knees as momentum continued for our 3D-printed titanium revision cones and our cementless knee products. U.S. Hips posted low single-digit growth due to softness in the revision market. Orthopaedics international delivered constant currency growth of 2.9%, led by a strong performance in our European Knee business. Lastly, we placed 17 MAKO units during the quarter. Overall, our second quarter results continue to reflect strong momentum across our Orthopaedics portfolio.
Our MedSurg segment's constant currency growth was 34.2%, including the impact of the recent acquisitions of Sage and Physio. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, our MedSurg business posted organic growth of 8.5%. Our U.S. MedSurg business continued their strong momentum with organic growth of 11.1%. Instruments had solid US growth of 8%, with strong performance in our power tools business, highlighted by double-digit gains in our micro power tools. Endoscopy continued its momentum from Q1, with U.S. growth of 10.8%, driven by continued success of our 1588 AIM video platform. Excluding the impact of the Sage and Physio acquisitions, Medical had U.S. growth of 16.9%, driven by continued performance of its power cot products as well as solid performance of our bed business. Internationally, MedSurg organic sales were down, 0.5% for the quarter, reflecting ongoing challenges in China primarily related to the distributor destocking. We expect this to continue throughout 2016 as we work with our distributors to drive end customer demand and reduce the buildup in their inventories.
Neurotechnology and Spine posted constant currency growth of 9% and organic growth of 7.5%, with continued strong momentum in our neurotech businesses, which increased 14.4%, while Spine was up 1%. As with our other businesses, U.S. neurotech growth was robust at 15.6%, which reflects the continued strong demand for our Neurovascular products, the Trevo stent retriever and Target Coil, our Neuro Powered Instruments and our craniomaxillofacial fixation products. Our U.S. Spine business grew 4.8% despite experiencing product supply issues but continues to see good demand for our new 3D-printed titanium products. We expect these supply issues to remain into the fourth quarter. Internationally, neurotech constant currency growth of 12.3% reflects the broader market momentum for the Trevo stent retriever and Target Coil products. Spine's international growth was dampened by the aforementioned product supplies issues and continued challenges in China.
Moving on to general operating highlights. Our gross margin on an adjusted basis was roughly flat at 66.2%, down 180 basis points sequentially. We had another quarter of strong impact from our focus on operational efficiencies, including improved productivity and absorption. This was offset by the full impact of our recent acquisitions, including certain accounting reclassifications between gross margin and SG&A to align with Stryker policy, sales mix and negative pricing. 
As for our operating expenses, we continue to focus on internal innovation, with R&D spending of 6.4% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A for the quarter was 34.9%, which was favorable by 120 basis points as compared to the prior year. The improvement reflects the favorable impact of SG&A leverage from our recent acquisitions, the previously mentioned reclassification of certain expenses, our sales mix and continued focus on our operating expense improvements through our CPG program. For the quarter, acquisitions contributed roughly half of our SG&A improvement. Combined, these factors drove a 100 basis point year-over-year increase in our adjusted operating margin to 24.8%.
Lastly, I will provide some highlights on our other income expenses. Other expenses increased due to higher net interest expense related to increased borrowings at the end of the first quarter. We anticipate that future quarterly interest expense will be roughly $30 million, which is consistent with this quarter. Our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 17.6% reflects the benefits of our global tax structure, partially offset by the impact of higher U.S.-based income from our recent acquisitions.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with $3.5 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 38% was held in the U.S. Total debt on the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter was $7.6 billion.
Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $671 million. Finally, as we had previously announced at the end of Q1, we suspended our share repurchases for the remainder of the year.
In terms of guidance, based on our second quarter performance, we expect our full year organic sales growth to be in the range of 6% to 6.5% versus 2016. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate net sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 1% for 2016, with negative pricing being in the range of 1.5% to 2%. Lastly, our guidance for adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2016 now stands in the range of $5.70 to $5.80 for the full year, and we expect the third quarter to be in the range of $1.33 to $1.38.
And now we'll open up the call for Q&A."

It's early. Acquisitions are off to a solid start, but that's going to impact gross margin for the rest of the year. And it impacted more than just product. We made some reclassifications to harmonize Sage and Physio accounting practices with our accounting practices. And this essentially shifted some SG&A expenses up to gross margin in order to sort of align them with how Stryker does the accounting. It's pretty common that we do that, and we don't get a chance to really see it until we really climb into the integration work. So that's one of the things that came out. And then on top of that, I really just need to reiterate that there's a lot of other things that make our margin move around, not just price but FX, geographic mix really impact it.

This is obviously going to be one of the variables that gets factored in as we go through our 2017 budgeting process. But clearly, it's incremental accretion above and beyond the normal earnings power of the businesses as they stand. How much of that flow through to the bottom line, how much of that we reinvest as we think about the opportunities in front of us, all of that will get factored in and will be evident when we give the range. So I wouldn't want to say it's a one for one, just throw it all on top of a normal earnings number because we have to look at the opportunities for reinvestment, recognizing, obviously, it's also incremental accretion. And so some portion of it is likely to play out at the bottom line as well."

So the Berchtold lights, booms and tables have sold well this year. The Pivot products have done very well in our hands as well.

It is fundamentally different than selling implants or disposables, which is why we have a separate dedicated sales force. We also have, for a number of years now, had a Flex Financial Group within the Stryker organization. And our MAKO group is using that to leverage their expertise to offer different options to our customers, whether they want to buy outright or lease. And so that expertise that's been developed for a number of years through MedSurg is clearly enabling a different type of discussion with customers than was possible when MAKO was a stand-alone.

For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Tim with an update on our 2 recent acquisitions, Sage and Physio-Control. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A.
With Q2 organic sales growth of 6.6%, we continue to demonstrate the strength of Stryker's diversified revenue base, which is allowing us to consistently deliver sales growth at the high end of med tech. This quarter, our growth was powered by robust performance in MedSurg & Neurotechnology, while Orthopaedics was in line. Our decentralized business model is enabling us to drive innovation and strong sales and marketing execution. On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by the U.S., up 9%, while sales outside the U.S. were up 2%, which is continuing to be impacted by ongoing challenges in China.
Beyond the top line achievement, Q2 was highlighted by strong operational expense leverage that reflects our focus on driving cost transformation across divisions and geographies. As previously mentioned, we have a significant opportunity to deliver greater G&A leverage on a multi-year basis, with initiatives such as indirect spending, product life cycle management and the optimization of our IT systems. As we are starting to see the impact from these initiatives, it underscores our conviction of delivering leveraged earning gains. Based on our first half performance, we now look for full year organic sales growth of 6% to 6.5% and adjusted per share earnings of $ 5.70 to $5.80 a share.

I'm excited about participating in today's call and providing you with perspectives regarding our recent acquisitions of Sage Products and Physio-Control. I will begin with Sage Products and reiterate the strategic rationa",793,"Thanks, Kevin. Good afternoon. I'm excited about participating in today's call and providing you with perspectives regarding our recent acquisitions of Sage Products and Physio-Control. 
I will begin with Sage Products and reiterate the strategic rationale which drove this acquisition. As we articulated in February, Sage complements Stryker Medical's portfolio of innovative ICU and MedSurg products, with disposables targeted at reducing never events. It also provides access to an important adjacent market that expands our hospital product offerings and improves our mix of single-use versus capital products. Sage's approach to innovation focuses on demonstrating superior clinical outcomes, which underscore the benefits of their products, driving customer adoption and loyalty. These innovation efforts have resulted in unique and highly trusted brands, which are an essential part of nurses' daily interactions with patients and hospital ICUs and MedSurg units. Sage is #1 in all the segments it serves, and we believe that in North America alone, Sage's products address a segment totaling approximately $1.4 billion.
Turning to the financials for Sage. Given that we closed the transaction on April 1, we are able to share a full quarter of sales results. Sage's performance was strong in Q2, with sales growth of roughly 9%. This performance was achieved while contending with an unexpected supply interruption during the quarter that was onetime in nature and has been resolved. Without the supply interruption, Sage's growth in Q2 would have been approximately 14%.
Sage's success has been fueled by their commitment to innovation, which has resulted in a long history of successful new product introductions, including the recently launched AirTAP product. Using proprietary air-assisted technology, AirTAP enables caregivers to provide exceptional care by aiding in the turning and boosting of patients while the patients remain in bed. AirTAP enhances caregiver safety as it requires 80% less force to boost patients versus the typically used drawsheet.
With respect to integration, plans are underway to expand our manufacturing capacity beginning in 2018 to support expected growth. Moreover, our businesses are working to coordinate activities to accelerate revenue in areas such as key account and brand strategies. Our international focus will begin with Europe, where Sage has experienced some initial success, and Canada, where they have done very well. Beyond these markets, we are working to prioritize countries which value proven clinical solutions that eliminate never events. We are excited by the cultural similarities and positive chemistry between Stryker and Sage and expect double-digit revenue growth in the second half.
Turning to Physio-Control. I would like to also reinforce the strategic rationale that led us to acquire this company. As we described in mid-February, Physio-Control complements Stryker Medical's portfolio of innovative and differentiated prehospital and hospital products as Physio-Control is the leader in the development, manufacture and sale of defibrillators and monitors, AEDs and CPR-assist devices. We are excited by the synergistic benefits and market strength that resulted from the combination of Physio-Control with our Medical division. Importantly, the vast majority of Physio-Control sales call points overlap with our Medical division call points. Physio-Control holds the #1 or #2 share position at every major segment it serves. We believe that on a global basis, Physio-Control's products address segments totaling approximately $1.7 billion.
With Stryker's market-leading power cot and Power-LOAD lift system coupled with Physio-Control's suite of defibrillators, monitors and related products, our solution set is extensive. Our existing EMS franchise has enjoyed tremendous success in recent years, with growth significantly higher than the market and Stryker as a whole. Physio-Control's business has an attractive mix of 60% capital and 40% recurring business compared to our EMS business, which is nearly 100% capital. In addition, Physio-Control has an impressive enduring competency and a robust pipeline of products that have recently begun to launched, with additional product launches slated for the next several years. We expect this refreshed product portfolio and the combination of our organizations to result in continued strong sales momentum and greater profitability leverage in the future.
As a reminder, we closed the Physio transaction on April 5. Pro forma Q2 sales grew roughly 9%. On the integration front, our teams are focused on determining the optimal organizational design that best serves our common EMS and hospital customers. In addition, Physio has a significant international structure and our Medical division is assessing opportunities to drive growth by leveraging Physio's international market knowledge, strength and operational infrastructure. We expect high single-digit growth from the Physio-Control business in the second half. 
With these 2 acquisitions, the Medical division is now bigger, stronger, better diversified geographically and has more base business. Encouragingly, Medical had a strong organic Q2 growth result, well integrating these 2 acquisitions.
This concludes my overview commentary on Sage and Physio-Control. Glenn will now discuss our Q2 financials in more detail."

I will focus my comments today on our financial results and key drivers of our second quarter performance. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release.For the quarter, our organic sales growth of 6.6% exceeded",1061,"Thanks, Tim. I will focus my comments today on our financial results and key drivers of our second quarter performance. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release.
For the quarter, our organic sales growth of 6.6% exceeded the high end of the range of our full year expectations despite a tough year-over-year comparison, with growth of 6.9% in the year ago quarter. The quarter included one additional selling day compared to prior year, and consistent with our previous communications, the additional selling day equates to approximately 1% of additional growth. Pricing in the quarter was down 1.3% from the prior year, trending modestly better than we expected. During the quarter, we continued to see strong U.S. sales with organic growth of 8.6%, while international sales posted organic growth of 2%, reflecting continued destocking challenges in China. Our adjusted EPS of $1.39 increased 15.8% from the prior year, primarily driven by our strong top line growth, including the impact from the acquisitions completed in the quarter. Interest related to the recent bond offering unfavorably impacted EPS by $0.05 per share, and foreign exchange unfavorably impacted EPS by $0.03 during the quarter.
Looking at our segment highlights. Orthopaedics delivered constant currency growth of 4.8% and organic growth of 4.5%. The top line was led by U.S. Orthopaedics gains of 5.9%, highlighted by a 9.5% increase in Trauma and Extremities and a 6.8% growth in Knees as momentum continued for our 3D-printed titanium revision cones and our cementless knee products. U.S. Hips posted low single-digit growth due to softness in the revision market. Orthopaedics international delivered constant currency growth of 2.9%, led by a strong performance in our European Knee business. Lastly, we placed 17 MAKO units during the quarter. Overall, our second quarter results continue to reflect strong momentum across our Orthopaedics portfolio.
Our MedSurg segment's constant currency growth was 34.2%, including the impact of the recent acquisitions of Sage and Physio. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, our MedSurg business posted organic growth of 8.5%. Our U.S. MedSurg business continued their strong momentum with organic growth of 11.1%. Instruments had solid US growth of 8%, with strong performance in our power tools business, highlighted by double-digit gains in our micro power tools. Endoscopy continued its momentum from Q1, with U.S. growth of 10.8%, driven by continued success of our 1588 AIM video platform. Excluding the impact of the Sage and Physio acquisitions, Medical had U.S. growth of 16.9%, driven by continued performance of its power cot products as well as solid performance of our bed business. Internationally, MedSurg organic sales were down, 0.5% for the quarter, reflecting ongoing challenges in China primarily related to the distributor destocking. We expect this to continue throughout 2016 as we work with our distributors to drive end customer demand and reduce the buildup in their inventories.
Neurotechnology and Spine posted constant currency growth of 9% and organic growth of 7.5%, with continued strong momentum in our neurotech businesses, which increased 14.4%, while Spine was up 1%. As with our other businesses, U.S. neurotech growth was robust at 15.6%, which reflects the continued strong demand for our Neurovascular products, the Trevo stent retriever and Target Coil, our Neuro Powered Instruments and our craniomaxillofacial fixation products. Our U.S. Spine business grew 4.8% despite experiencing product supply issues but continues to see good demand for our new 3D-printed titanium products. We expect these supply issues to remain into the fourth quarter. Internationally, neurotech constant currency growth of 12.3% reflects the broader market momentum for the Trevo stent retriever and Target Coil products. Spine's international growth was dampened by the aforementioned product supplies issues and continued challenges in China.
Moving on to general operating highlights. Our gross margin on an adjusted basis was roughly flat at 66.2%, down 180 basis points sequentially. We had another quarter of strong impact from our focus on operational efficiencies, including improved productivity and absorption. This was offset by the full impact of our recent acquisitions, including certain accounting reclassifications between gross margin and SG&A to align with Stryker policy, sales mix and negative pricing. 
As for our operating expenses, we continue to focus on internal innovation, with R&D spending of 6.4% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A for the quarter was 34.9%, which was favorable by 120 basis points as compared to the prior year. The improvement reflects the favorable impact of SG&A leverage from our recent acquisitions, the previously mentioned reclassification of certain expenses, our sales mix and continued focus on our operating expense improvements through our CPG program. For the quarter, acquisitions contributed roughly half of our SG&A improvement. Combined, these factors drove a 100 basis point year-over-year increase in our adjusted operating margin to 24.8%.
Lastly, I will provide some highlights on our other income expenses. Other expenses increased due to higher net interest expense related to increased borrowings at the end of the first quarter. We anticipate that future quarterly interest expense will be roughly $30 million, which is consistent with this quarter. Our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 17.6% reflects the benefits of our global tax structure, partially offset by the impact of higher U.S.-based income from our recent acquisitions.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with $3.5 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 38% was held in the U.S. Total debt on the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter was $7.6 billion.
Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $671 million. Finally, as we had previously announced at the end of Q1, we suspended our share repurchases for the remainder of the year.
In terms of guidance, based on our second quarter performance, we expect our full year organic sales growth to be in the range of 6% to 6.5% versus 2016. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate net sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 1% for 2016, with negative pricing being in the range of 1.5% to 2%. Lastly, our guidance for adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2016 now stands in the range of $5.70 to $5.80 for the full year, and we expect the third quarter to be in the range of $1.33 to $1.38.
And now we'll open up the call for Q&A."

So there is, for me, no concern there. We see these changes from quarter to quarter.

And we're not seeing anything different in this quarter other than it was obviously a weaker-than-normal quarter versus Q1 being a stronger-than-normal quarter. In terms of CJRs, it went to effect April 1. We haven't seen any impact. I think it's simply too early. As you know, there's no penalty until after the first full year.

First of all, if you look at the sequential drop in margin, Q1 to Q2, roughly 180 basis points, I mean, Q2 was really impacted by mix especially, but not just sales mix but by adding in the acquisitions. It's early. Acquisitions are off to a solid start, but that's going to impact gross margin for the rest of the year. And it impacted more than just product. We made some reclassifications to harmonize Sage and Physio accounting practices with our accounting practices. And this essentially shifted some SG&A expenses up to gross margin in order to sort of align them with how Stryker does the accounting. It's pretty common that we do that, and we don't get a chance to really see it until we really climb into the integration work. So that's one of the things that came out. And then on top of that, I really just need to reiterate that there's a lot of other things that make our margin move around, not just price but FX, geographic mix really impact it. And all of those are pretty hard to forecast to a -- to sort of a single-point estimate.

But our efforts surround largely education, trying to assist, trying to ask the right questions, trying to connect people with the right consultants, things like that and make sure their stroke centers are properly operating. And they're getting the patients from the ER to the cap or the interventional lab to treat these patients. So it takes many forms. It takes many years.

And moreover, we've been selling very expensive capital on our MedSurg businesses for literally years and years. So we understand how to sell capital. It is fundamentally different than selling implants or disposables, which is why we have a separate dedicated sales force. We also have, for a number of years now, had a Flex Financial Group within the Stryker organization. And our MAKO group is using that to leverage their expertise to offer different options to our customers, whether they want to buy outright or lease. And so that expertise that's been developed for a number of years through MedSurg is clearly enabling a different type of discussion with customers than was possible when MAKO was a stand-alone.

Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations.
For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Katherine with an update on MAKO and our November analyst meeting. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call for Q&A. 
We achieved another quarter of solid organic sales growth coming in at 6.2% and fueled by a strong showing for both MedSurg and Neurotechnology, with both delivering roughly 7% increases.
Orthopaedics growth was consistent at approximately 5% organically. On a geographic basis, Q3 sales were balanced with a 6% increase in the U.S. and a 6.7% gain in international, driven by strong momentum in Europe and a return to growth in emerging markets.
We are pleased with the performance of our acquisitions, including both Sage and Physio-Control, which are well positioned to help us drive stronger organic sales growth for Stryker in the coming years.
A strong top line performance, coupled with our ongoing focus on G&A leverage, resulted in an EPS of $1.39, up 11.2% and $0.01 above the high end of our target range. Based on our performance for the first 9 months of 2016, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments, with organic sales growth for the full year expected at 6% to 6.5%. We are narrowing our adjusted EPS range to the upper end, which now stands at $5.75 to $5.80 per share. Overall, we believe the strength of our people, diversified revenue model and new product flow positions us well to continue to deliver sales at the high end of med tech, with leveraged earnings gains. 
We look forward to providing our 2017 financial guidance on our Q4 earnings call in January.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine."

My comments on today's call will include an update on MAKO as well as a preview of our upcoming analyst meeting. 
Starting with MAKO. Results in the quarter were strong with a total of 30 robots installed globally, representing a roughly 75% year-over-year increase with 23 in the U.S. Consistent with prior quarters, approximately 40% of the installations were in competitive accounts where Stryker has no or relatively low market share. Demand for the MAKO robot is being fueled by the expanded indications, including the Total Knee, which began a limited launch in June. Since that time, we have had KOL surgeons trained on the robots for the Total Knee, including those with prior robot experience but with less exposure to our triathlon knee as well as surgeons who had not previously used a robot for joint reconstruction. As we discussed previously, by observing both these groups, we are optimizing the training protocol. 
Of note, since the start of the limited market really for the Total Knee, over 200 cases have been performed, and we've been pleased with the results to date. We are targeting the 2017 AAOS meeting to move into the full commercial launch. 
I will now shift to the analyst meeting, which will be held on November 9 at our Orthopaedics headquarters in New Jersey. In order to optimize utility of this meeting, we will be focusing the formal part of the meeting on several key areas. This will include a MAKO physician panel with 2 surgeons who have been part of the limited market release. We will also have a Stryker Performance Solutions panel, which will include an XPS customer and focus on how we've been able to deploy our expertise in the joint reconstruction episode of care to help reduce our procedural costs. 
Turning to cost transformation for growth. Lonny Carpenter, Group President of Global Quality and Operations, will provide an update on the various initiatives within CTG, including the expected financial contribution over the next 2 [ph] years. Glenn will provide a financial update, including our longer-term targets. We will conclude the formal part of the meeting with a Q&A session with the leadership team. We will then move to the product fair, which will include product highlights for MedSurg & Neurotechnology and opportunity to interact in formerly with the broader Stryker leadership team.
We hope you will be able to join us for the meeting. The event details at the pin agenda, including the various guest speakers and their backgrounds, are available on the event registration site. 
With that, I will now turn the calll over to Glenn."

Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. 
Our organic sales grew 6.2% in the quarter, which was within our range of full year expectations of 6% to 6.5%, with no difference in selling days. Pricing in the quarter was down 1.3% from the prior year, while foreign currency exchange had a nominal impact on sales. 
U.S. sales continued to demonstrate strong momentum, with organic growth of 6%, reflecting solid performances across our portfolio, especially in MedSurg and Neurotech. International sales grew 6.7 organically, highlighted by solid gains in Europe, Canada and Australia, somewhat offset by the continued impact of our previously discussed destocking issues in China. We expect that the fourth quarter will show some improvement in our China business, as prior year comparables continue to ease. 
Our adjusted EPS of $1.39 increased 11.2% [ph] from the prior year, reflecting strong sales growth, accretive acquisitions and good operating expense control. Our third quarter EPS was negatively impacted by $0.03 related to transactional foreign currency exchange. 
Focusing on our segment highlights. Orthopaedics delivered constant currency growth of 5.3% and organic growth of 4.8%, led by the U.S. organic growth of 4.7%. These gains reflect solid performances in Trauma and Extremities at 6.9% and Knees and 5.1%. This growth reflects strong demand for our 3D-printed products, our Foot & Ankle portfolio and our MAKO platform, which had 30 units installed, including 7 outside the U.S. Orthopaedics international delivered constant currency growth of 6.3% and organic growth of 5.1%, led by our European business. 
MedSurg posted strong gains across all businesses in the quarter, with constant currency growth of 33% and organic gains of 7.3%, which included a 7.7% increase in the U.S. 
Instruments, which was up 5.2% in the U.S., maintained good momentum with its waste management business and the newly launched Neptune 3 and continued strong performance related to its Navigation business.
Endoscopy delivered U.S. growth of 10.4%, driven by strong double-digit performances of its camera and light source products and strong gains in its communications, sports medicine and ProCare service businesses. 
Our Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 6.8%, driven by double-digit growth of its core bed and power cut products. On a comparable basis, Medical's Physio business was up 6.3%. Its Sage business grew 12.5%, including the impact of the recent recall. Excluding this, Sage grew 15%. We are pleased with these results and the ongoing integration efforts at Medical. 
Internationally, MedSurg organic sales growth was 6%, which reflects strong European and Australian sales and some easing of the MedSurg comparable in China. 
Neurotechnology and Spine continues to drive of above-market performance with constant currency growth of 8.7% and organic growth of 6.9%. This growth reflects continued strong demand for our Neurotech products. 
U.S. Neurotech posted growth of 9.1% in the quarter, highlighted by our AAS product and our Neuro Powered Instruments. 
Our Spine business in the U.S. continued to see some supply issues, offset somewhat by strong demand for our 3D-printed interbody Tritanium products. As I have said last quarter, we expect the supply issues to remain into the fourth quarter.
Internationally, Neurotech had constant currency growth of 16.7%. This performance was driven by continued strong demand for our Trevo Stentriever and Target Coil products in Europe and Asia. 
Spine's international growth was 1.6% and was impacted by the aforementioned supply issues and challenges in China. 
Now I will focus on the operating highlights within the quarter. Our gross margin which, on an adjusted basis, was 66.3%, was down 60 basis points from the prior year quarter. Gross margin was favorably impacted by absorption and productivity gains, which was offset by mix, including the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange. 
SG&A for the third quarter was 34.9% of sales on an adjusted basis, which was favorable by 70 basis points as compared to the prior year quarter. This improvement reflects favorable leverage from continued focus on operating expense improvement through our CTG program, cost-containment efforts and business mix, including leverage from our recent acquisitions. 
We continue to invest in internal innovation with R&D, which is up 10 basis points year-over-year to 6.5% of sales. 
In total, adjusted operating expenses at 41.4% of sales was favorable 60 basis points to the prior year quarter, and these results continue to reflect our focus on leverage growth.
In summary, our operating margin was 24.9% of sales in Q3, flat year-over-year but up 64 basis points on a year-to-date basis. This performance reflects the positive results from our various CTG programs, continued cost control and favorable accretion from acquisitions, offset by business mix, pricing and foreign exchange.
Lastly, I will provide some highlights on other income and expense. Other expenses increased due to the higher net interest expense related to increased borrowings at the end of the first quarter. During the third quarter, we also paid down $750 million of debt, and accounting for the impact of this, we anticipate our future quarterly run rate of interest expense to be approximately $65 million.
Our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 17.5% reflects the benefits of our global tax structure, partially offset by the impact of higher U.S.-based income from our recent acquisitions.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with $3 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 80% was held outside the U.S. Total debt on the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter was $6.8 billion. 
Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $1.2 billion. Finally, as we have previously announced at the end of Q1, we have suspended our share repurchases for the remainder of 2016.
In terms of guidance, we reconfirm our previous full year organic sales growth range of 6% to 6.5% for 2016.
If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect a neutral impact in the fourth quarter and a negative foreign currency impact of less than 0.5% for the full year.
Lastly, our guidance for adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2016 is now expected to be in the range of $5.75 to $5.80 for the full year. 
And now I will open up the call for Q&A."

Now whether we'll get back to double-digit as we experienced in prior years, it's a little early for me to say, but certainly, look more positive than it has been over the past year."

Longer term, clinical data on that is going to take us time to collect. We will be garnering that, but that's going to be 1-, 2-, 3-year data and obviously will take that long. I think it'll be a great opportunity at the panel at the Analyst Day where we're going to have a surgeon who had no experience with a robot prior to becoming part of the limited market release of the knee, as well as a longer-term robot user to ask those questions and hear what their experiences has been.

And there was a bunch of questions, as you know, come out of them where people are asking about comments that you guys have made so maybe I thought speak the opportunity to clarify a couple of them. And Katherine, Kevin chime in here. 2 sets of comments were Kevin just about your outlook for the Trauma business and the Hip business and some potential deceleration in growth there. And then naturally, people try to get you to comment on 2017 preliminary and have to think about operating and financial leverage, excluding the impact of the acquisitions. There seems to be some confusion around that. So maybe just want to spend a minute on both the outlook for the Trauma and then the Hip business in light of all the focus on the Knee side and then just comment, if you would, about how we should think about operating leverage heading into '17 without, obviously, giving guidance."

I'll take the Trauma and the Hip question, and then I'll pass it over to Katherine to talk about, I think, some perceptions about 2017. So what I've been saying for some time on the Trauma business is that sustaining 15% growth year-over-year is pretty unlikely. We've done that for over 3 years coming to this year. If you look at last year's third quarter, we grew 15.1% in the U.S. And so to put up a 7% growth against that comp is still a pretty solid performance. But not a big numbers as we've been submitting that Trauma will start to slow down a little bit in terms of its growth rate but certainly performing above market and I think still a strong solid performance this quarter. But the only signal there is that sustaining that level of outperformance 3x the market is not likely to do indefinitely. So no concerns. We have a very strong Trauma leadership team, strong business, strong pipeline, so very bullish about that division. As it relates to Hips, we are longer in our product cycle, with Accolate II being one of the newer product that we launched a few years ago. And a lot of excitement in knees. And as you know, same sales force that sells both Hips and knees, we have a big launch upcoming with MAKO Total Knee. We have a lot of cementless products in the Knee portfolio. So I would say that there's been a bit of attention focused on these, and we've seen this in our industry for decades that it's very difficult to be able to focus on both products equally. So the fact that our Hip growth, which have been above-market for about 3 or 4 years, is now moving, let's say, more in line with market is not also surprising."

I will tell you, candidly, we were surprised as anybody that there was misperception. We try to be very consistent in terms of our goal of growing sales at the high end of med tech. We think the med tech markets are largely stable, at least for segments where our product portfolio competes. But as Kevin said, in his prepared comments, start of this call, we feel really good about our ability to continue to deliver that. The specific range around that in which may have been somewhere of the misperceptions came, we will talk about in January, as we do every year.

Like you mentioned, there's lots of variables that impact our margin, not only price, but FX, acquisition. And certainly, one of the biggest factors is mix, and the mix plays out in 2 ways. It plays out in sort of geographic mix but also sort of business and product mix. And so as I look year-over-year for the third quarter, really probably the biggest impact that we had was related to business mix in terms of how much MedSurg versus Orthopaedics versus international we had last year versus this year. And then on the FX front, we entered the hedging program back when foreign currency was a lot more volatile, and the whole idea was to lock in the predictability of foreign currency for us. So like you had mentioned, currencies move up and down. Our hedging program provides stability and predictability to us. And so for the third quarter, I think, as I said, there'll be sort of a nominal impact on sales related to translational, but that will have, potentially, a minor impact similar to this quarter related to transactional FX. And that's where, I think, we'll come out."

Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations.
For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Katherine with an update on MAKO and our November analyst meeting. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A.
We achieved another quarter of solid organic sales growth, coming in at 6.2% and fueled by a strong showing for both MedSurg & Neurotechnology, with both delivering roughly 7% increases. Orthopaedics growth was consistent at approximately 5% organically. On a geographic basis, Q3 sales were balanced with a 6% increase in the U.S. and a 6.7% gain in international, driven by strong momentum in Europe and a return to growth in emerging markets.
We are pleased with the performance of our acquisitions, including both Sage and Physio-Control, which are well positioned to help us drive stronger organic sales growth for Stryker in the coming years.
A strong top line performance, coupled with our ongoing focus on G&A leverage, resulted in an EPS of $1.39, up 11.2% and $0.01 above the high end of our target range. Based on our performance for the first 9 months of 2016, we are confident in our ability to deliver our commitments, with organic sales growth for the full year expected at 6% to 6.5%.
We are narrowing our adjusted EPS range to the upper end, which now stands at $5.75 to $5.80 per share. Overall, we believe the strength of our people, diversified revenue model and new product flow positions us well to continue to deliver sales at the high end of med tech with leveraged earnings gains. 
We look forward to providing our 2017 financial guidance on our Q4 earnings call in January.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine."

My comments on today's call will include an update on MAKO as well as a preview of our upcoming analyst meeting.
Starting with MAKO. Results in the quarter were strong with a total of 30 robots installed globally, representing a roughly 75% year-over-year increase with 23 in the U.S. Consistent with prior quarters, approximately 40% of the installations were in competitive accounts where Stryker has no or relatively low market share.
Demand for the MAKO robot is being fueled by the expanded indications, including the total knee, which began a limited launch in June. Since that time, we have had KOL surgeons trained on the robots for the total knee, including those with prior robot experience but with less exposure to our Triathlon knee as well as surgeons who had not previously used a robot for joint reconstruction. As we discussed previously, by observing both these groups, we are optimizing the training protocol.
Of note, since the start of the limited market release for the total knee, over 200 cases have been performed, and we've been pleased with the results to date. We are targeting the 2017 AAOS meeting to move into the full commercial launch.
I will now shift to the analyst meeting, which will be held on November 9 at our Orthopaedics headquarters in New Jersey. In order to optimize the utility of this meeting, we will be focusing the formal part of the meeting on several key areas. This will include a MAKO physician panel with 2 surgeons who have been part of the limited market release. We will also have a Stryker Performance Solutions panel, which will include an SPS customer and focus on how we've been able to deploy our expertise in the joint reconstruction episode of care to help reduce our procedural costs.
Turning to cost transformation for growth. Lonny Carpenter, Group President of Global Quality and Operations, will provide an update on the various initiatives within CTG, including the expected financial contribution over the next 2 years. Glenn Boehnlein will provide a financial update, including our longer-term targets. We will conclude the formal part of the meeting with a Q&A session with the leadership team. We will then move to the product fair, which will include product highlights for MedSurg & Neurotechnology and will afford [ph] the opportunity to interact informally with the broader Stryker leadership team.
We hope you will be able to join us for the meeting. The event details and complete agenda, including the various guest speakers and their backgrounds, are available on the event registration site.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn."

Today, I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and performance drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release.
Our organic sales grew 6.2% in the quarter, which was within our range of full year expectations of 6% to 6.5%, with no difference in selling days. Pricing in the quarter was down 1.3% from the prior year, while foreign currency exchange had a nominal impact on sales.
U.S. sales continue to demonstrate strong momentum with organic growth of 6%, reflecting solid performances across our portfolio, especially in MedSurg & Neurotech. International sales grew 6.7% organically, highlighted by solid gains in Europe, Canada and Australia, somewhat offset by the continued impact of our previously discussed destocking issues in China. We expect that the fourth quarter will show some improvement on our  China business as prior year comparables continued to ease.
Our adjusted EPS of $1.39 increased 11.2% from the prior year, reflecting strong sales growth, accretive acquisitions and good operating expense control. Our third quarter EPS was negatively impacted by $0.03 related to transactional foreign currency exchange.
Focusing on our segment highlights. Orthopaedics delivered constant currency growth of 5.3% and organic growth of 4.8%, led by the U.S. organic growth of 4.7%. These gains reflect solid performances in Trauma and Extremities at 6.9% and knees at 5.1%. This growth reflects strong demand for our 3D-printed products, our Foot & Ankle portfolio and our MAKO platform, which had 30 units installed, including 7 outside the U.S. Orthopaedics international delivered constant currency growth of 6.3% and organic growth of 5.1%, led by our European business.
MedSurg posted strong gains across all businesses in the quarter with constant currency growth of 33% and organic gains of 7.3%, which included a 7.7% increase in the U.S. Instruments, which was up 5.2% in the U.S., maintained good momentum with its waste management business and the newly launched Neptune 3 and continued strong performance related to its Navigation business.
Endoscopy delivered U.S. growth of 10.4%, driven by strong double-digit performances of its camera and light source products and strong gains in its communications, sports medicine and ProCare service businesses. 
Our Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 6.8%, driven by double-digit growth of its core bed and tower cot products. On a comparable basis, Medical's Physio business was up 6.3%. Its Sage business grew 12.5%, including the impact of the recent recall. Excluding this, Sage grew 15%. We are pleased with these results and the ongoing integration efforts at Medical.
Internationally, MedSurg organic sales growth was 6%, which reflects strong European and Australian sales and some easing of the MedSurg comparable in China. Neurotechnology and Spine continues to drive of above-market performance with constant currency growth of 8.7% and organic growth of 6.9%. This growth reflects continued strong demand for our Neurotech products. U.S. Neurotech posted growth of 9.1% in the quarter, highlighted by our AIS products and our Neuro Powered Instruments.
Our Spine business in the U.S. continued to see some supply issues, offset somewhat by strong demand for our 3D-printed interbody Tritanium products. As I have said last quarter, we expect the supply issues to remain into the fourth quarter.
Internationally, Neurotech had constant currency growth of 16.7%. This performance was driven by continued strong demand for our Trevo stent retriever and Target Coil products in Europe and Asia. Spine's international growth was 1.6% and was impacted by the aforementioned supply issues and challenges in China.
Now I will focus on the operating highlights within the quarter. Our gross margin, which, on an adjusted basis, was 66.3%, was down 60 basis points from the prior year quarter. Gross margin was favorably impacted by absorption and productivity gains, which was offset by mix, including the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange.
SG&A for the third quarter was 34.9% of sales on an adjusted basis, which was favorable by 70 basis points as compared to the prior year quarter. This improvement reflects favorable leverage from continued focus on operating expense improvements through our CTG program, cost-containment efforts and business mix, including leverage from our recent acquisitions.
We continue to invest in internal innovation with R&D, which is up 10 basis points year-over-year to 6.5% of sales. In total, adjusted operating expenses at 41.4% of sales was favorable 60 basis points to the prior year quarter, and these results continue to reflect our focus on leverage growth.
In summary, our operating margin was 24.9% of sales in Q3, flat year-over-year but up 64 basis points on a year-to-date basis. This performance reflects the positive results from our various CTG programs, continued cost control and favorable accretion from acquisitions, offset by business mix, pricing and foreign exchange.
Lastly, I will provide some highlights on other income and expense. Other expenses increased due to the higher net interest expense related to increased borrowings at the end of the first quarter. During the third quarter, we also paid down $750 million of debt. And accounting for the impact of this, we anticipate our future quarterly run rate of interest expense to be approximately $65 million.
Our third quarter adjusted effective tax adjusted effect of tax rate of 17.5% reflects the benefits of our global tax structure, partially offset by the impact of higher U.S.-based income from our recent acquisitions.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with $3 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 80% was held outside the U.S. Total debt on the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter was $6.8 billion.
Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $1.2 billion. Finally, as we have previously announced at the end of Q1, we have suspended our share repurchases for the remainder of 2016.
In terms of guidance, we reconfirm our previous full year organic sales growth range of 6% to 6.5% for 2016. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect a neutral impact in the fourth quarter and a negative foreign currency impact of less than 0.5% for the full year.
Lastly, our guidance for adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2016 is now expected to be in the range of $5.75 to $5.80 for the full year.
And now I will open up the call for Q&A."

Our other emerging market countries performed very well. China's still a bit of a laggard, but as Glenn's mentioned in his prepared remarks, we expect China to return to growth in the fourth quarter. So we're starting to see an improvement. Part of this is really the comparables that we're sort of lapping the years of sort of core performance. So we would expect a bit of a turnaround. But I -- it's really early. It's only one quarter, but I'm starting to see a trend that we will see growth. Now whether we'll get back to double digit as we experienced in prior years, it's a little early for me to say. But certainly, they'll look as much more positive than it has been over the past year."

And Katherine, Kevin, chime in here, 2 sets of comments were -- Kevin, just about your outlook for the Trauma business and the Hip business and some potential deceleration in growth. And then naturally, people try to get you to comment on 2017 preliminarily and how to think about operating a financial leverage, excluding the impact of the acquisitions. There seems to be some confusion around that. So maybe just want to spend a minute on both the outlook for the Trauma and then the Hip business in light of the -- all the focus on the knee side and then just comment, if you would, about how we should think about operating leverage heading into '17 without obviously giving guidance."

I'll take the Trauma and Hip question, and then I'll pass it over to Katherine to talk about, I think, some misperceptions around 2017.

I'll take the Trauma and Hip question, and then I'll pass it over to Katherine to talk about, I think, some misperceptions around 2017. So what I've been saying for some time on the Trauma business is that sustaining 15% growth quarter after quarter is pretty unlikely. We've done that for over 3 years coming into this year. If you look at last year's third quarter, we grew 15.1% in the U.S. And so to put up a 7% growth against that comp is still a pretty solid performance. But while big numbers is -- we've been signaling that Trauma will start to slow down a little bit in terms of its growth rate, but certainly performing above market and I think it still had a strong solid performance this quarter. But the only signal there is that sustaining that level of outperformance 3x the market is not likely to do indefinitely. So no concerns. We have a very strong Trauma leadership team, strong business, strong pipeline. I'm still very bullish about that division. As it relates to Hips, we're longer in our product cycle, with Accolade II being one of the newer products that we launched a few years ago. And a lot of excitement in knees. And as you know, same sales force that sells both Hips and Knees. We have a big launch upcoming with MAKO total knee. We have a lot of cementless products in the knee portfolio. So I would say that there's been a bit of attention focused on these. And we've seen this in our industry for decades that it's very difficult to be able to focus on both products equally. So the fact that our Hip growth, which have been above market for about 3 or 4 years, is now moving, let's say, more in line with market is not also surprising."

And just going back to some of the misperceptions around some of the conferences, the health care conferences in September, I will tell you, candidly, we were surprised if anybody -- that there was any misperception. We try to be very consistent in terms of our goal of growing sales at the high end of med tech. We think the med tech markets are largely stable, at least the segments where our product portfolio competes. But as Kevin said in his prepared comments at the start of this call, we feel really good about our ability to continue to deliver that. The specific range around that, in which may have been, where some of the misperceptions came, we will talk about in January as we do every year. So to the degree of unwillingness to give guidance ahead of when we normally do it caused some concern, I think that was incorrect. We feel great about the momentum and the product portfolio, and we'll look to specify that in terms of financial ranges in January."

And then I had one follow-up just on the Ortho side, if I could. So one of the things you've talked about in your presentation and the Q&A afterwards, there was just a buildout you've put in place around 3D-printed products in general. Of course, that drives the Spine portfolio of really one key product at the moment. But also, your press-fit knee, cementless knee platform you've talked a lot about. So I'm wondering, as you build that out, I mean, just given the proportion of your business, given the performance of your business, how are you prioritizing, I guess? Are you getting leverage across those 2 platforms and the way you manufacture and how you're sort of thinking about which one of these sort of high-demand products gets the volume over time?

We also have additional new products on the knee side, our 3D-printed revision cones and sleeves and as we just mentioned, our 3D-printed cementless knee, which is really driving us to now low double-digit penetration for cementless knees, which is well above the industry. So I think right now, you're just in a period where there's a lot of happening on the knee side and a lot will continue to happen as we go to full commercial launch. We will be introducing more hip products, but sales force likes to focus on what's new and hot. And clearly, a lot of that momentum right now is on the knee side.

If you look at MAKO prior to our acquisition, they were able to obtain about 18% of the knee market over a 4-year period. There were not a proven entity. They weren't even an orthopedic company. So we really believe this about technology adoption certainly in the first couple of years. It's really around behavior, which surgeons believe in technology, and we're going to go to the surgeons that believe in it. There are many skeptics, as you know, with all disruptive technology.

But could you talk about any of the drivers in gross margin between maybe price, currency or product or geographic mix, just kind of big buckets, kind of what drove the change in gross margin this year or this quarter?

I think if you look quarter-to-quarter, Q3 to Q4, our margin is fairly consistent. And I talked about this before. There's -- like you mentioned, there's lots of variables that impact our margin, not only price, but the FX, acquisitions. And certainly, one of the biggest factors is mix, and the mix plays out in 2 ways. It plays out in sort of geographic mix but also sort of business and product mix. And so as I look year-over-year for third quarter, really, probably the biggest impact that we had was related to business mix in terms of how much MedSurg versus Orthopaedics versus international we had last year versus this year. And then on the FX front, we entered the hedging program back when foreign currency was a lot more volatile, and the whole idea was to lock in the predictability of foreign currency for us. So like you had mentioned, currencies move up and down. Our hedging program provides stability and predictability to us. And so for the third quarter, I think, as I said, there will be sort of a nominal impact on sales related to translational, but that will have, potentially, a minor impact similar to this quarter related to transactional FX. And that's where, I think, we'll come out."

Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations.
For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Katherine with an update on MAKO and our November analyst meeting. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A.
We achieved another quarter of solid organic sales growth, coming in at 6.2% and fueled by a strong showing for both MedSurg & Neurotechnology, with both delivering roughly 7% increases. Orthopaedics growth was consistent at approximately 5% organically. On a geographic basis, Q3 sales were balanced with a 6% increase in the U.S. and a 6.7% gain in international, driven by strong momentum in Europe and a return to growth in emerging markets.
We are pleased with the performance of our acquisitions, including both Sage and Physio-Control, which are well positioned to help us drive stronger organic sales growth for Stryker in the coming years.
A strong top line performance, coupled with our ongoing focus on G&A leverage, resulted in an EPS of $1.39, up 11.2% and $0.01 above the high end of our target range. Based on our performance for the first 9 months of 2016, we are confident in our ability to deliver our commitments, with organic sales growth for the full year expected at 6% to 6.5%.
We are narrowing our adjusted EPS range to the upper end, which now stands at $5.75 to $5.80 per share. Overall, we believe the strength of our people, diversified revenue model and new product flow positions us well to continue to deliver sales at the high end of med tech with leveraged earnings gains. 
We look forward to providing our 2017 financial guidance on our Q4 earnings call in January.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine."

My comments on today's call will include an update on MAKO as well as a preview of our upcoming analyst meeting.
Starting with MAKO. Results in the quarter were strong with a total of 30 robots installed globally, representing a roughly 75% year-over-year increase with 23 in the U.S. Consistent with prior quarters, approximately 40% of the installations were in competitive accounts where Stryker has no or relatively low market share.
Demand for the MAKO robot is being fueled by the expanded indications, including the total knee, which began a limited launch in June. Since that time, we have had KOL surgeons trained on the robots for the total knee, including those with prior robot experience but with less exposure to our Triathlon knee as well as surgeons who had not previously used a robot for joint reconstruction. As we discussed previously, by observing both these groups, we are optimizing the training protocol.
Of note, since the start of the limited market release for the total knee, over 200 cases have been performed, and we've been pleased with the results to date. We are targeting the 2017 AAOS meeting to move into the full commercial launch.
I will now shift to the analyst meeting, which will be held on November 9 at our Orthopaedics headquarters in New Jersey. In order to optimize the utility of this meeting, we will be focusing the formal part of the meeting on several key areas. This will include a MAKO physician panel with 2 surgeons who have been part of the limited market release. We will also have a Stryker Performance Solutions panel, which will include an SPS customer and focus on how we've been able to deploy our expertise in the joint reconstruction episode of care to help reduce our procedural costs.
Turning to cost transformation for growth. Lonny Carpenter, Group President of Global Quality and Operations, will provide an update on the various initiatives within CTG, including the expected financial contribution over the next 2 years. Glenn Boehnlein will provide a financial update, including our longer-term targets. We will conclude the formal part of the meeting with a Q&A session with the leadership team. We will then move to the product fair, which will include product highlights for MedSurg & Neurotechnology and will afford the opportunity to interact informally with the broader Stryker leadership team.
We hope you will be able to join us for the meeting. The event details and complete agenda, including the various guest speakers and their backgrounds, are available on the event registration site.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn."

Today, I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and performance drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release.
Our organic sales grew 6.2% in the quarter, which was within our range of full year expectations of 6% to 6.5%, with no difference in selling days. Pricing in the quarter was down 1.3% from the prior year, while foreign currency exchange had a nominal impact on sales.
U.S. sales continue to demonstrate strong momentum with organic growth of 6%, reflecting solid performances across our portfolio, especially in MedSurg & Neurotech. International sales grew 6.7% organically, highlighted by solid gains in Europe, Canada and Australia, somewhat offset by the continued impact of our previously discussed destocking issues in China. We expect that the fourth quarter will show some improvement in our  China business as prior year comparables continued to ease.
Our adjusted EPS of $1.39 increased 11.2% from the prior year, reflecting strong sales growth, accretive acquisitions and good operating expense control. Our third quarter EPS was negatively impacted by $0.03 related to transactional foreign currency exchange.
Focusing on our segment highlights. Orthopaedics delivered constant currency growth of 5.3% and organic growth of 4.8%, led by the U.S. organic growth of 4.7%. These gains reflect solid performances in Trauma and Extremities at 6.9% and knees at 5.1%. This growth reflects strong demand for our 3D-printed products, our Foot & Ankle portfolio and our MAKO platform, which had 30 units installed, including 7 outside the U.S. Orthopaedics international delivered constant currency growth of 6.3% and organic growth of 5.1%, led by our European business.
MedSurg posted strong gains across all businesses in the quarter with constant currency growth of 33% and organic gains of 7.3%, which included a 7.7% increase in the U.S. Instruments, which was up 5.2% in the U.S., maintained good momentum with its waste management business and the newly launched Neptune 3 and continued strong performance related to its Navigation business.
Endoscopy delivered U.S. growth of 10.4%, driven by strong double-digit performances of its camera and light source products and strong gains in its communications, sports medicine and ProCare service businesses. 
Our Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 6.8%, driven by double-digit growth of its core bed and power cot products. On a comparable basis, Medical's Physio business was up 6.3%. Its Sage business grew 12.5%, including the impact of the recent recall. Excluding this, Sage grew 15%. We are pleased with these results and the ongoing integration efforts at Medical.
Internationally, MedSurg organic sales growth was 6%, which reflects strong European and Australian sales and some easing of the MedSurg comparable in China. Neurotechnology and Spine continues to drive above-market performance with constant currency growth of 8.7% and organic growth of 6.9%. This growth reflects continued strong demand for our Neurotech products. U.S. Neurotech posted growth of 9.1% in the quarter, highlighted by our AIS products and our Neuro Powered Instruments.
Our Spine business in the U.S. continued to see some supply issues, offset somewhat by strong demand for our 3D-printed interbody Tritanium products. As I have said last quarter, we expect the supply issues to remain into the fourth quarter.
Internationally, Neurotech had constant currency growth of 16.7%. This performance was driven by continued strong demand for our Trevo stent retriever and Target Coil products in Europe and Asia. Spine's international growth was 1.6% and was impacted by the aforementioned supply issues and challenges in China.
Now I will focus on the operating highlights within the quarter. Our gross margin, which, on an adjusted basis, was 66.3%, was down 60 basis points from the prior year quarter. Gross margin was favorably impacted by absorption and productivity gains, which was offset by mix, including the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange.
SG&A for the third quarter was 34.9% of sales on an adjusted basis, which was favorable by 70 basis points as compared to the prior year quarter. This improvement reflects favorable leverage from continued focus on operating expense improvements through our CTG program, cost-containment efforts and business mix, including leverage from our recent acquisitions.
We continue to invest in internal innovation with R&D, which is up 10 basis points year-over-year to 6.5% of sales. In total, adjusted operating expenses at 41.4% of sales was favorable 60 basis points to the prior year quarter, and these results continue to reflect our focus on leverage growth.
In summary, our operating margin was 24.9% of sales in Q3, flat year-over-year but up 64 basis points on a year-to-date basis. This performance reflects the positive results from our various CTG programs, continued cost control and favorable accretion from acquisitions, offset by business mix, pricing and foreign exchange.
Lastly, I will provide some highlights on other income and expense. Other expenses increased due to the higher net interest expense related to increased borrowings at the end of the first quarter. During the third quarter, we also paid down $750 million of debt. And accounting for the impact of this, we anticipate our future quarterly run rate of interest expense to be approximately $65 million.
Our third quarter adjusted effective tax adjusted effect of tax rate of 17.5% reflects the benefits of our global tax structure, partially offset by the impact of higher U.S.-based income from our recent acquisitions.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with $3 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 80% was held outside the U.S. Total debt on the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter was $6.8 billion.
Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $1.2 billion. Finally, as we have previously announced at the end of Q1, we have suspended our share repurchases for the remainder of 2016.
In terms of guidance, we reconfirm our previous full year organic sales growth range of 6% to 6.5% for 2016. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect a neutral impact in the fourth quarter and a negative foreign currency impact of less than 0.5% for the full year.
Lastly, our guidance for adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2016 is now expected to be in the range of $5.75 to $5.80 for the full year.
And now I will open up the call for Q&A."

Our other emerging market countries performed very well. China's still a bit of a laggard, but as Glenn's mentioned in his prepared remarks, we expect China to return to growth in the fourth quarter. So we're starting to see an improvement. Part of this is really the comparables that we're sort of lapping the years of sort of core performance. So we would expect a bit of a turnaround. But I -- it's really early. It's only one quarter, but I'm starting to see a trend that we will see growth. Now whether we'll get back to double digit as we experienced in prior years, it's a little early for me to say. But certainly, the outlook is much more positive than it has been over the past year."

I'll take the Trauma and Hip question, and then I'll pass it over to Katherine to talk about, I think, some misperceptions around 2017. So what I've been saying for some time on the Trauma business is that sustaining 15% growth quarter after quarter is pretty unlikely. We've done that for over 3 years coming into this year. If you look at last year's third quarter, we grew 15.1% in the U.S. And so to put up a 7% growth against that comp is still a pretty solid performance. But while big numbers is -- we've been signaling that Trauma will start to slow down a little bit in terms of its growth rate, but certainly performing above market and I think it still had a strong solid performance this quarter. But the only signal there is that sustaining that level of outperformance 3x the market is not likely to do indefinitely. So no concerns. We have a very strong Trauma leadership team, strong business, strong pipeline. I'm still very bullish about that division. As it relates to Hips, we're longer in our product cycle, with Accolade II being one of the newer products that we launched a few years ago. And a lot of excitement in knees. And as you know, same sales force that sells both Hips and Knees. We have a big launch upcoming with MAKO total knee. We have a lot of cementless products in the knee portfolio. So I would say that there's been a bit of attention focused on knees. And we've seen this in our industry for decades that it's very difficult to be able to focus on both products equally. So the fact that our Hip growth, which have been above market for about 3 or 4 years, is now moving, let's say, more in line with market is not also surprising."

And just going back to some of the misperceptions around some of the conferences, the health care conferences in September, I will tell you, candidly, we were surprised if anybody -- that there was any misperception. We try to be very consistent in terms of our goal of growing sales at the high end of med tech. We think the med tech markets are largely stable, at least the segments where our product portfolio competes. And as Kevin said in his prepared comments at the start of this call, we feel really good about our ability to continue to deliver that. The specific range around that, in which may have been, where some of the misperceptions came, we will talk about in January as we do every year. So to the degree of unwillingness to give guidance ahead of when we normally do it caused some concern, I think that was incorrect. We feel great about the momentum and the product portfolio, and we'll look to specify that in terms of financial ranges in January."

We also have additional new products on the knee side, our 3D-printed revision cones and sleeves and as we just mentioned, our 3D-printed cementless knee, which is really driving us to now low double-digit penetration for cementless knees, which is well above the industry. So I think right now, you're just in a period where there's a lot of happening on the knee side and a lot will continue to happen as we go to full commercial launch. We will be introducing more hip products, but sales force likes to focus on what's new and hot. And clearly, a lot of that momentum right now is on the knee side. And so we think hips, probably more like overall market growth. Knees, we believe, we're going to continue to grow above the market."

If you look at MAKO prior to our acquisition, they were able to obtain about 18% of the knee market over a 4-year period. There were not a proven entity. They weren't even an orthopedic company. So we really believe this about technology adoption certainly in the first couple of years. It's really around behavior, which surgeons believe in technology, and we're going to go to the surgeons that believe in it. There are many skeptics, as you know, with all disruptive technology.

And certainly, one of the biggest factors is mix, and the mix plays out in 2 ways. It plays out in sort of geographic mix but also sort of business and product mix. And so as I look year-over-year for third quarter, really, probably the biggest impact that we had was related to business mix in terms of how much MedSurg versus Orthopaedics versus international we had last year versus this year. And then on the FX front, we entered the hedging program back when foreign currency was a lot more volatile, and the whole idea was to lock in the predictability of foreign currency for us. So like you had mentioned, currencies move up and down. Our hedging program provides stability and predictability to us.

Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations.
For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by Katherine with an update on MAKO and our November analyst meeting. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A.
We achieved another quarter of solid organic sales growth, coming in at 6.2% and fueled by a strong showing for both MedSurg & Neurotechnology, with both delivering roughly 7% increases. Orthopaedics growth was consistent at approximately 5% organically. On a geographic basis, Q3 sales were balanced with a 6% increase in the U.S. and a 6.7% gain in international, driven by strong momentum in Europe and a return to growth in emerging markets.
We are pleased with the performance of our acquisitions, including both Sage and Physio-Control, which are well positioned to help us drive stronger organic sales growth for Stryker in the coming years.
A strong top line performance, coupled with our ongoing focus on G&A leverage, resulted in an EPS of $1.39, up 11.2% and $0.01 above the high end of our target range. Based on our performance for the first 9 months of 2016, we are confident in our ability to deliver our commitments, with organic sales growth for the full year expected at 6% to 6.5%.
We are narrowing our adjusted EPS range to the upper end, which now stands at $5.75 to $5.80 per share. Overall, we believe the strength of our people, diversified revenue model and new product flow positions us well to continue to deliver sales at the high end of med tech with leveraged earnings gains. 
We look forward to providing our 2017 financial guidance on our Q4 earnings call in January.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine."

My comments on today's call will include an update on MAKO as well as a preview of our upcoming analyst meeting.
Starting with MAKO. Results in the quarter were strong with a total of 30 robots installed globally, representing a roughly 75% year-over-year increase with 23 in the U.S. Consistent with prior quarters, approximately 40% of the installations were in competitive accounts where Stryker has no or relatively low market share.
Demand for the MAKO robot is being fueled by the expanded indications, including the total knee, which began a limited launch in June. Since that time, we have had KOL surgeons trained on the robots for the total knee, including those with prior robot experience but with less exposure to our Triathlon knee as well as surgeons who had not previously used a robot for joint reconstruction. As we discussed previously, by observing both these groups, we are optimizing the training protocol.
Of note, since the start of the limited market release for the total knee, over 200 cases have been performed, and we've been pleased with the results to date. We are targeting the 2017 AAOS meeting to move into the full commercial launch.
I will now shift to the analyst meeting, which will be held on November 9 at our Orthopaedics headquarters in New Jersey. In order to optimize the utility of this meeting, we will be focusing the formal part of the meeting on several key areas. This will include a MAKO physician panel with 2 surgeons who have been part of the limited market release. We will also have a Stryker Performance Solutions panel, which will include an SPS customer and focus on how we've been able to deploy our expertise in the joint reconstruction episode of care to help reduce our procedural costs.
Turning to cost transformation for growth. Lonny Carpenter, Group President of Global Quality and Operations, will provide an update on the various initiatives within CTG, including the expected financial contribution over the next 2 years. Glenn Boehnlein will provide a financial update, including our longer-term targets. We will conclude the formal part of the meeting with a Q&A session with the leadership team. We will then move to the product fair, which will include product highlights for MedSurg & Neurotechnology and will afford the opportunity to interact informally with the broader Stryker leadership team.
We hope you will be able to join us for the meeting. The event details and complete agenda, including the various guest speakers and their backgrounds, are available on the event registration site.
With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn."

Today, I will focus my comments on our third quarter financial results and performance drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release.
Our organic sales grew 6.2% in the quarter, which was within our range of full year expectations of 6% to 6.5%, with no difference in selling days. Pricing in the quarter was down 1.3% from the prior year, while foreign currency exchange had a nominal impact on sales.
U.S. sales continue to demonstrate strong momentum with organic growth of 6%, reflecting solid performances across our portfolio, especially in MedSurg & Neurotech. International sales grew 6.7% organically, highlighted by solid gains in Europe, Canada and Australia, somewhat offset by the continued impact of our previously discussed destocking issues in China. We expect that the fourth quarter will show some improvement in our  China business as prior year comparables continued to ease.
Our adjusted EPS of $1.39 increased 11.2% from the prior year, reflecting strong sales growth, accretive acquisitions and good operating expense control. Our third quarter EPS was negatively impacted by $0.03 related to transactional foreign currency exchange.
Focusing on our segment highlights. Orthopaedics delivered constant currency growth of 5.3% and organic growth of 4.8%, led by the U.S. organic growth of 4.7%. These gains reflect solid performances in Trauma and Extremities at 6.9% and knees at 5.1%. This growth reflects strong demand for our 3D-printed products, our Foot & Ankle portfolio and our MAKO platform, which had 30 units installed, including 7 outside the U.S. Orthopaedics international delivered constant currency growth of 6.3% and organic growth of 5.1%, led by our European business.
MedSurg posted strong gains across all businesses in the quarter with constant currency growth of 33% and organic gains of 7.3%, which included a 7.7% increase in the U.S. Instruments, which was up 5.2% in the U.S., maintained good momentum with its waste management business and the newly launched Neptune 3 and continued strong performance related to its Navigation business.
Endoscopy delivered U.S. growth of 10.4%, driven by strong double-digit performances of its camera and light source products and strong gains in its communications, sports medicine and ProCare service businesses. 
Our Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 6.8%, driven by double-digit growth of its core bed and power cot products. On a comparable basis, Medical's Physio business was up 6.3%. Its Sage business grew 12.5%, including the impact of the recent recall. Excluding this, Sage grew 15%. We are pleased with these results and the ongoing integration efforts at Medical.
Internationally, MedSurg organic sales growth was 6%, which reflects strong European and Australian sales and some easing of the MedSurg comparable in China. Neurotechnology and Spine continues to drive above-market performance with constant currency growth of 8.7% and organic growth of 6.9%. This growth reflects continued strong demand for our Neurotech products. U.S. Neurotech posted growth of 9.1% in the quarter, highlighted by our AIS products and our Neuro Powered Instruments.
Our Spine business in the U.S. continued to see some supply issues, offset somewhat by strong demand for our 3D-printed interbody Tritanium products. As I have said last quarter, we expect the supply issues to remain into the fourth quarter.
Internationally, Neurotech had constant currency growth of 16.7%. This performance was driven by continued strong demand for our Trevo stent retriever and Target Coil products in Europe and Asia. Spine's international growth was 1.6% and was impacted by the aforementioned supply issues and challenges in China.
Now I will focus on the operating highlights within the quarter. Our gross margin, which, on an adjusted basis, was 66.3%, was down 60 basis points from the prior year quarter. Gross margin was favorably impacted by absorption and productivity gains, which was offset by mix, including the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange.
SG&A for the third quarter was 34.9% of sales on an adjusted basis, which was favorable by 70 basis points as compared to the prior year quarter. This improvement reflects favorable leverage from continued focus on operating expense improvements through our CTG program, cost-containment efforts and business mix, including leverage from our recent acquisitions.
We continue to invest in internal innovation with R&D, which is up 10 basis points year-over-year to 6.5% of sales. In total, adjusted operating expenses at 41.4% of sales was favorable 60 basis points to the prior year quarter, and these results continue to reflect our focus on leverage growth.
In summary, our operating margin was 24.9% of sales in Q3, flat year-over-year but up 64 basis points on a year-to-date basis. This performance reflects the positive results from our various CTG programs, continued cost control and favorable accretion from acquisitions, offset by business mix, pricing and foreign exchange.
Lastly, I will provide some highlights on other income and expense. Other expenses increased due to the higher net interest expense related to increased borrowings at the end of the first quarter. During the third quarter, we also paid down $750 million of debt. And accounting for the impact of this, we anticipate our future quarterly run rate of interest expense to be approximately $65 million.
Our third quarter adjusted effective tax adjusted effect of tax rate of 17.5% reflects the benefits of our global tax structure, partially offset by the impact of higher U.S.-based income from our recent acquisitions.
Moving on to the balance sheet. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with $3 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 80% was held outside the U.S. Total debt on the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter was $6.8 billion.
Turning to cash flow. Our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $1.2 billion. Finally, as we have previously announced at the end of Q1, we have suspended our share repurchases for the remainder of 2016.
In terms of guidance, we reconfirm our previous full year organic sales growth range of 6% to 6.5% for 2016. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect a neutral impact in the fourth quarter and a negative foreign currency impact of less than 0.5% for the full year.
Lastly, our guidance for adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2016 is now expected to be in the range of $5.75 to $5.80 for the full year.
And now I will open up the call for Q&A."

Our other emerging market countries performed very well. China's still a bit of a laggard, but as Glenn's mentioned in his prepared remarks, we expect China to return to growth in the fourth quarter. So we're starting to see an improvement. Part of this is really the comparables that we're sort of lapping the years of sort of core performance. So we would expect a bit of a turnaround. But I -- it's really early. It's only one quarter, but I'm starting to see a trend that we will see growth. Now whether we'll get back to double digit as we experienced in prior years, it's a little early for me to say. But certainly, the outlook is much more positive than it has been over the past year."

There seems to be some confusion around that.

I'll take the Trauma and Hip question, and then I'll pass it over to Katherine to talk about, I think, some misperceptions around 2017. So what I've been saying for some time on the Trauma business is that sustaining 15% growth quarter after quarter is pretty unlikely. We've done that for over 3 years coming into this year. If you look at last year's third quarter, we grew 15.1% in the U.S. And so to put up a 7% growth against that comp is still a pretty solid performance. But while big numbers is -- we've been signaling that Trauma will start to slow down a little bit in terms of its growth rate, but certainly performing above market and I think it still had a strong solid performance this quarter. But the only signal there is that sustaining that level of outperformance 3x the market is not likely to do indefinitely. So no concerns. We have a very strong Trauma leadership team, strong business, strong pipeline. I'm still very bullish about that division. As it relates to Hips, we're longer in our product cycle, with Accolade II being one of the newer products that we launched a few years ago. And a lot of excitement in knees. And as you know, same sales force that sells both Hips and Knees. We have a big launch upcoming with MAKO total knee. We have a lot of cementless products in the knee portfolio. So I would say that there's been a bit of attention focused on knees. And we've seen this in our industry for decades that it's very difficult to be able to focus on both products equally. So the fact that our Hip growth, which have been above market for about 3 or 4 years, is now moving, let's say, more in line with market is not also surprising."

If you look at MAKO prior to our acquisition, they were able to obtain about 18% of the knee market over a 4-year period. There were not a proven entity. They weren't even an orthopedic company. So we really believe this about technology adoption certainly in the first couple of years. It's really around behavior, which surgeons believe in technology, and we're going to go to the surgeons that believe in it. There are many skeptics, as you know, with all disruptive technology. And some of those skeptics are Stryker loyal surgeons. And they won't be the first to adopt.

And certainly, one of the biggest factors is mix, and the mix plays out in 2 ways. It plays out in sort of geographic mix but also sort of business and product mix. And so as I look year-over-year for third quarter, really, probably the biggest impact that we had was related to business mix in terms of how much MedSurg versus Orthopaedics versus international we had last year versus this year. And then on the FX front, we entered the hedging program back when foreign currency was a lot more volatile, and the whole idea was to lock in the predictability of foreign currency for us. So like you had mentioned, currencies move up and down. Our hedging program provides stability and predictability to us. And so for the third quarter, I think, as I said, there will be sort of a nominal impact on sales related to translational, but that will have, potentially, a minor impact similar to this quarter related to transactional FX.
