I hope you enjoyed the holidays and had the opportunity to include some of our fine Constellation products in your celebrations with family and friends.

I hope you enjoyed the holidays and had the opportunity to include some of our fine Constellation products in your celebrations with family and friends. 
Welcome to our discussion of Constellation's third quarter fiscal 2016 sales and earnings results. Before we get started with a review of the quarter, I am pleased to report that we posted another year of exceptional stock price performance, with Constellation stock increasing more than 45% for calendar year 2015 versus the S&P 500, which declined 1% for the year. This is the fourth consecutive year that Constellation was one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index. I believe this excellent stock price performance is being driven by our strong financial results led by our beer business, which has incredible momentum and strong prospects for future growth. It is because of this tremendous growth opportunity that we are making smart investments now to ensure that we have the capacity, quality, control and flexibility to help us meet expected demand for our iconic beer brands well into the future. These investments include the construction of a new state-of-the-art brewery in Mexicali, Mexico. Details of our plans were announced earlier this morning. Initially, this brewery will be built to operate at 10 million hectoliters of production capacity with future scalability to 20 million hectoliters. The Mexicali location is ideal given its close proximity to the State of California, Constellation's largest beer market. The new brewery is being built with similar technology and operational advancements as our Nava Brewery and is designed to ensure consistency in brewing and production processes with the highest level of product quality expected between the 2 facilities. 
Let's take a moment to discuss the progress at our Nava facility, which had production capacity of 10 million hectoliters with the ability to expand at the time we acquired it. As previously discussed, we currently have work underway to expand Nava to 25 million hectoliters by the summer of calendar 2017 via 3 incremental 5 million hectoliter expansion. In addition to our plans to build the Mexicali brewery, we also announced today that we have plans to further expand Nava with a 2.5 million hectoliter capacity expansion that will bring production from 25 million to 27.5 million hectoliters when completed in early calendar year 2018. Now I'm pleased to report that, as expected, our first incremental 5 million hectoliters of Nava production capacity recently became operational and is in the process of ramping to optimal capacity utilization levels. We now have 15 million hectoliters of functioning brewing capacity at Nava. 2 [ph] packaging lines have been running to support this new brewing capacity, and ramp-up to full utilization is expected shortly for these lines, which will provide additional capacity for premium-class products like Modelo Especial and Carlita. The second incremental 5 million hectoliters of new brewing capacity at Nava is underway, with this piece of the expansion to be expected to be completed by June of this year. And work continues on the third expansion phase, as we increase Nava production capacity from 20 million to 25 million hectoliters and continue to expand the rail and logistics capability around the site, with completion expected by the summer of calendar 2017. 
As these expansion activities continue, we have worked with ABI to extend the Interim Supply Agreement we currently have in place for finished goods in order to support our robust growth and enable a smooth transition as we increase capacity. This agreement is expected to remain in place through June of 2017 for a select number of products that are expected to represent about 15% to 20% of the company's needs for the U.S. marketplace. Overall, we remain on track with all expansion activities, but I'm excited to be in a position to continue investing in Mexico and enhancing our operational platform to support the industry-leading growth levels of our incredible beer business. 
Our additional investments in production capacity are designed to ensure that we are well positioned to capture the continued momentum in growth opportunities we see in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, which has consistently grown in the mid- to high-single-digit range and is expected to grow at these levels into the foreseeable future. 
Our third quarter beer results are a testament to this momentum. As we achieved depletion growth of more than 16%, leading volume gains amongst all U.S. brewers and outperforming the U.S. beer industry, key competitors and all other imports with double-digit growth achieved by nearly every brand, every brand in our Mexican beer portfolio. 
Corona Extra posted accelerating depletion and consumer takeaway trends during the quarter by gaining distribution for key packages, accelerating velocities behind investments in media and merchandising and continuing to grow the can format, which represented nearly 25% of the growth of the Corona Extra brand during the quarter. 
Marketing initiatives for the brand included Corona Football with Jon Gruden, 2 major boxing matches, General Market and Hispanic TV advertising throughout the fall, football tailgating seasons and the airing of the holiday spot for the 25th consecutive year. 
Modelo Especial also delivered accelerating depletion growth of more than 20% during the third quarter, with all core Especial packages growing double digits. This brand's media investments included the continuation of Modelo Especial's national English-language TV and video campaign with the addition of sports programming during the start of the NFL season across CBS, Fox, ESPN and ESPN2. And National Hispanic media continued throughout the quarter with weekly TV exposure to Spanish-language consumers. 
Now given some of these marketing highlights, it's important to note that the beer team was recently recognized by earning a top spot on and ad agent 2015 marketers A list. Constellation is the only beer line experience company to make the list, and I'm very, very proud of this accomplishment. 
Collectively, these activities Modelo Especial becoming the #1 dollar share gain amongst established U.S. beer brands in the IRI channels during the third quarter, followed by Corona Extra as the #2 share gainer. Overall, the strong results that the beer business achieved in the third quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation's EPS guidance for fiscal 2016. David will have more to say about this in a few moments. 
When you put all of these pieces together, the exceptional growth of strong consumer demand for our Mexican beer brand, the exciting opportunity to invest in Mexico to expand our brewery operations and the on-schedule progress we are making to meet our expansion goals, it is a clearly an exciting time at Constellation with the opportunities to build upon our growth as a leader in the high end of the U.S. beer segment keep getting better and better. 
As you know, we acted upon another such opportunity for the future growth when we entered the U.S. craft beer market with the acquisition of Ballast Point, one of the most awarded major craft breweries in the industry. Ballast Point provides a high-growth premium platform that will enable Constellation to compete in the fast-growing craft beer segment, further strengthening our position in the high end of the U.S. beer market. 
Now Ballast Point is currently growing at more than 125% in IRI channels and remains on track to sell nearly 4 million cases and generate approximately $115 million in net sales for calendar 2015, representing growth of more than 100% versus the prior calendar year. I am pleased to welcome the Ballast Point founder, Jack White, and the entire Ballast Point team to Constellation. 
And now I would like to discuss the business results for our wine and spirits business. In our wine and spirits business during the third quarter, we achieved earnings growth and strong margin expansion, driven primarily by the Meiomi wine acquisition as well as favorable mix and COGS trends. As I mentioned last quarter, we have successfully integrated into our new Meiomi wine brand into our existing wine portfolio and our efforts to expand distribution are working to drive incremental growth for the brand. As a matter of fact, the most recent IRI trends corresponding with our quarterly results show that the Meiomi pinot noir is growing more than 80% in IRI channels, a trend which has accelerated since we first acquired the brand this past summer. 
Third quarter depletions for the brand were also strong across all channels, growing more than 50%. Meiomi pinot noir is one of the hottest wines of the year, listed as #20 in the Wine Spectator's Top 100 Wines for 2015 and #1 on wine.com's Top 100 List, which is based entirely on consumer preferences. We believe the brand has plenty of room to continue driving healthy growth for our business. Just this quarter, we began shipping the 2414 vintage -- 2014 vintage of Meiomi Chardonnay, following the success of the 2013 Chardonnay in the marketplace. 
Our Mark West brand is also known as a leader in the premium pinot noir category, and we are pleased to announce that the new wine expansion, Mark West Black, is now shipping. This higher-priced tier of the Mark West brand welcomes consumer to the dark side of pinot noir, with a more full-bodied and rich taste profile. 
Now one of our newer brand, Tom Gore Vineyards, has been gaining consumer acceptance for its high quality and authentic second-generation grape farmer brand story. It has also been featured in publications like Wine Enthusiasts, celebrating wine around the world in the Wall Street Journal's My Ride Series. Our Focus Brands are gaining, again driving positive results for the quarter in our wine and spirits portfolio, led by brands like Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi, which is America's favorite Cabernet, holding the #1 Cabernet Sauvignon position with the highest dollar and volume sales. 
Other Focus Brand leaders include Kim Crawford, which was named #1 -- or #11, I'm sorry, on wine.com's Top 100 Wines of 2015; and The Dreaming Tree, which launched its Pinot Noir varietal earlier this year. 
Our luxury brand in tiers continue to maintain their reputation for excellence among the critics, with outstanding reviews, rankings and 90-plus scores for our brands like Robert Mondavi Winery, SIMI and Mount Veeder from publications like the Wine Spectator, Wine Enthusiast and Wine and Spirits. During the quarter, our spirits portfolio posted net sales growth of 2%, driven by Paul Masson Grande Amber Peach Flavor as well as SVEDKA Vodka Mango, Pineapple and Strawberry Lemonade flavors. 
Casa Noble Tequila is exceeding our expectations so far this year with continuing share gains and was recently awarded a 94-point score in the Wine Enthusiast and a Top 10 Best Tequila designation by licker.com. 
In closing, it is certainly shaping up to be yet another eventful year at Constellation. With the year quickly drawing to a close, I am very pleased with our progress to date. Our efforts have produced a year of strong financial performance, notable business and brand milestones, industry accolades and healthy growth within several areas of the business. I am particularly pleased that we have finalized our investment plans in Mexicali, Mexico, to support the future growth we see within our beer business. And we are working diligently on the Nava Brewery and glass plant expansions while maintaining the strong momentum on the commercial side of the beer business. 
In calendar 2015, amid all of our hard work and accomplishments achieved throughout the year, we also celebrated the 70th anniversary of our company founding. While we are proud of our most recent accomplishments, taking a longer view of our 70-year heritage gives us perspective of how far we have come and even greater results to continue challenging our own expectations as we look forward to the next 70 years. 
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Klein for a financial discussion of our third quarter results."
258589,319058186,916254,"Constellation Brands Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 07, 2016",2016-01-07,"Earnings Calls","Constellation Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone.

Stellar execution by the beer business drove strong marketplace and financial results for the quarter. The strong beer performance, along with some slight favorability in our tax rate and better-than-expected Meiomi results, are driving our full year fiscal '16 comparable-basis diluted EPS projection up to a range of $5.30 to $5.40 versus our previous guidance range of $5 to $5.20. 
Operational activities related to bringing new capacity online at Nava continue to progress as planned. And the beer business performance, timing of capital expenditures related to the Nava expansion and lower-than-planned income tax payments are helping to increase our fiscal '16 free cash flow projection to a range of $475 million to $525 million versus our previous range of $200 million to $300 million. 
In addition to our quarterly results, we recently completed the Ballast Point craft beer acquisition. And this morning, we outlined our plans to build a new 10 million hectoliter brewery in Mexicali, Mexico, and further expand our Nava Brewery. 
Let's take a closer look at all of this activity, starting with our Q3 results, where my comments will generally focus on comparable-basis financial results. 
Consolidated net sales on an organic constant-currency basis grew 6% for the quarter. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth coming in over 16%. Beer net sales increased 8% on volume growth that came in a little under 7%. Beer net sales growth for the quarter was impacted by the overlap of a shift of approximately 2 million cases and $37 million of net sales from Q2 fiscal '15 into Q3 fiscal '15 related to the beer product recall. In addition to that activity, wholesalers also increased their inventory position during the third quarter of fiscal '15 to bring inventory more in line with historical levels. 
Given the Q3 fiscal '15 overlaps just mentioned, it is worth noting that beer net sales growth for the first 9 months of fiscal '16 totaled 11%, and we now expect full year fiscal '16 beer net sales growth to be in the range of 12% to 14%. 
Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant-currency basis increased 3%. This primarily reflects favorable mix across the business. As mentioned by Rob, Meiomi continues to demonstrate excellent marketplace momentum as the brand generated approximately $35 million of incremental sales during the quarter. For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $89 million, up 13%, with gross margin increasing 280 basis points. Beer gross profit increased $58 million primarily due to volume growth, favorable pricing and lower COGS. Our beer gross profit margin increased 360 basis points to 48.9%. 
Wine and spirits gross profit was up $31 million. This primarily reflects the benefit from the Meiomi acquisition, favorable mix and lower COGS. Wine and spirits gross profit margin increased 190 basis points to 43.6%. 
Consolidated SG&A for the quarter increased $29 million. This reflects marketing investments made by the beer and wine and spirits businesses. Corporate expense was up due primarily to an increase in payroll-related taxes associated with employee stock option exercises, higher incentive compensation expense and investments to support the growth of the business, including the establishment of our Chief Growth Officer function. 
We continue to expand margins across the business as consolidated operating income increased $61 million and consolidated operating margin improved 210 basis points. Beer operating margin increased 360 basis points to 35.1%, and wine and spirits operating margin improved 170 basis points to 27.5%. Equity earnings increased $6 million due to strong results for Opus 1. 
Interest expense for the quarter was $76 million, down 12%. The decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates. At the end of November, our debt totaled $7.4 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $6.9 billion, a decrease of $326 million since the end of fiscal 2015. This primarily reflects our free cash flow generation, partially offset by the funding for the Meiomi acquisition. Our net debt to comparable-basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.5x at the end of Q3. Even with the funding of the Ballast Point acquisition, we expect to end fiscal '16 below the 4x level. Additionally, we continue to expect fiscal '16 interest expense to be in the range of $310 million to $320 million. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 32.3% compared to 29.2% last year, which reflected the benefit of certain tax credits. We now expect our full year tax rate to approximate 30%. 
Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first 9 months of fiscal '16, we generated $578 million of free cash flow compared to $209 million for the same period last year. Operating cash flow totaled $1.1 billion versus $750 million for the prior year period. This increase was primarily generated by the beer business. Given higher projected earnings for the beer business and lower projected income tax payments, we now expect to generate operating cash flow in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion for fiscal '16. CapEx for the first 9 months of fiscal '16 totaled $514 million and was slightly below our CapEx spending from the same time frame last year. While our initial 10 million hectoliter expansion at Nava continues to progress as planned, payment timing for some of the capital expenditures associated with this activity has shifted into fiscal 2017. 
In a few moments, I will outline the CapEx requirements we are targeting for the new Mexicali brewery and the additional 2.5 million hectoliter expansion at Nava. Even with the incremental capital expenditures projected from these initiatives, we are decreasing our total capital expenditure estimate for 2016 to a range of $875 million to $925 million versus our previous guidance of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion for fiscal '16. Due to the factors just mentioned, we now expect fiscal '16 free cash flow to be in the range of $475 million to $525 million. 
Now let's move to our full year fiscal '16 P&L outlook. As discussed earlier, we are increasing our comparable-basis diluted EPS production to $5.30 to $5.40. Our fiscal '16 comparable-basis credits excludes comparable adjustments which are detailed in the release. 
For the wine and spirits business, we continue to expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range. Meiomi's volume performance has exceeded our initial expectations, and we now expect fiscal '16 diluted EPS accretion from this acquisition to be around $0.07 to $0.08 versus our previous $0.03 to $0.04 accretion projection. The beer business is the primary driver of our diluted EPS guidance increase. We now expect volume growth of 10% to 12%, net sales growth of 12% to 14% and operating income growth in the range of 22% to 24%, before any benefit from the Ballast Point acquisition. 
We closed the Ballast Point acquisition in December. We funded the $1 billion purchase price with a combination of net proceeds from the issuance of $400 million of 4.75% senior notes due in 2025, borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility and cash on hand. For calendar 2015, Ballast Point is expected to sell nearly 4 million cases and generate approximately $115 million in sales. On a comparable basis, the acquisition is expected to be neutral to diluted EPS for fiscal '16 and $0.05 to $0.06 accretive for fiscal '17. Our current beer segment guidance has us targeting a beer operating margin of approximately 34% to 35% for fiscal '16. The improvement versus our previous 34% target primarily relates to Q3 benefiting from lower depreciation as well as lower line commissioning and optimization cost than originally anticipated. Now that this incremental capacity has become operational, we expect these costs to ramp up in the fourth quarter. We are pleased that we have already achieved our mid-30% operating margin goal for our beer business. We expect the beer operating margin to continue to run in the mid-30% range over the next 1 to 2 years, as we still have much to accomplish at Nava, and expect some margin volatility as we bring online and optimize new capacity. As Rob mentioned earlier, we have extended Interim Supply Agreement with ABI to ensure a smooth transition as we increase capacity. This could temper operating margin expansion in fiscal '17 as utilization at Nava will likely run below the utilization targeted before the extension of the supply agreement. 
Speaking of capacity, Rob also outlined our plans to build a new 10 million hectoliter brewery in Mexicali and further expand capacity at our Nava Brewery. In the press release we issued this morning, we included a table summarizing the collective investments we are making in our Mexican operating platform. Let me provide a few highlights around the capital expenditures associated with this activity starting with Nava. The additional 2.5 million hectoliters we are adding to Nava is estimated to cost approximately $250 million. This, combined with our previously announced Nava Brewery and glass plant expansion projects, puts our total targeted Nava capital expenditures at $2.5 billion. After fiscal '16, we expect to spend $1.1 billion over the fiscal '17 and '18 time frame, with most of that occurring in fiscal '17. The new 10 million hectoliter Mexicali brewery is expected to cost $1.5 billion. And the associated land, water rights and infrastructure and other site requirements to accommodate scalability to 20 million hectoliters is estimated at $500 million. For this total $2 billion investment, we expect some initial spend to occur in fiscal '16, a little over half of this spend to come in fiscal '17 and '18 and the remaining spend to happen in the fiscal '19 to fiscal '21 time frame. 
Given the strong demand we see for our beer portfolio and our best-in-class margin profile, the investments I just outlined are expected to generate high returns with a fast payback. Even with the capital requirements associated with these initiatives, our strong projected earnings and operating cash flow will allow us to operate below our targeted 4x leverage range and continue to provide us with significant allocation flexibility. 
With that, we are happy to take your questions."

So I think that there's plenty of room left for Modelo Especial distribution expansion. It does not have the ACV of, say, Corona Extra. Right now, the ACV on Modelo Especial is about 65%. So we see lots of room for continued expansion in both distribution, and we see opportunity for expansion of velocity, i.e. sales per point of distribution as the brand continues to gain momentum with general market consumers. So this is a real growth story for beer, in general, not only just for Constellation Brands. I mean it's a phenomenon."

So on the craft -- on the Ballast acquisition, I think some people have looked at the $1 billion price tag in the context of the current volume size and thought it was the high end of some of the more recent deals. So if you can sort of give us your view on why that price tag was appropriate and the growth opportunities perhaps beyond maybe even the distribution expansion that you see with Ballast. And then more broadly, if you think about your ambition to really get bigger in the craft beer industry, do you think that you would have to have more collections of the more regional brands and expand distribution or more of a large-scale kind of brand like Ballast and just getting more scale with that brand?"

It's related to the growth percentage and the size of the brand, okay? So obviously, the multiple that we paid for it in relationship to the growth is actually a pretty reasonable purchase price, right? As you recall from my initial comments, the brand grew over 100% this year and 125% in IRI. So when you look at purchase price and multiple as a function of growth rate, it's pretty reasonable. And we don't see that growth rate changing much in the short term. So we expect another pretty robust year with Ballast Point. Also, you got to realize that Ballast Point has the highest average retail selling price basically of any significantly sized craft, right? If you go buy some Ballast Point, you're going to see the Ballast Point sales for around $15, $16 a sixpack, okay, versus competitors that you'll see it under $10 or just a bit over $10 a sixpack. So it's a very, very high-growth, high-margin product. Now our strategy with Ballast Point is actually pretty simple, and it's why we were so particularly interested in the brand, which is our strategy is we don't really have to do too much other than what they're doing right now. The key to Ballast Point is maintaining the growth, and I think the maintenance of the growth is going to be a function of maintenance of sort of the award-winning stature and high quality of the brand. It's a very sought-after product. All of the people that have been involved in making Ballast Point what it is today continue, that's Jack White, the founder, it's Jim Claire the CEO, all of these people are brewmasters, the incredible group of people that we have there continue to be 100% behind the brand and has continued very enthusiastically with Constellation. Part of the motivation for that wine to sell the business to Constellation was, of all the buyers, they saw Constellation is the best fit because of our incredibly strong position in the beer industry and the fact that we are only a high-end beer manufacturer and seller as well as being in the high end of the wine business, which makes us a completely different animal, okay? We're not big beer, okay, in the sense of being one of the 2 U.S. premium domestic producers. So the strategy with Ballast Point is all about continuing to do what the company has been doing, and I would say bringing incrementally to that some of the areas where I think that Constellation can be of help, and that would be with major key accounts, and I would say other places where a smaller company wouldn't necessarily have the ability to play right off the bat."

But I'm kind of still stuck on the consumer proposition from a longer-term perspective. When I hear you reemphasize growth in a multiple, I'm reminded of wine deals in the past going back far enough where growth was irrational. And then when I look at the craft beer segment, I think the segment's been around for a long time, and we probably all argue whether there's more than really one brand, saying that, since that's become a national brand have really has that session ability associated with it. So -- and in the price point in the IBA, like these are not brands that you see people kind of having in -- you get a group of 5 people together, one Square to be having skeleton, another to have another craft beer. So just doesn't seem to lend itself to being a big brand the way you're important beer portfolio does. So can you speak about that consumer proposition or how you think about that?"

If you look at sort of the competitors in the marketplace and where they are volumetrically, okay, that implies a huge amount of growth for Ballast Point. And obviously, at the kind of price point and margins that we're talking about, big is a relative term. So you look at some of the other competitors, and we clearly see plenty of craft brands in the 10 million to 30-plus million case ranges, right?

I mean, I think that what we're really are talking here financially are the kind of contribution, right, economically and financially that a Ballast Point can make to our bottom line. With all that said, maintaining the quality and the award-winning position of the brand with craft consumers is going to be key to that, and I am 100% sure that the team that's running Ballast Point will do that. We have some unbelievable great new products that are coming out like a Watermelon Dorado, which is a double IPA. These are very sort of breakthrough products that I think are going to potentially set the craft world, vis-à-vis, the consumers, on fire. So that's why it's been so successful.

The wine industry has actually accelerated quite considerably and is probably, as we sit here right now at one of the most robust points that it's ever been in, I mean, you look at IRI dollars for the last 12 weeks, the wine industry has accelerated to over 6% growth.

That's the industry, okay? And then as it relates to Meiomi, okay, number one, basically, the brand has a tremendous amount of momentum in and of itself. Okay, we bring a lot to that party. Obviously, we bring distribution strength. We bring strength where we're major players, #1 players, for that matter, with key customers. If you look at our position today in beverage alcohol -- total beverage alcohol, okay, which is really important, and you look at major, major customers like the mass merchandisers, like the big grocery chains, when you combine our beverage alcohol portfolio, okay, we tend to be a #1 supplier certainly in terms of the kind of profit that we're providing these key customers. So that's been helpful in driving the Meiomi results as well. And also -- I think that -- like everything, okay, whether we're talking Corona, whether we're talking Modelo Especial, whether we're talking Meiomi, it's all about the consumer voting with their feet, all right? Meiomi has just a tremendous, tremendous amount of consumer acceptance. And that's building. So it's a very, very strong brand. It's a -- I've talked about this before. Somewhat of a unique taste profile for pinot noir and it's sort of fitting squarely into what the consumer is looking for for that kind of product. And price point, everything.

So we're now into an environment where we're sort of getting the best of both worlds in that regard. Beer, okay. Beer is a lot -- yes, beer is becoming like wine. There is -- the high end of the beer business is a very exciting part of the business because there's huge trading up going on in beer, okay? The consumer is definitely premium-izing. It's premium-izing into our import brand and craft. You see the high end of the beer business be very robust. You can see it coming right out of the -- the sort of the premium part of that beer. We definitely think that's going to continue. And although the price differential seems big in beer, okay, that's really in percentage terms, okay? Yes, you still talking about like a super affordable luxury. I mean way, way even more affordable than wine, right? It's a big deal up for the consumer to go to a grocery store and buy 2 $25 bottles of wine. That's $50, okay? But the trade up to Corona at $1 a bottle versus whatever else they were repurchasing at $0.50 or less a can, big percentage increase, but fundamentally not something that takes the product outside of the realm of an affordable luxury. So I don't think the consumer -- the consumer is proving to be pretty insensitive to those kind of changes at those sort of nominal prices."

I hope you enjoyed the holidays and had the opportunity to include some of our fine Constellation products in your celebrations with family and friends. 
Welcome to our discussion of Constellation's third quarter fiscal 2016 sales and earnings results. Before we get started with a review of the quarter, I am pleased to report that we posted another year of exceptional stock price performance, with Constellation's stock increasing more than 45% for calendar year 2015 versus the S&P 500, which declined 1% for the year. This is the fourth consecutive year that Constellation was one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index. I believe this excellent stock price performance is being driven by our strong financial results led by our beer business, which has incredible momentum and strong prospects for future growth. It is because of this tremendous growth opportunity that we are making smart investments now to ensure that we have the capacity, quality, control and flexibility to help us meet expected demand for our iconic beer brands well into the future. 
These investments include the construction of a new state-of-the-art brewery in Mexicali, Mexico. Details of our plans were announced earlier this morning. Initially, this brewery will be built to operate at 10 million hectoliters of production capacity with future scalability to 20 million hectoliters. The Mexicali location is ideal given its close proximity to the State of California, Constellation's largest beer market. The new brewery is being built with similar technology and operational advancements as our Nava Brewery and is designed to ensure consistency in brewing and production processes with the highest level of product quality expected between the 2 facilities. 
Let's take a moment to discuss the progress at our Nava facility, which had production capacity of 10 million hectoliters with the ability to expand at the time we acquired it. As previously discussed, we currently have work underway to expand Nava to 25 million hectoliters by the summer of calendar 2017 via 3 incremental 5 million hectoliter expansion. 
In addition to our plans to build the Mexicali brewery, we also announced today that we have plans to further expand Nava with a 2.5 million hectoliter capacity expansion that will bring production from 25 million to 27.5 million hectoliters when completed in early calendar year 2018. Now I'm pleased to report that, as expected, our first incremental 5 million hectoliters of Nava production capacity recently became operational and is in the process of ramping to optimal capacity utilization levels. We now have 15 million hectoliters of functioning brewing capacity at Nava. Two packaging lines have been running to support this new brewing capacity, and ramp-up to full utilization is expected shortly for these lines, which will provide additional capacity for premium-class products like Modelo Especial and Coronitas. 
The second incremental 5 million hectoliters of new brewing capacity at Nava is underway, with this piece of the expansion to be expected to be completed by June of this year. And work continues on the third expansion phase, as we increase Nava production capacity from 20 million to 25 million hectoliters and continue to expand the rail and logistics capability around the site, with completion expected by the summer of calendar 2017. 
As these expansion activities continue, we have worked with ABI to extend the Interim Supply Agreement we currently have in place for finished goods in order to support our robust growth and enable a smooth transition as we increase capacity. This agreement is expected to remain in place through June of 2017 for a select number of products that are expected to represent about 15% to 20% of the company's needs for the U.S. marketplace. Overall, we remain on track with all expansion activities, but I'm excited to be in a position to continue investing in Mexico and enhancing our operational platform to support the industry-leading growth levels of our incredible beer business. 
Our additional investments in production capacity are designed to ensure that we are well positioned to capture the continued momentum in growth opportunities we see in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, which has consistently grown in the mid- to high-single-digit range and is expected to grow at these levels into the foreseeable future. 
Our third quarter beer results are a testament to this momentum. As we achieved depletion growth of more than 16%, leading volume gains amongst all U.S. brewers and outperforming the U.S. beer industry, key competitors and all other imports with double-digit growth achieved by nearly every brand, every brand in our Mexican beer portfolio. 
Corona Extra posted accelerating depletion and consumer takeaway trends during the quarter by gaining distribution for key packages, accelerating velocities behind investments in media and merchandising and continuing to grow the can format, which represented nearly 25% of the growth of the Corona Extra brand during the quarter. 
Marketing initiatives for the brand included Corona Football with Jon Gruden, 2 major boxing matches, general market and Hispanic TV advertising throughout the fall, football tailgating seasons and the airing of the O’ Tannenpalm holiday spot for the 25th consecutive year. 
Modelo Especial also delivered accelerating depletion growth of more than 20% during the third quarter, with all core Especial packages growing double digits. This brand's media investments included the continuation of Modelo Especial's national English-language TV and video campaign with the addition of sports programming during the start of the NFL season across CBS, Fox, ESPN and ESPN2. And National Hispanic media continued throughout the quarter with weekly TV exposure to Spanish-language consumers. 
Now given some of these marketing highlights, it's important to note that the beer team was recently recognized by earning a top spot on Ad Age's 2015 Marketers' A-List. Constellation is the only beer-line-experience company to make the list, and I am very, very proud of this accomplishment. 
Collectively, these activities resulted in Modelo Especial becoming the #1 dollar-share gainer amongst established U.S. beer brands in the IRI channels during the third quarter, followed by Corona Extra as the #2 share gainer. Overall, the strong results that the beer business achieved in the third quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation's EPS guidance for fiscal 2016. David will have more to say about this in a few moments. 
When you put all of these pieces together, the exceptional growth of strong consumer demand for our Mexican beer brand, the exciting opportunity to invest in Mexico to expand our brewery operations and the on-schedule progress we are making to meet our expansion goals, it is clearly an exciting time at Constellation with the opportunities to build upon our growth as a leader in the high end of the U.S. beer segment keep getting better and better. 
As you know, we acted upon another such opportunity for the future growth when we entered the U.S. craft beer market with the acquisition of Ballast Point, one of the most-awarded major craft breweries in the industry. Ballast Point provides a high-growth premium platform that will enable Constellation to compete in the fast-growing craft beer segment, further strengthening our position in the high end of the U.S. beer market. 
Now Ballast Point is currently growing at more than 125% in IRI channels and remains on track to sell nearly 4 million cases and generate approximately $115 million in net sales for calendar 2015, representing growth of more than 100% versus the prior calendar year. I am pleased to welcome the Ballast Point founder, Jack White, and the entire Ballast Point team to Constellation. 
And now I would like to discuss the business results for our wine and spirits business. In our wine and spirits business during the third quarter, we achieved earnings growth and strong margin expansion, driven primarily by the Meiomi wine acquisition as well as favorable mix and COGS trends. As I mentioned last quarter, we have successfully integrated into our new Meiomi wine brand into our existing wine portfolio and our efforts to expand distribution are working to drive incremental growth for the brand. As a matter of fact, the most recent IRI trends corresponding with our quarterly results show that the Meiomi pinot noir is growing more than 80% in IRI channels, a trend which has accelerated since we first acquired the brand this past summer. 
Third quarter depletions for the brand were also strong across all channels, growing more than 50%. Meiomi pinot noir is one of the hottest wines of the year, listed as #20 in the Wine Spectator's Top 100 Wines for 2015 and #1 on wine.com's Top 100 List, which is based entirely on consumer preferences. We believe the brand has plenty of room to continue driving healthy growth for our business. Just this quarter, we began shipping the 2414 vintage -- 2014 vintage of Meiomi Chardonnay, following the success of the 2013 Chardonnay in the marketplace. 
Our Mark West brand is also known as a leader in the premium pinot noir category, and we are pleased to announce that the new wine expansion, Mark West Black, is now shipping. This higher-priced tier of the Mark West brand welcomes consumer to the dark side of pinot noir, with a more full-bodied and rich taste profile. 
Now one of our newer brand, Tom Gore Vineyards, has been gaining consumer acceptance for its high quality and authentic second-generation grape farmer brand story. It has also been featured in publications like Wine Enthusiasts, celebrating wine around the world in the Wall Street Journal's My Ride Series. Our Focus Brands are gaining, again driving positive results for the quarter in our wine and spirits portfolio, led by brands like Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi, which is America's favorite Cabernet, holding the #1 Cabernet Sauvignon position with the highest dollar and volume sales. 
Other Focus Brand leaders include Kim Crawford, which was named #1 -- or #11, I'm sorry, on wine.com's Top 100 Wines of 2015; and The Dreaming Tree, which launched its Pinot Noir varietal earlier this year. 
Our luxury brand in tiers continue to maintain their reputation for excellence among the critics, with outstanding reviews, rankings and 90-plus scores for our brands like Robert Mondavi Winery, Simi and Mount Veeder from publications like the Wine Spectator, Wine Enthusiast and Wine & Spirits. During the quarter, our spirits portfolio posted net sales growth of 2%, driven by Paul Masson Grande Amber Peach Flavor as well as SVEDKA Vodka Mango, Pineapple and Strawberry Lemonade flavors. 
Casa Noble Tequila is exceeding our expectations so far this year with continuing share gains and was recently awarded a 94-point score in the Wine Enthusiast and a Top 10 Best Tequila designation by liquor.com. 
In closing, it is certainly shaping up to be yet another eventful year at Constellation. With the year quickly drawing to a close, I am very pleased with our progress to date. Our efforts have produced a year of strong financial performance, notable business and brand milestones, industry accolades and healthy growth within several areas of the business. I am particularly pleased that we have finalized our investment plans in Mexicali, Mexico to support the future growth we see within our beer business. And we are working diligently on the Nava Brewery and glass plant expansions while maintaining the strong momentum of the commercial side of the beer business. 
In calendar 2015, amid all of our hard work and accomplishments achieved throughout the year, we also celebrated the 70th anniversary of our company founding. While we are proud of our most recent accomplishments, taking a longer view of our 70-year heritage gives us perspective of how far we have come and even greater results to continue challenging our own expectations as we look forward to the next 70 years. 
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Klein for a financial discussion of our third quarter results."
258589,319058186,916350,"Constellation Brands Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 07, 2016",2016-01-07,"Earnings Calls","Constellation Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone.

The strong beer performance al",1725,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with some Q3 highlights. Comparable-basis diluted EPS was up 15%. Stellar execution by the beer business drove strong marketplace and financial results for the quarter. The strong beer performance along with some slight favorability in our tax rate and better-than-expected Meiomi results are driving our full year fiscal '16 comparable-basis diluted EPS projection up to a range of $5.30 to $5.40 versus our previous guidance range of $5 to $5.20. 
Operational activities related to bringing new capacity online at Nava continue to progress as planned. And the beer business performance, timing of capital expenditures related to the Nava expansion and lower-than-planned income tax payments are helping to increase our fiscal '16 free cash flow projection to a range of $475 million to $525 million versus our previous range of $200 million to $300 million. 
In addition to our quarterly results, we recently completed the Ballast Point craft beer acquisition. And this morning, we outlined our plans to build a new 10 million hectoliter brewery in Mexicali, Mexico and further expand our Nava Brewery. 
Let's take a closer look at all of this activity, starting with our Q3 results, where my comments will generally focus on comparable-basis financial results. 
Consolidated net sales on an organic constant-currency basis grew 6% for the quarter. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth coming in over 16%. Beer net sales increased 8% on volume growth that came in a little under 7%. Beer net sales growth for the quarter was impacted by the overlap of a shift of approximately 2 million cases and $37 million of net sales from Q2 fiscal '15 into Q3 fiscal '15 related to the beer product recall. In addition to that activity, wholesalers also increased their inventory position during the third quarter of fiscal '15 to bring inventory more in line with historical levels. 
Given the Q3 fiscal '15 overlaps just mentioned, it is worth noting that beer net sales growth for the first 9 months of fiscal '16 totaled 11%, and we now expect full year fiscal '16 beer net sales growth to be in the range of 12% to 14%. 
Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant-currency basis increased 3%. This primarily reflects favorable mix across the business. As mentioned by Rob, Meiomi continues to demonstrate excellent marketplace momentum as the brand generated approximately $35 million of incremental sales during the quarter. 
For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $89 million, up 13%, with gross margin increasing 280 basis points. Beer gross profit increased $58 million primarily due to volume growth, favorable pricing and lower COGS. Our beer gross profit margin increased 360 basis points to 48.9%. 
Wine and spirits gross profit was up $31 million. This primarily reflects the benefit from the Meiomi acquisition, favorable mix and lower COGS. Wine and spirits gross profit margin increased 190 basis points to 43.6%. 
Consolidated SG&A for the quarter increased $29 million. This reflects marketing investments made by the beer and wine and spirits businesses. Corporate expense was up due primarily to an increase in payroll-related taxes associated with employee stock option exercises, higher incentive compensation expense and investments to support the growth of the business, including the establishment of our Chief Growth Officer function. 
We continue to expand margins across the business as consolidated operating income increased $61 million and consolidated operating margin improved 210 basis points. Beer operating margin increased 360 basis points to 35.1%, and wine and spirits operating margin improved 170 basis points to 27.5%. Equity earnings increased $6 million due to strong results for Opus One.
Interest expense for the quarter was $76 million, down 12%. The decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates. At the end of November, our debt totaled $7.4 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $6.9 billion, a decrease of $326 million since the end of fiscal 2015. This primarily reflects our free cash flow generation, partially offset by the funding for the Meiomi acquisition. 
Our net debt to comparable-basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.5x at the end of Q3. Even with the funding of the Ballast Point acquisition, we expect to end fiscal '16 below the 4x level. Additionally, we continue to expect fiscal '16 interest expense to be in the range of $310 million to $320 million. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 32.3% compared to 29.2% last year, which reflected the benefit of certain tax credits. We now expect our full year tax rate to approximate 30%. 
Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first 9 months of fiscal '16, we generated $578 million of free cash flow compared to $209 million for the same period last year. Operating cash flow totaled $1.1 billion versus $750 million for the prior year period. This increase was primarily generated by the beer business. Given higher projected earnings for the beer business and lower projected income tax payments, we now expect to generate operating cash flow in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion for fiscal '16. CapEx for the first 9 months of fiscal '16 totaled $514 million and was slightly below our CapEx spending from the same time frame last year. 
While our initial 10 million hectoliter expansion at Nava continues to progress as planned, payment timing for some of the capital expenditures associated with this activity has shifted into fiscal 2017. In a few moments, I will outline the CapEx requirements we are targeting for the new Mexicali brewery and the additional 2.5 million hectoliter expansion at Nava. 
Even with the incremental capital expenditures projected from these initiatives, we are decreasing our total capital expenditure estimate for 2016 to a range of $875 million to $925 million versus our previous guidance of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion for fiscal '16. Due to the factors just mentioned, we now expect fiscal '16 free cash flow to be in the range of $475 million to $525 million. 
Now let's move to our full year fiscal '16 P&L outlook. As discussed earlier, we are increasing our comparable-basis diluted EPS projection to $5.30 to $5.40. Our fiscal '16 comparable-basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments which are detailed in the release. 
For the wine and spirits business, we continue to expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range. Meiomi's volume performance has exceeded our initial expectations, and we now expect fiscal '16 diluted EPS accretion from this acquisition to be around $0.07 to $0.08 versus our previous $0.03 to $0.04 accretion projection. The beer business is the primary driver of our diluted EPS guidance increase. We now expect volume growth of 10% to 12%, net sales growth of 12% to 14% and operating income growth in the range of 22% to 24% before any benefit from the Ballast Point acquisition. 
We closed the Ballast Point acquisition in December. We funded the $1 billion purchase price with a combination of net proceeds from the issuance of $400 million of 4.75% senior notes due in 2025, borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility and cash on hand. For calendar 2015, Ballast Point is expected to sell nearly 4 million cases and generate approximately $115 million in sales. On a comparable basis, the acquisition is expected to be neutral to diluted EPS for fiscal '16 and $0.05 to $0.06 accretive for fiscal '17. 
Our current beer segment guidance has us targeting a beer operating margin of approximately 34% to 35% for fiscal '16. The improvement versus our previous 34% target primarily relates to Q3 benefiting from lower depreciation as well as lower line commissioning and optimization costs than originally anticipated. Now that this incremental capacity has become operational, we expect these costs to ramp up in the fourth quarter. 
We are pleased that we have already achieved our mid-30% operating margin goal for our beer business. We expect the beer operating margin to continue to run in the mid-30% range over the next 1 to 2 years, as we still have much to accomplish at Nava, and expect some margin volatility as we bring online and optimize new capacity. As Rob mentioned earlier, we have extended the Interim Supply Agreement with ABI to ensure a smooth transition as we increase capacity. This could temper operating margin expansion in fiscal '17 as utilization at Nava will likely run below the utilization targeted before the extension of the supply agreement. 
Speaking of capacity, Rob also outlined our plans to build a new 10 million hectoliter brewery in Mexicali and further expand capacity at our Nava Brewery. In the press release we issued this morning, we included a table summarizing the collective investments we are making in our Mexican operating platform. Let me provide a few highlights around the capital expenditures associated with this activity starting with Nava. 
The additional 2.5 million hectoliters we are adding to Nava is estimated to cost approximately $250 million. This, combined with our previously announced Nava Brewery and glass plant expansion projects, puts our total targeted Nava capital expenditures at $2.5 billion. After fiscal '16, we expect to spend $1.1 billion over the fiscal '17 and '18 time frame, with most of that occurring in fiscal '17. 
The new 10 million hectoliter Mexicali brewery is expected to cost $1.5 billion. And the associated land, water rights and infrastructure and other site requirements to accommodate scalability to 20 million hectoliters is estimated at $500 million. For this total $2 billion investment, we expect some initial spend to occur in fiscal '16, a little over half of this spend to come in fiscal '17 and '18 and the remaining spend to happen in the fiscal '19 to fiscal '21 time frame. 
Given the strong demand we see for our beer portfolio and our best-in-class margin profile, the investments I just outlined are expected to generate high returns with a fast payback. Even with the capital requirements associated with these initiatives, our strong projected earnings and operating cash flow will allow us to operate below our targeted 4x leverage range and continue to provide us with significant capital allocation flexibility. 
With that, we are happy to take your questions."

I was hoping maybe you could take a step back on the Modelo Especial brand, which driven a lot of the growth, and peel back how much of that growth has been driven by distribution expansion in the last couple of years versus organic sales growth per distribution point.

So we see lots of room for continued expansion in both distribution, and we see opportunity for expansion of velocity, i.e. sales per point of distribution as the brand continues to gain momentum with general market consumers. So this is a real growth story for beer, in general, not only just for Constellation Brands. I mean it's a phenomenon."

And then more broadly, if you think about your ambition to really get bigger in the craft beer industry, do you think that you would have to have more collection of some of the more regional brands and expand distribution or more of a large-scale kind of brand like Ballast and just getting more scale with that brand?"

It's related to the growth percentage and the size of the brand, okay? So obviously, the multiple that we paid for it in relationship to the growth is actually a pretty reasonable purchase price, right? As you recall from my initial comments, the brand grew over 100% this year and 125% in IRI. So when you look at purchase price and multiple as a function of growth rate, it's pretty reasonable. And we don't see that growth rate changing much in the short term, so we expect another pretty robust year with Ballast Point. Also, you got to realize that Ballast Point has the highest average retail selling price basically of any significantly-sized craft, right? If you go buy some Ballast Point, you're going to see the Ballast Point sales for around $15, $16 a six pack, okay, versus competitors that you'll see at under $10 or just a bit over $10 a six pack. So it's a very, very high-growth, high-margin product. Now our strategy with Ballast Point is actually pretty simple, and it's why we were so particularly interested in the brand, which is our strategy is we don't really have to do too much other than what they're doing right now. The key to Ballast Point is maintaining the growth, and I think the maintenance of the growth is going to be a function of maintenance of sort of the award-winning stature and high quality of the brand. It's a very sought-after product. All of the people that had been involved in making Ballast Point what it is today continue. That's Jack White, the founder; it's Jim Buechler, the CEO. All of these people are brewmasters, the incredible group of people that we have there, continue to be 100% behind the brand and have continued very enthusiastically with Constellation. Part of the motivation for that wine to sell the business to Constellation was -- of all the buyers, they saw Constellation as the best fit because of our incredibly strong position in the beer industry and the fact that we are only a high-end beer manufacturer and seller as well as being in the high end of the wine business, which makes us a completely different animal, okay? We're not big beer, okay, in the sense of one of -- being one of the 2 U.S. premium domestic producers. So the strategy with Ballast Point is all about continuing to do what the company has been doing and, I would say, bringing incrementally to that some of the areas where I think that Constellation can be a help -- of help. And that would be with major key accounts and, I would say, other places where a smaller company wouldn't necessarily have the ability to play right off the bat."

But I'm kind of still stuck on the consumer proposition from a longer-term perspective. When I hear you emphasize growth in a multiple, I'm reminded of wine deals in the past going back far enough where growth was irrational. And then when I look at the craft beer segment, I think the segment's been around for a long time, and we probably all argue over -- whether there's more than really one brand, Sam Adams, that's become a national brand and really has that sessionability associated with it, so -- and then the price point and the IPA. It's like these are not brands that you see people kind of having in -- you get a group of 5 people together. One is going to be having Sculpin. One is going to be having another craft beer. So it just doesn't seem to lend itself to being a big brand the way your imported beer portfolio does. So could you just speak about that consumer proposition and how you're thinking about that?"

And when we say big, okay, I think that, that may be a relative kind of a number. I mean, we're not talking volume metrically, Bud Light big, okay? But versus where it is right now, okay, it can be a lot bigger. And if you look at sort of the competitors in the marketplace and where they are volumetrically, okay, that implies a huge amount of growth for Ballast Point. And obviously, at the kind of price point and margins that we're talking about, big is a relative term. So you look at some of the other competitors, and we clearly see plenty of craft brands in the 10-million to 30-plus million case ranges, right? And we start out at 4 million cases right now as we end the year with over 100% growth rate, so -- and incredible margin. So things are relative. I mean, I think that what we're really are talking here financially is about the kind of contribution, right, economically and financially, that a Ballast Point can make to our bottom line. With all that said, maintaining the quality and the award-winning position of the brand with craft consumers is going to be key to that, and I am 100% sure that the team that's running Ballast Point will do that. We have some unbelievable great new products that are coming out like a Watermelon Dorado, which is a double IPA.

Is there anything else that was driving that disconnect?"

The wine industry has actually accelerated quite considerably and is probably, as we sit here right now, at one of the most robust points that it's ever been in. I mean, you look at the IRI dollars for the last 12 weeks, the wine industry has accelerated to over 6% growth. And probably even more importantly, if you look at the premium plus segment, which is a segment of $8-plus, okay, which is what we would be primarily interested in, okay, the industry has accelerated to a double-digit growth in dollar terms over the last 12 weeks, 11.2%. That's the industry, okay? And then as it relates to Meiomi, okay, number one, basically, the brand has a tremendous amount of momentum in and of itself, okay? We bring a lot to that party. Obviously, we bring distribution strength. We bring strength where we're major players, #1 players for that matter with key customers. If you look at our position today in beverage alcohol, total beverage alcohol, okay, which is really important, and you look at major, major customers like the mass merchandisers, like the big grocery chains, when you combine our beverage alcohol portfolio, okay, we tend to be a #1 supplier certainly in terms of the kind of profit that we're providing these key customers. So that's been helpful in driving the Meiomi results as well. And also I think that, like everything, okay, whether we're talking Corona, whether we're talking Model Especial, whether we're talking Meiomi, it's all about the consumer voting with their feet, all right? Meiomi has just a tremendous, tremendous amount of consumer acceptance, and that's building. So it's a very, very strong brand. It's a -- I've talked about this before, somewhat of a unique taste profile for pinot noir. And it's sort of fitting squarely into what the consumer is looking for, for that kind of product; and price point, everything. I mean, it's just a tremendous ""wine by the glass"" opportunity in higher-end, on-premise venues. So it just meets every kind of criterion for success."

They certainly come -- half, they come from better places, okay, as you move up the price scale and then how the wine is made, in particular things that add quite a bit of cost to wine: like how much oak is used; if it's white, how much of the product is fermented on oak; and age of barrels, quality of barrels; where the wood came from; et cetera.

I mean, I think you'll see -- trading up on wine is accelerating, and I think that you'll continue to see it be extremely robust. And I think that you'll continue to see us benefit from that trading up. And yes, you asked about pricing on wine. We are taking -- we're working with both. We both have significant trading up going on within the portfolio, and therefore, our sales growth is running considerably ahead of our volume growth, which is representative of that positive mix shift. And we're taking pricing where we think that it's applicable, and that would be in sort of the lower end of our portfolio, for instance. Products like -- we're not so focused on, I would say, share and volume. And there's opportunities to enhance profitability nominally, and they're not the most strategic areas of the business. So we're now into an environment where we're sort of getting the best of both worlds in that regard. Beer, okay. Beer is a -- you could guess, beer is becoming like wine. There is -- the high end of the beer business is a very exciting part of the business because there's huge trading up going on in beer, okay? The consumer is definitely premiumizing. It's premiumizing into our import. They're premiumizing into our import brand and craft. You see the high end of the beer business be very robust. You can see it coming right out of the sort of the premium part of that beer. We definitely think that, that's going to continue. And although the price differential seems big in beer, okay, that's really in percentage terms, okay? Yes, you're still talking about like a super affordable luxury. I mean way, way even more affordable than wine, right? It's a big deal for the consumer to go to a grocery store and buy 2 $25 bottles of wine. That's $50, okay? But the trade up to Corona at $1 a bottle versus whatever else they were purchasing at $0.50 or less a can, big percentage increase, but fundamentally not something that takes the product outside of the realm of an affordable luxury. So I don't think the consumer -- the consumer is proving to be pretty insensitive to those kind of changes at those sort of nominal prices."

I hope you enjoyed the holidays and had the opportunity to include some of our fine Constellation products in your celebrations with family and friends. Welcome to our discussion of Conste",1991,"Thanks, Patty, and good morning and happy new year to everybody. I hope you enjoyed the holidays and had the opportunity to include some of our fine Constellation products in your celebrations with family and friends. 
Welcome to our discussion of Constellation's third quarter fiscal 2016 sales and earnings results. Before we get started with a review of the quarter, I am pleased to report that we posted another year of exceptional stock price performance, with Constellation's stock increasing more than 45% for calendar year 2015 versus the S&P 500, which declined 1% for the year. This is the fourth consecutive year that Constellation was one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index. I believe this excellent stock price performance is being driven by our strong financial results, led by our beer business, which has incredible momentum and strong prospects for future growth. It is because of this tremendous growth opportunity that we are making smart investments now to ensure that we have the capacity, quality, control and flexibility to help us meet expected demand for our iconic beer brands well into the future. 
These investments include the construction of a new state-of-the-art brewery in Mexicali, Mexico. Details of our plans were announced earlier this morning. Initially, this brewery will be built to operate at 10 million hectoliters of production capacity, with future scalability to 20 million hectoliters. The Mexicali location is ideal given its close proximity to the State of California, Constellation's largest beer market. The new brewery is being built with similar technology and operational advancements as our Nava Brewery, and is designed to ensure consistency in brewing and production processes with the highest level of product quality expected between the 2 facilities. 
Let's take a moment to discuss the progress at our Nava facility, which had production capacity of 10 million hectoliters with the ability to expand at the time we acquired it. As previously discussed, we currently have work underway to expand Nava to 25 million hectoliters by the summer of calendar 2017 via 3 incremental 5-million-hectoliter expansions. 
In addition to our plans to build the Mexicali brewery, we also announced today that we have plans to further expand Nava with a 2.5 million hectoliter capacity expansion that will bring production from 25 million to 27.5 million hectoliters when completed in early calendar year 2018. Now I'm pleased to report that, as expected, our first incremental 5 million hectoliters of Nava production capacity recently became operational and is in the process of ramping to optimal capacity utilization levels. We now have 15 million hectoliters of functioning brewing capacity at Nava. Two packaging lines have been running to support this new brewing capacity, and ramp-up to full utilization is expected shortly for these lines, which will provide additional capacity for premium-class products like Modelo Especial and Coronitas. 
The second incremental 5 million hectoliters of new brewing capacity at Nava is underway, with this piece of the expansion to be expected to be completed by June of this year. And work continues on the third expansion phase, as we increase Nava production capacity from 20 million to 25 million hectoliters and continue to expand the rail and logistics capability around the site, with completion expected by the summer of calendar 2017. 
As these expansion activities continue, we have worked with ABI to extend the Interim Supply Agreement we currently have in place for finished goods in order to support our robust growth and enable a smooth transition as we increase capacity. This agreement is expected to remain in place through June of 2017 for a select number of products that are expected to represent about 15% to 20% of the company's needs for the U.S. marketplace. Overall, we remain on track with all expansion activities, but I'm excited to be in a position to continue investing in Mexico and enhancing our operational platform to support the industry-leading growth levels of our incredible beer business. 
Our additional investments in production capacity are designed to ensure that we are well positioned to capture the continued momentum and growth opportunities we see in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, which has consistently grown in the mid- to high single-digit range and is expected to grow at these levels into the foreseeable future. 
Our third quarter beer results are a testament to this momentum. As we achieved depletion growth of more than 16%, leading volume gains amongst all U.S. brewers and outperforming the U.S. beer industry, key competitors and all other imports with double-digit growth achieved by nearly every brand, every brand in our Mexican beer portfolio. 
Corona Extra posted accelerating depletion and consumer takeaway trends during the quarter by gaining distribution for key packages, accelerating velocities behind investments in media and merchandising and continuing to grow the can format, which represented nearly 25% of the growth of the Corona Extra brand during the quarter. 
Marketing initiatives for the brand included Corona Football with Jon Gruden, 2 major boxing matches, general market and Hispanic TV advertising throughout the fall football tailgating season and the airing of the O’ Tannenpalm holiday spot for the 25th consecutive year. 
Modelo Especial also delivered accelerating depletion growth of more than 20% during the third quarter, with all core Especial packages growing double digits. This brand's media investments included the continuation of Modelo Especial's national English-language TV and video campaign, with the addition of sports programming during the start of the NFL season across CBS, Fox, ESPN and ESPN2. And national Hispanic media continued throughout the quarter with weekly TV exposure to Spanish-language consumers. 
Now given some of these marketing highlights, it's important to note that the beer team was recently recognized by earning a top spot on Ad Age's 2015 Marketers' A-List. Constellation is the only beer, wine and spirits company to make the list, and I am very, very proud of this accomplishment. 
Collectively, these activities resulted in Modelo Especial becoming the #1 dollar-share gainer amongst established U.S. beer brands in the IRI channels during the third quarter, followed by Corona Extra as the #2 share gainer. Overall, the strong results that the beer business achieved in the third quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to Constellation's EPS guidance for fiscal 2016. David will have more to say about this in a few moments. 
When you put all of these pieces together, the exceptional growth of strong consumer demand for our Mexican beer brands, the exciting opportunity to invest in Mexico to expand our brewery operations and the on-schedule progress we are making to meet our expansion goals, it is clearly an exciting time at Constellation, where the opportunities to build upon our growth as a leader in the high end of the U.S. beer segment keep getting better and better. 
As you know, we acted upon another such opportunity for the future growth when we entered the U.S. craft beer market with the acquisition of Ballast Point, one of the most awarded major craft breweries in the industry. Ballast Point provides a high-growth premium platform that will enable Constellation to compete in the fast-growing craft beer segment, further strengthening our position in the high end of the U.S. beer market. 
Now Ballast Point is currently growing at more than 125% in IRI channels, and remains on track to sell nearly 4 million cases and generate approximately $115 million in net sales for calendar 2015, representing growth of more than 100% versus the prior calendar year. I am pleased to welcome the Ballast Point founder, Jack White, and the entire Ballast Point team to Constellation. 
And now I would like to discuss the business results for our wine and spirits business. In our wine and spirits business during the third quarter, we achieved earnings growth and strong margin expansion, driven primarily by the Meiomi wine acquisition as well as favorable mix and COGS trends. As I mentioned last quarter, we have successfully integrated into -- our new Meiomi wine brand into our existing wine portfolio and our efforts to expand distribution are working to drive incremental growth for the brand. As a matter of fact, the most recent IRI trends corresponding with our quarterly results show that the Meiomi Pinot Noir is growing more than 80% in IRI channels, a trend which has accelerated since we first acquired the brand this past summer. 
Third quarter depletions for the brand were also strong across all channels, growing more than 50%. Meiomi Pinot Noir is one of the hottest wines of the year, listed as #20 in the Wine Spectator's Top 100 Wines for 2015 and #1 on wine.com's Top 100 List, which is based entirely on consumer preferences. We believe the brand has plenty of room to continue driving healthy growth for our business. Just this quarter, we began shipping the 2414 vintage -- 2014 vintage of Meiomi Chardonnay, following the success of the 2013 Chardonnay in the marketplace. 
Our Mark West brand is also known as a leader in the premium Pinot Noir category, and we are pleased to announce that the new line extension, Mark West Black, is now shipping. This higher-priced tier of the Mark West brand welcomes consumers to the dark side of Pinot Noir, with a more full-bodied and rich taste profile. 
Now one of our newer brands, Tom Gore Vineyards, has been gaining consumer acceptance for its high quality and authentic second-generation grape farmer brand story. It has also been featured in publications like Wine Enthusiast, celebrating wine around the world, and the Wall Street Journal's My Ride Series. Our Focus Brands are gaining, again driving positive results for the quarter in our wine and spirits portfolio, led by brands like Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi, which is America's favorite Cabernet, holding the #1 Cabernet Sauvignon position with the highest dollar and volume sales. 
Other Focus Brand leaders include Kim Crawford, which was named #1 -- or #11, I'm sorry, on wine.com's Top 100 Wines of 2015; and The Dreaming Tree, which launched its Pinot Noir varietal earlier this year. 
Our luxury brand and tiers continue to maintain their reputation for excellence among the critics, with outstanding reviews, rankings and 90-plus scores for our brands like Robert Mondavi Winery, Simi and Mount Veeder, from publications like the Wine Spectator, Wine Enthusiast and Wine & Spirits. During the quarter, our spirits portfolio posted net sales growth of 2%, driven by Paul Masson Grande Amber peach flavor as well as SVEDKA Vodka Mango, Pineapple and Strawberry Lemonade flavors. 
Casa Noble Tequila is exceeding our expectations so far this year with continuing share gains, and was recently awarded a 94-point score in the Wine Enthusiast and a Top 10 Best Tequila designation by liquor.com. 
In closing, it is certainly shaping up to be yet another eventful year at Constellation. With the year quickly drawing to a close, I am very pleased with our progress to date. Our efforts have produced a year of strong financial performance, notable business and brand milestones, industry accolades and healthy growth within several areas of the business. I am particularly pleased that we have finalized our investment plans in Mexicali, Mexico, to support the future growth we see within our beer business. And we are working diligently on the Nava Brewery and glass plant expansions while maintaining the strong momentum of the commercial side of the beer business. 
In calendar 2015, amid all of our hard work and accomplishments achieved throughout the year, we also celebrated the 70th anniversary of our company founding. While we are proud of our most recent accomplishments, taking a longer view of our 70-year heritage gives us perspective of how far we have come, and even greater resolve to continue challenging our own expectations as we look forward to the next 70 years. 
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Klein for a financial discussion of our third quarter results."
258589,319058186,916450,"Constellation Brands Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jan 07, 2016",2016-01-07,"Earnings Calls","Constellation Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone.

The strong beer performance, a",1714,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with some Q3 highlights. Comparable-basis diluted EPS was up 15%. Stellar execution by the beer business drove strong marketplace and financial results for the quarter. The strong beer performance, along with some slight favorability in our tax rate and better-than-expected Meiomi results, are driving our full year fiscal '16 comparable-basis diluted EPS projection up to a range of $5.30 to $5.40 versus our previous guidance range of $5 to $5.20. 
Operational activities related to bringing new capacity online at Nava continue to progress as planned. And the beer business performance, timing of capital expenditures related to the Nava expansion and lower-than-planned income tax payments are helping to increase our fiscal '16 free cash flow projection to a range of $475 million to $525 million versus our previous range of $200 million to $300 million. 
In addition to our quarterly results, we recently completed the Ballast Point craft beer acquisition. And this morning, we outlined our plans to build a new 10-million-hectoliter brewery in Mexicali, Mexico, and further expand our Nava Brewery. 
Let's take a closer look at all of this activity, starting with our Q3 results, where my comments will generally focus on comparable-basis financial results. 
Consolidated net sales on an organic constant-currency basis grew 6% for the quarter. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth coming in over 16%. Beer net sales increased 8% on volume growth that came in a little under 7%. Beer net sales growth for the quarter was impacted by the overlap of a shift of approximately 2 million cases and $37 million of net sales from Q2 fiscal '15 into Q3 fiscal '15 related to the beer product recall. In addition to that activity, wholesalers also increased their inventory position during the third quarter of fiscal '15 to bring inventory more in line with historical levels. 
Given the Q3 fiscal '15 overlaps just mentioned, it is worth noting that beer net sales growth for the first 9 months of fiscal '16 totaled 11%, and we now expect full year fiscal '16 beer net sales growth to be in the range of 12% to 14%. 
Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant-currency basis increased 3%. This primarily reflects favorable mix across the business. As mentioned by Rob, Meiomi continues to demonstrate excellent marketplace momentum, as the brand generated approximately $35 million of incremental sales during the quarter. 
For the quarter, consolidated gross profit increased $89 million, up 13%, with gross margin increasing 280 basis points. Beer gross profit increased $58 million, primarily due to volume growth, favorable pricing and lower COGS. Our beer gross profit margin increased 360 basis points to 48.9%. 
Wine and spirits gross profit was up $31 million. This primarily reflects the benefit from the Meiomi acquisition, favorable mix and lower COGS. Wine and spirits gross profit margin increased 190 basis points to 43.6%. 
Consolidated SG&A for the quarter increased $29 million. This reflects marketing investments made by the beer and wine and spirits businesses. Corporate expense was up due primarily to an increase in payroll-related taxes associated with employee stock option exercises, higher incentive compensation expense and investments to support the growth of the business, including the establishment of our Chief Growth Officer function. 
We continue to expand margins across the business, as consolidated operating income increased $61 million and consolidated operating margin improved 210 basis points. Beer operating margin increased 360 basis points to 35.1%, and wine and spirits operating margin improved 170 basis points to 27.5%. Equity earnings increased $6 million due to strong results for Opus One.
Interest expense for the quarter was $76 million, down 12%. The decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates. At the end of November, our debt totaled $7.4 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $6.9 billion, a decrease of $326 million since the end of fiscal 2015. This primarily reflects our free cash flow generation, partially offset by the funding for the Meiomi acquisition. 
Our net debt to comparable-basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.5x at the end of Q3. Even with the funding of the Ballast Point acquisition, we expect to end fiscal '16 below the 4x level. Additionally, we continue to expect fiscal '16 interest expense to be in the range of $310 million to $320 million. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 32.3% compared to 29.2% last year, which reflected the benefit of certain tax credits. We now expect our full year tax rate to approximate 30%. 
Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For the first 9 months of fiscal '16, we generated $578 million of free cash flow compared to $209 million for the same period last year. Operating cash flow totaled $1.1 billion versus $750 million for the prior-year period. This increase was primarily generated by the beer business. Given higher projected earnings for the beer business and lower projected income tax payments, we now expect to generate operating cash flow in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion for fiscal '16. CapEx for the first 9 months of fiscal '16 totaled $514 million and was slightly below our CapEx spending from the same time frame last year. 
While our initial 10-million-hectoliter expansion at Nava continues to progress as planned, payment timing for some of the capital expenditures associated with this activity has shifted into fiscal 2017. In a few moments, I will outline the CapEx requirements we are targeting for the new Mexicali brewery and the additional 2.5-million-hectoliter expansion at Nava. 
Even with the incremental capital expenditures projected from these initiatives, we are decreasing our total capital expenditure estimate for 2016 to a range of $875 million to $925 million versus our previous guidance of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion for fiscal '16. Due to the factors just mentioned, we now expect fiscal '16 free cash flow to be in the range of $475 million to $525 million. 
Now let's move to our full year fiscal '16 P&L outlook. As discussed earlier, we are increasing our comparable-basis diluted EPS projection to $5.30 to $5.40. Our fiscal '16 comparable-basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. 
For the wine and spirits business, we continue to expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range. Meiomi's volume performance has exceeded our initial expectations, and we now expect fiscal '16 diluted EPS accretion from this acquisition to be around $0.07 to $0.08 versus our previous $0.03 to $0.04 accretion projection. The beer business is the primary driver of our diluted EPS guidance increase. We now expect volume growth of 10% to 12%, net sales growth of 12% to 14% and operating income growth in the range of 22% to 24% before any benefit from the Ballast Point acquisition. 
We closed the Ballast Point acquisition in December. We funded the $1 billion purchase price with a combination of net proceeds from the issuance of $400 million of 4.75% senior notes due in 2025, borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facilities and cash on hand. For calendar 2015, Ballast Point is expected to sell nearly 4 million cases and generate approximately $115 million in sales. On a comparable basis, the acquisition is expected to be neutral to diluted EPS for fiscal '16 and $0.05 to $0.06 accretive for fiscal '17. 
Our current beer segment guidance has us targeting a beer operating margin of approximately 34% to 35% for fiscal '16. The improvement versus our previous 34% target primarily relates to Q3 benefiting from lower depreciation as well as lower line commissioning and optimization costs than originally anticipated. Now that this incremental capacity has become operational, we expect these costs to ramp up in the fourth quarter. 
We are pleased that we have already achieved our mid-30% operating margin goal for our beer business. We expect the beer operating margin to continue to run in the mid-30% range over the next 1 to 2 years, as we still have much to accomplish at Nava, and expect some margin volatility as we bring online and optimize new capacity. As Rob mentioned earlier, we have extended the Interim Supply Agreement with ABI to ensure a smooth transition as we increase capacity. This could temper operating margin expansion in fiscal '17, as utilization at Nava will likely run below the utilization targeted before the extension of the supply agreement. 
Speaking of capacity, Rob also outlined our plans to build a new 10-million-hectoliter brewery in Mexicali and further expand capacity at our Nava Brewery. In the press release we issued this morning, we included a table summarizing the collective investments we are making in our Mexican operating platform. Let me provide a few highlights around the capital expenditures associated with this activity, starting with Nava. 
The additional 2.5 million hectoliters we are adding to Nava is estimated to cost approximately $250 million. This, combined with our previously announced Nava Brewery and glass plant expansion projects, puts our total targeted Nava capital expenditures at $2.5 billion. After fiscal '16, we expect to spend $1.1 billion over the fiscal '17 and '18 time frame, with most of that occurring in fiscal '17. 
The new 10-million-hectoliter Mexicali brewery is expected to cost $1.5 billion. And the associated land, water rights and infrastructure and other site requirements to accommodate scalability to 20 million hectoliters is estimated at $500 million. For this total $2 billion investment, we expect some initial spend to occur in fiscal '16, a little over half of this spend to come in fiscal '17 and '18, and the remaining spend to happen in the fiscal '19 to fiscal '21 time frame. 
Given the strong demand we see for our beer portfolio and our best-in-class margin profile, the investments I just outlined are expected to generate high returns with a fast payback. Even with the capital requirements associated with these initiatives, our strong projected earnings and operating cash flow will allow us to operate below our targeted 4x leverage range and continue to provide us with significant capital allocation flexibility. 
With that, we are happy to take your questions."

So I think that there's plenty of room left for Modelo Especial distribution expansion. It does not have the ACV of, say, Corona Extra. Right now, the ACV on Modelo Especial is about 65%. So we see lots of room for continued expansion in both distribution, and we see opportunity for expansion of velocity, i.e., sales per point of distribution, as the brand continues to gain momentum with general market consumers. So this is a real growth story for beer, in general, not only just for Constellation Brands. I mean it's a phenomenon."

And then more broadly, if you think about your ambition to really get bigger in the craft beer industry, do you think that you would have to have more collection of some of the more regional brands and expand distribution or more of a large-scale kind of brand like Ballast and just getting more scale with that brand?"

It's related to the growth percentage and the size of the brand, okay? So obviously, the multiple that we paid for it in relationship to the growth is actually a pretty reasonable purchase price, right? As you recall from my initial comments, the brand grew over 100% this year and 125% in IRI. So when you look at purchase price and multiple as a function of growth rate, it's pretty reasonable. And we don't see that growth rate changing much in the short term, so we expect another pretty robust year with Ballast Point. Also, you've got to realize that Ballast Point has the highest average retail selling price basically of any significantly sized craft, right? If you go buy some Ballast Point, you're going to see that Ballast Point sells for around $15, $16 a six-pack, okay, versus competitors that you'll see at under $10 or just a bit over $10 a six-pack. So it's a very, very high-growth, high-margin product. Now our strategy with Ballast Point is actually pretty simple, and it's why we were so particularly interested in the brand, which is our strategy is we don't really have to do too much other than what they're doing right now. The key to Ballast Point is maintaining the growth, and I think the maintenance of the growth is going to be a function of maintenance of sort of the award-winning stature and high quality of the brand. It's a very sought-after product. All of the people that had been involved in making Ballast Point what it is today continue. That's Jack White, the founder; it's Jim Buechler, the CEO. All of these people are brewmasters. The incredible group of people that we have there, continue to be 100% behind the brand and have continued very enthusiastically with Constellation. Part of the motivation for them wanting to sell the business to Constellation was, of all the buyers, they saw Constellation as the best fit because of our incredibly strong position in the beer industry and the fact that we are only a high-end beer manufacturer and seller as well as being in the high end of the wine business, which makes us a completely different animal, okay? We're not big beer, okay, in the sense of one of -- being one of the 2 U.S. premium domestic producers. So the strategy with Ballast Point is all about continuing to do what the company has been doing and, I would say, bringing incrementally to that some of the areas where I think that Constellation can be a help -- of help. And that would be with major key accounts and, I would say, other places where a smaller company wouldn't necessarily have the ability to play right off the bat."

It's clear on the -- what the distribution opportunity you present for a brand that already has some pretty clear distribution opportunities because of its award-winning qualities. But I'm kind of still stuck on the consumer proposition from a longer-term perspective. When I hear you emphasize growth in a multiple, I'm reminded of wine deals in the past, going back far enough where growth was a rationale. And then when I look at the craft beer segment, I think the segment's been around for a long time, and we probably all argue over whether there's more than really one brand, Sam Adams, that's become a national brand and really has that sessionability associated with it, so -- and then the price point and the IPA. It's like these are not brands that you see people kind of having in -- you get a group of 5 people together, one is going to be having Sculpin, one is going to be having another craft beer. So it just doesn't seem to lend itself to being a big brand the way your imported beer portfolio does. So could you just speak about that consumer proposition and how you're thinking about that?"

And when we say big, okay, I think that, that may be a relative kind of a number. I mean, we're not talking volumetrically, Bud Light big, okay? But versus where it is right now, okay, it can be a lot bigger. And if you look at sort of the competitors in the marketplace and where they are volumetrically, okay, that implies a huge amount of growth for Ballast Point. And obviously, at the kind of price point and margins that we're talking about, big is a relative term. So you look at some of the other competitors, and we clearly see plenty of craft brands in the 10-million to 30-plus-million case ranges, right? And we started out at 4 million cases, right now, as we end the year with over 100% growth rate, so -- and incredible margin. So things are relative. I mean, I think that what we're really talking here financially is about the kind of contribution, right, economically and financially, that a Ballast Point can make to our bottom line. With all that said, maintaining the quality and the award-winning position of the brand with craft consumers is going to be key to that, and I am 100% sure that the team that's running Ballast Point will do that. We have some unbelievable great new products that are coming out like a Watermelon Dorado, which is a double IPA. These are very sort of breakthrough products that I think are going to potentially set the craft world vis-à-vis the consumers on fire, so that's why it's been so successful.

That's the industry, okay? And then as it relates to Meiomi, okay, number one, basically, the brand has a tremendous amount of momentum in and of itself, okay? We bring a lot to that party. Obviously, we bring distribution strength. We bring strength where we're major players, #1 players, for that matter, with key customers. If you look at our position today in beverage alcohol, total beverage alcohol, okay, which is really important, and you look at major, major customers like the mass merchandisers, like the big grocery chains, when you combine our beverage alcohol portfolio, okay, we tend to be a #1 supplier, certainly in terms of the kind of profit that we're providing these key customers. So that's been helpful in driving the Meiomi results as well. And also I think that, like everything, okay, whether we're talking Corona, whether we're talking Model Especial, whether we're talking Meiomi, it's all about the consumer voting with their feet, all right? Meiomi has just a tremendous, tremendous amount of consumer acceptance, and that's building. So it's a very, very strong brand. It's a -- I've talked about this before, somewhat of a unique taste profile for Pinot Noir.

In particular, things that add quite a bit of cost to wine: like how much oak is used; if it's white, how much of the product is fermented on oak; and age of barrels, quality of barrels; where the wood came from; et cetera.

We both have significant trading up going on within the portfolio, and therefore, our sales growth is running considerably ahead of our volume growth, which is representative of that positive mix shift. And we're taking pricing where we think that it's applicable, and that would be in sort of the lower end of our portfolio. For instance, products like Vendange, where we're not so focused on, I would say, share and volume. And there's opportunities to enhance profitability nominally, and they're not the most strategic areas of the business. So we're now into an environment where we're sort of getting the best of both worlds in that regard. Beer, okay. Beer is a -- yes, beer is becoming like wine. There is -- the high end of the beer business is a very exciting part of the business because there's huge trading up going on in beer, okay? The consumer is definitely premiumizing. It's premiumizing into our import -- they're premiumizing into our import brands and craft. You see the high end of the beer business be very robust. You can see it coming right out of the sort of the premium part of the beer. We definitely think that that's going to continue. And although the price differential seems big in beer, okay, that's really in percentage terms, okay? Yes, you're still talking about like a super affordable luxury. I mean way, way even more affordable than wine, right? It's a big deal for the consumer to go to a grocery store and buy 2 $25 bottles of wine. That's $50, okay? But the trade-up to Corona at $1 a bottle versus whatever else they were purchasing at $0.50 or less a can, big percentage increase, but fundamentally not something that takes the product outside of the realm of an affordable luxury. So I don't think the consumer -- the consumer is proving to be pretty insensitive to those kind of changes at those sort of nominal prices."

Now before I begin the review of our accomplishments for fiscal 2016 and our plans for the coming year, I'd like to focus on the new initiatives disclosed within the press release issued earli",3209,"Thanks, Patty. Good morning, and welcome to our year-end call. Now before I begin the review of our accomplishments for fiscal 2016 and our plans for the coming year, I'd like to focus on the new initiatives disclosed within the press release issued earlier today. First, we announced that we are evaluating the merits of executing an IPO for a portion of our Canadian business. The consideration of this strategic action is the result of our ongoing efforts to identify value-enhancing opportunities for our shareholders and to strengthen the financial profile of our overall wine and spirits businesses. As we continue to transform the company, the focus and resources we've put behind strategic initiatives to support sustainable, value-generating long-term growth are also evolving. This effort would provide better visibility to the Canadian business, which delivered excellent financial performance in 2016. 
Our Canadian business has a strong leadership team with extensive knowledge of the Canadian market. They market and selling a winning portfolio of brands and have a proven track record of successful innovation and new product development that resonates with Canadian consumers. Their size and scale across Canada includes 8 wineries in key wine regions, approximately 1,700 acres of Canadian vineyards and a network of growers to support their Canadian-produced brands. And they are the largest holder of independent retail licenses in Ontario with more than 160 wine rack stores. We're in the early process of evaluating an IPO of this business and we plan to make a final decision later this calendar year, depending on market conditions. If an IPO is completed, the proceeds are expected to be used to manage debt and our other capital allocation priorities. 
This morning, we also announced our plans to acquire The Prisoner Wine Company brands, a super-luxury portfolio of 5 highly rated wines led by the largest brand, The Prisoner. It's other brands include Saldo, Cuttings, Blindfold and Sorin, with overall volume for the portfolio reaching 175,000 cases in calendar 2015. 
The Prisoner is currently the #1 super-luxury red brand growing at almost 30% in IRI channels at the $40 retail price point. Now similar to the Meiomi wine brand acquisition, The Prisoner acquisition aligns with our portfolio premiumization strategy and enables us to capitalize on U.S. market trends that favor high-end wine brands with accretive margin profile. In particular, it strengthens our position in the dynamic and margin enhancing super-luxury wine category and can be easily integrated into our existing portfolio of brands. 
So now let's turn our attention to some of our key achievements for the past year and great initiatives we have underway for fiscal 2017. Overall, I am pleased with the significant accomplishments and the impressive financial results we achieved in fiscal 2016. This past summer, we purchased the Meiomi wine brand, which is currently the fastest growing major brand in IRI channels in the $20 luxury price point. The brand delivered depletion growth of almost 60% in fiscal 2016, a trend which has accelerated since we first acquired the brand last summer. Its excellent margin profile is one of the contributing drivers of the margin expansion for the wine and spirits business in fiscal 2016. Meiomi Pinot Noir is one of the hottest wines of the year listed as #20 in the Wine Spectator's Top 100 for 2015 and #1, that's good, on wine.com's top 100 list, which is based entirely on consumer preferences. We believe the brand has plenty of room to continue driving healthy growth for our business. 
Last fall, we entered the craft beer market with the purchase of Ballast Point, one of the most awarded major craft breweries in the industry. Ballast Point provides a high-growth premium platform that is enabling Constellation to compete in the fast-growing craft beer segment, further strengthening our position in the high-end of the U.S. beer market. 
In calendar 2015, Ballast Point posted depletion growth of more than 130% and sold nearly 4 million cases. This phenomena level of growth is approximately 3x that of any major competitor. 
Operationally, we selected a site and secured the land to construct a new state-of-the-art brewery in Mexicali, Mexico. Initially, this brewery will be built to operate at 10 million hectoliters of production capacity with potential scalability to 20 million hectoliters and it will have similar technology and operational advancements as our Nava Brewery. 
And speaking of Nava, we successfully completed our first incremental 5-million-hectoliter capacity expansion as planned by year-end calendar 2015. And we are progressing with our plans to build out Nava to 27.5 million hectoliters by early calendar 2018. 
Now these investments in Mexicali and at Nava will ensure that we have the capacity, quality, control and flexibility to meet the expected demand for our iconic beer brands well into the future and position us to capture the continued momentum and growth opportunities we see in the high end of the U.S. beer market. 
Organizationally, we made key management changes across the business, strengthening the organization by fostering the continued growth and development of our people, while ensuring continuity to build upon our current success and drive the company's long-term growth strategies. Collectively, these accomplishments, in conjunction with our excellent business performance, have help to drive the appreciation of our stock, which remains one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 Index. 
Now let's move now to excellent business performance I just referenced as a critical component to our success. We'll start with the Constellation Brands beer business, which was the #1 contributor to growth in the total U.S. beer category last year, for the third consecutive year, with most of our brands in the Mexican import portfolio posting record volumes in 2016. And Constellation was the leader and the #1 share gainer in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market in calendar 2015. 
More remarkably, our beer business growth has accelerated every year since 2010, with depletion trends succeeding 12% in fiscal 2016. I'd like to take a minute to share some of this past year's amazing accomplishments for our iconic beer brands and highlight the key initiatives we plan to execute during fiscal 2017 in order to maintain this excellent momentum. 
Let's begin with the clear heavyweights in our portfolio, Corona Extra and Modelo Especial. These brands are 2 of the hottest brands in the industry and delivered 25% of U.S. beer category industry growth last year. Our flagship Corona Extra brand has been the #1 imported beer brand for almost 20 years and today is the #5 beer brand overall in the U.S. industry. This brand sold more than 117 million cases in fiscal 2016, growing depletions almost 10% versus the prior year. This growth occurred across the country as Corona Extra grew share in 49 out of 50 states and was the only top 5 U.S. beer brand to grow share for the year. 
Corona Extra growth has been accelerating over the last 5 years, with the launch accounting for about 1/3 of the growth in fiscal 2016. The remainder of the phenomenal growth came from the increased distribution and velocity of the iconic Corona Extra bottles. 
In fiscal 2017, we expect to increase our media investment in Corona Extra, while focusing the dollars against key periods that include the NBA Finals and our 120 days of Summer in order to maintain our leadership position during our most important selling season. We also plan to increase our digital investments as we saw great success with the brand's social media activities last year. We believe there remains tremendous growth opportunity in Corona Extra cans as depletions for this format increased more than 100% in fiscal 2016, but currently represents less than 6% of total brand volume. As such, we are investing more behind Corona cans to generate incrementally awareness and consumer demand. You'll see a heavy media presence leading into key can holidays, including Memorial Day, July 4 and Labor Day. 
Now moving to Modelo Especial, this brand is stronger than ever as the fastest-growing major beer brand in America. Last year, the brand grew depletions more than 19% to surpass 70 million cases and $1 billion in sales. As a result, Modelo Especial was the #1 dollar share gainer and is now ranked as the #8 beer overall in the U.S. market in total dollars sales, up from the #9 position last year. 
The size of this brand has doubled in just 5 short years and our goal is to keep this momentum going. In fiscal 2017, our biggest opportunity for this brand lies in expanding distribution because despite being the #2 import, Modelo currently has less than 50% distribution on most packages. We also see tremendous opportunity for this brand in the on-premise channel, where Modelo Especial increased more than 20% last year with the draft format increase of almost 50%, yet only about 30% of on-premise locations across the U.S. carry Modelo Especial today. So we are focused on closing that distribution gap and increasing the momentum. 
Now for the sixth consecutive year, we are increasing our Modelo Especial investment in national, Spanish-language TV and digital, and we will be running new TV advertising throughout the entire year, increasing our spend on live sports by 50% and investing in heavily visible soccer broadcast properties. In addition, we are increasing our general market media by almost 40% across national TV and digital with high profile placements during the NBA playoffs and key NFL matchups. Together, we expect these initiatives to position Modelo Especial for another great year of stellar growth. 
I also want to call out Corona Light, which we remains the #1 imported light beer by a large margin. Depletion growthon  this brand has accelerated every year for the last 5 years with depletions growing almost 8% in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2017, we plan to build on the already successful light cerveza campaign with a new TV advertisement, which will begin airing nationally this month. We have also added high profile live spots during NHL live broadcast this spring and sponsorships of national Major League Baseball games on ESPN during the key summer holidays. This will be supplemented with an investment in social media. We are also expanding Corona Light draft by launching with several additional distributors. The Corona Light can will continue to be a big point of emphasis as depletions for this format increase more than 40% in fiscal 2016. As you are aware, the bench strength of our beer portfolio goes deeper than our biggest brands. Part of what makes our collection of brands so powerful is the long-term potential of our smaller brands like Victoria and Pacifico that are currently outpacing category growth. 
And let's not forget about Ballast Point, a brewery known for unbridled innovation and outstanding quality and one that gives our beer portfolio a leading position in the craft space that can be built upon in several ways. This year, it's to expand the Ballast Point distribution nationally, making it available in all 50 states. This along with successful new product launches is expected to drive the strong double-digit growth we are targeting in fiscal 2017. Overall, I'm excited about the growth prospects for our beer business in fiscal 2017. As you can see, we have tremendous opportunity to grow the business organically through enhanced distribution and execution opportunities across the portfolio. As a result, we are targeting both net sales growth and operating income growth in the 14% to 17% range for our beer business in fiscal 2017, including the benefits from Ballast Point. 
From a brewery and operational perspective, in fiscal 2016, we achieved our key Nava Brewery performance goals for capacity utilization, quality and cost. All areas of the brewery expansion are well underway with overall project on schedule to be completed on time and within our budget. 
As we begin fiscal 2017, we'll be intensely focused on the continued expansion of the Nava Brewery to 20 million hectoliters. This capacity is expected to become fully operational within the next few months. As a matter of fact, we've already begun to run test brews and have all-new packaging lines up and running in test mode to support this 20 million hectoliters of capacity. 
Now over the next few months, we will continue to fine tune all the components necessary to successfully achieve this important milestone as planned. Within our existing capacity, we recently made our first brew of Modelo Especial Chelada at Nava with excellent results. 
With that accomplishment complete, we have now made brews of all of our products at this brewery. And as many of you are aware, our third phase of expansion to 25 million hectoliters is our next critical milestone and I am pleased to report that this work is proceeding as scheduled. I am proud of the fact that Nava is the newest and most advanced state-of-the-art brewery in the world and that our brewery team's capabilities and commitment to quality are unparalleled. These best-in-class credentials are what we plan to bring to our new Mexicali brewery. Mexicali is the ideal site for our sister brewery to Nava. The technology and skilled expertise we plan to put in place are designed to ensure the highest quality and consistency for our consumers, and we will continue to update you on the progress there. 
And now I'd like to focus on the operational results for our wine and spirits business. During fiscal 2016, we delivered overall earnings growth and margin expansion for our wine and spirits business. Our spirits portfolio produced solid results and our Canadian business exceeded its financial goals, while outperform the industry and growing market share for the year. Sales grew in the U.S. benefited from organic volume growth and positive mix trends. We delivered exceptional results for our focused brands, which grew depletions 5% for the year, and we are reaping the benefits of our targeted investments in these brands. As a matter fact, many of our Focus Brands were included in our list of significant milestones and accomplishments for our overall wine and spirits portfolio for fiscal 2016. 7 of our brands were featured on impacts annual hot brands list for wine and spirits, including Meiomi, which recently surpassed our very own Mark West as IRI's largest pinot noir for the current 12- and 52-week periods. And Kim Crawford recently emerged as the #1 Cabernet Sauvignon at IRI channels. Our products also called out in the Beverage Information Group's 2015 awards, which 4 of our brands achieved fast-track status recognizing their impressive growth. 3 were named rising stars, including one of our you with brands, Tom Gore Vineyards and to work established growth brands, such as Mark West, Ruffino, Simi and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. 
The Beverage Information Group also recognized as SVEDKA spirits groups brand which this year achieved its place as the #1 imported vodka in the entire U.S. We plan to continue building on the success of some of our most recent new brands and line extensions to capitalize on the hottest trends in the market. Our newest red blend Ravitch is a dark, fruit forward red blend, which structure and depth which has resonated well with consumers and will go national in September. 
Ravitch Cabernet Sauvignon performed very well during our exclusive testing period with a major retailer throughout last year end we are pleased to expand the brand to wider distribution this spring. We've also continued to support the growth of Tom Gore Vineyards, the farmer's wine, that meets consumers desire to know the people in places behind the products they choose. Some of our existing new line extensions include our Robert Mondavi private selection, bourbon, barrel Cabernet, which bodes an impressively rich that comes from a unique aging process in bourbon borrows. And Ruffino sparkling rosy, which expects to capitalize on the success of our Ruffino Prosecco and growing consumer tastes for imported Rosie wine and spirits. 
For the year, our spirits portfolio posted solid net sales growth of 6%, driven by the continued success of our flavor introductions for Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy as well as SVEDKA. almost doubled net sales this past year and tripled distribution in terms of number of accounts. We are upbeat about the future growth trajectory of these brand. In fact, we are putting resources behind Casa Noble to support what we believe is a compelling growth opportunity. Some of these investments include fresh packaging and new marketing campaign and continued cross-promotion with Corona Extra during the Cinco de Mayo holiday season. Our marketing campaign, the noble pursuit, features digital spots that highlights the heritage unique to with this fine tequila. We also plan to continue supporting our #1 imported vodka, SVEDKA, with the new addition to our line of a flavor is cucumber line. SVEDKA has been very successful in launching highly targeted unique flavors that stand out from the vast options on the shelf today and has proven it knows how to win in this space. We think cucumber line will be a great addition to the track record of success and the initial consumer response supports our optimism. From a strategic perspective in the fiscal 2017, our goal for the wine and spirits business is to grow profits ahead of sales and improve margins, which is reflected in our 2017 wine and spirits guidance of mid-single-digit sales growth and mid- to high-single digits profit growth for the year. 
So what will be the enablers of this goal? We plan to capitalize on the market today growth of our recent high-growth margin enhancing wine acquisitions, Meiomi and The Prisoner. We will continue our targeted approach to investing in a subject of our Focus Brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and greatest growth potential. We remain committed to mix and margin accretive innovation and new product development and have several new products in the Hopper, a few which I have just mentioned. And for the third consecutive year, we plan to execute price increases for select products within the portfolio. And finally, we plan to continue to optimize COGS through global blend management initiatives, productivity improvements and lower grade cost. Overall, we are committing people, technology and resources to work with our wholesalers and retailers to execute growth for our wine and spirits business. In closing, it has certainly been another exciting year at Constellation. Our achievements are many and have driven a year of strong financial performance. In fiscal 2016, we delivered industry-leading market results for our beer business, while continuing to enhance our operational platform in Mexico to support the growth of our iconic Mexican beer brands. Within our wine and spirits business, we maintained our focus on premiumization, innovation and brand building, which drove enhanced margins and earnings growth. We are very proud to have delivered another rewarding year of value to our shareholders and I am pleased that our results can support a significant dividend increase in the coming year. 
Overall, we remain committed to challenging ourselves in order to optimize the business opportunities that lie ahead. 
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Klein who will review our financial results for fiscal 2016 and the outlook for fiscal 2017."

Fiscal '16 was another very exciting year with strong financial performance in which we generated over $6.5 billion of net sales and 9% net sales growth. We expanded our operating margins in both businesses and improved our consolidated comparable basis operating margin by more than 200 basis points. We increased consolidated EBIT 18% and comparable basis diluted EPS 22%, and we produced $1.4 billion of operating cash flow, an increase of 31%. The best to our earnings and operating cash flow growth helped our net debt-to-comparable basis EBITDA ratio finish at 3.8x even as we made significant capital investments in our Mexican operations, acquired Meiomi and Ballast Point and return cash to shareholders with the initiation of a dividend and the repurchase of stock. 
We expect fiscal '17 to be another strong year as we are targeting healthy net sales, EBIT, operating cash flow and EPS growth, while we continue to invest in our world-class Mexican beer operating platform and increase our dividend per share by 29%. 
Given those highlights, let's look at fiscal 2016 performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Consolidated net sales on an organic constant currency basis grew 8% for the year. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth coming in over 12%. Organic beer net sales increased 13% on an organic volume growth of 11%. Ballast Point added $27 million of sales since joining our beer portfolio in mid-December. Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 3%. This primarily reflects volume growth and favorable mix. As mentioned by Rob, Meiomi continues to demonstrate excellent marketplace momentum as the brand generated $74 million of incremental sales since joining the portfolio last August. 
For the year, consolidated gross profit increased $373 million, up 14% with gross margin increasing 220 basis points. Beer gross profit increased $310 million, primarily due to volume growth, favorable pricing and lower COGS and our beer gross profit margin increased 300 basis points to 49%. 
Wine and spirits gross profit was up $63 million. This primarily reflects the benefits from the Meiomi acquisition and lower COGS. Wine and spirits gross profit margin increased 90 basis points to 42.2%. 
Consolidated SG&A increased $90 million. This reflects marketing investments made primarily by the beer business. Corporate expense was up due primarily to higher incentive compensation expense and increase in payroll taxes associated with employee stock option exercises activity and investments to support the growth of our business, including the establishment of our Chief Growth Officer function. 
Consolidated SG&A as a percentage of net sales remain constant at 17.5%. We continue to expand margins across the business as consolidated operating income increased $283 million and consolidated operating margin improved 220 basis points. Beer operating margin increased 300 basis points to 34.9% and wine and spirits operating margin improved 110 basis points to 24.8%. 
Equity earnings increased $5 million due largely to strong results for Opus One. Interest expense for the year was $314 million, down 7%. The decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates. At the end of February, our total debt was $8.1 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $8 billion, an increase of $812 million since the end of fiscal 2015. This primarily reflects funding for the Ballast Point and Meiomi acquisitions, partially offset by our free cash flow generation. 
Our net debt-to-comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.8x at the end of fiscal '16 versus 4x at the end for fiscal '15. Our fiscal '16 ratio does not reflect a full year EBITDA benefit for the Ballast Point and Meiomi acquisitions. Our effective tax rate for the year came in at 29.6%, which was essentially even with last year. 
Now let's briefly discuss Q4 results. Comparable basis diluted EPS came in at $1.19, up 16%. EPS growth was impacted by our tax rate as our Q4 rate was 29.8% versus a 23.2% rate in Q4 last year, which reflected the benefit of certain foreign tax credits. 
Beer business results for the quarter finished strong with organic net sales up 18% on organic volume growth of 14%. Net sales benefited from pricing in the overlap of certain sales adjustments recorded recorded during the fourth quarter last year. 
Beer depletions for the quarter grew 13%. This factors in Ballast Point depletions since the transaction closed in mid-December and the corresponding period last year. Ballast Point added a little under 1 percentage point to our Q4 depletion growth rate. 
Beer operating income increased 29%, primarily due to organic volume growth, favorable pricing and lower COGS, partially offset by increased SG&A largely attributed to higher marketing spend. Wine and spirits organic net sales on a constant currency basis were up 4% for the quarter primarily due to volume growth. Wine and spirits operating income increased 14%. This reflected the benefit of the Meiomi acquisition, organic volume growth and lower COGS, partially offset by higher marketing spend. 
Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. For fiscal '16, we generated $522 million of free cash flow compared to $362 million last year. 
Operating cash flow totaled $1.4 billion versus $1.1 billion for the prior year. This increase was primarily generated by the growth of the beer business. CapEx for fiscal '16 totaled $891 million compared to $719 million last year. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 246,000 shares of common stock for $34 million. Rob provided highlights of our agreement to acquire The Prisoner Wine Company brands. The cash paid at closing is expected to approximate $285 million. The transaction is expected to close by the end of April and to be $0.03 to $0.05 accretive to EPS for fiscal '17. 
This provides a good spot to move to our full year fiscal '17 P&L and free cash flow outlook. We are projecting our comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.05 to $6.35. Our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. The beer business is targeting net sales and operating income growth to be in the range of 14% to 17%. This includes the anticipated incremental benefit from our Meiomi acquisition. We expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the 10% to 13% range. Our projections include 1% to 2% anticipated pricing benefit for our Mexican portfolio. 
We are pleased that our beer operating margin finished fiscal '16 just under 35%, which came in line with our most recent guidance. Our fiscal '17 beer segment guidance has us targeting a flattish beer operating margin versus fiscal '16. In fiscal '17, we expect to see positive operating margin benefits from product pricing, ongoing favorability from foreign currency and commodities, glass sourcing and lower levels of finished goods purchased under the Interim Supply Agreement with ABI. And while we are pleased with our progress on our expansion activities at Nava, we still have much to accomplish as we continue to bring online and optimize new capacity. 
Given these activities, we will continue to see a ramp up in depreciation expense, line commissioning and optimization costs and employee hiring. These costs, along with marketing investments and the consolidation of Ballast Point, are essentially offset the margin benefits I just outlined. 
Looking closer at depreciation and amortization expense for the beer segment, it totaled $62 million in fiscal '16. We expect that to increase by approximately 125% in fiscal '17. 
For the wine and spirits business, we expect net sales growth in the mid-single-digit range and operating income growth in the mid- to high single-digit range. This includes the anticipated incremental benefit from the Meiomi and Prisoner acquisitions. We expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range, with operating income growth targeted to be ahead of sales growth as we are forecasting some mix benefits. 
In addition, we expect our interest expense to be in the range of $325 million to $335 million. Our tax rate to approximate 29% and our weighted average diluted shares outstanding to approximate 206 million. This does not assume additional ship stock repurchases. We expect fiscal '17 free cash flow to be in the range of $250 million to $350 million. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and CapEx of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion. Based on the midpoint of our guidance, we are targeting double-digit growth in operating cash flow for fiscal '17. This benefit is being more than offset by the planned increase in capital expenditures as our guidance includes approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion related to our beer operational expansion projects in Mexico. 
In the press release we issued this morning, we included an updated table summarizing the collective capital expenditure investments we are making in our Mexican operating platform and related timing. Overall, there is no change to the total cost estimate related to these projects. And fiscal '17 and fiscal '18 still represents the peak spending periods for this activity. We increased our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share for Class A stocks and to $0.36 per share for Class B stocks. This represent a 29% increase in our dividend rate per share. As a result, we expect approximately $320 million in dividend payments for fiscal '17. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our fiscal '16 financial performance and excited about the strong projected earnings and operating cash flow growth we are planning for fiscal '17. We continue to strengthen our financial profile and have significant capital allocation flexibility as we remain focused on operating in our targeted 3 to 4x leverage range. 
With that, we are happy to take your questions."

And if we treat it more as a stand-alone entity, it -- the fact of it's a very high-performing business in Canada will become a lot more visible. That's #1. So we think that, that will be positively reflected in its valuation and our valuation overall. #2, it's obviously also a capital allocation opportunity for us, as I said, an IPO of the Canadian business will enable us to continue to manage our debt and keep it at the levels that we think are optimal for the company as we also embark on some of our other strategic initiatives that are driving our very positive results in the wine and spirits business. Meiomi is an example, Prisoner is an example, our investments behind driving premiumization in the portfolio with our other brands, on our NPD initiatives. So we see the Canadian IPO as helping us to potentially achieve a lot of positive things that we think that are optimal. It is an interesting business. It's got strong growth. It -- we built an improved market share in Canada. So we think that it represents in many respects a great stand-alone opportunity. As far as its implications as to our strategy for the rest of the wine and spirits business, there really is no implication there. The wine and spirits business, our wine and spirits business remains very strong as you've seen in the results. We had fantastic leverage, P&L leverage in that business this year. We have tremendous margin expansion in that business, even inclusive of Canada, which is a bit lower in margin than the overall business, we posted operating profit margin in the mid-20s, which is fantastic for any business, in any industry, a mid-20s operating profit margin was the kind of leverage growth in a bit that we are getting in that business. So really no implication is relative to the rest of the business but we think that -- as I said, as a stand-alone business, it's a great opportunity from an investment point of view. So that's basically the thinking there."

But it seems like some of those favorable items you mentioned like the glass efficiency, pricing, top line leverage, et cetera, will be a lot bigger than some of the negatives that you mentioned, particularly given the strong gross margin momentum in Q4.

I would say that we -- while we also are benefiting from stepping away from the ISA with ABI, as you recall, we did extend also add a lesser amount in terms of case volume, we extended the IDSA with ABI, which it dampened some of the near-term margin upside that we may have otherwise seen. And then the last point really being Ballast Point. Now in terms of craft or formers, Ballast Point is probably the best-performing craft from a financial profile perspective, but it still is dilutive to our overall operating margin of our beer business."

That's #1. NPD continues to be really important in the beverage alcohol business. NPD is providing almost all of the growth across any category in wine, beer and spirits. Our beer business tends to be a little bit different than that because we're sort of in the main sweet spots of growth with our Mexican portfolio and our craft portfolio. But continuing to drive that NPD pipeline is again one of his main strategic initiatives. And as I said, our new acquisitions, Meiomi, Mark West is only a few years old, Prisoner, these are all key to our premiumization and strategy and driving mix. And again, this is the sweet spot of growth in the beverage alcohol business. So it's pretty straightforward. And then sort of I'd say day-to-day bread-and-butter stuff, COGS, control over COGS, cost and growth has been an important driver of our financial results there as well as other expense items in the P&L.

You know I would -- I do want to address your point around the level of conservatism in our guidance. I would say that we've taken the same approach this year guidance as we've used in the past. We're trying to give our best estimate as to where we think the business will land on the year and, I think, that's reflected in the numbers that we produced.

So it is opportunistic in that regard. It's also strategic in that clearly, premiumization is an important part of the strategy, whether it's wine, beer or spirits. Margin enhancement is important to us as we look at various opportunities across the 3 segments, which goes back, of course, to the premiumization element of the strategy and also obviously buying things that are sort of in the right place and the right time is important to us. You look at wine and clearly, all the big growth in wine right now is in the higher price points like the Prisoner. If you look at beer, it's almost the same and that it's better beer and higher price points that are driving that market. I think Ballast Point is a great example of that. I mean, that's sort of like at the high end of the beer market and it's got the fastest growth of any major craft brewer. It's almost the low contradictorily as sense that it would be the highest price and have the highest growth but that's what makes it as attractive as it is. And spirits is an interesting segment as well. We made a couple of small acquisitions in the craft spirits space over the last 12 months, 1 called craft house cocktails where we bought a minority interest in a brand that we think has the potential to be very fast-growing, high-margin business. And then another bourbon brand recently, again, that we think has the potential to be high-margin, high-growth too. But you know spirits, I'd say, is a little less developed from an opportunity point of view right now. The global spirits brand picture, I don't necessarily see us really playing in that. It's not really a great interest. It's a market that is somewhat is under pressure even in the segments that are growing pretty well, i.e., brown spirits and bourbon. But it's not really our sweet spot. But craft spirits, much like craft beers, it's pretty interesting. But much more developed mental in the craft spirits businesses much less developed than the craft beer and the brands are even smaller, okay, than in craft beer. But we look at that segment too. I just add 1 other thing. Our strategy as it relates to capital allocation acquisition really hasn't changed. Okay, we're not an acquisition vendor or anything to that effect. We're going to continue to be highly strategic, look at opportunities as they arise as we always have. Obviously, our strategy has changed a lot over the years. Now it's really about where we've taken advantage of opportunities. It's about buying sort of tuck-in, high-growth, high-margin, easy-to-assimilate type opportunities. So I guess, as I said, the answer to your question is some and some, its strategic and it's also opportunistic as we go forward here. We intend to maintain more importantly, our discipline on capital allocation, all of the things that we said being a priority, reducing debt, returning dollars and value to shareholders. And making occasional strategic acquisitions as they come along. And I mean, debt level sort of in that 3 range which we said."

Good morning, and welcome to our year-end call. Now before I begin the review of our accomplishments for fiscal 2016 and our plans for the coming year, I'd like to focus on the new initiatives disclosed within the press release issued earlier today. 
First, we announced that we are evaluating the merits of executing an IPO for a portion of our Canadian business. The consideration of this strategic action is the result of our ongoing efforts to identify value-enhancing opportunities for our shareholders and to strengthen the financial profile of our overall wine and spirits businesses. As we continue to transform the company, the focus and resources we put behind strategic initiatives to support sustainable, value-generating long-term growth are also evolving. This effort would provide better visibility to the Canadian business, which delivered excellent financial performance in 2016.
Our Canadian business has a strong leadership team with extensive knowledge of the Canadian market. They market and selling a winning portfolio of brands and have a proven track record of successful innovation and new product development that resonates with Canadian consumers. Their size and scale across Canada includes 8 wineries in key wine regions, approximately 1,700 acres of Canadian vineyards and a network of growers to support their Canadian-produced brands. And they are the largest holder of independent retail licenses in Ontario with more than 160 wine rack stores. We are in the early process of evaluating an IPO of this business and we plan to make a final decision later this calendar year, depending on market conditions. If an IPO is completed, the proceeds are expected to be used to manage debt and our other capital allocation priorities.
This morning, we also announced our plans to acquire The Prisoner Wine Company brands, a super luxury portfolio of 5 highly rated wines, led by the largest brand, The Prisoner. It's other brands include Saldo, Cuttings, Blindfold and Thorn with overall volume for the portfolio reaching 175,000 cases in calendar 2015.
The Prisoner is currently the #1 super luxury red blend growing at almost 30% in IRI channels at the $40 retail price point. Now similar to the Meiomi wine brand acquisition, The Prisoner acquisition aligns with our portfolio premiumization strategy and enabilizes us to capitalize on U.S. market trends that favor high-end wine brands with accretive margin profiles. In particular, it strengthens our position in the dynamic and margin enhancing super luxury wine category and can be easily integrated into our existing portfolio of brands.
So now let's turn our attention to some of our key achievements for the past year and great initiatives we have underway for fiscal 2017. Overall, I am pleased with the significant accomplishments and the impressive financial results we achieved in fiscal 2016. This past summer, we purchased the Meiomi wine brand, which is currently the fastest growing major brand in IRI channels in the $20 luxury price point. The brand delivered depletion growth of almost 60% in fiscal 2016, a trend which has accelerated since we first acquired the brand last summer. Its excellent margin profile is one of the contributing drivers of the margin expansion for the wine and spirits business in fiscal 2016. 
Meiomi Pinot Noir is one of the hottest wines of the year listed as #20 in the Wine Spectator's Top 100 for 2015 and #1, that's good, on wine.com's top 100 list, which is based entirely on consumer preferences. We believe the brand has plenty of room to continue driving healthy growth for our business.
Last fall, we entered the craft beer market with the purchase of Ballast Point, one of the most awarded major craft breweries in the industry. Ballast Point provides a high growth premium platform that is enabling Constellation to compete in the fast growing craft beer segment, further strengthening our position in the high end of the U.S. beer market. 
In calendar 2015, Ballast Point posted depletion growth of more than 130% and sold nearly 4 million cases. This phenomenal level of growth is approximately 3x that of any major competitor.
Operationally, we selected a site and secured the land to construct a new state-of-the-art brewery in Mexicali, Mexico. Initially, this brewery will be built to operate at 10 million hectoliters of production capacity with potential scalability to 20 million hectoliters and it will have similar technology and operational advancements as our Nava Brewery. 
And speaking of Nava, we successfully completed our first incremental 5 million hectoliter capacity expansion as planned by year-end calendar 2015. And we are progressing with our plans to build out Nava to 27.5 million hectoliters by early calendar 2018.
Now these investments in Mexicali and at Nava will ensure that we have the capacity, quality, control and flexibility to meet the expected demand for our iconic beer brands well into the future and position us to capture the continued momentum and growth opportunities we see in the high end of the U.S. beer market.
Organizationally, we made key management changes across the business, strengthening the organization by fostering the continued growth and development of our people, while ensuring continuity to build upon our current success and drive the company's long-term growth strategies. Collectively, these accomplishments, in conjunction with our excellent business performance, have helped to drive the appreciation of our stock, which remains one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 Index. 
Now let's move now to excellent business performance I just referenced as a critical component to our success. We'll start with the Constellation Brands beer business, which was the #1 contributor to growth in the total U.S. beer category last year for the third consecutive year, with most of our brands in the Mexican import portfolio posting record volumes in 2016. And Constellation was the leader and the #1 share gainer in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market in calendar 2015.
More remarkably, our beer business growth has accelerated every year since 2010 with depletion trends exceeding 12% in fiscal 2016. I'd like to take a minute to share some of this past year's amazing accomplishments for our iconic beer brands and highlight the key initiatives we plan to execute during fiscal 2017 in order to maintain this excellent momentum. 
Let's begin with the clear heavyweights in our portfolio, Corona Extra and Modelo Especial. These brands are 2 of the hottest brands in the industry and delivered 25% of U.S. beer category industry growth last year. Our flagship Corona Extra brand has been the #1 imported beer brand for almost 20 years and today is the #5 beer brand overall in the U.S. industry. This brand sold more than 117 million cases in fiscal 2016, growing depletions almost 10% versus the prior year. This growth occurred across the country as Corona Extra grew share in 49 out of 50 states and was the only top 5 U.S. beer brand to grow share for the year.
Corona Extra growth has been accelerating over the last 5 years with the can launch accounting for about 1/3 of the growth in fiscal 2016. The remainder of the phenomenal growth came from the increased distribution and velocity of the iconic Corona Extra bottles.
In fiscal 2017, we expect to increase our media investment in Corona Extra while focusing the dollars against key time periods that include the NBA Finals and our 120 days of Summer in order to maintain our leadership position during our most important selling season. We also plan to increase our digital investments as we saw great success with the brand's social media activities last year. We believe there remains tremendous growth opportunity in Corona Extra cans as depletions for this format increased more than 100% in fiscal 2016, but currently represents less than 6% of total brand volume. As such, we are investing more behind Corona cans to generate incremental awareness and consumer demand. You'll see a heavy media presence leading into key can holidays, including Memorial Day, July 4 and Labor Day.
Now moving to Modelo Especial, this brand is stronger than ever as the fastest growing major beer brand in America. Last year, the brand grew depletions more than 19% to surpass 70 million cases and $1 billion in sales. As a result, Modelo Especial was the #1 dollar share gainer and is now ranked as the #8 beer overall in the U.S. market in total dollar sales, up from the #9 position last year.
The size of this brand has doubled in just 5 short years and our goal is to keep this momentum going. In fiscal 2017, our biggest opportunity for this brand lies in expanding distribution because despite being the #2 import, Modelo currently has less than 50% distribution on most packages. We also see tremendous opportunity for this brand in the on-premise channel, where Modelo Especial increased more than 20% last year with the draft format increasing almost 50% yet only about 30% of on-premise locations across the U.S. carry Modelo Especial today. So we are focused on closing that distribution gap and increasing the momentum.
Now for the sixth consecutive year, we are increasing our Modelo Especial investment in national, Spanish language TV and digital, and we will be running new TV advertising throughout the entire year, increasing our spend on live sports by 50% and investing in heavily visible soccer broadcast properties. In addition, we are increasing our general market media by almost 40% across national TV and digital with high profile placements during the NBA playoffs and key NFL matchups. Together, we expect these initiatives to position Modelo Especial for another great year of stellar growth.
I also want to call our Corona Light, which we remains the #1 imported light beer by a large margin. Depletion growth on  this brand has accelerated every year for the last 5 years with depletions growing almost 8% in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2017, we plan to build on the already successful Light Cerveza campaign with a new TV advertisement, which will begin airing nationally this month. We have also added high profile, live spots during NHL playoff broadcast this spring and sponsorships of national Major League Baseball games on ESPN during the key summer holidays. This will be supplemented with an investment in social media. We are also expanding Corona Light draft by launching with several additional distributors. The Corona Light can will continue to be a big point of emphasis as depletions for this format increased more than 40% in fiscal 2016. As you are aware, the bench strength of our beer portfolio goes deeper than our biggest brands. Part of what makes our collection of brands so powerful is the long-term potential of our smaller brands like Victoria and Pacifico that are currently outpacing category growth. 
And let's not forget about Ballast Point, a brewer known for unbridled innovation and outstanding quality and one that gives our beer portfolio a leading position in the craft space that can be built upon in several ways. This year, it's to expand the Ballast Point distribution nationally, making it available in all 50 states. This along with successful new product launches is expected to drive the strong double-digit growth we are targeting in fiscal 2017. 
Overall, I'm excited about the growth prospects for our beer business in fiscal 2017. As you can see, we have tremendous opportunity to grow the business organically through enhanced distribution and execution opportunities across the portfolio. As a result, we are targeting both net sales growth and operating income growth in the 14% to 17% range for our beer business in fiscal 2017, including the benefits from Ballast Point.
From a brewery and operational perspective, in fiscal 2016, we achieved our key Nava Brewery performance goals for capacity utilization, quality and cost. All areas of the brewery expansion are well underway with overall project on schedule to be completed on time and within our budget.
As we begin fiscal 2017, we'll be intensely focused on the continued expansion of the Nava Brewery to 20 million hectoliters. This capacity is expected to become fully operational within the next few months. As a matter of fact, we've already begun to run test brews and have all-new packaging lines up and running in test mode to support this 20 million hectoliters of capacity.
Now over the next few months, we will continue to fine tune all the components necessary to successfully achieve this important milestone as planned. Within our existing capacity, we recently made our first brew of Modelo Especial Chelada at Nava with excellent results.  With that accomplishment complete, we have now made brews of all of our products at this brewery. And as many of you are aware, our third phase of expansion to 25 million hectoliters is our next critical milestone and I am pleased to report that this work is proceeding as scheduled. I am proud of the fact that Nava is the newest and most advanced state-of-the-art brewery in the world and that our brewery team's capabilities and commitment to quality are unparalleled. These best-in-class credentials are what we plan to bring to our new Mexicali brewery. Mexicali is the ideal site for our sister brewery to Nava. Their technology and skilled expertise we plan to put in place are designed to ensure the highest quality and consistency for our consumers, and we will continue to update you on the progress there.
And now I'd like to focus on the operational results for our wine and spirits business. During fiscal 2016, we delivered overall earnings growth and margin expansion for our wine and spirits business. Our spirits portfolio produced solid results and our Canadian wine business exceeded its financial goals while outperforming the industry and growing market share for the year. 
Sales growth in the U.S. benefited from organic volume growth and positive mix trends. We delivered exceptional results for our focused brands, which grew depletions 5% for the year, and we are reaping the benefits of our targeted investments in these brands. As a matter of fact, many of our focused brands were included in our list of significant milestones and accomplishments for our overall wine and spirits portfolio for fiscal 2016. 7 of our brands were featured on Impact's Annual Hot Brand list for wine and spirits, including Meiomi, which recently surpassed our very own Mark West as IRI's largest Pinot Noir for the current 12- and 52-week periods. And Kim Crawford recently emerged as the #1 Sauvignon Blanc in IRI channels. 
Our products were also called out in the Beverage Information Group's 2015 awards, in which 4 of our brands achieved fast track status recognizing their impressive growth. 3 were named rising stars, including one of our newest brands, Tom Gore Vineyards and 6 were listed as established growth brands, such as Mark West, Ruffino, SIMI and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi.
The Beverage Information Group also recognized SVEDKA Vodka as a spirits growth brand, which this year achieved its place as the #1 imported vodka in the entire U.S. We plan to continue building on the success of some of our most recent new brands and line extensions to capitalize on the hottest trends in the market. Our newest red blend Ravage is a dark, fruit-forward red blend with structure and depth that has resonated well with consumers and will go national in September.
Ravage Cabernet Sauvignon performed very well during our exclusive testing period with a major retailer throughout last year and we are pleased to expand the brand to wider distribution this spring. We will also continue to support the growth of Tom Gore Vineyards, the farmer's wine, that meets consumers desire to know the people in places behind the products they choose. Some of our existing new line extensions include our Robert Mondavi private selection, Bourbon Barrel-Aged Cabernet, which bodes an impressively rich profile that comes from a unique aging process in Bourbon barrels. And Ruffino Sparkling Rosé, which expects to capitalize on the success of our Ruffino Prosecco and the growing consumer taste for imported Rosé wines. 
For the year, our spirits portfolio posted solid net sales growth of 6%, driven by the continued success of our flavor introductions for Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy as well as SVEDKA Vodka. Casa Noble almost doubled net sales this past year and tripled distribution in terms of number of accounts. We are upbeat about the future growth trajectory of this brand. In fact, we are putting resources behind Casa Noble to support what we believe is a compelling growth opportunity. Some of these investments include fresh packaging and new marketing campaign and continued cross promotion with Corona Extra during the Cinco de Mayo holiday season. 
Our marketing campaign, the noble pursuit, features digital spots that highlights the quality and heritage unique to this fine tequila. We also plan to continue supporting our #1 imported vodka SVEDKA with the new addition to our line of flavors, Cucumber Lime. SVEDKA has been very successful in launching highly targeted, unique flavors that stand out from the vast options on the shelf today, and has proven it knows how to win in this space. We think Cucumber Lime will be a great addition to the track record of success and the initial consumer response supports our optimism. 
From a strategic perspective, in fiscal 2017, our goal for the wine and spirits business is to grow profits ahead of sales and improve margins, which is reflected in our 2017 wine and spirits guidance of mid-single-digit sales growth and mid- to high single digits profit growth for the year.
So what will be the enablers of this goal? We plan to capitalize on the market leading growth of our recent high growth, margin enhancing wine acquisitions, Meiomi and The Prisoner. We will continue our targeted approach to investing in a subset of our focused brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and the greatest growth potential. We remain committed to mix and margin accretive innovation and new product development and have several new products in the hopper, a few of which I just mentioned. And for the third consecutive year, we plan to execute price increases for select products within the portfolio. 
And finally, we plan to continue to optimize COGS through global blend management initiatives, productivity improvements and lower grade cost. Overall, we are committing people, technology and resources to work with our wholesalers and retailers to execute growth for our wine and spirits business. 
In closing, it has certainly been another exciting year at Constellation. Our achievements are many and have driven a year of strong financial performance. In fiscal 2016, we delivered industry-leading market results for our beer business, while continuing to enhance our operational platform in Mexico to support the growth of our iconic Mexican beer brands. Within our wine and spirits business, we maintained our focus on premiumization, innovation and brand building, which drove enhanced margins and earnings growth. We are very proud to have delivered another rewarding year of value to our shareholders. And I am pleased that our results can support a significant dividend increase in the coming year.
Overall, we remain committed to challenging ourselves in order to optimize the business opportunities that lie ahead.
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Klein, who will review our financial results for fiscal 2016 and the outlook for fiscal 2017."

Fiscal '16 was another very exciting year with strong financial performance in which we generated over $6.5 billion of net sales and 9% net sales growth. We expanded operating margins in both businesses and improved",1648,"Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Fiscal '16 was another very exciting year with strong financial performance in which we generated over $6.5 billion of net sales and 9% net sales growth. We expanded operating margins in both businesses and improved our consolidated comparable basis operating margin by more than 200 basis points. We increased consolidated EBIT 18% and comparable basis diluted EPS 22%, and we produced $1.4 billion of operating cash flow, an increase of 31%. The strong earnings and operating cash flow growth helped our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio finish at 3.8x even as we made significant capital investments in our Mexican operations, acquired Meiomi and Ballast Point and return cash to shareholders with the initiation of a dividend and the repurchase of stock.
We expect fiscal '17 to be another strong year as we are targeting healthy net sales, EBIT, operating cash flow and EPS growth while we continue to invest in our world-class Mexican beer operating platform and increase our dividend per share by 29%.
Given those highlights, let's look at fiscal 2016 performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Consolidated net sales on an organic constant currency basis grew 8% for the year. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth coming in over 12%. 
Organic beer net sales increased 13% on organic volume growth of 11%. Ballast Point added $27 million of sales since joining our beer portfolio in mid-December. 
Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 3%. This primarily reflects volume growth and favorable mix. As mentioned by Rob, Meiomi continues to demonstrate excellent marketplace momentum as the brand generated $74 million of incremental sales since joining the portfolio last August.
For the year, consolidated gross profit increased $373 million, up 14% with gross margin increasing 220 basis points. Beer gross profit increased $310 million, primarily due to volume growth, favorable pricing and lower COGS, and our beer gross profit margin increased 300 basis points to 49%. 
Wine and spirits gross profit was up $63 million. This primarily reflects the benefits from the Meiomi acquisition and lower COGS. Wine and spirits gross profit margin increased 90 basis points to 42.2%.
Consolidated SG&A increased $90 million. This reflects marketing investments made primarily by the beer business. Corporate expense was up due primarily to higher incentive compensation expense and increase in payroll taxes associated with employee stock option exercise activity and investments to support the growth of our business, including the establishment of our Chief Growth Officer function.
Consolidated SG&A as a percentage of net sales remain constant at 17.5%. We continue to expand margins across the business as consolidated operating income increased $283 million and consolidated operating margin improved 220 basis points. 
Beer operating margin increased 300 basis points to 34.9% and wine and spirits operating margin improved 110 basis points to 24.8%.
Equity earnings increased $5 million due largely to strong results for Opus One. Interest expense for the year was $314 million, down 7%. The decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates. 
At the end of February, our total debt was $8.1 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $8 billion, an increase of $812 million since the end of fiscal 2015. This primarily reflects funding for the Ballast Point and Meiomi acquisitions, partially offset by our free cash flow generation.
Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.8x at the end of fiscal '16 versus 4x at the end for fiscal '15. Our fiscal '16 ratio does not reflect a full year EBITDA benefit for the Ballast Point and Meiomi acquisitions. 
Our effective tax rate for the year came in at 29.6%, which was essentially even with last year.
Now let's briefly discuss Q4 results. Comparable basis diluted EPS came in at $1.19, up 16%. EPS growth was impacted by our tax rate as our Q4 rate was 29.8% versus a 23.2% rate in Q4 last year, which reflected the benefit of certain foreign tax credits.
Beer business results for the quarter finished strong with organic net sales up 18% on organic volume growth of 14%. Net sales benefited from pricing in the overlap of certain sales adjustments recorded during the fourth quarter last year.
Beer depletions for the quarter grew 13%. This factors in Ballast Point depletions since the transaction close date in mid-December and the corresponding period last year. Ballast Point added a little under 1 percentage point to our Q4 depletion growth rate.
Beer operating income increased 29%, primarily due to organic volume growth, favorable pricing and lower COGS, partially offset by increased SG&A largely attributed to higher marketing spend. 
Wine and spirits organic net sales on a constant currency basis were up 4% for the quarter primarily due to volume growth. Wine and spirits operating income increased 14%. This reflected the benefit of the Meiomi acquisition, organic volume growth and lower COGS, partially offset by higher marketing spend.
Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. For fiscal '16, we generated $522 million of free cash flow compared to $362 million last year.
Operating cash flow totaled $1.4 billion versus $1.1 billion for the prior year. This increase was primarily generated by the growth of the beer business. CapEx for fiscal '16 totaled $891 million compared to $719 million last year.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 246,000 shares of common stock for $34 million. Rob provided highlights of our agreement to acquire The Prisoner Wine Company brands. The cash paid at closing is expected to approximate $285 million. The transaction is expected to close by the end of April and to be $0.03 to $0.05 accretive to EPS for fiscal '17.
This provides a good spot to move to our full year fiscal '17 P&L and free cash flow outlook. We are projecting our comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.05 to $6.35. Our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. 
The beer business is targeting net sales and operating income growth to be in the range of 14% to 17%. This includes the anticipated incremental benefit from our Meiomi acquisition. We expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the 10% to 13% range. Our projections include 1% to 2% anticipated pricing benefit for our Mexican portfolio.
We are pleased that our beer operating margin finished fiscal '16 just under 35%, which came in line with our most recent guidance. Our fiscal '17 beer segment guidance has us targeting a flattish beer operating margin versus fiscal '16.  In fiscal '17, we expect to see positive operating margin benefits from product pricing, ongoing favorability from foreign currency and commodities, glass sourcing and lower levels of finished goods purchased under the Interim Supply Agreement with ABI. And while we are pleased with our progress on our expansion activities at Nava, we still have much to accomplish as we continue to bring online and optimize new capacity.
Given these activities, we will continue to see a ramp up in depreciation expense, line commissioning and optimization costs and employee hiring. These costs, along with marketing investments and the consolidation of Ballast Point are essentially offset the margin benefits I just outlined.
Looking closer at depreciation and amortization expense for the beer segment, it totaled $62 million in fiscal '16. We expect that to increase by approximately 125% in fiscal '17.
For the wine and spirits business, we expect net sales growth in the mid-single-digit range and operating income growth in the mid- to high single digit range. This includes the anticipated incremental benefit from the Meiomi and Prisoner acquisitions. We expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range, with operating income growth targeted to be ahead of sales growth as we are forecasting some mix benefits.
In addition, we expect our interest expense to be in the range of $325 million to $335 million. Our tax rate to approximate 29% and our weighted average diluted shares outstanding to approximate 206 million. This does not assume additional ship stock repurchases.
We expect fiscal '17 free cash flow to be in the range of $250 million to $350 million. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and CapEx of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion. Based on the midpoint of our guidance, we are targeting double-digit growth in operating cash flow for fiscal '17. This benefit is being more than offset by the planned increase in capital expenditures as our guidance includes approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion related to our beer operational expansion projects in Mexico.
In the press release we issued this morning, we included an updated table summarizing the collective capital expenditure investments we are making in our Mexican operating platform and related timing. Overall, there is no change to the total cost estimate related to these projects. And fiscal '17 and fiscal '18 still represents the peak spending periods for this activity. We increased our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share for Class A stock and to $0.36 per share for Class B stock. This represent a 29% increase in our dividend rate per share. As a result, we expect approximately $320 million in dividend payments for fiscal '17. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our fiscal '16 financial performance and excited about the strong projected earnings and operating cash flow growth we are planning for fiscal '17. We continue to strengthen our financial profile and have significant capital allocation flexibility as we remain focused on operating in our targeted 3 to 4x leverage range.
With that, we are happy to take your questions."

So the Canadian IPO is really assuming that it occurs, intended to achieve a number of things. They are #1, we think that sort of buried in the whole company in the Wine & Spirits division, it doesn't really get much visibility from a value perspective. And that if we treat it more as a stand-alone entity, it -- the fact of that it is a very high-performing business in Canada will become a lot more visible. That's #1. So we think that, that will be positively reflected in its valuation and our valuation overall. #2, it's obviously also a capital allocation opportunity for us, as I said, an IPO of part of the Canadian business will enable us to continue to manage our debt and keep it at the levels that we think are optimal for the company as we also embark on some of our other strategic initiatives that are driving our very positive results in the wine and spirits business. Meiomi is an example, Prisoner is an example, our investments behind driving premiumization in the portfolio with our other brands, on our NPD initiatives. So we see the Canadian IPO is helping us to potentially achieve a lot of positive things. It is an interesting business. It's got strong growth. It -- we built an approved market share in Canada. So we think that it represents in many respects a great stand-alone opportunity. As far as its implications as to our strategy for the rest of the wine and spirits business, there really is no implication there. The wine and spirits business, our wine and spirits business remains very strong as you've seen in the results. We had fantastic leverage, P&L leverage in that business this year. We had tremendous margin expansion in that business, even inclusive of Canada, which is a bit lower in margin than the overall business. We posted operating profit margin in the mid-20s, which is fantastic for any business, in any industry, a mid-20s operating profit margin was the kind of leverage and growth in EBIT that we're getting in that business. So really no implication is relative to the rest of the business, but we think that -- as I said, as a stand-alone business, it's a great opportunity from an investment point of view. So that's basically the thinking there."

But it seems like some of those favorable items you mentioned like the glass efficiency, pricing, top line leverage, et cetera, would be a lot bigger than some of the negatives that you mentioned, particularly given the strong gross margin momentum in Q4.

I would say that we -- while we also are benefiting from stepping away from the ISA with ABI, as you will recall, we did extend although at a lesser amount in terms of case volume, we extended the ISA with ABI, which dampened some of the near-term margin upside that we may have otherwise seen. And then the last point really being Ballast Point. Now in terms of craft performers, Ballast Point is probably one of the best performing crafts from a financial profile perspective, but it's still is dilutive to our overall operating margin of our beer business."

That's #1. NPD continues to be really important in the beverage alcohol business. NPD is providing almost all of the growth across any category in wine, beer and spirits. Our beer business tends to be a little bit different than that because we happen to be sort of in the main sweet spot of growth with our Mexican portfolio and our craft portfolio. But continuing to drive that NPD pipeline is again, one of his main strategic initiatives. And as I said, our new acquisitions, Meiomi, Mark West is only a few years old, Prisoner, these are all key to our premiumization and strategy and driving mix.

And yes, in some instances, it's an acquisition like The Prisoner or Meiomi and I would say that early returns on Meiomi and Ballast Point are very positive from a shareholder return standpoint. We expect to see the same results from an execution standpoint from The Prisoner transaction. You can see that we do remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders as evidenced by a 29% increase in our dividend. And we will continue to look at share repurchase when we can stay within our leverage -- our targeted leverage range, and we can be opportunistic in the market. And remember that the guidance that we gave, assuming 206 million shares outstanding assumes no additional share repurchases at this point."

And then look, we're increasing our marketing activities ahead of the market, very cautiously because the most critical thing we have is to maintain the health of these brands. And therefore, we think that continuing to increase our share of voice in building these brands is important. And then we also have great execution in that regard.

It is obviously opportunistic in that. You can't necessarily predict that there's going to be a willing seller of things that we would like to acquire at the price that we would like to acquire it. So it is opportunistic in that regard. It's also strategic in that. Clearly, premiumization is an important part of the strategy, whether it's wine, beer or spirits. Margin enhancement is important to us as we look at various opportunities across the 3 segments, which goes back, of course, to the premiumization element of the strategy and also obviously, buying things that are sort of in the right place at the right time is important to us. You look at wine and clearly, all the big growth in wine right now is in these higher price points like The Prisoner. If you look at beer, it's almost the same and that its better beer and higher price points that are driving that market. I think Ballast Point is a great example of that. I mean, that's sort of like at the highest end of the beer market and it's got the fastest growth of any major craft brewer. It's almost a little contradictory in the sense that it would be the highest price and have the highest growth, but that's what makes it as attractive as it is. And then spirits is an interesting segment as well. We made a couple of small acquisitions in the craft spirits space over the last 12 months, one called Crafthouse Cocktails, where we bought a minority interest in a brand that we think has the potential to be very fast-growing, high-margin business. And then another bourbon brand recently, again, that we think has the potential to be high-margin, high-growth too. But -- so spirits, I'd say, is a little less developed from an opportunity point of view right now. The global spirits brand picture, I don't necessarily see us really playing in that. It's not of great interest. It's a market that somewhat is under pressure even in the segments that are growing pretty well, i.e., brown spirits and bourbon. But it's not really our sweet spot. But craft spirits, much like craft beers, it's pretty interesting. But much more developmental in that the craft spirits business is much less developed than the craft beer and the brands are even smaller, okay, than in craft beer. But we look at that segment too. I'll just add one other thing. Our strategy as it relates to capital allocation acquisition really hasn't changed. Okay, we're not an acquisition vendor or anything to that effect. We're going to continue to be highly strategic, look at opportunities as they arise as we always have. Obviously, our strategy has changed a lot over the years. Now it's really about where we've taken the advantage of opportunities. It's about buying sort of tuck-in, high-growth, high-margin, easy-to-assimilate type opportunities. So I guess, as I said, the answer to your question is some and some, it's strategic but it's also opportunistic as we go forward here. We intend to maintain more importantly, our discipline on capital allocation, all the things that we've said being a priority, reducing debt, returning dollars and value to shareholders, and making occasional strategic acquisitions as they come along. I mean, clearing your debt levels sort of in that 3 range where we've said."

Good morning, and welcome to our year-end call. Now before I begin the review of our accomplishments for fiscal 2016 and our plans for the coming year, I'd like to focus on the new initiatives disclosed within the press release issued earlier today. 
First, we announced that we are evaluating the merits of executing an IPO for a portion of our Canadian business. The consideration of this strategic action is the result of our ongoing efforts to identify value-enhancing opportunities for our shareholders and to strengthen the financial profile of our overall wine and spirits businesses. As we continue to transform the company, the focus and resources we put behind strategic initiatives to support sustainable, value-generating long-term growth are also evolving. This effort would provide better visibility to the Canadian business, which delivered excellent financial performance in 2016.
Our Canadian business has a strong leadership team with extensive knowledge of the Canadian market. They market and sell a winning portfolio of brands and have a proven track record of successful innovation and new product development that resonates with Canadian consumers. Their size and scale across Canada includes 8 wineries in key wine regions, approximately 1,700 acres of Canadian vineyards and a network of growers to support their Canadian-produced brands. And they are the largest holder of independent retail licenses in Ontario with more than 160 wine rack stores. We are in the early process of evaluating an IPO of this business and we plan to make a final decision later this calendar year, depending on market conditions. If an IPO is completed, the proceeds are expected to be used to manage debt and our other capital allocation priorities.
This morning, we also announced our plans to acquire The Prisoner Wine Company brands, a super luxury portfolio of 5 highly rated wines, led by the largest brand, The Prisoner. It's other brands include Saldo, Cuttings, Blindfold and Thorn with overall volume for the portfolio reaching 175,000 cases in calendar 2015.
The Prisoner is currently the #1 super luxury red blend, growing at almost 30% in IRI channels at the $40 retail price point. Now similar to the Meiomi wine brand acquisition, The Prisoner acquisition aligns with our portfolio premium-ization strategy and enables us to capitalize on U.S. market trends that favor high-end wine brands with accretive margin profiles. In particular, it strengthens our position in the dynamic and margin enhancing super luxury wine category and can be easily integrated into our existing portfolio of brands.
So now let's turn our attention to some of our key achievements for the past year and great initiatives we have underway for fiscal 2017. Overall, I am pleased with the significant accomplishments and the impressive financial results we achieved in fiscal 2016. This past summer, we purchased the Meiomi wine brand, which is currently the fastest growing major brand in IRI channels in the $20 luxury price point. The brand delivered depletion growth of almost 60% in fiscal 2016, a trend which has accelerated since we first acquired the brand last summer. Its excellent margin profile is one of the contributing drivers of the margin expansion for the wine and spirits business in fiscal 2016. 
Meiomi Pinot Noir was one of the hottest wines of the year listed as #20 in the Wine Spectator's Top 100 for 2015 and #1 -- that's good -- on wine.com's top 100 list, which is based entirely on consumer preferences. We believe the brand has plenty of room to continue driving healthy growth for our business.
Last fall, we entered the craft beer market with the purchase of Ballast Point, one of the most awarded major craft breweries in the industry. Ballast Point provides a high growth premium platform that is enabling Constellation to compete in the fast growing craft beer segment, further strengthening our position in the high end of the U.S. beer market. 
In calendar 2015, Ballast Point posted depletion growth of more than 130% and sold nearly 4 million cases. This phenomenal level of growth is approximately 3x that of any major competitor.
Operationally, we selected a site and secured the land to construct a new state-of-the-art brewery in Mexicali, Mexico. Initially, this brewery will be built to operate at 10 million hectoliters of production capacity with potential scalability to 20 million hectoliters and it will have similar technology and operational advancements as our Nava Brewery. 
And speaking of Nava, we successfully completed our first incremental 5 million hectoliter capacity expansion as planned by year-end calendar 2015. And we are progressing with our plans to build out Nava to 27.5 million hectoliters by early calendar 2018.
Now these investments in Mexicali and at Nava will ensure that we have the capacity, quality, control and flexibility to meet expected demand for our iconic beer brands well into the future and position us to capture the continued momentum and growth opportunities we see in the high end of the U.S. beer market.
Organizationally, we made key management changes across the business, strengthening the organization by fostering the continued growth and development of our people, while ensuring continuity to build upon our current success and drive the company's long-term growth strategies. Collectively, these accomplishments, in conjunction with our excellent business performance, have helped to drive the appreciation of our stock, which remains one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 Index. 
Now let's move to the excellent business performance I just referenced as a critical component to our success. We'll start with the Constellation Brands beer business, which was the #1 contributor to growth in the total U.S. beer category last year for the third consecutive year, with most of our brands in the Mexican import portfolio posting record volumes in 2016. And Constellation was the leader and the #1 share gainer in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market in calendar 2015.
More remarkably, our beer business growth has accelerated every year since 2010 with depletion trends exceeding 12% in fiscal 2016. I'd like to take a minute to share some of this past year's amazing accomplishments for our iconic beer brands and highlight the key initiatives we plan to execute during fiscal 2017 in order to maintain this excellent momentum. 
Let's begin with the clear heavyweights in our portfolio, Corona Extra and Modelo Especial. These brands are 2 of the hottest brands in the industry and delivered 25% of the U.S. beer category industry growth last year. Our flagship Corona Extra brand has been the #1 imported beer brand for almost 20 years and today is the #5 beer brand overall in the U.S. industry. This brand sold more than 117 million cases in fiscal 2016, growing depletions almost 10% versus the prior year. This growth occurred across the country as Corona Extra grew share in 49 out of 50 states and was the only top 5 U.S. beer brand to grow share for the year.
Corona Extra growth has been accelerating over the last 5 years with the can launch accounting for about 1/3 of the growth in fiscal 2016. The remainder of the phenomenal growth came from the increased distribution and velocity of the iconic Corona Extra bottles.
In fiscal 2017, we expect to increase our media investment in Corona Extra while focusing the dollars against key time periods that include the NBA Finals and our 120 days of Summer in order to maintain our leadership position during our most important selling season. We also plan to increase our digital investments as we saw great success with the brand's social media activities last year. We believe there remains tremendous growth opportunity in Corona Extra cans as depletions for this format increased more than 100% in fiscal 2016, but currently represent less than 6% of total brand volume. As such, we are investing more behind Corona cans to generate incremental awareness and consumer demand. You'll see a heavy media presence leading into key can holidays, including Memorial Day, July 4 and Labor Day.
Now moving to Modelo Especial, this brand is stronger than ever as the fastest growing major beer brand in America. Last year, the brand grew depletions more than 19% to surpass 70 million cases and $1 billion in sales. As a result, Modelo Especial was the #1 dollar share gainer and is now ranked as the #8 beer overall in the U.S. market in total dollar sales, up from the #9 position last year.
The size of this brand has doubled in just 5 short years and our goal is to keep this momentum going. In fiscal 2017, our biggest opportunity for this brand lies in expanding distribution, because despite being the #2 import, Modelo currently has less than 50% distribution on most packages. We also see tremendous opportunity for this brand in the on-premise channel, where Modelo Especial increased more than 20% last year with the draft format increasing almost 50% yet only about 30% of on-premise locations across the U.S. carry Modelo Especial today. So we are focused on closing that distribution gap and increasing the momentum.
Now for the sixth consecutive year, we are increasing our Modelo Especial investment in national, Spanish language TV and digital, and we will be running new TV advertising throughout the entire year, increasing our spend on live sports by 50% and investing in heavily visible soccer broadcast properties. In addition, we are increasing our general market media by almost 40% across national TV and digital with high profile placements during the NBA playoffs and key NFL match ups. Together, we expect these initiatives to position Modelo Especial for another great year of stellar growth.
I also want to call out Corona Light, which remains the #1 imported light beer by a large margin. Depletion growth on this brand has accelerated every year for the last 5 years with depletions growing almost 8% in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2017, we plan to build on the already successful Light Cerveza campaign with a new TV advertisement, which will begin airing nationally this month. We have also added high profile, live spots during NHL playoff broadcasts this spring and sponsorships of national Major League Baseball games on ESPN during the key summer holidays. This will be supplemented with an investment in social media. We are also expanding Corona Light draft by launching with several additional distributors. The Corona Light can will continue to be a big point of emphasis as depletions for this format increased more than 40% in fiscal 2016. As you are aware, the bench strength of our beer portfolio goes deeper than our biggest brands. Part of what makes our collection of brands so powerful is the long-term potential of our smaller brands like Victoria and Pacifico that are currently outpacing category growth. 
And let's not forget about Ballast Point, a brewer known for unbridled innovation and outstanding quality and one that gives our beer portfolio a leading position in the craft space that can be built upon in several ways. This year, it's to expand the Ballast Point distribution nationally, making it available in all 50 states. This along with successful new product launches is expected to drive the strong double-digit growth we are targeting in fiscal 2017. 
Overall, I'm excited about the growth prospects for our beer business in fiscal 2017. As you can see, we have tremendous opportunity to grow the business organically through enhanced distribution and execution opportunities across the portfolio. As a result, we are targeting both net sales growth and operating income growth in the 14% to 17% range for our beer business in fiscal 2017, including the benefits from Ballast Point.
From a brewery and operational perspective, in fiscal 2016, we achieved our key Nava Brewery performance goals for capacity utilization, quality and cost. All areas of the brewery expansion are well underway with overall project on schedule to be completed on time and within our budget.
As we begin fiscal 2017, we'll be intensely focused on the continued expansion of the Nava Brewery to 20 million hectoliters. This capacity is expected to become fully operational within the next few months. As a matter of fact, we've already begun to run test brews and have all-new packaging lines up and running in test mode to support this 20 million hectoliters of capacity.
Now over the next few months, we will continue to fine tune all the components necessary to successfully achieve this important milestone as planned. Within our existing capacity, we recently made our first brew of Modelo Especial Chelada at Nava with excellent results.  With that accomplishment complete, we have now made brews of all of our products at this brewery. And as many of you are aware, our third phase of expansion to 25 million hectoliters is our next critical milestone and I am pleased to report that this work is proceeding as scheduled. I am proud of the fact that Nava is the newest and most advanced state-of-the-art brewery in the world and that our brewery team's capabilities and commitment to quality are unparalleled. These best-in-class credentials are what we plan to bring to our new Mexicali brewery. Mexicali is the ideal site for a sister brewery to Nava. The technology and skilled expertise we plan to put in place are designed to ensure the highest quality and consistency for our consumers, and we will continue to update you on the progress there.
And now I'd like to focus on the operational results for our wine and spirits business. During fiscal 2016, we delivered overall earnings growth and margin expansion for our wine and spirits business. Our spirits portfolio produced solid results and our Canadian wine business exceeded its financial goals while outperforming the industry and growing market share for the year. 
Sales growth in the U.S. benefited from organic volume growth and positive mix trends. We delivered exceptional results for our focus brands, which grew depletions 5% for the year, and we are reaping the benefits of our targeted investments in these brands. As a matter of fact, many of our focus brands were included in our list of significant milestones and accomplishments for our overall wine and spirits portfolio for fiscal 2016. 7 of our brands were featured on Impact's Annual Hot Brand list for wine and spirits, including Meiomi, which recently surpassed our very own Mark West as IRI's largest Pinot Noir for the current 12- and 52-week periods. And Kim Crawford recently emerged as the #1 Sauvignon Blanc in IRI channels. 
Our products were also called out in the Beverage Information Group's 2015 awards, in which 4 of our brands achieved fast track status recognizing their impressive growth. Three were named rising stars, including one of our newest brands, Tom Gore Vineyards and 6 were listed as established growth brands, such as Mark West, Ruffino, SIMI and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi.
The Beverage Information Group also recognized SVEDKA Vodka as a spirits growth brand, which this year achieved its place as the #1 imported vodka in the entire U.S. We plan to continue building on the success of some of our most recent new brands and line extensions to capitalize on the hottest trends in the market. Our newest red blend Ravage is a dark, fruit-forward red blend with structure and depth that has resonated well with consumers and will go national in September.
Ravage Cabernet Sauvignon performed very well during our exclusive testing period with a major retailer throughout last year, and we are pleased to expand the brand to wider distribution this spring. We will also continue to support the growth of Tom Gore Vineyards, the farmer's wine, that meets consumers desire to know the people and places behind the products they choose. Some of our existing new line extensions include our Robert Mondavi private selection, Bourbon Barrel-Aged Cabernet, which boasts an impressively rich profile that comes from a unique aging process in Bourbon barrels. And Ruffino Sparkling Rosé, which expects to capitalize on the success of our Ruffino Prosecco and the growing consumer taste for imported Rosé wines. 
For the year, our spirits portfolio posted solid net sales growth of 6%, driven by the continued success of our flavor introductions for Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy as well as SVEDKA Vodka. Casa Noble almost doubled net sales this past year and tripled distribution in terms of number of accounts. We are upbeat about the future growth trajectory of this brand. In fact, we are putting resources behind Casa Noble to support what we believe is a compelling growth opportunity. Some of these investments include fresh packaging, a new marketing campaign and continued cross promotion with Corona Extra during the Cinco de Mayo holiday season. 
Our marketing campaign, the noble pursuit, features digital spots that highlights the quality and heritage unique to this fine tequila. We also plan to continue supporting our #1 imported vodka SVEDKA with the new addition to our line of flavors, Cucumber Lime. SVEDKA has been very successful in launching highly targeted, unique flavors that stand out from the vast options on the shelf today, and has proven it knows how to win in this space. We think Cucumber Lime will be a great addition to the track record of success and the initial consumer response supports our optimism. 
From a strategic perspective, in fiscal 2017, our goal for the wine and spirits business is to grow profits ahead of sales and improve margins, which is reflected in our 2017 wine and spirits guidance of mid-single digit sales growth and mid- to high-single digits profit growth for the year.
So what will be the enablers of this goal? We plan to capitalize on the market leading growth of our recent high growth, margin enhancing wine acquisitions; Meiomi and The Prisoner. We will continue our targeted approach to investing in a subset of our focus brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and the greatest growth potential. We remain committed to mix and margin accretive innovation and new product development and have several new products in the hopper, a few of which I just mentioned. And for the third consecutive year, we plan to execute price increases for select products within the portfolio. 
And finally, we plan to continue to optimize COGS through global blend management initiatives, productivity improvements and lower grade cost. Overall, we are committing people, technology and resources to work with our wholesalers and retailers to execute growth for our wine and spirits business. 
In closing, it has certainly been another exciting year at Constellation. Our achievements are many and have driven a year of strong financial performance. In fiscal 2016, we delivered industry-leading market results for our beer business, while continuing to enhance our operational platform in Mexico to support the growth of our iconic Mexican beer brands. Within our wine and spirits business, we maintained our focus on premium-ization, innovation and brand building, which drove enhanced margins and earnings growth. We are very proud to have delivered another rewarding year of value to our shareholders. And I am pleased that our results can support a significant dividend increase in the coming year.
Overall, we remain committed to challenging ourselves in order to optimize the business opportunities that lie ahead.
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Klein, who will review our financial results for fiscal 2016 and the outlook for fiscal 2017."
258589,327941576,957700,"Constellation Brands Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2016",2016-04-06,"Earnings Calls","Constellation Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Fiscal '16 was another very exciting year with strong financial performance in which we generated over $6.5 billion of net sales and 9% net sales growth. We expanded operating margins in both businesses and improved",1650,"Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Fiscal '16 was another very exciting year with strong financial performance in which we generated over $6.5 billion of net sales and 9% net sales growth. We expanded operating margins in both businesses and improved our consolidated comparable basis operating margin by more than 200 basis points. We increased consolidated EBIT 18% and comparable basis diluted EPS 22%, and we produced $1.4 billion of operating cash flow, an increase of 31%. The strong earnings and operating cash flow growth helped our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio finish at 3.8x even as we made significant capital investments in our Mexican operations, acquired Meiomi and Ballast Point and returned cash to shareholders with the initiation of a dividend and the repurchase of stock.
We expect fiscal '17 to be another strong year as we are targeting healthy net sales, EBIT, operating cash flow and EPS growth while we continue to invest in our world-class Mexican beer operating platform and increase our dividend per share by 29%.
Given those highlights, let's look at fiscal 2016 performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Consolidated net sales on an organic constant currency basis grew 8% for the year. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth coming in over 12%. 
Organic beer net sales increased 13% on organic volume growth of 11%. Ballast Point added $27 million of sales since joining our beer portfolio in mid-December. 
Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 3%. This primarily reflects volume growth and favorable mix. As mentioned by Rob, Meiomi continues to demonstrate excellent marketplace momentum as the brand generated $74 million of incremental sales since joining the portfolio last August.
For the year, consolidated gross profit increased $373 million, up 14% with gross margin increasing 220 basis points. Beer gross profit increased $310 million, primarily due to volume growth, favorable pricing and lower COGS, and our beer gross profit margin increased 300 basis points to 49%. 
Wine and spirits gross profit was up $63 million. This primarily reflects the benefits from the Meiomi acquisition and lower COGS. Wine and spirits gross profit margin increased 90 basis points to 42.2%.
Consolidated SG&A increased $90 million. This reflects marketing investments made primarily by the beer business. Corporate expense was up due primarily to higher incentive compensation expense and increase in payroll taxes associated with employee stock option exercise activity and investments to support the growth of our business, including the establishment of our Chief Growth Officer function.
Consolidated SG&A as a percentage of net sales remain constant at 17.5%. We continue to expand margins across the business as consolidated operating income increased $283 million and consolidated operating margin improved 220 basis points. 
Beer operating margin increased 300 basis points to 34.9%, and wine and spirits operating margin improved 110 basis points to 24.8%.
Equity earnings increased $5 million due largely to strong results for Opus One. Interest expense for the year was $314 million, down 7%. The decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates. 
At the end of February, our total debt was $8.1 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $8 billion, an increase of $812 million since the end of fiscal 2015. This primarily reflects funding for the Ballast Point and Meiomi acquisitions, partially offset by our free cash flow generation.
Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.8x at the end of fiscal '16 versus 4x at the end of fiscal '15. Our fiscal '16 ratio does not reflect a full year EBITDA benefit for the Ballast Point and Meiomi acquisitions. 
Our effective tax rate for the year came in at 29.6%, which was essentially even with last year.
Now let's briefly discuss Q4 results. Comparable basis diluted EPS came in at $1.19, up 16%. EPS growth was impacted by our tax rate as our Q4 rate was 29.8% versus a 23.2% rate in Q4 last year, which reflected the benefit of certain foreign tax credits.
Beer business results for the quarter finished strong with organic net sales up 18% on organic volume growth of 14%. Net sales benefited from pricing in the overlap of certain sales adjustments recorded during the fourth quarter last year.
Beer depletions for the quarter grew 13%. This factors in Ballast Point depletions since the transaction close date in mid-December and the corresponding period last year. Ballast Point added a little under 1 percentage point to our Q4 depletion growth rate.
Beer operating income increased 29%, primarily due to organic volume growth, favorable pricing and lower COGS, partially offset by increased SG&A largely attributed to higher marketing spend. 
Wine and spirits organic net sales on a constant currency basis were up 4% for the quarter primarily due to volume growth. Wine and spirits operating income increased 14%. This reflected the benefit of the Meiomi acquisition, organic volume growth and lower COGS, partially offset by higher marketing spend.
Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. For fiscal '16, we generated $522 million of free cash flow compared to $362 million last year.
Operating cash flow totaled $1.4 billion versus $1.1 billion for the prior year. This increase was primarily generated by the growth of the beer business. CapEx for fiscal '16 totaled $891 million compared to $719 million last year.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 246,000 shares of common stock for $34 million. Rob provided highlights of our agreement to acquire The Prisoner Wine Company brands. The cash paid at closing is expected to approximate $285 million. The transaction is expected to close by the end of April and to be $0.03 to $0.05 accretive to EPS for fiscal '17.
This provides a good spot to move to our full year fiscal '17 P&L and free cash flow outlook. We are projecting our comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.05 to $6.35. Our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. 
The beer business is targeting net sales and operating income growth to be in the range of 14% to 17%. This includes the anticipated incremental benefit from our [indiscernible] acquisition. We expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the 10% to 13% range. Our projections include 1% to 2% anticipated pricing benefit for our Mexican portfolio.
We are pleased that our beer operating margin finished fiscal '16 just under 35%, which came in line with our most recent guidance. Our fiscal '17 beer segment guidance has us targeting a flattish beer operating margin versus fiscal '16.  In fiscal '17, we expect to see positive operating margin benefits from product pricing, ongoing favorability from foreign currency and commodities, glass sourcing and lower levels of finished goods purchased under the Interim Supply Agreement with ABI. And while we are pleased with our progress on our expansion activities at Nava, we still have much to accomplish as we continue to bring online and optimize new capacity.
Given these activities, we will continue to see a ramp up in depreciation expense, line commissioning and optimization costs and employee hiring. These costs, along with marketing investments and the consolidation of Ballast Point are essentially offsetting the margin benefits I just outlined.
Looking closer at depreciation and amortization expense for the beer segment, it totaled $62 million in fiscal '16. We expect that to increase by approximately 125% in fiscal '17.
For the wine and spirits business, we expect net sales growth in the mid-single digit range and operating income growth in the mid- to high-single digit range. This includes the anticipated incremental benefit from the Meiomi and Prisoner acquisitions. We expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single digit range, with operating income growth targeted to be ahead of sales growth as we are forecasting some mix benefits.
In addition, we expect our interest expense to be in the range of $325 million to $335 million. Our tax rate to approximate 29% and our weighted average diluted shares outstanding to approximate 206 million. This does not assume additional ship -- stock repurchases.
We expect fiscal '17 free cash flow to be in the range of $250 million to $350 million. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and CapEx of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion. Based on the midpoint of our guidance, we are targeting double-digit growth in operating cash flow for fiscal '17. This benefit is being more than offset by the planned increase in capital expenditures as our guidance includes approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion related to our beer operational expansion projects in Mexico.
In the press release we issued this morning, we included an updated table summarizing the collective capital expenditure investments we are making in our Mexican operating platform and related timing. Overall, there is no change to the total cost estimate related to these projects. And fiscal '17 and fiscal '18 still represent the peak spending periods for this activity. We increased our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share for Class A stock and to $0.36 per share for Class B stock. This represent a 29% increase in our dividend rate per share. As a result, we expect approximately $320 million in dividend payments for fiscal '17. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our fiscal '16 financial performance and excited about the strong projected earnings and operating cash flow growth we are planning for fiscal '17. We continue to strengthen our financial profile and have significant capital allocation flexibility as we remain focused on operating in our targeted 3 to 4x leverage range.
With that, we are happy to take your questions."

So the Canadian IPO is really assuming that it occurs, intended to achieve a number of things. They are #1, we think that sort of buried in the whole company in the Wine & Spirits division, it doesn't really get much visibility from a value perspective. And that if we treat it more as a stand-alone entity, it -- the fact that it is a very high-performing business in Canada will become a lot more visible. That's #1. So we think that, that will be positively reflected in its valuation and our valuation overall. #2, it's obviously also a capital allocation opportunity for us. As I said, an IPO of part of the Canadian business will enable us to continue to manage our debt and keep it at the levels that we think are optimal for the company as we also embark on some of our other strategic initiatives that are driving our very positive results in the wine and spirits business. Meiomi is an example, Prisoner is an example, our investments behind driving premium-ization in the portfolio with our other brands, and our NPD initiatives. So we see the Canadian IPO is helping us to potentially achieve a lot of positive things. It is an interesting business. It's got strong growth. It -- we built and improved market share in Canada. So we think that it represents in many respects a great stand-alone opportunity. As far as its implication to our strategy for the rest of the wine and spirits business, there really is no implication there. The wine and spirits business -- our wine and spirits business remains very strong as you've seen in the results. We had fantastic leverage -- P&L leverage in that business this year. We had tremendous margin expansion in that business, even inclusive of Canada, which is a bit lower in margin than the overall business. We posted operating profit margin in the mid-20s, which is fantastic for any business, in any industry, a mid-20s operating profit margin with the kind of leverage and growth in EBIT that we're getting in that business. So really no implications relative to the rest of the business, but we think that -- as I said, as a stand-alone business, it's a great opportunity from an investment point of view. So that's basically the thinking there."

But it seems like some of those favorable items you mentioned like the glass efficiency, pricing, top line leverage, et cetera, would be a lot bigger than some of the negatives that you mentioned, particularly given the strong gross margin momentum in Q4.

So as we said for the last year, really, we're going to see headwinds in margin expansion at Nava as a result of incremental depreciation expense, line commissioning cost, employee hiring as we bring capacity on, but we don't necessarily get the throughput through the facility. I would say that we -- while we also are benefiting from stepping away from the ISA with ABI, as you'll recall, we did extend, although at a lesser amount in terms of case volume, we extended the ISA with ABI, which dampened some of the near-term margin upside that we may have otherwise seen. And then the last point really being Ballast Point. Now in terms of craft performers, Ballast Point is probably one of the best performing crafts from a financial profile perspective, but it still is dilutive to our overall operating margin of our beer business."

That's #1. NPD continues to be really important in the beverage alcohol business. NPD is providing almost all of the growth across any category in wine, beer and spirits. Our beer business tends to be a little bit different than that because we happen to be sort of in the main sweet spot of growth with our Mexican portfolio and our craft portfolio. But continuing to drive that NPD pipeline is again, one of his main strategic initiatives. And as I said, our new acquisitions, Meiomi, Mark West is only a few years old, Prisoner, these are all key to our premium-ization and strategy and driving mix.

I guess historically, it seems like you guys sort of were a little bit more conservative at the outset of the year in terms of looking at the beer depletion. And it looks like this time, the 10% to 13% organic sales guidance for beer, lapping some of the tougher comps in the back half seems actually not as conservative. So just wanted to understand maybe a little bit more just in terms of, is it really the momentum behind all of your brands that you're seeing that gives you confidence? How big a factor would continued distribution gains on the cans be -- really a factor in terms of driving that sales growth momentum in '17 for your beer business?"

We continue to see that even as we're into the New Year in terms of IRI. There is a lot of distribution gain activity -- or a lot of space we can gain in terms of distribution in the coming year. We do expect continued growth of cans. And again, our objective remains to drive our can volume up in aggregate into that mid-teens kind of range of total volume over time. You know I would -- I do want to address your point around the level of conservatism in our guidance. I would say that we've taken the same approach this year to guidance as we've used in the past. We're trying to give our best estimate as to where we think the business will land on the year, and I think that's reflected in the numbers that we produced. And again, I think, you do need to focus on the organic depletion number, which is -- or the organic net sales number, which is the 10% to 13%, because I think combined with our 1% to 2% net pricing guidance, you get to a fairly respectable but achievable volume number."

It is obviously opportunistic in that you can't necessarily predict that there's going to be a willing seller of the things that we would like to acquire at the price that we would like to acquire it. So it is opportunistic in that regard. It's also strategic in that clearly premium-ization is an important part of the strategy, whether it's wine, beer or spirits. Margin enhancement is important to us as we look at various opportunities across the 3 segments, which goes back, of course, to the premium-ization element of the strategy and also obviously, buying things that are sort of in the right place at the right time is important to us. You look at wine and clearly, all the big growth in wine right now is in these higher price points like The Prisoner. If you look at beer, it's almost the same in that it's better beer and higher price points that are driving that market. I think Ballast Point is a great example of that. I mean, that's sort of like at the highest end of the beer market and it's got the fastest growth of any major craft brewer. It's almost a little contradictory in the sense that it would be the highest price and have the highest growth, but that's what makes it as attractive as it is. And then spirits is an interesting segment as well. We made a couple of small acquisitions in the craft spirits space over the last 12 months; one called Crafthouse Cocktails, where we bought a minority interest in a brand that we think has the potential to be a very fast-growing, high-margin business. And then another bourbon brand recently, again, that we think has the potential to be high-margin, high-growth too. But -- so spirits, I'd say, is a little less developed from an opportunity point of view right now. The global spirits brand picture, I don't necessarily see us really playing in that. It's not of great interest. It's a market that's somewhat under pressure even in the segments that are growing pretty well, i.e., brown spirits and bourbon. But it's not really our sweet spot. But craft spirits, much like craft beers, it's pretty interesting. But much more developmental in that the craft spirits business is much less developed than the craft beer and the brands are even smaller, okay, than in craft beer. But we look at that segment too. I'll just add one other thing. Our strategy as it relates to capital allocation, acquisition really hasn't changed. Okay, we're not an acquisition bender or anything to that effect. We're going to continue to be highly strategic, look at opportunities as they arise as we always have. Obviously, our strategy has changed a lot over the years. Now it's really about -- where we've taken advantage of opportunities -- it's about buying sort of tuck-in, high-growth, high-margin, easy-to-assimilate type opportunities. So I guess, as I said, the answer to your question is some and some, it's strategic but it's also opportunistic as we go forward here. We intend to maintain more importantly, our discipline on capital allocation; all the things that we've said being a priority, reducing debt, returning dollars and value to shareholders, and making occasional strategic acquisitions as they come along. And maintaining our debt levels sort of in that 3 range where we've said."

Good morning, and welcome to our year-end call. Now before I begin the review of our accomplishments for fiscal 2016 and our plans for the coming year, I'd like to focus on the new initiatives disclosed within the press release issued earlier today. 
First, we announced that we are evaluating the merits of executing an IPO for a portion of our Canadian business. The consideration of this strategic action is the result of our ongoing efforts to identify value-enhancing opportunities for our shareholders and to strengthen the financial profile of our overall wine and spirits businesses. As we continue to transform the company, the focus and resources we put behind strategic initiatives to support sustainable, value-generating long-term growth are also evolving. This effort would provide better visibility to the Canadian business, which delivered excellent financial performance in 2016.
Our Canadian business has a strong leadership team with extensive knowledge of the Canadian market. They market and sell a winning portfolio of brands and have a proven track record of successful innovation and new product development that resonates with Canadian consumers. Their size and scale across Canada includes 8 wineries in key wine regions, approximately 1,700 acres of Canadian vineyards and a network of growers to support their Canadian-produced brands. And they are the largest holder of independent retail licenses in Ontario with more than 160 wine rack stores. We are in the early process of evaluating an IPO of this business and we plan to make a final decision later this calendar year, depending on market conditions. If an IPO is completed, the proceeds are expected to be used to manage debt and our other capital allocation priorities.
This morning, we also announced our plans to acquire The Prisoner Wine Company brands, a super luxury portfolio of 5 highly rated wines, led by the largest brand, The Prisoner. It's other brands include Saldo, Cuttings, Blindfold and Thorn with overall volume for the portfolio reaching 175,000 cases in calendar 2015.
The Prisoner is currently the #1 super luxury red blend, growing at almost 30% in IRI channels at the $40 retail price point. Now similar to the Meiomi wine brand acquisition, The Prisoner acquisition aligns with our portfolio premiumization strategy and enables us to capitalize on U.S. market trends that favor high-end wine brands with accretive margin profiles. In particular, it strengthens our position in the dynamic and margin enhancing super luxury wine category and can be easily integrated into our existing portfolio of brands.
So now let's turn our attention to some of our key achievements for the past year and great initiatives we have underway for fiscal 2017. Overall, I am pleased with the significant accomplishments and the impressive financial results we achieved in fiscal 2016. This past summer, we purchased the Meiomi wine brand, which is currently the fastest growing major brand in IRI channels in the $20 luxury price point. The brand delivered depletion growth of almost 60% in fiscal 2016, a trend which has accelerated since we first acquired the brand last summer. Its excellent margin profile is one of the contributing drivers of the margin expansion for the wine and spirits business in fiscal 2016. 
Meiomi Pinot Noir was one of the hottest wines of the year listed as #20 in the Wine Spectator's Top 100 for 2015 and #1 -- that's good -- on wine.com's top 100 list, which is based entirely on consumer preferences. We believe the brand has plenty of room to continue driving healthy growth for our business.
Last fall, we entered the craft beer market with the purchase of Ballast Point, one of the most awarded major craft breweries in the industry. Ballast Point provides a high growth premium platform that is enabling Constellation to compete in the fast growing craft beer segment, further strengthening our position in the high end of the U.S. beer market. 
In calendar 2015, Ballast Point posted depletion growth of more than 130% and sold nearly 4 million cases. This phenomenal level of growth is approximately 3x that of any major competitor.
Operationally, we selected a site and secured the land to construct a new state-of-the-art brewery in Mexicali, Mexico. Initially, this brewery will be built to operate at 10 million hectoliters of production capacity with potential scalability to 20 million hectoliters and it will have similar technology and operational advancements as our Nava Brewery. 
And speaking of Nava, we successfully completed our first incremental 5 million hectoliter capacity expansion as planned by year-end calendar 2015. And we are progressing with our plans to build out Nava to 27.5 million hectoliters by early calendar 2018.
Now these investments in Mexicali and at Nava will ensure that we have the capacity, quality, control and flexibility to meet expected demand for our iconic beer brands well into the future and position us to capture the continued momentum and growth opportunities we see in the high end of the U.S. beer market.
Organizationally, we made key management changes across the business, strengthening the organization by fostering the continued growth and development of our people, while ensuring continuity to build upon our current success and drive the company's long-term growth strategies. Collectively, these accomplishments, in conjunction with our excellent business performance, have helped to drive the appreciation of our stock, which remains one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 Index. 
Now let's move to the excellent business performance I just referenced as a critical component to our success. We'll start with the Constellation Brands beer business, which was the #1 contributor to growth in the total U.S. beer category last year for the third consecutive year, with most of our brands in the Mexican import portfolio posting record volumes in 2016. And Constellation was the leader and the #1 share gainer in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market in calendar 2015.
More remarkably, our beer business growth has accelerated every year since 2010 with depletion trends exceeding 12% in fiscal 2016. I'd like to take a minute to share some of this past year's amazing accomplishments for our iconic beer brands and highlight the key initiatives we plan to execute during fiscal 2017 in order to maintain this excellent momentum. 
Let's begin with the clear heavyweights in our portfolio, Corona Extra and Modelo Especial. These brands are 2 of the hottest brands in the industry and delivered 25% of the U.S. beer category industry growth last year. Our flagship Corona Extra brand has been the #1 imported beer brand for almost 20 years and today is the #5 beer brand overall in the U.S. industry. This brand sold more than 117 million cases in fiscal 2016, growing depletions almost 10% versus the prior year. This growth occurred across the country as Corona Extra grew share in 49 out of 50 states and was the only top 5 U.S. beer brand to grow share for the year.
Corona Extra growth has been accelerating over the last 5 years with the can launch accounting for about 1/3 of the growth in fiscal 2016. The remainder of the phenomenal growth came from the increased distribution and velocity of the iconic Corona Extra bottles.
In fiscal 2017, we expect to increase our media investment in Corona Extra while focusing the dollars against key time periods that include the NBA Finals and our 120 days of Summer in order to maintain our leadership position during our most important selling season. We also plan to increase our digital investments as we saw great success with the brand's social media activities last year. We believe there remains tremendous growth opportunity in Corona Extra cans as depletions for this format increased more than 100% in fiscal 2016, but currently represent less than 6% of total brand volume. As such, we are investing more behind Corona cans to generate incremental awareness and consumer demand. You'll see a heavy media presence leading into key can holidays, including Memorial Day, July 4 and Labor Day.
Now moving to Modelo Especial, this brand is stronger than ever as the fastest growing major beer brand in America. Last year, the brand grew depletions more than 19% to surpass 70 million cases and $1 billion in sales. As a result, Modelo Especial was the #1 dollar share gainer and is now ranked as the #8 beer overall in the U.S. market in total dollar sales, up from the #9 position last year.
The size of this brand has doubled in just 5 short years and our goal is to keep this momentum going. In fiscal 2017, our biggest opportunity for this brand lies in expanding distribution, because despite being the #2 import, Modelo currently has less than 50% distribution on most packages. We also see tremendous opportunity for this brand in the on-premise channel, where Modelo Especial increased more than 20% last year with the draft format increasing almost 50% yet only about 30% of on-premise locations across the U.S. carry Modelo Especial today. So we are focused on closing that distribution gap and increasing the momentum.
Now for the sixth consecutive year, we are increasing our Modelo Especial investment in national, Spanish language TV and digital, and we will be running new TV advertising throughout the entire year, increasing our spend on live sports by 50% and investing in heavily visible soccer broadcast properties. In addition, we are increasing our general market media by almost 40% across national TV and digital with high profile placements during the NBA playoffs and key NFL match ups. Together, we expect these initiatives to position Modelo Especial for another great year of stellar growth.
I also want to call out Corona Light, which remains the #1 imported light beer by a large margin. Depletion growth on this brand has accelerated every year for the last 5 years with depletions growing almost 8% in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2017, we plan to build on the already successful Light Cerveza campaign with a new TV advertisement, which will begin airing nationally this month. We have also added high profile, live spots during NHL playoff broadcasts this spring and sponsorships of national Major League Baseball games on ESPN during the key summer holidays. This will be supplemented with an investment in social media. We are also expanding Corona Light draft by launching with several additional distributors. The Corona Light can will continue to be a big point of emphasis as depletions for this format increased more than 40% in fiscal 2016. As you are aware, the bench strength of our beer portfolio goes deeper than our biggest brands. Part of what makes our collection of brands so powerful is the long-term potential of our smaller brands like Victoria and Pacifico that are currently outpacing category growth. 
And let's not forget about Ballast Point, a brewer known for unbridled innovation and outstanding quality and one that gives our beer portfolio a leading position in the craft space that can be built upon in several ways. This year, it's to expand the Ballast Point distribution nationally, making it available in all 50 states. This along with successful new product launches is expected to drive the strong double-digit growth we are targeting in fiscal 2017. 
Overall, I'm excited about the growth prospects for our beer business in fiscal 2017. As you can see, we have tremendous opportunity to grow the business organically through enhanced distribution and execution opportunities across the portfolio. As a result, we are targeting both net sales growth and operating income growth in the 14% to 17% range for our beer business in fiscal 2017, including the benefits from Ballast Point.
From a brewery and operational perspective, in fiscal 2016, we achieved our key Nava Brewery performance goals for capacity utilization, quality and cost. All areas of the brewery expansion are well underway with overall project on schedule to be completed on time and within our budget.
As we begin fiscal 2017, we'll be intensely focused on the continued expansion of the Nava Brewery to 20 million hectoliters. This capacity is expected to become fully operational within the next few months. As a matter of fact, we've already begun to run test brews and have all-new packaging lines up and running in test mode to support this 20 million hectoliters of capacity.
Now over the next few months, we will continue to fine tune all the components necessary to successfully achieve this important milestone as planned. Within our existing capacity, we recently made our first brew of Modelo Especial Chelada at Nava with excellent results.  With that accomplishment complete, we have now made brews of all of our products at this brewery. And as many of you are aware, our third phase of expansion to 25 million hectoliters is our next critical milestone and I am pleased to report that this work is proceeding as scheduled. I am proud of the fact that Nava is the newest and most advanced state-of-the-art brewery in the world and that our brewery team's capabilities and commitment to quality are unparalleled. These best-in-class credentials are what we plan to bring to our new Mexicali brewery. Mexicali is the ideal site for a sister brewery to Nava. The technology and skilled expertise we plan to put in place are designed to ensure the highest quality and consistency for our consumers, and we will continue to update you on the progress there.
And now I'd like to focus on the operational results for our wine and spirits business. During fiscal 2016, we delivered overall earnings growth and margin expansion for our wine and spirits business. Our spirits portfolio produced solid results and our Canadian wine business exceeded its financial goals while outperforming the industry and growing market share for the year. 
Sales growth in the U.S. benefited from organic volume growth and positive mix trends. We delivered exceptional results for our focus brands, which grew depletions 5% for the year, and we are reaping the benefits of our targeted investments in these brands. As a matter of fact, many of our focus brands were included in our list of significant milestones and accomplishments for our overall wine and spirits portfolio for fiscal 2016. 7 of our brands were featured on Impact's Annual Hot Brand list for wine and spirits, including Meiomi, which recently surpassed our very own Mark West as IRI's largest Pinot Noir for the current 12- and 52-week periods. And Kim Crawford recently emerged as the #1 Sauvignon Blanc in IRI channels. 
Our products were also called out in the Beverage Information Group's 2015 awards, in which 4 of our brands achieved fast track status recognizing their impressive growth. Three were named rising stars, including one of our newest brands, Tom Gore Vineyards and 6 were listed as established growth brands, such as Mark West, Ruffino, SIMI and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi.
The Beverage Information Group also recognized SVEDKA Vodka as a spirits growth brand, which this year achieved its place as the #1 imported vodka in the entire U.S. We plan to continue building on the success of some of our most recent new brands and line extensions to capitalize on the hottest trends in the market. Our newest red blend Ravage is a dark, fruit-forward red blend with structure and depth that has resonated well with consumers and will go national in September.
Ravage Cabernet Sauvignon performed very well during our exclusive testing period with a major retailer throughout last year, and we are pleased to expand the brand to wider distribution this spring. We will also continue to support the growth of Tom Gore Vineyards, the farmer's wine, that meets consumers desire to know the people and places behind the products they choose. Some of our existing new line extensions include our Robert Mondavi private selection, Bourbon Barrel-Aged Cabernet, which boasts an impressively rich profile that comes from a unique aging process in Bourbon barrels. And Ruffino Sparkling Rosé, which expects to capitalize on the success of our Ruffino Prosecco and the growing consumer taste for imported Rosé wines. 
For the year, our spirits portfolio posted solid net sales growth of 6%, driven by the continued success of our flavor introductions for Paul Masson Grande Amber Brandy as well as SVEDKA Vodka. Casa Noble almost doubled net sales this past year and tripled distribution in terms of number of accounts. We are upbeat about the future growth trajectory of this brand. In fact, we are putting resources behind Casa Noble to support what we believe is a compelling growth opportunity. Some of these investments include fresh packaging, a new marketing campaign and continued cross promotion with Corona Extra during the Cinco de Mayo holiday season. 
Our marketing campaign, the noble pursuit, features digital spots that highlights the quality and heritage unique to this fine tequila. We also plan to continue supporting our #1 imported vodka SVEDKA with the new addition to our line of flavors, Cucumber Lime. SVEDKA has been very successful in launching highly targeted, unique flavors that stand out from the vast options on the shelf today, and has proven it knows how to win in this space. We think Cucumber Lime will be a great addition to the track record of success and the initial consumer response supports our optimism. 
From a strategic perspective, in fiscal 2017, our goal for the wine and spirits business is to grow profits ahead of sales and improve margins, which is reflected in our 2017 wine and spirits guidance of mid-single digit sales growth and mid- to high-single digits profit growth for the year.
So what will be the enablers of this goal? We plan to capitalize on the market leading growth of our recent high growth, margin enhancing wine acquisitions; Meiomi and The Prisoner. We will continue our targeted approach to investing in a subset of our focus brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and the greatest growth potential. We remain committed to mix and margin accretive innovation and new product development and have several new products in the hopper, a few of which I just mentioned. And for the third consecutive year, we plan to execute price increases for select products within the portfolio. 
And finally, we plan to continue to optimize COGS through global blend management initiatives, productivity improvements and lower grade cost. Overall, we are committing people, technology and resources to work with our wholesalers and retailers to execute growth for our wine and spirits business. 
In closing, it has certainly been another exciting year at Constellation. Our achievements are many and have driven a year of strong financial performance. In fiscal 2016, we delivered industry-leading market results for our beer business, while continuing to enhance our operational platform in Mexico to support the growth of our iconic Mexican beer brands. Within our wine and spirits business, we maintained our focus on premiumization, innovation and brand building, which drove enhanced margins and earnings growth. We are very proud to have delivered another rewarding year of value to our shareholders. And I am pleased that our results can support a significant dividend increase in the coming year.
Overall, we remain committed to challenging ourselves in order to optimize the business opportunities that lie ahead.
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David Klein, who will review our financial results for fiscal 2016 and the outlook for fiscal 2017."
258589,327941576,958360,"Constellation Brands Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 06, 2016",2016-04-06,"Earnings Calls","Constellation Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Fiscal '16 was another very exciting year with strong financial performance in which we generated over $6.5 billion of net sales and 9% net sales growth. We expanded operating margins in both businesses and improved",1650,"Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Fiscal '16 was another very exciting year with strong financial performance in which we generated over $6.5 billion of net sales and 9% net sales growth. We expanded operating margins in both businesses and improved our consolidated comparable basis operating margin by more than 200 basis points. We increased consolidated EBIT 18% and comparable basis diluted EPS 22%, and we produced $1.4 billion of operating cash flow, an increase of 31%. The strong earnings and operating cash flow growth helped our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA ratio finish at 3.8x even as we made significant capital investments in our Mexican operations, acquired Meiomi and Ballast Point and returned cash to shareholders with the initiation of a dividend and the repurchase of stock.
We expect fiscal '17 to be another strong year as we are targeting healthy net sales, EBIT, operating cash flow and EPS growth while we continue to invest in our world-class Mexican beer operating platform and increase our dividend per share by 29%.
Given those highlights, let's look at fiscal 2016 performance in more detail, where my comments will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Consolidated net sales on an organic constant currency basis grew 8% for the year. We continue to see robust marketplace momentum for our beer business with depletion growth coming in over 12%. 
Organic beer net sales increased 13% on organic volume growth of 11%. Ballast Point added $27 million of sales since joining our beer portfolio in mid-December. 
Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 3%. This primarily reflects volume growth and favorable mix. As mentioned by Rob, Meiomi continues to demonstrate excellent marketplace momentum as the brand generated $74 million of incremental sales since joining the portfolio last August.
For the year, consolidated gross profit increased $373 million, up 14% with gross margin increasing 220 basis points. Beer gross profit increased $310 million, primarily due to volume growth, favorable pricing and lower COGS, and our beer gross profit margin increased 300 basis points to 49%. 
Wine and spirits gross profit was up $63 million. This primarily reflects the benefits from the Meiomi acquisition and lower COGS. Wine and spirits gross profit margin increased 90 basis points to 42.2%.
Consolidated SG&A increased $90 million. This reflects marketing investments made primarily by the beer business. Corporate expense was up due primarily to higher incentive compensation expense and increase in payroll taxes associated with employee stock option exercise activity and investments to support the growth of our business, including the establishment of our Chief Growth Officer function.
Consolidated SG&A as a percentage of net sales remain constant at 17.5%. We continue to expand margins across the business as consolidated operating income increased $283 million and consolidated operating margin improved 220 basis points. 
Beer operating margin increased 300 basis points to 34.9%, and wine and spirits operating margin improved 110 basis points to 24.8%.
Equity earnings increased $5 million due largely to strong results for Opus One. Interest expense for the year was $314 million, down 7%. The decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates. 
At the end of February, our total debt was $8.1 billion. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $8 billion, an increase of $812 million since the end of fiscal 2015. This primarily reflects funding for the Ballast Point and Meiomi acquisitions, partially offset by our free cash flow generation.
Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.8x at the end of fiscal '16 versus 4x at the end of fiscal '15. Our fiscal '16 ratio does not reflect a full year EBITDA benefit for the Ballast Point and Meiomi acquisitions. 
Our effective tax rate for the year came in at 29.6%, which was essentially even with last year.
Now let's briefly discuss Q4 results. Comparable basis diluted EPS came in at $1.19, up 16%. EPS growth was impacted by our tax rate as our Q4 rate was 29.8% versus a 23.2% rate in Q4 last year, which reflected the benefit of certain foreign tax credits.
Beer business results for the quarter finished strong with organic net sales up 18% on organic volume growth of 14%. Net sales benefited from pricing in the overlap of certain sales adjustments recorded during the fourth quarter last year.
Beer depletions for the quarter grew 13%. This factors in Ballast Point depletions since the transaction close date in mid-December and the corresponding period last year. Ballast Point added a little under 1 percentage point to our Q4 depletion growth rate.
Beer operating income increased 29%, primarily due to organic volume growth, favorable pricing and lower COGS, partially offset by increased SG&A largely attributed to higher marketing spend. 
Wine and spirits organic net sales on a constant currency basis were up 4% for the quarter primarily due to volume growth. Wine and spirits operating income increased 14%. This reflected the benefit of the Meiomi acquisition, organic volume growth and lower COGS, partially offset by higher marketing spend.
Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. For fiscal '16, we generated $522 million of free cash flow compared to $362 million last year.
Operating cash flow totaled $1.4 billion versus $1.1 billion for the prior year. This increase was primarily generated by the growth of the beer business. CapEx for fiscal '16 totaled $891 million compared to $719 million last year.
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 246,000 shares of common stock for $34 million. Rob provided highlights of our agreement to acquire The Prisoner Wine Company brands. The cash paid at closing is expected to approximate $285 million. The transaction is expected to close by the end of April and to be $0.03 to $0.05 accretive to EPS for fiscal '17.
This provides a good spot to move to our full year fiscal '17 P&L and free cash flow outlook. We are projecting our comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.05 to $6.35. Our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. 
The beer business is targeting net sales and operating income growth to be in the range of 14% to 17%. This includes the anticipated incremental benefit from our [indiscernible] acquisition. We expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the 10% to 13% range. Our projections include 1% to 2% anticipated pricing benefit for our Mexican portfolio.
We are pleased that our beer operating margin finished fiscal '16 just under 35%, which came in line with our most recent guidance. Our fiscal '17 beer segment guidance has us targeting a flattish beer operating margin versus fiscal '16.  In fiscal '17, we expect to see positive operating margin benefits from product pricing, ongoing favorability from foreign currency and commodities, glass sourcing and lower levels of finished goods purchased under the Interim Supply Agreement with ABI. And while we are pleased with our progress on our expansion activities at Nava, we still have much to accomplish as we continue to bring online and optimize new capacity.
Given these activities, we will continue to see a ramp up in depreciation expense, line commissioning and optimization costs and employee hiring. These costs, along with marketing investments and the consolidation of Ballast Point are essentially offsetting the margin benefits I just outlined.
Looking closer at depreciation and amortization expense for the beer segment, it totaled $62 million in fiscal '16. We expect that to increase by approximately 125% in fiscal '17.
For the wine and spirits business, we expect net sales growth in the mid-single digit range and operating income growth in the mid- to high-single digit range. This includes the anticipated incremental benefit from the Meiomi and Prisoner acquisitions. We expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single digit range, with operating income growth targeted to be ahead of sales growth as we are forecasting some mix benefits.
In addition, we expect our interest expense to be in the range of $325 million to $335 million. Our tax rate to approximate 29% and our weighted average diluted shares outstanding to approximate 206 million. This does not assume additional ship -- stock repurchases.
We expect fiscal '17 free cash flow to be in the range of $250 million to $350 million. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and CapEx of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion. Based on the midpoint of our guidance, we are targeting double-digit growth in operating cash flow for fiscal '17. This benefit is being more than offset by the planned increase in capital expenditures as our guidance includes approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion related to our beer operational expansion projects in Mexico.
In the press release we issued this morning, we included an updated table summarizing the collective capital expenditure investments we are making in our Mexican operating platform and related timing. Overall, there is no change to the total cost estimate related to these projects. And fiscal '17 and fiscal '18 still represent the peak spending periods for this activity. We increased our quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share for Class A stock and to $0.36 per share for Class B stock. This represent a 29% increase in our dividend rate per share. As a result, we expect approximately $320 million in dividend payments for fiscal '17. 
In closing, we are very pleased with our fiscal '16 financial performance and excited about the strong projected earnings and operating cash flow growth we are planning for fiscal '17. We continue to strengthen our financial profile and have significant capital allocation flexibility as we remain focused on operating in our targeted 3 to 4x leverage range.
With that, we are happy to take your questions."

So the Canadian IPO is really assuming that it occurs, intended to achieve a number of things. They are #1, we think that sort of buried in the whole company in the Wine & Spirits division, it doesn't really get much visibility from a value perspective. And that if we treat it more as a stand-alone entity, it -- the fact that it is a very high-performing business in Canada will become a lot more visible. That's #1. So we think that, that will be positively reflected in its valuation and our valuation overall. #2, it's obviously also a capital allocation opportunity for us. As I said, an IPO of part of the Canadian business will enable us to continue to manage our debt and keep it at the levels that we think are optimal for the company as we also embark on some of our other strategic initiatives that are driving our very positive results in the wine and spirits business. Meiomi is an example, Prisoner is an example, our investments behind driving premiumization in the portfolio with our other brands, and our NPD initiatives. So we see the Canadian IPO is helping us to potentially achieve a lot of positive things. It is an interesting business. It's got strong growth. It -- we built and improved market share in Canada. So we think that it represents in many respects a great stand-alone opportunity. As far as its implication to our strategy for the rest of the wine and spirits business, there really is no implication there. The wine and spirits business -- our wine and spirits business remains very strong as you've seen in the results. We had fantastic leverage -- P&L leverage in that business this year. We had tremendous margin expansion in that business, even inclusive of Canada, which is a bit lower in margin than the overall business. We posted operating profit margin in the mid-20s, which is fantastic for any business, in any industry, a mid-20s operating profit margin with the kind of leverage and growth in EBIT that we're getting in that business. So really no implications relative to the rest of the business, but we think that -- as I said, as a stand-alone business, it's a great opportunity from an investment point of view. So that's basically the thinking there."

I would say that we -- while we also are benefiting from stepping away from the ISA with ABI, as you'll recall, we did extend, although at a lesser amount in terms of case volume, we extended the ISA with ABI, which dampened some of the near-term margin upside that we may have otherwise seen. And then the last point really being Ballast Point. Now in terms of craft performers, Ballast Point is probably one of the best performing crafts from a financial profile perspective, but it still is dilutive to our overall operating margin of our beer business."

He's got to continue to focus on those same things. So it's all about premiumization, it's about driving mix, it's about driving our higher-margin brands and our newly acquired brands like Prisoner, like Meiomi, driving the organic growth of our really high-margin Focus Brands, good examples, being Kim Crawford. That's #1. NPD continues to be really important in the beverage alcohol business. NPD is providing almost all of the growth across any category in wine, beer and spirits. Our beer business tends to be a little bit different than that because we happen to be sort of in the main sweet spot of growth with our Mexican portfolio and our craft portfolio. But continuing to drive that NPD pipeline is again, one of his main strategic initiatives. And as I said, our new acquisitions, Meiomi, Mark West is only a few years old, Prisoner, these are all key to our premiumization and strategy and driving mix. And again, this is the sweet spot of growth in the beverage alcohol business. So it's pretty straightforward. And then it's sort of I'd say day-to-day bread-and-butter stuff, COGS, control over COGS, cost and growth has been an important driver of our financial results there as well as other expense items in the P&L. So he'll continue to focus on those things as well. Good news is that he's doing a really great job and we're extremely optimistic, obviously, given our guidance for next year that we'll continue to be very successful in those areas."

You know I would -- I do want to address your point around the level of conservatism in our guidance. I would say that we've taken the same approach this year to guidance as we've used in the past. We're trying to give our best estimate as to where we think the business will land on the year, and I think that's reflected in the numbers that we produced.

And so you can see the benefits that we've had in recent years from certain foreign tax credits as well as from the benefits of the tax treatment of stock option expense. And so that has helped push our number down in recent years, right? And then in terms of our cash versus book, I would say how that all resolved itself on an ongoing basis, I think, is going to depend upon the changes in overall tax policy. I would say that we expect our cash taxes to remain in the low 20s for the foreseeable future."

It is obviously opportunistic in that you can't necessarily predict that there's going to be a willing seller of the things that we would like to acquire at the price that we w",579,"Well, I think that the answer to your question is again kind of some and some. It is obviously opportunistic in that you can't necessarily predict that there's going to be a willing seller of the things that we would like to acquire at the price that we would like to acquire it. So it is opportunistic in that regard. It's also strategic in that clearly premiumization is an important part of the strategy, whether it's wine, beer or spirits. Margin enhancement is important to us as we look at various opportunities across the 3 segments, which goes back, of course, to the premiumization element of the strategy and also obviously, buying things that are sort of in the right place at the right time is important to us. You look at wine and clearly, all the big growth in wine right now is in these higher price points like The Prisoner. If you look at beer, it's almost the same in that it's better beer and higher price points that are driving that market. I think Ballast Point is a great example of that. I mean, that's sort of like at the highest end of the beer market and it's got the fastest growth of any major craft brewer. It's almost a little contradictory in the sense that it would be the highest price and have the highest growth, but that's what makes it as attractive as it is. And then spirits is an interesting segment as well. We made a couple of small acquisitions in the craft spirits space over the last 12 months, one called Crafthouse Cocktails, where we bought a minority interest in a brand that we think has the potential to be a very fast-growing, high-margin business. And then another bourbon brand recently, again, that we think has the potential to be high-margin, high-growth too. But -- so spirits, I'd say, is a little less developed from an opportunity point of view right now. The global spirits brand picture, I don't necessarily see us really playing in that. It's not of great interest. It's a market that's somewhat under pressure even in the segments that are growing pretty well, i.e., brown spirits and bourbon. But it's not really our sweet spot. But craft spirits, much like craft beers, it's pretty interesting. But much more developmental in that the craft spirits business is much less developed than the craft beer and the brands are even smaller, okay, than in craft beer. But we look at that segment too. I'll just add one other thing. Our strategy as it relates to capital allocation, acquisition really hasn't changed. Okay, we're not an acquisition bender or anything to that effect. We're going to continue to be highly strategic, look at opportunities as they arise as we always have. Obviously, our strategy has changed a lot over the years. Now it's really about -- where we've taken advantage of opportunities -- it's about buying sort of tuck-in, high-growth, high-margin, easy-to-assimilate type opportunities. So I guess, as I said, the answer to your question is some and some, it's strategic but it's also opportunistic as we go forward here. We intend to maintain more importantly, our discipline on capital allocation, all the things that we've said being a priority, reducing debt, returning dollars and value to shareholders, and making occasional strategic acquisitions as they come along. And maintaining our debt levels sort of in that 3 range where we've said."

We are off to a great start to our new fiscal year with sales and earnings up double digits. Across the business, we",1556,"Thank you, Patty, and good morning, and welcome to our discussion of Constellation's first quarter fiscal 2017 sales and earnings results. We are off to a great start to our new fiscal year with sales and earnings up double digits. Across the business, we're seeing the results of our efforts to drive consumer demand for premium products through best-in-class marketing and sales execution while improving margins through financial discipline and a focus on core premium products. This, combined with the successful integration of and growth from our recently acquired brands, provides a healthy foundation for achieving our fiscal 2017 objectives. Our beer business continues to deliver industry-leading results while expanding their operational footprint with planned capital investments in Mexico. During the quarter, the beer business generated depletion growth of almost 10% and was the #1 share gainer in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer business. Constellation's beer portfolio led volume gains amongst U.S. brewers, contributing almost 20% of category dollar growth during the quarter as each brand in our Mexican beer portfolio grew across most channels and packages. 
Corona Extra and Modelo Especial remain 2 of the hottest brands in the U.S. beer industry and held category-leading positions as the #3 and #2 players, respectively, among overall brand share gainers. These results are due in part to focused market execution as well as optimization of key marketing and advertising initiatives. We launched fresh, new Spanish and English-language national television advertising for the Corona Extra brand in canned format, including the brand's first-ever boxing TV ad. New national TV advertising was also launched for Modelo Especial in English and Spanish and for the Modelo Especial Chelada in Spanish, both of which continue to have double-digit growth and are among the fastest-growing brands in the category. 
Our new Pacifico 24-ounce can format is the #1 new import so far in 2016, and we are supporting the brand by expanding targeted television advertising. Pacifico grew depletions more than 15% [ph] for the quarter. 
And last but certainly not least, let's not forget about Ballast Point, which continues to be the fastest-growing major craft banner brand in the U.S., posting depletion growth of more than 60% [ph] in the first quarter. As you know, our plan for Ballast Point this year to expand distribution and make the brand available in all 50 states. And to date, we now distribution in more than 40 states and expect to complete our overall goal sometime before calendar year-end. This distribution push, along with successful new flavor and style launches, is expected to deliver the strong double-digit growth we are targeting for Ballast Point in fiscal 2017. It was recently announced that we plan to establish a Ballast Point brewery in Virginia. This will allow us to develop an East Coast presence to provide the best-quality, freshest craft beer to all of our customers. 
I'd now like to take a minute to discuss recently published IRI and Nielsen consumer takeaway data for our beer business as there seems to be significant discussion and debate related to the growth trends for some of our brands. First, IRI channels represent about 50% of our overall beer business at retail and therefore provide only a partial picture of the brand and portfolio performance outside of the sales, shipment and depletion results we report every quarter. Within IRI channels, over the last quarter, we've seen significant variability from week to week. Much of this relates to year-over-year timing and selling day comparison issues for import, holidays during the quarter, including Cinco and Memorial Day. We saw some impact from our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter recall of certain Corona Extra packages, which created temporary product shortages in select areas. We also experienced pockets of poor weather, especially in the Northeast, and we are cycling very strong Corona Extra can growth, following last year's first quarter intro of the can format for this brand. Despite these temporary headwinds, our recent brand health assessment for Corona Extra indicates a consistent or increased drinking on key brand health scores nationally since fiscal 2016. While consumer takeaway is a standard measurement, depletions represent our entire business or an even more comprehensive indicator on growth and health. I'm very proud of our nearly double-digit beer depletion growth trend for the first quarter, given some of the factors I just mentioned. And preliminary beer depletion results for the month of June are progressing in line with our forecast. We anticipate similar timing issues around the upcoming key holidays in the second quarter related to the July 4 and Labor Day weekends. Operationally, during the quarter, we completed a significant expansion milestone at Nava by doubling the size of the brewery that we acquired and bringing annual production capacity to 20 million hectoliters. All support areas are in place for this added capacity, including packaging, utilities, warehouse and rail infrastructure. As many of you are aware, the expansion of the Nava Brewery to 25 million hectoliters is our next critical capacity milestone, and I'm pleased to report that this work is proceeding as scheduled. 
In addition, we've officially broken ground at Mexicali. And although this project is in the early phase, it is also progressing as planned. Finally, we recently fired up our second furnace at our Nava glass plant and expect that it will be producing glass shortly. As a reminder, it takes several months for a new furnace to ramp up in order to produce optimal capacity. 
And now I would like to focus on the operational results for our wine and spirits business. During the quarter, our wine and spirits business grew earnings and expanded margins while successfully integrating and growing our newly acquired premium wine brands Meiomi and The Prisoner, which posted IRI dollar growth of about 90% and 30%, respectively. Since the acquisition of The Prisoner, Constellation has gained 2 share points in the IRI luxury-plus segment, extending the lead in our #1 luxury-plus position. Constellation is now ranked #3 in superluxury wine at the greater than $25 retail price point. The U.S. wine business posted strong sales growth and gained IRI dollar share, driven by our core Focus Brands where we're building momentum across multiple price segments. 
Let me provide a few examples. In the IRI $20-plus luxury and superluxury price segments combined, Meiomi is not only the largest Pinot Noir but also the largest dollar share gainer for the entire quarter. Kim Crawford is the #1 Sauvignon Blanc in the IRI superpremium segment and posted dollar sales growth of more than 20% during the quarter. Clos du Bois is the #1 Chardonnay in the IRI premium segment. And Black Box is the leader in the fast-growing premium box segment. 
In aggregate, our Focus Brands grew depletions at 12% for the quarter. Our innovation platform is also gaining traction, thanks to new margin-enhancing offerings like the Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Bourbon Barrel-Aged Cabernet, SVEDKA Cucumber Lime, Ruffino Sparkling Rose and Ravage Cabernet Sauvignon. The Canadian business delivered a solid quarter, posting mid-single-digit net sales growth while continuing to gain market share across both the import and domestic wine segments. Overall, our first quarter wine and spirits results are a testament to our ability to achieve our goal of growing profits ahead of sales and improving margins. 
So what are the key enablers? We're reaping the benefits of our targeted investments for a subset of our Focus Brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and greater growth potential. We remain committed to mix in margin-accretive innovation and new product development and have several new products in the hopper, a few of which I just mentioned. We continue to optimize COGS through global blend management initiatives, productivity improvements and lower costs. We are capitalizing on the market-leading growth of our margin-enhancing wine acquisitions, Meiomi and The Prisoner. And we have recently made some leadership changes within wine and spirits to enable a stronger, more competitive business. 
Now before I turn the call over to David, I would like to touch on 2 more high-level topics of interest for our business. The first is related to the exploration of a possible IPO of our Canadian business discussed last quarter. Our evaluation of this strategic option continues, and we plan to provide you with an update as soon as possible. Since this evaluation is ongoing, there is not much else to add at this time. The second is the recent referendum in favor of the U.K. exiting the European Union. As a reminder, Constellation is primarily a U.S. business. Our sales outside the U.S. represent about 10% of our total consolidated sales and are primarily related to our Canada business. As such, our exposure to European markets, in particular, is limited, and a strong dollar generally benefits us financially. 
In closing, our first quarter results have set the stage for fiscal 2017. We are off to a very positive start for the year, gaining market share across our beer and wine businesses. We have been working diligently to build a solid and sustainable foundation of operational excellence, financial strength and innovation. And we expect to continue to execute on these areas throughout the remainder of the year. 
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David, who will review our first quarter financial results."

On the last call, we provided guidance which represented an impressive mid-teens EPS growth. I'm happy to report that we're steadily executing against our plan.

I'm happy to report that we're steadily executing against our plan. Comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came in at $1.54, up 22%, putting us on a path to achieve our full year comparable basis diluted EPS goal of $6.05 to $6.35 per share. 
Let's look at Q1 fiscal '17 performance in more detail, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Organic beer net sales increased 15%, primarily due to organic volume growth of 12% and favorable pricing. Beer depletion growth for the quarter came in at almost 10%. This includes Ballast Point depletions for the quarter and in the corresponding period last year. Excluding Ballast Point, depletions for our Mexican portfolio grew 9%. Beer shipment volume for the first quarter generally runs ahead of depletion volume as distributors build inventory for the summer selling season. This year, we also benefited from a shift in shipment volume from Q4 fiscal '16 into Q1 fiscal '17 related to the beer recall we discussed last quarter. Distributor inventory days at the end of Q1 fiscal '17 were fairly level with the prior year quarter. Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant-currency basis increased 3%. This primarily reflects volume growth and favorable mix for the segment driven by solid financial results for the organic U.S. wine business in the quarter. Beer operating margin increased 80 basis points to 35.6%. This reflects benefits from pricing, foreign currency and timing of marketing spend for our Mexican portfolio. As expected, these positive factors were partially offset by higher COGS, including increased depreciation as additional capacity came online; SG&A investments; and the consolidation of Ballast Point. If you exclude the marketing timing benefit, beer operating margin for the quarter would have been flattish to up slightly. 
I'd also like to note we've reduced the level of product we received under the Interim Supply Agreement with ABI as Nava has reached the 20 million hectoliter capacity milestone. Wine and spirits operating margin improved 160 basis points to 23.3%. The increase was primarily related to the benefit from the Meiomi acquisition. Interest expense for the quarter increased 9%, primarily due to higher average borrowings. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $8.1 billion, an increase of $143 million since the end of fiscal '16. This increase primarily reflects funding for The Prisoner acquisition, which closed at the end of April, partially offset by our free cash flow generation. Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.7x at the end of Q1 fiscal '17 versus 3.8x at the end of fiscal '16. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q1 does not yet reflect a full year EBITDA benefit from the Ballast Point, Meiomi and Prisoner acquisitions. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 31.6%, which is essentially even with Q1 of last year. We anticipate that our Q2 fiscal '17 effective tax rate will be similar to the Q1 rate. However, we continue to expect our full year fiscal '17 effective tax rate to approximate 29%. 
Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we generated $177 million of free cash flow compared to $76 million for Q1 last year. Operating cash flow totaled $346 million, up 68%. This increase was primarily driven by our earnings growth. CapEx for the quarter was $169 million compared to $130 million for Q1 last year. While CapEx was up for the quarter, we still have significant spending plan for the balance of the year as our full year CapEx guidance of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion remains unchanged. As a reminder, this guidance includes approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion related to our beer business operational expansion projects in Mexico. We continue to expect fiscal '17 free cash flow to be in the range of $250 million to $350 million. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and the CapEx spend that I just outlined. 
Moving to our full year fiscal '17 P&L outlook. We continue to project our comparable basis EPS to be in the range of $6.05 to $6.35. Our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. The beer business continues to target net sales and operating income growth in the range of 14% to 17%. We also continue to expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the 10% to 13% range. This includes 1% to 2% of anticipated pricing benefit for our Mexican portfolio. For the wine and spirits business, we continue to expect net sales growth in the mid-single-digit range and operating income growth in the mid to high single-digit range. In addition, we continue to project organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range with operating income growth targeted ahead of sales growth as we are forecasting some mix benefits. 
In closing, we're off to a great start to the year and on track to achieve our financial performance goals for fiscal '17. While we still have much to accomplish with our Mexican brewing operations, we're excited that we achieved a critical milestone by reaching the 20 million hectoliter capacity mark at Nava. 
With that, Rob and I are happy to take your questions."

Maybe 2 or 3 years ago, we would have been talking about the $8 to $10 or $12 segment really being the hottest segment in the industry, but I would say that that shifted up to even the $15 and $20 segments. Hence, our interest in brands like Meiomi and Prisoner in that segment because I think we really see the future continuing to favor premiumization and trading-up even into these more expensive categories. And then as it relates to our own business, we're constantly working on positioning our business -- our portfolio, okay, to take advantage of those trends. And I think that we very successfully done that and have great brands in all of these hot-price segments and categories. And it's not just price segments, right? It's categories. Perfect example being pinot noir, okay? We're a leader in pinot noir today. And pinot noir is just an extremely hot varietal. And I would say that the good news there is that -- I would say we expect it to continue to be a hot varietal for well into the future in that it is not a trendy kind of a thing that will be fleeting. And that, of course, pinot noir is one of the noble varieties and has always been highly sought after. And we -- and as I said, we get the hottest brands. Red blends continue to be hot, as you know. We've got hot brands in the red blend category. And Prisoner, I mean, is a perfect example of that, albeit a newly-acquired brand, but you only have to go and sort of see what people are drinking in any major metropolitan area or talk to people. And Prisoner is the hottest brand in its price point and has taken advantage of that as well. And again, I don't think that's particularly trendy in that it's gotten fantastic scores and is considered to be -- let me put it this way, a real fine wine. So that's basically the answer to your question, Tim."

I mean, that said, our beer portfolio grew a little bit shy of 10%, which is an outstanding result on a relative or comparative basis. Yes, there were a few things that affected our business, which I talked about. The recall affected it, for sure. Hence, we would have done better in the first quarter had that not been the case. The can overlap, i.e. overlapping the intro was a factor. There was definitely some promo activity in first quarter last year, which was not duplicated this year, again due to some packs not being in supply during that period. And then I guess, to your point, you can see all that kind of clearing itself up by simply looking at the June IRI trends, which I think are reflective of the overall health of the business. So we have no concerns whatsoever about the brand health of the import portfolio or Corona, period. So we fully expect to be on our forecast for the year, for the portfolio. And that's our import portfolio, right? Ballast Point, we're not even talking about that because the growth is so high that what can you even say?

The other comment I want to make, Judy, relates to glass. So yes, we fired up the second furnace at Nava. We won't be producing glass out of that facility really until the end of July. And then even when that happens, the facility itself won't be producing at what we would expect our acceptable levels of utilization for many months. It takes a long time to get the furnaces functioning in a way that we'll be happy with. So I would say that the benefit from that furnace really won't show up until the back half of this year, if it shows up this year at all."

They sort of remain #1 at keeping our debt levels in that sort of mid 3 to 4 range, where we actually are at the current time. Returning dollars to shareholders continues to be a big and important focus for us. As you know, we did increase our annual dividend at the end of the year, and we have made some stock repurchases. So we continued to prioritize that as a key priority. And then as we've said in the past, we'll continue to look at and potentially make selective acquisitions of things like Meiomi, Prisoner, as we go on. So I think that those kind of things are somewhat reflective of being tuck-in-type acquisitions are the things that we would like at. And I would say that that strategy is working very well. And I think to the -- your question about the magnitude, I think that goes back to my first point relative to maintaining our debt levels in that sort of 3 to 4x, okay? We will be, I'll say, guided in terms of magnitude by that priority. And then as I've mentioned in my script, we continued to evaluate the Canadian IPO, right? But that's a disposition. So if we were to complete that, that will actually bring in cash, right? So we're being, I would say, pretty judicious in terms of how we're managing the whole capital allocation process and our priorities. So I think that we've got -- we've struck a really good balance there, let me put it that way."

And therefore, it's -- I'd say real beer appeals to  I would say real beer aficionados, which is one of the reasons why I think that it is able to command the premium pricing that it does command is because of the fact that that it really is viewed by beer people, okay, as a super high-quality, award-winning product, a lot like wine in that regard, right?

Modelo Especial has about 70% ACV. So it's got a pretty good distribution runway.

Across the business, we",1559,"Thank you, Patty, and good morning, and welcome to our discussion of Constellation's first quarter fiscal 2017 sales and earnings results. We are off to a great start to our new fiscal year with sales and earnings up double digits. Across the business, we're seeing the results of our efforts to drive consumer demand for premium products through best-in-class marketing and sales execution while improving margins through financial discipline and a focus on core premium products. This, combined with the successful integration of and growth from our recently acquired brands, provides a healthy foundation for achieving our fiscal 2017 objectives. 
Our beer business continues to deliver industry-leading results while expanding their operational footprint with planned capital investments in Mexico. During the quarter, the beer business generated depletion growth of almost 10% and was the #1 share gainer in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer business. Constellation's beer portfolio led volume gains amongst U.S. brewers, contributing almost 20% of category dollar growth during the quarter, as each brand in our Mexican beer portfolio grew across most channels and packages.
Corona Extra and Modelo Especial remained 2 of the hottest brands in the U.S. beer industry and held category-leading positions as the #3 and #2 players, respectively, among overall brand share gainers. These results are due in part to focused market execution as well as optimization of key marketing and advertising initiatives. We launched fresh, new Spanish and English language national television advertising for the Corona Extra brand and canned format, including the brand's first-ever boxing TV ad. New national TV advertising was also launched for Modelo Especial in English and Spanish and for the Modelo Especial Chelada in Spanish, both of which continue to have double-digit growth and are among the fastest-growing brands in the category.
Our new Pacifico 24-ounce canned format is the #1 new import so far in 2016, and we are supporting the brand by expanding targeted television advertising. Pacifico grew depletions more than 15% for the quarter.
And last but certainly not least, let's not forget about Ballast Point, which continues to be the fastest-growing major craft brand in the U.S., posting depletion growth of more than 60% in the first quarter. As you know, our plan for Ballast Point this year is to expand distribution and make that brand available in all 50 states. And to date, we now have distribution in more than 40 states and expect to complete our overall goal sometime before calendar year-End. This distribution push, along with successful new flavor and style launches, is expected to deliver the strong double-digit growth we are targeting for Ballast Point in fiscal 2017. 
It was recently announced that we plan to establish a Ballast Point brewery in Virginia. This will allow us to develop an East Coast presence to provide the best-quality, freshest craft beer to all of our customers.
I'd now like to take a minute to discuss recently published IRI and Nielsen consumer takeaway data for our beer business as there seems to be significant discussion and debate related to the growth trends for some of our brands. First, IRI channels represent about 50% of our overall beer business at retail and therefore provide only a partial picture of the brand and portfolio performance outside of the sales, shipment and depletion results we report every quarter. Within IRI channels, over the last quarter, we've seen significant variability from week to week. Much of this relates to year-over-year timing and selling day comparison issues for important holidays during the quarter, including Cinco and Memorial Day. We saw some impact from our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter recall of certain Corona Extra packages, which created temporary product shortages in select areas. We also experienced pockets of poor weather, especially in the Northeast, and we are cycling very strong Corona Extra can growth following last year's first quarter intro of the canned format for this brand. 
Despite these temporary headwinds, our recent brand health assessment for Corona Extra indicates a consistent or increased drinking on key brand health scores nationally since fiscal 2016. While consumer takeaway is a standard measurement, depletions represent our entire business or an even more comprehensive indicator of growth and health. I'm very proud of our nearly double-digit beer depletion growth trend for the first quarter, given some of the factors I just mentioned. And preliminary beer depletion results for the month of June are progressing in line with our forecast. We anticipate similar timing issues around the upcoming key holidays in the second quarter related to the July 4 and Labor Day weekends. 
Operationally, during the quarter, we completed a significant expansion milestone at Nava by doubling the size of the brewery that we acquired and bringing annual production capacity to 20 million hectoliters. All support areas are in place for this added capacity, including packaging, utilities, warehouse and rail infrastructure. As many of you are aware, the expansion of the Nava Brewery to 25 million hectoliters is our next critical capacity milestone, and I'm pleased to report that this work is proceeding as scheduled.
In addition, we have officially broken ground at Mexicali. And although this project is in the early phase, it is also progressing as planned. 
Finally, we recently fired up our second furnace at our Nava glass plant and expect that it will be producing glass shortly. As a reminder, it takes several months for a new furnace to ramp up in order to produce optimal capacity.
And now I would like to focus on the operational results for our wine and spirits business. During the quarter, our wine and spirits business grew earnings and expanded margins while successfully integrating and growing our newly acquired premium wine brands, Meiomi and The Prisoner, which posted IRI dollar growth of about 90% and 30%, respectively. 
Since the acquisition of The Prisoner, Constellation has gained 2 share points in the IRI luxury plus segment, extending the lead in our #1 luxury plus position. Constellation is now ranked #3 in superluxury wine at the greater-than-$25 retail price point. The U.S. wine business posted strong sales growth and gained IRI dollar share, driven by our core Focus Brands, where we're building momentum across multiple price segments.
Let me provide a few examples. In the IRI $20-plus luxury and superluxury price segments combined, Meiomi is not only the largest pinot noir, but also the largest dollar share gainer for the entire quarter. Kim Crawford is the #1 Sauvignon Blanc in the IRI superpremium segment and posted dollar sales growth of more than 20% during the quarter. Clos du Bois is the #1 chardonnay in the IRI premium segment. And Black Box is the leader in the fast-growing premium boxed segment.
In aggregate, our Focus Brands grew depletions at 12% for the quarter. Our innovation platform is also gaining traction, thanks to new margin-enhancing offerings like the Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Bourbon Barrel-Aged Cabernet, SVEDKA Cucumber Lime, Ruffino Sparkling Rosé and Ravage Cabernet Sauvignon.
The Canadian business delivered a solid quarter, posting mid-single-digit net sales growth while continuing to gain market share across both the import and domestic wine segments. Overall, our first quarter wine and spirits results are a testament to our ability to achieve our goal of growing profits ahead of sales and improving margins.
So what are the key enablers? We are reaping the benefits of our targeted investments for a subset of our Focus Brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and greater growth potential. We remain committed to mix and margin-accretive innovation and new product development and have several new products in the hopper, a few of which I just mentioned. We continue to optimize COGS through global blend management initiatives, productivity improvements and lower grave costs. We are capitalizing on the market-leading growth of our margin-enhancing wine acquisitions, Meiomi and The Prisoner. And we have recently made some leadership changes within wine and spirits to enable a stronger, more competitive business.
Now before I turn the call over to David, I would like to touch on 2 more high-level topics of interest for our business. The first is related to the exploration of a possible IPO of our Canadian business discussed last quarter. Our evaluation of this strategic option continues, and we plan to provide you with an update as soon as possible. Since this evaluation is ongoing, there is not much else to add at this time. The second is the recent referendum in favor of the U.K. exiting the European Union. As a reminder, Constellation is primarily a U.S. business. Our sales outside the U.S. represent about 10% of our total consolidated sales and are primarily related to our Canada business. As such, our exposure to European markets, in particular, is limited, and a strong dollar generally benefits us financially.
In closing, our first quarter results have set the stage for fiscal 2017. We are off to a very positive start for the year, gaining market share across our beer and wine businesses. We have been working diligently to build a solid and sustainable foundation of operational excellence, financial strength and innovation. And we expect to continue to execute on these areas throughout the remainder of the year.
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David, who will review our first quarter financial results."
258589,345278312,1003729,"Constellation Brands Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Jun 30, 2016",2016-06-30,"Earnings Calls","Constellation Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. On the last call, we provided guidance which represented an impressive mid-teens EPS growth. I'm happy to report that we're steadily executing against our plan. Comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came",923,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. On the last call, we provided guidance which represented an impressive mid-teens EPS growth. I'm happy to report that we're steadily executing against our plan. Comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came in at $1.54, up 22%, putting us on a path to achieve our full year comparable basis diluted EPS goal of $6.05 to $6.35 per share.
Let's look at Q1 fiscal '17 performance in more detail, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Organic beer net sales increased 15%, primarily due to organic volume growth of 12% and favorable pricing. Beer depletion growth for the quarter came in at almost 10%. This includes Ballast Point depletions for the quarter and in the corresponding period last year. Excluding Ballast Point, depletions for our Mexican portfolio grew 9%. 
Beer shipment volume for the first quarter generally runs ahead of depletion volume as distributors build inventory for the summer selling season. This year, we also benefited from a shift in shipment volume from Q4 fiscal '16 into Q1 fiscal '17 related to the beer recall we discussed last quarter. Distributor inventory days at the end of Q1 fiscal '17 were fairly level with the prior year quarter. 
Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 3%. This primarily reflects volume growth and favorable mix for the segment, driven by solid financial results for the organic U.S. wine business in the quarter. 
Beer operating margin increased 80 basis points to 35.6%. This reflects benefits from pricing, foreign currency and timing of marketing spend for our Mexican portfolio. As expected, these positive factors were partially offset by higher COGS, including increased depreciation as additional capacity came online; SG&A investments; and the consolidation of Ballast Point. If you exclude the marketing timing benefit, beer operating margin for the quarter would have been flattish to up slightly.
I'd also like to note we have reduced the level of product we receive under the Interim Supply Agreement with ABI as Nava has reached the 20 million hectoliter capacity milestone. Wine and spirits operating margin improved 160 basis points to 23.3%. The increase was primarily related to the benefit from the Meiomi acquisition. 
Interest expense for the quarter increased 9%, primarily due to higher average borrowings. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $8.1 billion, an increase of $143 million since the end of fiscal '16. This increase primarily reflects funding for The Prisoner acquisition, which closed at the end of April, partially offset by our free cash flow generation. 
Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.7x at the end of Q1 fiscal '17 versus 3.8x at the end of fiscal '16. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q1 does not yet reflect a full year EBITDA benefit from the Ballast Point, Meiomi and Prisoner acquisitions. 
Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 31.6%, which is essentially even with Q1 of last year. We anticipate that our Q2 fiscal '17 effective tax rate will be similar to the Q1 rate. However, we continue to expect our full year fiscal '17 effective tax rate to approximate 29%.
Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we generated $177 million of free cash flow compared to $76 million for Q1 last year. Operating cash flow totaled $346 million, up 68%. This increase was primarily driven by our earnings growth. 
CapEx for the quarter was $169 million compared to $130 million for Q1 last year. While CapEx was up for the quarter, we still have significant spending plan for the balance of the year as our full year CapEx guidance of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion remains unchanged. As a reminder, this guidance includes approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion related to our beer business operational expansion projects in Mexico. We continue to expect fiscal '17 free cash flow to be in the range of $250 million to $350 million. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and the CapEx spend that I just outlined.
Moving to our full year fiscal '17 P&L outlook. We continue to project our comparable basis EPS to be in the range of $6.05 to $6.35. Our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. The beer business continues to target net sales and operating income growth in the range of 14% to 17%. We also continue to expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the 10% to 13% range. This includes 1% to 2% of anticipated pricing benefit for our Mexican portfolio. 
For the wine and spirits business, we continue to expect net sales growth in the mid-single-digit range and operating income growth in the mid- to high single-digit range. In addition, we continue to project organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range, with operating income growth targeted ahead of sales growth as we are forecasting some mix benefits.
In closing, we're off to a great start to the year and on track to achieve our financial performance goals for fiscal '17. While we still have much to accomplish with our Mexican brewing operations, we're excited that we achieved a critical milestone by reaching the 20 million hectoliter capacity mark at Nava.
With that, Rob and I are happy to take your questions."

I think, actually, the category, as you mentioned, has accelerated a bit lately, and therefore, I would say that it's very robust. I would say that the trading up and premiumization in the category is probably stronger than ever, okay, and things have really kind of shifted. Maybe 2 or 3 years ago, we would have been talking about the $8 to $10 or $12 segment really being the hottest segment in the industry, but I would say that, that shifted up to even the $15 and $20 segments. Hence, our interest in brands like Meiomi and Prisoner in that segment because I think we really see the future continuing to favor premiumization and trading up even into these more expensive categories. And then as it relates to our own business, we're constantly working on positioning our biz -- our portfolio, okay, to take advantage of those trends. And I think that we have very successfully done that and have great brands in all of these hot price segments and categories. And it's not just price segments, right? It's categories, a perfect example being pinot noir, okay? We're a leader in pinot noir today. And pinot noir is just an extremely hot varietal. And I would say that the good news there is that -- I would say we expect it to continue to be a hot varietal for well into the future in that it is not a trendy kind of a thing that will be fleeting and that, of course, pinot noir is one of the noble varieties and has always been highly sought after. And we -- and as I said, we've got the hottest brands. Red blends continue to be hot. As you know, we've got hot brands in the red blend category. I mean, Prisoner, I mean, is a perfect example of that, albeit a newly acquired brand, but you only have to go and sort of see what people are drinking in any major metropolitan area or talk to people and Prisoner is the hottest brand in its price point and has taken advantage of that as well. Again, I don't think that's particularly trendy in that it's gotten fantastic scores and is considered to be, let me put it this way, a real fine wine. So that's basically the answer to your question, Tim."

I mean, some of the Nielsen data actually looked pretty strong as we've seen in the last few weeks. So maybe just a little bit more color just on the June trend.

So look, it's hard to get into specific numbers, okay, on what the growth would have been had these factors not affected us. But as I said, there were 2 or 3 factors. I'd say first quarter was kind of not a great quarter for the beer business -- the beer category in general. I mean, that said, our beer portfolio grew a little bit shy of 10%, which is an outstanding result on a relative or comparative basis. Yes, there were a few things that affected our business, which I talked about. The recall affected it, for sure. Hence, we would have done better in the first quarter had that not been the case. The can overlap, i.e., overlapping the intro, was a factor. There was definitely some promo activity in first quarter last year, which was not duplicated this year, again due to some packs not being in supply during that period. And then I guess, to your point, you can see all that kind of clearing itself up by simply looking at the June IRI trends, which I think are reflective of the overall health of the business. So we have no concerns whatsoever about the brand health of the import portfolio or Corona, period. So we fully expect to be on our forecast for the year for the portfolio. And that's our import portfolio, right? Ballast Point, we're not even talking about that because the growth is so high that, what can you even say? It's the fastest-growing beer in the entire craft segment in the entire U.S. on what's getting to be a very big base, okay? I mean, you don't -- we can't even talk about double-digit growth because it's so high. It's triple digits sometimes."

So in the first quarter, we benefited from pricing in general, which somewhat offset COGS increases, which were driven by increased depreciation. We did receive some benefits from FX. But probably the biggest driver in the quarter was the timing of marketing spend. And now I'm talking about operating margins, right? So we'll see that spend come back as we progress in the fiscal year, which will have a bit of a dampening effect on the margin. So we still expect flat margins roughly year-over-year, and we're just -- we're pleased with the progress we're making in terms of margin expansion and getting the Nava facility functioning at 20 million hectoliters. The other comment I want to make, Judy, relates to glass. So yes, we fired up the second furnace at Nava. We won't be producing glass out of that facility really until the end of July. And then even when that happens, the facility itself won't be producing at what we would expect our acceptable levels of utilization for many months. It takes a long time to get the furnaces functioning in a way that we'll be happy with. So I would say that the benefit from that furnace really won't show up until the back half of this year if it shows up this year at all."

And then as we've said in the past, we'll continue to look at and potentially make selective acquisitions of things like Meiomi, Prisoner as we go on. So I think that those kind of things are somewhat reflective of being tuck-in-type acquisitions of the things that we would like at, and I would say that, that strategy is working very well. And then I think to the -- your question about the magnitude, I think that goes back to my first point relative to maintaining our debt levels in that sort of 3x to 4x, okay? We will be, I'll say, guided in terms of magnitude by that priority. And then as I've mentioned in my script, we continue to evaluate the Canadian IPO, right? But that's a disposition.

I mean, where we have gotten the distribution as we've moved it to the east, I think that it's resonating particularly well. I'm not sure that it's perceived with any geographic specificity as we bring it into new markets. And as it grows in new markets, I think that it's really more viewed as a really high-end, high-quality, award-winning brand. And it's all about sort of styles and flavors. And I think the thing that's kind of unique or somewhat unique about Ballast Point is that it does have a lot of different styles like The Commodore style or the Sculpin IPA. And that's got flavors and essence like the Grapefruit Sculpin or the new Pineapple Sculpin, which is really hot, or a new product, which we just intro-ed, called Barmy, which is a honey -- apricot and honey flavored pale ale. But this is very subtle stuff, right? It's not like it's flavored like a flavored alco FAB, okay, like my father's root beer or Mike's [ph] or something. These are very subtle flavors that accentuate, okay, the sort of exotic hops that are used in the product and sort of bring out some of the qualities of those hops. And therefore, it's -- I'd say real beer -- and appeals to, I would say, real beer aficionados, which is one of the reasons why I think that it is able to command the premium pricing that it does command is because of the fact that it really is viewed by beer people, okay, as a superhigh-quality, award-winning product. A lot like wine in that regard, right? High-end wine. Think of its acceptance in that vein by real craft beer drinkers who know and follow what's really being held as superhigh-quality examples of that type of product. So it's much more like that, it's much more like high-end wine, is the way I would think about Ballast Point."

The good news is that -- probably the second most important thing, right, is velocity per point of distribution.

Across the business, we",1559,"Thank you, Patty, and good morning, and welcome to our discussion of Constellation's first quarter fiscal 2017 sales and earnings results. We are off to a great start to our new fiscal year with sales and earnings up double digits. Across the business, we're seeing the results of our efforts to drive consumer demand for premium products through best-in-class marketing and sales execution while improving margins through financial discipline and a focus on core premium products. This, combined with the successful integration of and growth from our recently acquired brands, provides a healthy foundation for achieving our fiscal 2017 objectives. 
Our beer business continues to deliver industry-leading results while expanding their operational footprint with planned capital investments in Mexico. During the quarter, the beer business generated depletion growth of almost 10% and was the #1 share gainer in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer business. Constellation's beer portfolio led volume gains amongst U.S. brewers, contributing almost 20% of category dollar growth during the quarter, as each brand in our Mexican beer portfolio grew across most channels and packages.
Corona Extra and Modelo Especial remained 2 of the hottest brands in the U.S. beer industry and held category-leading positions as the #3 and #2 players, respectively, among overall brand share gainers. These results are due in part to focused market execution as well as optimization of key marketing and advertising initiatives. We launched fresh, new Spanish and English language national television advertising for the Corona Extra brand in canned format, including the brand's first-ever boxing TV ad. New national TV advertising was also launched for Modelo Especial in English and Spanish and for the Modelo Especial Chelada in Spanish, both of which continue to have double-digit growth and are among the fastest-growing brands in the category.
Our new Pacifico 24-ounce canned format is the #1 new import so far in 2016, and we are supporting the brand by expanding targeted television advertising. Pacifico grew depletions more than 15% for the quarter.
And last but certainly not least, let's not forget about Ballast Point, which continues to be the fastest-growing major craft brand in the U.S., posting depletion growth of more than 60% in the first quarter. As you know, our plan for Ballast Point this year is to expand distribution and make their brand available in all 50 states. And to date, we now have distribution in more than 40 states and expect to complete our overall goal sometime before calendar year-end. This distribution push, along with successful new flavor and style launches, is expected to deliver the strong double-digit growth we are targeting for Ballast Point in fiscal 2017. 
It was recently announced that we plan to establish a Ballast Point brewery in Virginia. This will allow us to develop an East Coast presence to provide the best-quality, freshest craft beer to all of our customers.
I'd now like to take a minute to discuss recently published IRI and Nielsen consumer takeaway data for our beer business as there seems to be significant discussion and debate related to the growth trends for some of our brands. First, IRI channels represent about 50% of our overall beer business at retail and therefore provide only a partial picture of the brand and portfolio performance outside of the sales, shipment and depletion results we report every quarter. Within IRI channels, over the last quarter, we've seen significant variability from week to week. Much of this relates to year-over-year timing and selling day comparison issues for important holidays during the quarter, including Cinco and Memorial Day. We saw some impact from our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter recall of certain Corona Extra packages, which created temporary product shortages in select areas. We also experienced pockets of poor weather, especially in the Northeast, and we are cycling very strong Corona Extra can growth following last year's first quarter intro of the canned format for this brand. 
Despite these temporary headwinds, our recent brand health assessment for Corona Extra indicates a consistent or increased drinking on key brand health scores nationally since fiscal 2016. While consumer takeaway is a standard measurement, depletions represent our entire business or an even more comprehensive indicator of growth and health. I'm very proud of our nearly double-digit beer depletion growth trend for the first quarter, given some of the factors I just mentioned. And preliminary beer depletion results for the month of June are progressing in line with our forecast. We anticipate similar timing issues around the upcoming key holidays in the second quarter related to the July 4 and Labor Day weekends. 
Operationally, during the quarter, we completed a significant expansion milestone at Nava by doubling the size of the brewery that we acquired and bringing annual production capacity to 20 million hectoliters. All support areas are in place for this added capacity, including packaging, utilities, warehouse and rail infrastructure. As many of you are aware, the expansion of the Nava Brewery to 25 million hectoliters is our next critical capacity milestone, and I'm pleased to report that this work is proceeding as scheduled.
In addition, we have officially broken ground at Mexicali. And although this project is in the early phase, it is also progressing as planned. 
Finally, we recently fired up our second furnace at our Nava glass plant and expect that it will be producing glass shortly. As a reminder, it takes several months for a new furnace to ramp up in order to produce optimal capacity.
And now I would like to focus on the operational results for our wine and spirits business. During the quarter, our wine and spirits business grew earnings and expanded margins while successfully integrating and growing our newly acquired premium wine brands, Meiomi and The Prisoner, which posted IRI dollar growth of about 90% and 30%, respectively. 
Since the acquisition of The Prisoner, Constellation has gained 2 share points in the IRI luxury plus segment, extending the lead in our #1 luxury plus position. Constellation is now ranked #3 in super-luxury wine at the greater-than-$25 retail price point. The U.S. wine business posted strong sales growth and gained IRI dollar share, driven by our core Focus Brands, where we're building momentum across multiple price segments.
Let me provide a few examples. In the IRI $20-plus luxury and super-luxury price segments combined, Meiomi is not only the largest pinot noir, but also the largest dollar share gainer for the entire quarter. Kim Crawford is the #1 Sauvignon Blanc in the IRI super-premium segment and posted dollar sales growth of more than 20% during the quarter. Clos du Bois is the #1 chardonnay in the IRI premium segment. And Black Box is the leader in the fast-growing premium box segment.
In aggregate, our Focus Brands grew depletions at 12% for the quarter. Our innovation platform is also gaining traction, thanks to new margin-enhancing offerings like the Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Bourbon Barrel-Aged Cabernet, SVEDKA Cucumber Lime, Ruffino Sparkling Rosé and Ravage Cabernet Sauvignon.
The Canadian business delivered a solid quarter, posting mid-single-digit net sales growth while continuing to gain market share across both the import and domestic wine segments. Overall, our first quarter wine and spirits results are a testament to our ability to achieve our goal of growing profits ahead of sales and improving margins.
So what are the key enablers? We are reaping the benefits of our targeted investments for a subset of our Focus Brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and greater growth potential. We remain committed to mix and margin-accretive innovation and new product development and have several new products in the hopper, a few of which I just mentioned. We continue to optimize COGS through global blend management initiatives, productivity improvements and lower grape costs. We are capitalizing on the market-leading growth of our margin-enhancing wine acquisitions, Meiomi and The Prisoner. And we have recently made some leadership changes within wine and spirits to enable a stronger, more competitive business.
Now before I turn the call over to David, I would like to touch on 2 more high-level topics of interest for our business. The first is related to the exploration of a possible IPO of our Canadian business discussed last quarter. Our evaluation of this strategic option continues, and we plan to provide you with an update as soon as possible. Since this evaluation is ongoing, there is not much else to add at this time. The second is the recent referendum in favor of the U.K. exiting the European Union. As a reminder, Constellation is primarily a U.S. business. Our sales outside the U.S. represent about 10% of our total consolidated sales and are primarily related to our Canada business. As such, our exposure to European markets, in particular, is limited, and a strong dollar generally benefits us financially.
In closing, our first quarter results have set the stage for fiscal 2017. We are off to a very positive start for the year, gaining market share across our beer and wine businesses. We have been working diligently to build a solid and sustainable foundation of operational excellence, financial strength and innovation. And we expect to continue to execute on these areas throughout the remainder of the year.
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David, who will review our first quarter financial results."

On the last call, we provided guidance which represented an impressive mid-teens EPS growth. I'm happy to report that we're steadily executing against our plan. Comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came",923,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. On the last call, we provided guidance which represented an impressive mid-teens EPS growth. I'm happy to report that we're steadily executing against our plan. Comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came in at $1.54, up 22%, putting us on a path to achieve our full year comparable basis diluted EPS goal of $6.05 to $6.35 per share.
Let's look at Q1 fiscal '17 performance in more detail, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Organic beer net sales increased 15%, primarily due to organic volume growth of 12% and favorable pricing. Beer depletion growth for the quarter came in at almost 10%. This includes Ballast Point depletions for the quarter and in the corresponding period last year. Excluding Ballast Point, depletions for our Mexican portfolio grew 9%. 
Beer shipment volume for the first quarter generally runs ahead of depletion volume as distributors build inventory for the summer selling season. This year, we also benefited from a shift in shipment volume from Q4 fiscal '16 into Q1 fiscal '17 related to the beer recall we discussed last quarter. Distributor inventory days at the end of Q1 fiscal '17 were fairly level with the prior year quarter. 
Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 3%. This primarily reflects volume growth and favorable mix for the segment, driven by solid financial results for the organic U.S. wine business in the quarter. 
Beer operating margin increased 80 basis points to 35.6%. This reflects benefits from pricing, foreign currency and timing of marketing spend for our Mexican portfolio. As expected, these positive factors were partially offset by higher COGS, including increased depreciation as additional capacity came online; SG&A investments; and the consolidation of Ballast Point. If you exclude the marketing timing benefit, beer operating margin for the quarter would have been flattish to up slightly.
I'd also like to note we have reduced the level of product we receive under the Interim Supply Agreement with ABI as Nava has reached the 20 million hectoliter capacity milestone. Wine and spirits operating margin improved 160 basis points to 23.3%. The increase was primarily related to the benefit from the Meiomi acquisition. 
Interest expense for the quarter increased 9%, primarily due to higher average borrowings. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $8.1 billion, an increase of $143 million since the end of fiscal '16. This increase primarily reflects funding for The Prisoner acquisition, which closed at the end of April, partially offset by our free cash flow generation. 
Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.7x at the end of Q1 fiscal '17 versus 3.8x at the end of fiscal '16. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q1 does not yet reflect a full year EBITDA benefit from the Ballast Point, Meiomi and Prisoner acquisitions. 
Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 31.6%, which is essentially even with Q1 of last year. We anticipate that our Q2 fiscal '17 effective tax rate will be similar to the Q1 rate. However, we continue to expect our full year fiscal '17 effective tax rate to approximate 29%.
Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we generated $177 million of free cash flow compared to $76 million for Q1 last year. Operating cash flow totaled $346 million, up 68%. This increase was primarily driven by our earnings growth. 
CapEx for the quarter was $169 million compared to $130 million for Q1 last year. While CapEx was up for the quarter, we still have significant spending plan for the balance of the year as our full year CapEx guidance of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion remains unchanged. As a reminder, this guidance includes approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion related to our beer business operational expansion projects in Mexico. We continue to expect fiscal '17 free cash flow to be in the range of $250 million to $350 million. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and the CapEx spend that I just outlined.
Moving to our full year fiscal '17 P&L outlook. We continue to project our comparable basis EPS to be in the range of $6.05 to $6.35. Our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. The beer business continues to target net sales and operating income growth in the range of 14% to 17%. We also continue to expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the 10% to 13% range. This includes 1% to 2% of anticipated pricing benefit for our Mexican portfolio. 
For the wine and spirits business, we continue to expect net sales growth in the mid-single-digit range and operating income growth in the mid- to high single-digit range. In addition, we continue to project organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range, with operating income growth targeted ahead of sales growth as we are forecasting some mix benefits.
In closing, we're off to a great start to the year and on track to achieve our financial performance goals for fiscal '17. While we still have much to accomplish with our Mexican brewing operations, we're excited that we achieved a critical milestone by reaching the 20 million hectoliter capacity mark at Nava.
With that, Rob and I are happy to take your questions."

I think, actually, the category, as you mentioned, has accelerated a bit lately, and therefore, I would say that it's very robust. I would say that trading up and premiumization in the category is probably stronger than ever, okay, and things have really kind of shifted. Maybe 2 or 3 years ago, we would have been talking about the $8 to $10 or $12 segment really being the hottest segment in the industry, but I would say that, that shifted up to even the $15 and $20 segments. Hence, our interest in brands like Meiomi and Prisoner in that segment because I think we really see the future continuing to favor premiumization and trading up even into these more expensive categories. And then as it relates to our own business, we're constantly working on positioning our -- our portfolio, okay, to take advantage of those trends. And I think that we have very successfully done that and have great brands in all of these hot price segments and categories. And it's not just price segments, right? It's categories, a perfect example being pinot noir, okay? We're a leader in pinot noir today. And pinot noir is just an extremely hot varietal. And I would say that the good news there is that -- I would say we expect it to continue to be a hot varietal for well into the future in that it is not a trendy kind of a thing that will be fleeting and that, of course, pinot noir is one of the noble varieties and has always been highly sought after. And we -- and as I said, we've got the hottest brands. Red blends continue to be hot. As you know, we've got hot brands in the red blend category. I mean, Prisoner, I mean, is a perfect example of that, albeit a newly acquired brand, but you only have to go and sort of see what people are drinking in any major metropolitan area or talk to people and Prisoner is the hottest brand in its price point and has taken advantage of that as well. Again, I don't think that's particularly trendy in that it's gotten fantastic scores and is considered to be, let me put it this way, a real fine wine. So that's basically the answer to your question, Tim."

I'd say first quarter was kind of not a great quarter for the beer business -- the beer category in general. I mean, that said, our beer portfolio grew a little bit shy of 10%, which is an outstanding result on a relative or comparative basis. Yes, there were a few things that affected our business, which I talked about. The recall affected it, for sure. Hence, we would have done better in the first quarter had that not been the case. The can overlap, i.e., overlapping the intro, was a factor. There was definitely some promo activity in first quarter last year, which was not duplicated this year, again due to some packs not being in supply during that period. And then I guess, to your point, you can see all that kind of clearing itself up by simply looking at the June IRI trends, which I think are reflective of the overall health of the business. So we have no concerns whatsoever about the brand health of the import portfolio or Corona, period. So we fully expect to be on our forecast for the year for the portfolio. And that's our import portfolio, right? Ballast Point, we're not even talking about that because the growth is so high that, what can you even say? It's the fastest-growing beer in the entire craft segment in the entire U.S. on what's getting to be a very big base, okay?

So in the first quarter, we benefited from pricing in general, which somewhat offset COGS increases, which were driven by increased depreciation. We did receive some benefits from FX. But probably the biggest driver in the quarter was the timing of marketing spend. And now I'm talking about operating margins, right? So we'll see that spend come back as we progress in the fiscal year, which will have a bit of a dampening effect on the margin. So we still expect flat margins roughly year-over-year, and we're just -- we're pleased with the progress we're making in terms of margin expansion and getting the Nava facility functioning at 20 million hectoliters. The other comment I want to make, Judy, relates to glass. So yes, we fired up the second furnace at Nava. We won't be producing glass out of that facility really until the end of July. And then even when that happens, the facility itself won't be producing at what we would expect are acceptable levels of utilization for many months. It takes a long time to get the furnaces functioning in a way that we'll be happy with. So I would say that the benefit from that furnace really won't show up until the back half of this year if it shows up this year at all."

So we continue to prioritize that as a key priority. And then as we've said in the past, we'll continue to look at and potentially make selective acquisitions of things like Meiomi, Prisoner as we go on. So I think that those kind of things are somewhat reflective of being tuck-in-type acquisitions of the things that we would look at, and I would say that, that strategy is working very well. And then I think to the -- your question about the magnitude, I think that goes back to my first point relative to maintaining our debt levels in that sort of 3x to 4x, okay? We will be, I'll say, guided in terms of magnitude by that priority. And then as I mentioned in my script, we continue to evaluate the Canadian IPO, right? But that's a disposition.

I mean, where we have gotten new distribution as we've moved it to the east, I think that it's resonating particularly well. I'm not sure that it's perceived with any geographic specificity as we bring it into new markets. And as it grows in new markets, I think that it's really more viewed as a really high-end, high-quality, award-winning brand. And it's all about sort of styles and flavors. And I think the thing that's kind of unique or somewhat unique about Ballast Point is that it does have a lot of different styles like Commodore stout or the Sculpin IPA. And that's got flavors, in essence, like the Grapefruit Sculpin or the new Pineapple Sculpin, which is really hot, or a new product, which we just intro-ed, called Barmy, which is a honey -- apricot- and honey-flavored pale ale. But this is very subtle stuff, right? It's not like it's flavored like a flavored alco -- a FAB, okay, like my father's root beer or Mike's or something. These are very subtle flavors that accentuate, okay, the sort of exotic hops that are used in the product and sort of bring out some of the qualities of those hops. And therefore, it's -- I'd say real beer -- and appeals to, I would say, real beer aficionados, which is one of the reasons why I think that it is able to command the premium pricing that it does command is because of the fact that it really is viewed by beer people, okay, as a super high-quality, award-winning product. A lot like wine in that regard, right? High-end wine. Think of its acceptance in that vein by real craft beer drinkers who know and follow what's really being held as super high-quality examples of that type of product. So it's much more like that, it's much more like high-end wine, is the way I would think about Ballast Point."

It's one of the top beer brands now in the entire country. And if you look at beer brands that are -- have full distribution, I mean, you're talking like 80%, 90%, okay, Modelo Especial has about 70% ACV. So it's got a pretty good distribution runway. And I think that the thing that you should realize is, in general, okay, it's distribution growth that drives depletion growth probably the most of anything. So a pretty big runway there. The good news is that -- probably the second most important thing, right, is velocity per point of distribution.

Across the business, we",1559,"Thank you, Patty, and good morning, and welcome to our discussion of Constellation's first quarter fiscal 2017 sales and earnings results. We are off to a great start to our new fiscal year with sales and earnings up double digits. Across the business, we're seeing the results of our efforts to drive consumer demand for premium products through best-in-class marketing and sales execution while improving margins through financial discipline and a focus on core premium products. This, combined with the successful integration of and growth from our recently acquired brands, provides a healthy foundation for achieving our fiscal 2017 objectives. 
Our beer business continues to deliver industry-leading results while expanding their operational footprint with planned capital investments in Mexico. During the quarter, the beer business generated depletion growth of almost 10% and was the #1 share gainer in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer business. Constellation's beer portfolio led volume gains amongst U.S. brewers, contributing almost 20% of category dollar growth during the quarter, as each brand in our Mexican beer portfolio grew across most channels and packages.
Corona Extra and Modelo Especial remained 2 of the hottest brands in the U.S. beer industry and held category-leading positions as the #3 and #2 players, respectively, among overall brand share gainers. These results are due in part to focused market execution as well as optimization of key marketing and advertising initiatives. We launched fresh, new Spanish and English language national television advertising for the Corona Extra brand in canned format, including the brand's first-ever boxing TV ad. New national TV advertising was also launched for Modelo Especial in English and Spanish and for the Modelo Especial Chelada in Spanish, both of which continue to have double-digit growth and are among the fastest-growing brands in the category.
Our new Pacifico 24-ounce canned format is the #1 new import so far in 2016, and we are supporting the brand by expanding targeted television advertising. Pacifico grew depletions more than 15% for the quarter.
And last but certainly not least, let's not forget about Ballast Point, which continues to be the fastest-growing major craft brand in the U.S., posting depletion growth of more than 60% in the first quarter. As you know, our plan for Ballast Point this year is to expand distribution and make their brand available in all 50 states. And to date, we now have distribution in more than 40 states and expect to complete our overall goal sometime before calendar year-end. This distribution push, along with successful new flavor and style launches, is expected to deliver the strong double-digit growth we are targeting for Ballast Point in fiscal 2017. 
It was recently announced that we plan to establish a Ballast Point brewery in Virginia. This will allow us to develop an East Coast presence to provide the best-quality, freshest craft beer to all of our customers.
I'd now like to take a minute to discuss recently published IRI and Nielsen consumer takeaway data for our beer business as there seems to be significant discussion and debate related to the growth trends for some of our brands. First, IRI channels represent about 50% of our overall beer business at retail and therefore provide only a partial picture of the brand and portfolio performance outside of the sales, shipment and depletion results we report every quarter. Within IRI channels, over the last quarter, we've seen significant variability from week to week. Much of this relates to year-over-year timing and selling day comparison issues for important holidays during the quarter, including Cinco and Memorial Day. We saw some impact from our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter recall of certain Corona Extra packages, which created temporary product shortages in select areas. We also experienced pockets of poor weather, especially in the Northeast, and we are cycling very strong Corona Extra can growth following last year's first quarter intro of the canned format for this brand. 
Despite these temporary headwinds, our recent brand health assessment for Corona Extra indicates a consistent or increased drinking on key brand health scores nationally since fiscal 2016. While consumer takeaway is a standard measurement, depletions represent our entire business or an even more comprehensive indicator of growth and health. I'm very proud of our nearly double-digit beer depletion growth trend for the first quarter, given some of the factors I just mentioned. And preliminary beer depletion results for the month of June are progressing in line with our forecast. We anticipate similar timing issues around the upcoming key holidays in the second quarter related to the July 4 and Labor Day weekends. 
Operationally, during the quarter, we completed a significant expansion milestone at Nava by doubling the size of the brewery that we acquired and bringing annual production capacity to 20 million hectoliters. All support areas are in place for this added capacity, including packaging, utilities, warehouse and rail infrastructure. As many of you are aware, the expansion of the Nava Brewery to 25 million hectoliters is our next critical capacity milestone, and I'm pleased to report that this work is proceeding as scheduled.
In addition, we have officially broken ground at Mexicali. And although this project is in the early phase, it is also progressing as planned. 
Finally, we recently fired up our second furnace at our Nava glass plant and expect that it will be producing glass shortly. As a reminder, it takes several months for a new furnace to ramp up in order to produce optimal capacity.
And now I would like to focus on the operational results for our wine and spirits business. During the quarter, our wine and spirits business grew earnings and expanded margins while successfully integrating and growing our newly acquired premium wine brands, Meiomi and The Prisoner, which posted IRI dollar growth of about 90% and 30%, respectively. 
Since the acquisition of The Prisoner, Constellation has gained 2 share points in the IRI luxury plus segment, extending the lead in our #1 luxury plus position. Constellation is now ranked #3 in super-luxury wine at the greater-than-$25 retail price point. The U.S. wine business posted strong sales growth and gained IRI dollar share, driven by our core Focus Brands, where we're building momentum across multiple price segments.
Let me provide a few examples. In the IRI $20-plus luxury and super-luxury price segments combined, Meiomi is not only the largest pinot noir, but also the largest dollar share gainer for the entire quarter. Kim Crawford is the #1 Sauvignon Blanc in the IRI super-premium segment and posted dollar sales growth of more than 20% during the quarter. Clos du Bois is the #1 chardonnay in the IRI premium segment. And Black Box is the leader in the fast-growing premium box segment.
In aggregate, our Focus Brands grew depletions at 12% for the quarter. Our innovation platform is also gaining traction, thanks to new margin-enhancing offerings like the Robert Mondavi Private Selection, Bourbon Barrel-Aged Cabernet, SVEDKA Cucumber Lime, Ruffino Sparkling Rosé and Ravage Cabernet Sauvignon.
The Canadian business delivered a solid quarter, posting mid-single-digit net sales growth while continuing to gain market share across both the import and domestic wine segments. Overall, our first quarter wine and spirits results are a testament to our ability to achieve our goal of growing profits ahead of sales and improving margins.
So what are the key enablers? We are reaping the benefits of our targeted investments for a subset of our Focus Brands in order to drive key brands that have scale, higher margin and greater growth potential. We remain committed to mix and margin-accretive innovation and new product development and have several new products in the hopper, a few of which I just mentioned. We continue to optimize COGS through global blend management initiatives, productivity improvements and lower grape costs. We are capitalizing on the market-leading growth of our margin-enhancing wine acquisitions, Meiomi and The Prisoner. And we have recently made some leadership changes within wine and spirits to enable a stronger, more competitive business.
Now before I turn the call over to David, I would like to touch on 2 more high-level topics of interest for our business. The first is related to the exploration of a possible IPO of our Canadian business discussed last quarter. Our evaluation of this strategic option continues, and we plan to provide you with an update as soon as possible. Since this evaluation is ongoing, there is not much else to add at this time. The second is the recent referendum in favor of the U.K. exiting the European Union. As a reminder, Constellation is primarily a U.S. business. Our sales outside the U.S. represent about 10% of our total consolidated sales and are primarily related to our Canada business. As such, our exposure to European markets, in particular, is limited, and a strong dollar generally benefits us financially.
In closing, our first quarter results have set the stage for fiscal 2017. We are off to a very positive start for the year, gaining market share across our beer and wine businesses. We have been working diligently to build a solid and sustainable foundation of operational excellence, financial strength and innovation. And we expect to continue to execute on these areas throughout the remainder of the year.
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David, who will review our first quarter financial results."
258589,345278312,1003908,"Constellation Brands Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Jun 30, 2016",2016-06-30,"Earnings Calls","Constellation Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. On the last call, we provided guidance which represented an impressive mid-teens EPS growth. I'm happy to report that we're steadily executing against our plan. Comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came",923,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. On the last call, we provided guidance which represented an impressive mid-teens EPS growth. I'm happy to report that we're steadily executing against our plan. Comparable basis diluted EPS for the quarter came in at $1.54, up 22%, putting us on a path to achieve our full year comparable basis diluted EPS goal of $6.05 to $6.35 per share.
Let's look at Q1 fiscal '17 performance in more detail, where I'll generally focus on comparable basis financial results. Organic beer net sales increased 15%, primarily due to organic volume growth of 12% and favorable pricing. Beer depletion growth for the quarter came in at almost 10%. This includes Ballast Point depletions for the quarter and in the corresponding period last year. Excluding Ballast Point, depletions for our Mexican portfolio grew 9%. 
Beer shipment volume for the first quarter generally runs ahead of depletion volume as distributors build inventory for the summer selling season. This year, we also benefited from a shift in shipment volume from Q4 fiscal '16 into Q1 fiscal '17 related to the beer recall we discussed last quarter. Distributor inventory days at the end of Q1 fiscal '17 were fairly level with the prior year quarter. 
Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 3%. This primarily reflects volume growth and favorable mix for the segment, driven by solid financial results for the organic U.S. wine business in the quarter. 
Beer operating margin increased 80 basis points to 35.6%. This reflects benefits from pricing, foreign currency and timing of marketing spend for our Mexican portfolio. As expected, these positive factors were partially offset by higher COGS, including increased depreciation as additional capacity came online; SG&A investments; and the consolidation of Ballast Point. If you exclude the marketing timing benefit, beer operating margin for the quarter would have been flattish to up slightly.
I'd also like to note we have reduced the level of product we receive under the Interim Supply Agreement with ABI as Nava has reached the 20 million hectoliter capacity milestone. Wine and spirits operating margin improved 160 basis points to 23.3%. The increase was primarily related to the benefit from the Meiomi acquisition. 
Interest expense for the quarter increased 9%, primarily due to higher average borrowings. When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt totaled $8.1 billion, an increase of $143 million since the end of fiscal '16. This increase primarily reflects funding for The Prisoner acquisition, which closed at the end of April, partially offset by our free cash flow generation. 
Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.7x at the end of Q1 fiscal '17 versus 3.8x at the end of fiscal '16. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q1 does not yet reflect a full year EBITDA benefit from the Ballast Point, Meiomi and Prisoner acquisitions. 
Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 31.6%, which is essentially even with Q1 of last year. We anticipate that our Q2 fiscal '17 effective tax rate will be similar to the Q1 rate. However, we continue to expect our full year fiscal '17 effective tax rate to approximate 29%.
Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For Q1, we generated $177 million of free cash flow compared to $76 million for Q1 last year. Operating cash flow totaled $346 million, up 68%. This increase was primarily driven by our earnings growth. 
CapEx for the quarter was $169 million compared to $130 million for Q1 last year. While CapEx was up for the quarter, we still have significant spending plan for the balance of the year as our full year CapEx guidance of $1.25 billion to $1.35 billion remains unchanged. As a reminder, this guidance includes approximately $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion related to our beer business operational expansion projects in Mexico. We continue to expect fiscal '17 free cash flow to be in the range of $250 million to $350 million. This reflects operating cash flow in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion and the CapEx spend that I just outlined.
Moving to our full year fiscal '17 P&L outlook. We continue to project our comparable basis EPS to be in the range of $6.05 to $6.35. Our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. The beer business continues to target net sales and operating income growth in the range of 14% to 17%. We also continue to expect organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the 10% to 13% range. This includes 1% to 2% of anticipated pricing benefit for our Mexican portfolio. 
For the wine and spirits business, we continue to expect net sales growth in the mid-single-digit range and operating income growth in the mid- to high single-digit range. In addition, we continue to project organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range, with operating income growth targeted ahead of sales growth as we are forecasting some mix benefits.
In closing, we're off to a great start to the year and on track to achieve our financial performance goals for fiscal '17. While we still have much to accomplish with our Mexican brewing operations, we're excited that we achieved a critical milestone by reaching the 20 million hectoliter capacity mark at Nava.
With that, Rob and I are happy to take your questions."

I think, actually, the category, as you mentioned, has accelerated a bit lately, and therefore, I would say that it's very robust. I would say that trading up and premiumization in the category is probably stronger than ever, okay, and things have really kind of shifted. Maybe 2 or 3 years ago, we would have been talking about the $8 to $10 or $12 segment really being the hottest segment in the industry, but I would say that, that shifted up to even the $15 and $20 segments. Hence, our interest in brands like Meiomi and Prisoner in that segment because I think we really see the future continuing to favor premiumization and trading up even into these more expensive categories. And then as it relates to our own business, we're constantly working on positioning our -- our portfolio, okay, to take advantage of those trends. And I think that we have very successfully done that and have great brands in all of these hot price segments and categories. And it's not just price segments, right? It's categories, a perfect example being pinot noir, okay? We're a leader in pinot noir today. And pinot noir is just an extremely hot varietal. And I would say that the good news there is that -- I would say we expect it to continue to be a hot varietal for well into the future in that it is not a trendy kind of a thing that will be fleeting and that, of course, pinot noir is one of the noble varieties and has always been highly sought after. And we -- and as I said, we've got the hottest brands. Red blends continue to be hot. As you know, we've got hot brands in the red blend category. I mean, Prisoner, I mean, is a perfect example of that, albeit a newly acquired brand, but you only have to go and sort of see what people are drinking in any major metropolitan area or talk to people and Prisoner is the hottest brand in its price point and has taken advantage of that as well. Again, I don't think that's particularly trendy in that it's gotten fantastic scores and is considered to be, let me put it this way, a real fine wine. So that's basically the answer to your question, Tim."

I mean, that said, our beer portfolio grew a little bit shy of 10%, which is an outstanding result on a relative or comparative basis. Yes, there were a few things that affected our business, which I talked about. The recall affected it, for sure. Hence, we would have done better in the first quarter had that not been the case. The can overlap, i.e., overlapping the intro, was a factor. There was definitely some promo activity in first quarter last year, which was not duplicated this year, again due to some packs not being in supply during that period. And then I guess, to your point, you can see all that kind of clearing itself up by simply looking at the June IRI trends, which I think are reflective of the overall health of the business. So we have no concerns whatsoever about the brand health of the import portfolio or Corona, period. So we fully expect to be on our forecast for the year for the portfolio. And that's our import portfolio, right? Ballast Point, we're not even talking about that because the growth is so high that, what can you even say? It's the fastest-growing beer in the entire craft segment in the entire U.S. on what's getting to be a very big base, okay?

So we still expect flat margins roughly year-over-year, and we're just -- we're pleased with the progress we're making in terms of margin expansion and getting the Nava facility functioning at 20 million hectoliters. The other comment I want to make, Judy, relates to glass. So yes, we fired up the second furnace at Nava. We won't be producing glass out of that facility really until the end of July. And then even when that happens, the facility itself won't be producing at what we would expect are acceptable levels of utilization for many months. It takes a long time to get the furnaces functioning in a way that we'll be happy with. So I would say that the benefit from that furnace really won't show up until the back half of this year if it shows up this year at all."

They sort of remained #1 at keeping our debt levels in that sort of mid-3 to 4 range, where we actually are at the current time. Returning dollars to shareholders continues to be a big and important focus for us. As you know, we did increase our annual dividend at the end of the year, and we have made some stock repurchases. So we continue to prioritize that as a key priority. And then as we've said in the past, we'll continue to look at and potentially make selective acquisitions of things like Meiomi, Prisoner as we go on. So I think that those kind of things are somewhat reflective of being tuck-in-type acquisitions of the things that we would look at, and I would say that, that strategy is working very well. And then I think to the -- your question about the magnitude, I think that goes back to my first point relative to maintaining our debt levels in that sort of 3x to 4x, okay? We will be, I'll say, guided in terms of magnitude by that priority. And then as I mentioned in my script, we continue to evaluate the Canadian IPO, right? But that's a disposition. So if we were to complete that, that will actually bring in cash, right? So we're being, I would say, pretty judicious in terms of how we're managing the whole capital allocation process and our priorities. So I think that we've got -- we've struck a really good balance there. Let me put it that way."

I mean, where we have gotten new distribution as we've moved it to the east, I think that it's resonating particularly well. I'm not sure that it's perceived with any geographic specificity as we bring it into new markets. And as it grows in new markets, I think that it's really more viewed as a really high-end, high-quality, award-winning brand. And it's all about sort of styles and flavors. And I think the thing that's kind of unique or somewhat unique about Ballast Point is that it does have a lot of different styles like Commodore stout or the Sculpin IPA. And that's got flavors, in essence, like the Grapefruit Sculpin or the new Pineapple Sculpin, which is really hot, or a new product, which we just intro-ed, called Barmy, which is a honey -- apricot- and honey-flavored pale ale. But this is very subtle stuff, right? It's not like it's flavored like a flavored alco -- a FAB, okay, like my father's root beer or Mike's or something. These are very subtle flavors that accentuate, okay, the sort of exotic hops that are used in the product and sort of bring out some of the qualities of those hops. And therefore, it's -- I'd say real beer -- and appeals to, I would say, real beer aficionados, which is one of the reasons why I think that it is able to command the premium pricing that it does command is because of the fact that it really is viewed by beer people, okay, as a super high-quality, award-winning product. A lot like wine in that regard, right? High-end wine. Think of its acceptance in that vein by real craft beer drinkers who know and follow what's really being held as super high-quality examples of that type of product.

It's one of the top beer brands now in the entire country. And if you look at beer brands that are -- have full distribution, I mean, you're talking like 80%, 90%, okay, Modelo Especial has about 70% ACV. So it's got a pretty good distribution runway. And I think that the thing that you should realize is, in general, okay, it's distribution growth that drives depletion growth probably the most of anything. So a pretty big runway there. The good news is that -- probably the second most important thing, right, is velocity per point of distribution. And if you look at our portfolio in general, whether it's wine, beer, spirits, Modelo Especial, our fast-growing brands are achieving their growth through both velocity growth as well as distribution growth."

Before I begin a review of this quarter, I'd like to focus your attention on the press release issued earlier today reporting that we have an agreement to purchase Utah-based High West Distillery for approximately $160 million. Now this acquisition includes a portfolio of award-winning, high-end American straight whiskeys and other spirit brands at the greater than $30 retail price point. With the addition of High West to our portfolio, we are entering the profitable, high-end craft whiskey market segment. High West sales approximately 70,000 cases annually and has experienced double-digit volume growth for each of the last 3 years. The portfolio includes 4 core products: American Bourbon, Double [ph], rye and High West Whiskey Camp Fire. High West will be an excellent addition to our spirits portfolio as we expect it to bolster our position in the dynamic and growing spirits category. 
Now let's turn to our discussion of our quarterly results, which reflect excellent performance across our businesses, especially our beer business, which is significantly outperforming the U.S. beer market and our own expectations. As a matter of fact, during the quarter, Constellation beers contributed 60% of the total U.S. beer industry IRI dollar growth, driven by the excellent performance of our top brands, and we remain the #1, #1 share gainer in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, with double-digit depletion growth of almost 14% for the second quarter. 
These results were driven by excellent execution by the beer team during the peak summer selling season. Our ""120 Days of Summer"" marketing campaign drove marketing share gains during the fourth of July and continued throughout the heart of the summer and into the Labor Day holiday. This performance was led by Corona Extra and Modelo Especial, both of which held category-leading positions as the #3 and the #2 overall brand share gainers, driven by continued distribution and velocity gains for increased marketing investments and consumer demand. 
Corona Extra continued the air TV campaigns in both national English and Spanish language TV while making investments in boxing with the launch of limited-edition boxing bottles at the end of August. 
In addition, Corona Extra recently became an official partner of the Los Angeles Rams, as the exclusive in beer sponsor and official cervesa of the team and kicked off the NFL preseason with in-stadium and retail execution end market. 
During the quarter, we introduced Casa Modelo, a new master brand and portfolio approach for the Modelo family of brands, including Especial, Negra and Chelada. Casa Modelo reestablishes Modelo as an iconic Mexican brewer and allows for more effective gross promotion and awareness, building for each Modelo brand, setting the stage for enhanced product innovation and product line extensions. 
This new strategy leverages the momentum of Modelo Especial, the fastest-growing major beer in America and the #2 imported beer in the U.S., and directly links it to the leadership of its sister, Modelo brand, Negra and Chelada. Negra, which has been renamed Modelo Negra, is the #1 dark Mexican beer, while Modelo Chelada owns nearly 25% share of the Chelada market. 
With its entire portfolio under 1 roof, consumers will begin to see a new thought advertising campaign, unified packaging, including a fully redesigned look for Modelo Negra, and a new point-of-sale retail and inspired by models heritage, tradition and high-quality standard. 
During the second quarter, Casa Modelo continued TV advertising via both national, Spanish-language TV ad national general market TV for Modelo Especial, including a spot supporting Modelo Chelada. 
I'd also like to highlight the Pacifico brand, which launched TV advertising across 11 Western states, a significant expansion of this type of marketing activity. In addition, the recently launched 24 ounce singleserve can continues to gain traction as the #1 new item nationally and IRI channels. Our Pacifico marketing investments are obviously paying off as this brand grew depletions more than 20% for the quarter. 
And let's not forget about Ballast Point, which continues to be the fastest-growing major craft brand in the U.S. and achieved solid high double-digit depletion growth during the quarter. We continue to expand distribution of Ballast Point brand throughout the U.S. and recently began the buildout of a new Ballast Point East Coast brewery in Virginia. 
Operationally, during the quarter, our recently expanded Nava Brewery and our supply chain performed well in delivering product supply to support our sales growth during our pre peak sales period. As you are aware, we of transitioning directly from a recently completed 20-million-hectoliter Nava expansion to our next critical capacity milestone of 25 million hectoliters. This project is progressing extremely well. 
Last quarter, I mentioned that we have fired up our second glass furnace at the Nava glass plant. I'm proud to report that in less than 90 days we are producing and packaging quality glass from the furnace at an improved efficiency rate. 
And finally, construction at our new brewery in Mexicali is peaking up momentum, including an infrastructure investment to support future capacity expansions. Overall, the strong results of the beer business achieved in the second quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to our EPS guidance for fiscal 2017. 
We are now targeting EBIT growth for the beer business in the high teens range, which is expected to drive an operating margin of approximately 35% to 36% for the segment in fiscal 2017 versus our previous margin estimate of about 35%. 
And now I would like to discuss the results for our wine and spirits business. During the quarter, our wine and spirits business grew earnings and expanded margins while continuing to drive share gains for our recently acquired premium wine brands, Meiomi and The Prisoner, which posted IRI growth of about 70% and 35%, respectively. 
These premium margin accretive wine acquisitions have been excellent additions to our portfolio. As a matter of fact, at current growth rates, we are on track for Meiomi to achieve the 1 million case mark this year. And the Wine Spectator recently awarded the 2014 Prisoner a 91-point score, which marks the fifth consecutive vintage that The Prisoner has scored 90 plus points. 
Our higher-margin Focus Brands had an outstanding quarter, posting depletion growth of 9%, driven by Meiomi and Kim Crawford, Black [ph], Prisoner, Clos du Bois, The Dreaming Tree and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. Several of these brands were also recognized as blue-chip brands by Impact [ph] as they met the criteria for this award in terms of profitability and by posting several consecutive years of volume growth. 
As you can see, we are reaping the benefits of our investments in our Focus Brands, which continue to have excellent growth potential and represent the majority of the revenue and profitability for our wine and spirits business. During the quarter, our innovation team rolled out new margin enhancing offerings like Cooper and Thief, a bourbon barrel-aged [ph] at the superluxury price point as well as the Kelly Collection priced in the superpremium price segment. 
We are also gaining traction with Robert Mondavi Private Selection, bourbon barrel aged [ph] and ravage [ph], both of which are achieving their growth so for this year. 
As we head into the key holiday season selling for wine and spirits business, we will be executing programming designed to ensure that we continue to drive growth, especially for our Focus Brands. As is typical at this point of this year, I would like to provide an update relative to the California grape harvest, which is currently more than 60% complete and expected to be finished by early November. 
The current California industry estimate is for our total harvest yield of approximately 4 million tons versus 3.7 million tons last year. The craft is up this year versus last, which is needed to replace inventory levels. The quality looks good to be fantastic with excellent color and flavors. 
From a pricing perspective, we continue to expect great pricing to increase slightly versus last year, depending on the variety, location and demand. So in closing, we are at the halfway point of the year, and I am extremely pleased with our impressive results. Our beer business continues to deliver industry-leading results while our wine business is gaining share and is on track to meet its goals for the year, and I am pleased to welcome High West to our family of brands, and we continue to progress as planned with our brewery and glass plant expansions in Mexico. 
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David, who will review our second quarter financial results."

As highlighted by Rob, we're pleased with our impressive results for Q2 and first half of fiscal '17.

As highlighted by Rob, we're pleased with our impressive results for Q2 and first half of fiscal '17. Strong execution and smart investments continue to fuel our growth and solidify our leadership position in total beverage alcohol. 
This is demonstrated by the 17% comparable basis diluted EPS growth we generated during the first half of fiscal '17. As a result of this performance, we are increasing our full year comparable basis diluted EPS target to a range of $6.30 to $6.45 versus our previous guidance of $6.05 to $6.35. 
Looking at our Q2 fiscal '17 performance in more detail, where I will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. You can see organic beer net sales increased 15%, primarily due to volume growth of 13% and favorable pricing. 
Beer depletion growth for the quarter came in at 14%. Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 8%. This primarily reflects 6% volume growth and favorable mix. 
Our U.S. depletions grew a little more than 3% in Q2. Our U.S. shipment volume outpaced depletions during the first half of fiscal '17. This is mostly timing related as we expect U.S. shipment volume to generally align with depletion volume for the year. 
As a result, we expect wine and spirits net sales and EBIT growth in the second half of the year to be lower than the first half, with Q3 net sales expected to be flattish to down slightly and EBIT down further due to anticipated marketing and SG&A investment during the key holiday selling period. 
Beer operating margin increased 200 basis points to 36.9%. This reflects benefits from pricing, volume, freight and foreign currency. These positive factors were partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense, driven by our capacity expansion activities. 
Wine and spirits operating margin improved 120 basis points to 25.8%. The increase was primarily related to favorable volume, COGS and mix and benefit from the addition of the Meiomi and Prisoner wine brands, partially offset by higher investment in SG&A and marketing. 
Interest expense for the quarter increased $17 million primarily due to higher average borrowings. Additionally, during Q2, we recorded an adjustment on our balance sheet related to a prior year period for the conversion of $132 million from equity interest into debt for the Nava glass plant JV. As a result, we recognized $7 million of interest expense associated with this debt during Q2. This was offset by an increase in the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest line of our income statement. 
At the end of Q2, this debt totaled $159 million with an average interest rate of 5.7%. I would also like to note that at the end of August, we redeemed our $700 million 7.25% senior notes that were coming due in September of 2016. This was primarily funded with cash. 
When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt at the end of Q2 totaled $7.9 billion, a decrease of $146 million since the end of fiscal '16. Our net debt-to-comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.4x at the end of Q2 versus 3.8x at the end of fiscal '16. 
Our leverage ratio at the end of Q2 does not yet reflect a full year EBITDA benefit from the Ballast Point and Prisoner acquisitions. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 31.8% versus 24.6% for Q2 last year. 
Last year's rate reflected the favorable outcome of various tax items that were effectively settled in connection with IRS examinations. We continue to expect our full year fiscal '17 effective tax rate to approximate 29%. 
Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For first half of fiscal '17, we generated $676 million of free cash flow compared to $508 million for the same period last year. 
Operating cash flow was above the $1 billion mark, up 30%, driven by our earnings growth. CapEx for the first half of the year was $369 million compared to $295 million for the prior year period. While our CapEx is up versus last year, it's tracking below our original plan. This primarily reflects some shift in the timing of Nava Brewery capital payments into next year. 
Primarily as result of this activity, we've lowered full year CapEx guidance by $125 million to a range of $1.125 billion to $1.225 billion. The lower CapEx is driving an increase in our fiscal '17 free cash flow guidance to a range of $375 million to $475 million. 
Moving to our full year fiscal '17 P&L outlook. I shared earlier that we now expect our comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.30 to $6.45. This represents mid- to high teen growth versus last year. The increase is being driven by the strong performance of the beer business, which is now targeting net sales growth in the range of 16% to 17% with organic net sales expected to be in the 12% to 13% range. These sales targets represent the high end of our previous guidance ranges and includes 1% to 2% of anticipated pricing benefit for our Mexican portfolio. 
Operating income growth for the beer business is now expected to be in the high teens. This new guidance now targets our beer operating margins to be in the 35% to 36% range. The improvement versus our previous guidance is primarily being driven by lower depreciation than we originally anticipated in some additional foreign currency favorability versus our original plan. We are now estimating beer segment depreciation and amortization to be closer to $125 million for fiscal '17, which is approximately $15 million lower than our original estimate. 
For the wine and spirits business, we continue to expect net sales growth in the mid-single-digit range and operating income growth in the mid- to high single-digit range. In addition, we continued to project organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range. 
Rob provided highlights of the High West acquisition, and I would just add that from a financial perspective, High West generates approximately $25 million in annual sales, and we expect minimal financial impact from the transaction for fiscal '17. 
I would also note before closing that our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. 
In closing, our results for the first half of fiscal '17 have put us on track to achieve another year of strong growth and financial performance and drive growth for the overall total beverage alcohol category. 
Our focus on strong execution in the marketplace and making investments to support our business positions as to continue to propel future growth. We expect the addition of the High West Distillery and its portfolio of award-winning, high-end craft whiskeys will provide us an excellent opportunity to strengthen our spirits platform with fast-growing, consumer favorite products and an exciting category. 
With that, Rob and I are happy to take your questions."

The on-premise I think continues to be sort of the in the down-ish, slightly down-ish side. For us, our on-premise business is very strong. So we're clearly gaining share in on-premise. So while the channel is not performing particularly well, we're extremely pleased with our performance in the on-premise. And then to your second question, Nik, there are definitely white space that we think is very good white space that we don't anticipate in. You mentioned, for instance, the SMB category, that's a very good category in terms of its premium positioning, margins and growth. So that's clearly a subcategory that we'll be looking at in terms of developing our portfolio for the future. And then secondly, there's other areas of white space I think, a good example of our filling white space in our portfolio is our High West acquisition, right. So that has put us in the craft brown spirits, right, American straight whiskey category, and that's a fantastic category in terms of growth and margins, which we see no abatement in that trend in any time in the near future. So we've got a great entrance there and we'll be continuing to look at other areas of white space that would be available to us and makes sense in terms of our portfolio and from a synergy perspective, which really anything in beverage alcohol really fits that bill because obviously, we have strong sales organizations across wine, beer and spirits and extremely strong distribution networks in wine and spirits and beer. So we're really in a position to attack anything anything that meets our criteria and in the wine and spirits and beer business, which is pretty simple, right?

I think Casa Noble is another great example, right? Fastest-growing luxury tequila -- of any luxury tequila growing in the IRI at 45%. Basically, what we're able to do with these brands and we will be able to do with High West is use our sales organization, our expertise and execution in our extremely strong distribution network to take a brand like High West and really grow it into something material in the category that it participates in. So I think that we'll be very successful in scaling that brand. And the brand already has fantastic momentum and it already is of significant size at 70,000 cases. So you apply this kind of high double-digit growth rates and for the next several years, and you can definitely see this being scaled into a material brand, especially when you think about the price point and the high margins that are associated with the brand in the category.

And I am quite confident that High West will be 1 of those brands as are the other brands in our spirits portfolio. So just like we bought SVEDKA years ago and have grown that to be the second-largest vodka in the entire in the States and the #1 import brand and fundamentally changed the vodka category with that brand. I think that our other spirits additions have a lot of great potential similar to that.

So we are overinvesting and when I say overinvestment, I mean we're investing more than we have traditionally specifically in marketing of our wines and spirits brands. And so what you're seeing is advertising campaigns that we've initiated to drive brands like Kim Crawford. We've got tests going on in various states like Texas, for instance, to really heavy-consumer type advertising for our brand like Kim Crawford to see how that drives the brand, which, by the way, is driving the brand fantastically. And I think that we're proving that our investments in media advertising on wine, on brands like Kim Crawford and Woodbridge is another one that we've really heavy-ed up our advertising on, that these are payback rapid rate, meaning a rate greater than what you traditionally seek in consumer products, which is very similar to beer brands in particular Corona and Modelo Especial, where we see sort of the payback rates on our advertising activities at a much faster rate than what would typically be seen in consumer products. So we're both testing what we can do through marketing, and we're increasing marketing where we know that it already works. So hopefully that specific marketing."

We're seeing a definitive shift up in that regard and now you're sort of seeing this $15 to $25 segment really coming on strong as well as segments above that. So this is what's driving the growth of brands like Meiomi, which are about $20 a bottle or even Prisoner closer to $40 a bottle as this premiumization trend, which we think is going to continue unabated in certainly the midterm.

And then on the High West side, as I said, we've taken full ownership of that, and we will be in essence integrating that into our wine and spirits platform.

And the proposition is all about the founders of the company going into the business before bourbon and [ph] had really reached the level craft bourbon and wry in particular reached a level of popularity that it has to the. They took a view that much like the Scotch whiskey category the sort of the combination of distilling and aging their own whiskey and then combining that with blending could create a product that was really superior so that they did create those products. And I'll say through the expertise of master blenders that they brought in created a product that really appeals to the luxury American straight whiskey and Bourbon and [ph] consumer and was able therefore to take advantage of the whole sort of craft trend in that area. So we think it's a relatively unique proposition and that certainly is reflecting itself in the way that the company has been able to grow the brand. And we think that we're going to be able to really take that platform and accelerate that. Distribution agreements we, have no interest in whatsoever. Okay? #1, you don't own the brand. Number two, distribution agreements are short term, no sign up and give you distribution rights for right. Number three, distribution margins are small relative to the kind of margins that we at Constellation generate through our owned brand portfolio and certainly the type of margins that we're talking about on luxury spirits. So we don't have a really any interest at all in distribution, low margin, short-term distribution agreements that would utilize probably one of our most valuable assets, which is our sales and marketing organization. So we don't see that -- we don't see distribution arrangement as an add-on for the future. As I said, way we, we to low margin and no brand equity related to there too."

So that's a big part of what we're doing, and I think that the trend that you're alluding to is definitely occurring. And I think that, that's bodes really well for us in a couple of areas. Craft, even though you're going to see some shakeout there, I think that what will also occur there simultaneously is that the bigger, stronger, faster growing brands like Ballast Point will and should be given more space, more SKUs sort of for the obvious reasons because it's moving and it's highly, highly profitable, and I think that you can say the same thing about imports because it's going to become obvious to the retailer that that's the best way to maximize, as I say, their velocity and profitability for the unit space that they're devoting to the category.

And also was our sales president for our wine and spirits business as well for many years. And he brings a level of knowledge and expertise in growing brands and in wholesale and distributor relations and sales execution that far exceeds the previous management team had. And then if you look at the sales side of the business, we replaced the sales guy with the #2 sales guy that was heading California already at Ballast Point, and California were presented a very large proportion of the business. And this is the guy that was driving that portion of the business. And then the other changes aren't going to have any real commercial effect on the business. So I would say if anything, we're really excited about the changes that have been made and we think that it's going to lead to even stronger results on Ballast Point as it grows into a much larger business and needs a degree of professionalism that I don't think the old management team could bring. And then as it relates to the product itself, we have the same production team, the same expertise in the making of what really is the highest quality and most award-winning craft beer brand of any size in the country. And they're just -- they're going about their business and doing what they have done in the past and they are probably doing it better than they have ever done it before. So there's really a lot of really exciting stuff and sort of culturally, everybody is acutely aware of the type of culture that needs to be maintained and sort of that fast-moving craft type business, where it's important to continue to proliferate new products and new types that the consumer is really interested in that particular craft consumer.

Before I begin a review of the quarter, I'd like to focus your attention on the press release issued earlier today reporting that we have an agreement to purchase Utah-based High West Distillery for approximately $160 million. Now this acquisition includes a portfolio of award-winning, high-end American straight whiskeys and other spirit brands at the greater than $30 retail price point. With the addition of High West to our portfolio, we are entering the profitable, high-end craft whiskey market segment. High West sells approximately 70,000 cases annually and has experienced double-digit volume growth for each of the last 3 years. The portfolio includes 4 core products: American Prairie Bourbon, Double Rye!, Rendezvous Rye and High West Whiskey Campfire. High West will be an excellent addition to our spirits portfolio as we expect it to bolster our position in the dynamic and growing spirits category. 
Now let's turn to our discussion of our quarterly results, which reflect excellent performance across our businesses, especially our beer business, which is significantly outperforming the U.S. beer market and our own expectations. As a matter of fact, during the quarter, Constellation beers contributed 60% of the total U.S. beer industry IRI dollar growth, driven by the excellent performance of our top brands, and we remain the #1, #1 share gainer in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, with double-digit depletion growth of almost 14% for the second quarter. 
These results were driven by excellent execution by the beer team during the peak summer selling season. Our ""120 Days of Summer"" marketing campaign drove marketing share gains during the 4th of July and continued throughout the heart of the summer and into the Labor Day holiday. This performance was led by Corona Extra and Modelo Especial, both of which held category-leading positions as the #3 and the #2 overall brand share gainers, driven by continued distribution and velocity gains from increased marketing investments and consumer demand. 
Corona Extra continued to air TV campaigns in both national English and Spanish language TV while making investments in boxing with the launch of limited-edition boxing bottles at the end of August. 
In addition, Corona Extra recently became an official partner of the Los Angeles Rams, as the exclusive import beer sponsor and official Cerveza of the team and kicked off the NFL preseason with in-stadium and retail execution end market. 
During the quarter, we introduced Casa Modelo, a new master brand and portfolio approach for the Modelo family of brands, including Especial, Negra and Chelada. Casa Modelo reestablishes Modelo as an iconic Mexican brewer and allows for more effective cross promotion and awareness building for each Modelo brand, setting the stage for enhanced product innovation and product line extensions. 
This new strategy leverages the momentum of Modelo Especial, the fastest-growing major beer in America and the #2 imported beer in the U.S., and directly links it to the leadership of its sister, Modelo brand, Negra and Chelada. Negra, which has been renamed Modelo Negra, is the #1 dark Mexican beer, while Modelo Chelada owns nearly 25% share of the Chelada market. 
With its entire portfolio under one roof, consumers will begin to see a new thought advertising campaign, unified packaging, including a fully redesigned look for Modelo Negra, and a new point-of-sale at retail inspired by Modelo's heritage, tradition and high-quality standard. 
During the second quarter, Casa Modelo continued TV advertising via both national, Spanish language TV and national general market TV for Modelo Especial, including a spot supporting Modelo Chelada. 
I'd also like to highlight the Pacifico brand, which launched TV advertising across 11 Western states, a significant expansion of this type of marketing activity. In addition, the recently launched 24-ounce single-serve can continues to gain traction as the #1 new item nationally and IRI channels. Our Pacifico marketing investments are obviously paying off as this brand grew depletions more than 20% for the quarter. 
And let's not forget about Ballast Point, which continues to be the fastest-growing major craft brand in the U.S. and achieved solid high double-digit depletion growth during the quarter. We continued to expand distribution of Ballast Point brand throughout the U.S. and recently began the buildout of a new Ballast Point East Coast brewery in Virginia. 
Operationally, during the quarter, our recently expanded Nava Brewery and our supply chain performed well in delivering product supply to support our sales growth during our pre-peak sales period. As you are aware, we have been transitioning directly from our recently completed 20-million-hectoliter Nava expansion to our next critical capacity milestone of 25 million hectoliters. This project is progressing extremely well. 
Last quarter, I mentioned that we have fired up our second glass furnace at the Nava glass plant. I'm proud to report that in less than 90 days we are producing and packaging quality glass from the furnace at an improved efficiency rate. 
And finally, construction at our new brewery in Mexicali is picking up momentum, including an infrastructure investments to support future capacity expansions. Overall, the strong results of the beer business achieved in the second quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to our EPS guidance for fiscal 2017. 
We are now targeting EBIT growth for the beer business in the high teens range, which is expected to drive an operating margin of approximately 35% to 36% for the segment in fiscal 2017 versus our previous margin estimate of about 35%. 
And now I would like to discuss the results for our wine and spirits business. During the quarter, our wine and spirits business grew earnings and expanded margins while continuing to drive share gains for our recently acquired premium wine brands, Meiomi and The Prisoner, which posted IRI growth of about 70% and 35%, respectively. 
These premium margin accretive wine acquisitions have been excellent additions to our portfolio. As a matter of fact, at current growth rates, we are on track for Meiomi to achieve the 1 million case mark this year. And the Wine Spectator recently awarded the 2014 Prisoner a 91-point score, which marks the 5th consecutive vintage that The Prisoner has scored 90-plus points. 
Our higher-margin Focus Brands had an outstanding quarter, posting depletion growth of 9%, driven by Meiomi and Kim Crawford, Black Box, Prisoner, Clos du Bois, The Dreaming Tree and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. Several of these brands were also recognized as Blue Chip brands by Impact Databank as they met the criteria for this award in terms of profitability and by posting several consecutive years of volume growth. 
As you can see, we are reaping the benefits of our investments in our Focus Brands, which continued to have excellent growth potential and represent the majority of the revenue and profitability for our wine and spirits business. During the quarter, our innovation team rolled out new margin-enhancing offerings like Cooper & Thief, a bourbon-barrel aged red blend at the superluxury price point as well as the Kelly Collection priced in the superpremium price segment. 
We are also gaining traction with Robert Mondavi Private Selection, bourbon barrel-aged Cabernet and Ravage Cabernet, both of which are achieving their growth so for this year. 
As we head into the key holiday season selling simpler our wine and spirits business, we will be executing programming designed to ensure that we continue to drive growth, especially for our Focus Brands. As is typical at this point of this year, I would like to provide an update relative to the California grape harvest, which is currently more than 60% complete and expected to be finished by early November. 
The current California industry estimate is for our total harvest yield of approximately 4 million tons versus 3.7 million tons last year. The crop is up this year versus last, which is needed to replace inventory levels. The quality looks good to be fantastic with excellent color and flavors. 
From a pricing perspective, we continue to expect grain pricing to increase slightly versus last year, depending on the variety, location and demand. So in closing, we are at the halfway point of the year, and I am extremely pleased with our impressive results. Our beer business continues to deliver industry-leading results while our wine business is gaining share and is on track to meet its goals for the year, and I am pleased to welcome High West to our family of brands, and we continue to progress as planned with our brewery and glass plant expansions in Mexico. 
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David, who will review our second quarter financial results."

As highlighted by Rob, we're pleased with our impressive results for Q2 and first half of fiscal '17. Strong execution and smart investments continued to fuel our growth and solidify our leadership position in t",1178,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. As highlighted by Rob, we're pleased with our impressive results for Q2 and first half of fiscal '17. Strong execution and smart investments continued to fuel our growth and solidify our leadership position in total beverage alcohol. 
This is demonstrated by the 17% comparable basis diluted EPS growth we generated during the first half of fiscal '17. As a result of this performance, we are increasing our full year comparable basis diluted EPS target to a range of $6.30 to $6.45 versus our previous guidance of $6.05 to $6.35. 
Looking at our Q2 fiscal '17 performance in more detail, where I will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. You can see organic beer net sales increased 15%, primarily due to volume growth of 13% and favorable pricing. 
Beer depletion growth for the quarter came in at 14%. Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 8%. This primarily reflects 6% volume growth and favorable mix. 
Our U.S. depletions grew a little more than 3% in Q2. Our U.S. shipment volume outpaced depletions during the first half of fiscal '17. This is mostly timing related as we expect U.S. shipment volume to generally align with depletion volume for the year. 
As a result, we expect wine and spirits net sales and EBIT growth in the second half of the year to be lower than the first half, with Q3 net sales expected to be flattish to down slightly and EBIT down further due to anticipated marketing and SG&A investment during the key holiday selling period. 
Beer operating margin increased 200 basis points to 36.9%. This reflects benefits from pricing, volume, freight and foreign currency. These positive factors were partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense, driven by our capacity expansion activities. 
Wine and spirits operating margin improved 120 basis points to 25.8%. The increase was primarily related to favorable volume, COGS and mix and benefit from the addition of the Meiomi and Prisoner wine brands, partially offset by higher investment in SG&A and marketing. 
Interest expense for the quarter increased $17 [ph] million, primarily due to higher average borrowings. Additionally, during Q2, we recorded an adjustment on our balance sheet related to a prior year period for the conversion of $132 million from equity interest into debt for the Nava glass plant JV. As a result, we recognized $7 million of interest expense associated with this debt during Q2. This was offset by an increase in the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest line of our income statement. 
At the end of Q2, this debt totaled $159 million with an average interest rate of 5.7%. I would also like to note that at the end of August, we redeemed our $700 million 7.25% senior notes that were coming due in September of 2016. This was primarily funded with cash. 
When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt at the end of Q2 totaled $7.9 billion, a decrease of $146 million since the end of fiscal '16. Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.4x at the end of Q2 versus 3.8x at the end of fiscal '16. 
Our leverage ratio at the end of Q2 does not yet reflect a full year EBITDA benefit from the Ballast Point and Prisoner acquisitions. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 31.8% versus 24.6% for Q2 last year. 
Last year's rate reflected the favorable outcome of various tax items that were effectively settled in connection with IRS examinations. We continue to expect our full year fiscal '17 effective tax rate to approximate 29%. 
Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For first half of fiscal '17, we generated $676 million of free cash flow compared to $508 million for the same period last year. 
Operating cash flow was above the $1 billion mark, up 30%, driven by our earnings growth. CapEx for the first half of the year was $369 million compared to $295 million for the prior year period. While our CapEx is up versus last year, it's tracking below our original plan. This primarily reflects some shift in the timing of Nava brewery capital payments into next year. 
Primarily as a result of this activity, we've lowered full year CapEx guidance by $125 million to a range of $1.125 billion to $1.225 billion. The lower CapEx is driving an increase in our fiscal '17 free cash flow guidance to a range of $375 million to $475 million. 
Moving to our full year fiscal '17 P&L outlook. I shared earlier that we now expect our comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.30 to $6.45. This represents mid- to high teen growth versus last year. The increase is being driven by the strong performance of the beer business, which is now targeting net sales growth in the range of 16% to 17% with organic net sales expected to be in the 12% to 13% range. These sales targets represents the high end of our previous guidance ranges and includes 1% to 2% of anticipated pricing benefit for our Mexican portfolio. 
Operating income growth for the beer business is now expected to be in the high teens. This new guidance now targets our beer operating margins to be in the 35% to 36% range. The improvement versus our previous guidance is primarily being driven by lower depreciation than we originally anticipated in some additional foreign currency favorability versus our original plan. We are now estimating beer segment depreciation and amortization to be closer to $125 million for fiscal '17, which is approximately $15 million lower than our original estimate. 
For the wine and spirits business, we continue to expect net sales growth in the mid-single-digit range and operating income growth in the mid- to high single-digit range. In addition, we continue to project organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range. 
Rob provided highlights of the High West acquisition, and I would just add that from a financial perspective, High West generates approximately $25 million in annual sales, and we expect minimal financial impact from the transaction for fiscal '17. 
I would also note before closing that our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. 
In closing, our results for the first half of fiscal '17 have put us on track to achieve another year of strong growth and financial performance and drive growth for the overall total beverage alcohol category. 
Our focus on strong execution in the marketplace and making investments to support our business positions us to continue to propel future growth. We expect the addition of the High West Distillery and it's portfolio of award-winning, high-end craft whiskeys will provide us an excellent opportunity to strengthen our spirits platform with fast-growing, consumer favorite products and an exciting category. 
With that, Rob and I are happy to take your questions."

First of all, as it relates to the wine -- the on-premise, right, I would say that the condition of the on-premise remains fairly poor in that -- to the extent that it's measurable. The on-premise I think continues to be sort of on the down-ish, slightly down-ish side. For us, our on-premise business is very strong. So we're clearly gaining share in on-premise. So while the channel is not performing particularly well, we're extremely pleased with our performance in the on-premise. And then to your second question, Nik, there's definitely white space that we think is very good white space that we don't participate in. You mentioned, for instance, the SMB category, that's a very good category in terms of its premium positioning, margins and growth. So that's clearly a subcategory that we'll be looking at in terms of developing our portfolio for the future. And then secondly, there's other areas of white space I think, a good example of our filling white space in our portfolio is our High West acquisition, right. So that has put us in the craft brown spirits, right, American straight whiskey category, and that's a fantastic category in terms of growth and margins, which we see no abatement in that trend in any time in the near future. So we've got a great entrant there and we'll be continuing to look at other areas of white space that would be available to us and makes sense in terms of our portfolio and from a synergy perspective, which really anything in beverage alcohol really fits that bill because obviously, we have strong sales organizations across wine, beer and spirits and extremely strong distribution networks in wine and spirits and beer. So we're really in a position to attack anything that meets our criteria in the wine and spirits and beer business, which is pretty simple, right? High growth and high margin are really the 2 things that are critical to us."

I think Casa Noble is another great example, right? Fastest-growing luxury tequila -- of any luxury tequila growing in IRI at 45%. Basically, what we're able to do with these brands and we will be able to do with High West is use our sales organization, our expertise and execution in our extremely strong distribution network to take a brand like High West and really grow it into something material in the category that it participates in. So I think that we'll be very successful in scaling that brand. And the brand already has fantastic momentum and it already is of significant size at 70,000 cases. So you apply these kind of high double-digit growth rates and for the next several years, and you can definitely see this being scaled into a material brand, especially when you think about the price point and the high margins that are associated with the brand in the category.

The whole point of sort of our selection process as we make these sort of smaller tuck-in acquisitions is to buy brands that stand on their own and have the momentum to be of a scale to contribute material -- materially to Constellation's growth and margins. And I am quite confident that High West will be one of those brands as are the other brands in our spirits portfolio. So just like we bought SVEDKA years ago and have grown that to be the second-largest vodka in the entire United States and the #1 import brand and fundamentally changed the vodka category with that brand. I think that our other spirits additions have a lot of great potential similar to that.

So we're overinvesting and when I say overinvesting, I mean, we're investing more than we have traditionally specifically in marketing of our wines and spirits brands. And so what you're seeing is advertising campaigns that we've initiated to drive brands like Kim Crawford. We've got tests going on in various states like Texas, for instance, to a really heavy-consumer weight-type advertising for our brand like Kim Crawford to see how that drives the brand, which, by the way, is driving the brand fantastically. And I think that we're proving that our investments in media advertising on wine, on brands like Kim Crawford and Woodbridge is another one that we've really heavy-ed up our advertising on, that these are paying back at a rapid rate, meaning a rate greater than what you traditionally seek in consumer products, which is very similar to our beer brands in particular Corona and Modelo Especial, where we see sort of the payback rates on our advertising activities at a much faster rate than what would typically be seen in consumer products. So we're both testing what we can do through marketing, and we're increasing marketing where we know that it already works. So hopefully that's specific as far as market..."

I think, we're seeing a real shift, whereas, 5 years ago, we were sort of talking about what they used to call the superpremium category, which was the $8 to $12 range, is really being the hot and premium segment of the industry. We're seeing a definitive shift up in that regard and now you're sort of seeing this $15 to $25 segment really coming on strong as well as segments above that. So this is what's driving the growth of brands like Meiomi, which are about $20 a bottle or even Prisoner closer to $40 a bottle as this premiumization trend, which we think is going to continue unabated in certainly the midterm.

And mix in the form of nonorganic, such as Meiomi and The Prisoner, but also mix within our base portfolio has improved as well, or our organic portfolio has improved as well. In addition to that, we have had some benefits from freight savings in the U.S. on wine. But I would say that we would expect wine margin trends to remain somewhat consistent in the second half. Although as I called out in my script, we can expect that since over the course of the year, shipments will roughly equal depletions that will have a slowdown on the shipments line in the second half.

The proposition is all about the founders of the company going into the business before bourbon arrived, had really reached the level craft bourbon had arrived, in particular reached the level of popularity that it has to today. They took a view that much like the Scotch whiskey category that sort of a combination of distilling and aging their own whiskey and then combining that with blending could create a product that was really superior so that they did create those products. And I'll say through the expertise of master blenders that they brought in created a product that really appeals to the luxury American straight whiskey and bourbon and rye consumer and was able therefore to take advantage of the whole sort of craft trend in that area. So we think it's a relatively unique proposition and that certainly is reflecting itself in the way that the company has been able to grow the brand. And we think that we're going to be able to really take that platform and accelerate that. Distribution agreements, we have no interest in whatsoever, okay? Number one, you don't own the brand. Number two, distribution agreements are short term, nobody is going to sign up and give you the distribution rights for a like. Number three, distribution margins are small relative to the kind of margins that we at Constellation generate through our owned brand portfolio and certainly the type of margins that we're talking about on luxury spirits. So we don't have really any interest at all in distribution, low margin, short-term distribution agreements that would utilize probably one of our most valuable assets, which is our sales and marketing organization. So we don't see that -- we don't see distribution arrangements as an add-on for the future. As I said, way, way, way too low margin and no brand equity related there too."

And I would say that so far, our wins have really been at the low end of the portfolio and at the luxury end of the portfolio. But we do believe that over time, that we will continue to get pricing opportunities across the portfolio, right? So this will be the third year we've taken price in various brands in our wine portfolio and this will be the year where we have the biggest effect of those price increases but I would say that we're just beginning that journey. And I would also say that we're also seeing some ability to take price in certain segments of the wine category that haven't taken price in the past. So we remain cautiously optimistic but we need to get some wins behind us before we want to talk about that much more."

And then if you looked at year-to-date pricing for our top 10 SKUs in the premium category, meaning we're bridging above, we're at plus 3.5%.

So I think we're seeing a little bit of that going on. And so anything that slips out of this year, we can expect we'll end up coming through our cash flow statement in FY '18. And in terms of depreciation and amortization, in my comments earlier, I said that we would be at $125 million of depreciation and amortization for the beer business. That does -- that will just by definition, the growth from about $65 million last year to $125 million this year, that will be somewhat back-end loaded just given the fact that we are behind a little bit on a year-to-date basis.

And we continue to see payback from our investment in Modelo Especial. Let me give you an example. When we were talking about our thoughts for the second quarter at the end of the first quarter, we actually thought that we would see a spike in marketing spend in Q2. We did spend more in marketing, but as a percentage of sales, it ended up being in line with our projections, simply because we got a significant short-term payback from that investment. So we continue to monitor that on an ongoing basis and that's our work on the beer side. And, as Rob had talked about the marketing investment on the wine piece of our business, we're bringing that same rigor to marketing spend in wine."

We're certainly trying to drive that trend through our category management efforts. I would say that as a general proposition, we probably think that craft is over skewed and over spaced and imports given the importance and the growth of high-end imports are under skewed and under spaced. And premium domestics are way over skewed and over space. So that's something that we spent a lot of time sort of thinking about, which is assortment in the high-end, especially, and I think we're in a very strong position to advise our retail customers through our category management initiatives as to ways that they can improve their velocity as well as their profit per unit space that they're devoting to beer. So that's a big part of what we're doing, and I think that the trend that you're alluding to is definitely occurring. And I think that, that bodes really well for us in a couple of ways. Craft, even though you're going to see some shakeout there, I think that what will also occur there simultaneously is that the bigger, stronger, faster growing brands like Ballast Point will and should be given more space, more SKUs sort of for the obvious reasons because it's moving and it's highly, highly profitable. And I think that you can say the same thing about imports because it's going to become obvious to the retailer that that's the best way to maximize, as I say, their velocity and profitability for the unit space that they're devoting to the category. So the trend that you mentioned is occurring and it bodes extremely well for our entire beer business because we only play in craft and the high-end."

I think that, that team certainly had some knowledge and credentials, but I don't think that they have anywhere near the level of sophistication and knowledge, okay, that the team that we supplanted them with has. First of all, as far as that team goes, okay, we replaced the CEO with Marty Birkel, who is the guy who ran national sales for our beer business for 8 years and probably the fastest growth period in our entire beer business and therefore, is really one of the stars in the beer business period. And also was our sales president for our wine and spirits business as well for many years. And he brings a level of knowledge and expertise in growing brands and in wholesale and distributor relations and sales execution that far exceeds with the previous management team had. And then if you look at the sales side of the business, we replaced the sales guy with the #2 sales guy that was heading California already at Ballast Point, and California presented a very large proportion of the business. And this is the guy that was driving that portion of the business. And then the other changes aren't going to have any real commercial effect on the business. So I would say if anything, we're really excited about the changes that have been made and we think that it's going to lead to even stronger results on Ballast Point as it grows into a much larger business and needs a degree of professionalism that I don't think that the old management team could bring. And then as it relates to the product itself, we have the same production team, the same expertise in the making of what really is the highest quality and most award-winning craft beer brand of any size in the country. And they're just -- they're going about their business and doing what they've done in the past and they're probably doing it better than they've ever done it before. So there's a lot of really exciting stuff. And then sort of culturally, everybody is acutely aware of the type of culture that needs to be maintained in sort of that fast-moving craft-type business, where it's important to continue to proliferate new products and new types that the consumer is really interested in that particular craft consumer. So I don't think that we're going to see anything lost there. So we're very optimistic and very pleased with the changes that we've made."

Before I begin a review of the quarter, I'd like to focus your attention on the press release issued earlier today rep",1452,"Thanks, Patty, and good morning, and welcome to our discussion of Constellation's second quarter fiscal 2017 sales and earnings results. Before I begin a review of the quarter, I'd like to focus your attention on the press release issued earlier today reporting that we have an agreement to purchase Utah-based High West Distillery for approximately $160 million. Now this acquisition includes a portfolio of award-winning, high-end American straight whiskeys and other spirit brands at the greater than $30 retail price point. 
With the addition of High West to our portfolio, we are entering the profitable, high-end craft whiskey market segment. High West sells approximately 70,000 cases annually and has experienced double-digit volume growth for each of the last 3 years. The portfolio includes 4 core products: American Prairie Bourbon, Double Rye!, Rendezvous Rye and High West Whiskey Campfire. High West will be an excellent addition to our spirits portfolio as we expect it to bolster our position in the dynamic and growing spirits category. 
Now let's turn to our discussion of our quarterly results, which reflect excellent performance across our businesses, especially our beer business, which is significantly outperforming the U.S. beer market and our own expectations. As a matter of fact, during the quarter, Constellation beers contributed 60% of the total U.S. beer industry IRI dollar growth, driven by the excellent performance of our top brands, and we remain the #1, #1 share gainer in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, with double-digit depletion growth of almost 14% for the second quarter. 
These results were driven by excellent execution by the beer team during the peak summer selling season. Our ""120 Days of Summer"" marketing campaign drove marketing share gains during the 4th of July and continued throughout the heart of the summer and into the Labor Day holiday. This performance was led by Corona Extra and Modelo Especial, both of which held category-leading positions as the #3 and the #2 overall brand share gainers, driven by continued distribution and velocity gains from increased marketing investments and consumer demand. 
Corona Extra continued to air TV campaigns in both national English and Spanish language TV while making investments in boxing with the launch of limited-edition boxing bottles at the end of August. 
In addition, Corona Extra recently became an official partner of the Los Angeles Rams, as the exclusive import beer sponsor and official Cerveza of the team and kicked off the NFL preseason with in-stadium and retail execution end [ph] market. 
During the quarter, we introduced Casa Modelo, a new master brand and portfolio approach for the Modelo family of brands, including Especial, Negra and Chelada. Casa Modelo reestablishes Modelo as an iconic Mexican brewer and allows for more effective cross promotion and awareness building for each Modelo brand, setting the stage for enhanced product innovation and product line extensions. 
This new strategy leverages the momentum of Modelo Especial, the fastest-growing major beer in America and the #2 imported beer in the U.S., and directly links it to the leadership of its sister Modelo brand, Negra and Chelada. Negra, which has been renamed Modelo Negra, is the #1 dark Mexican beer, while Modelo Chelada owns nearly 25% share of the Chelada market. 
With its entire portfolio under one roof, consumers will begin to see a new thought advertising campaign, unified packaging, including a fully redesigned look for Modelo Negra, and a new point-of-sale at retail inspired by Modelo's heritage, tradition and high-quality standard. 
During the second quarter, Casa Modelo continued TV advertising via both national, Spanish language TV and national general market TV for Modelo Especial, including a spot supporting Modelo Chelada. 
I'd also like to highlight the Pacifico brand, which launched TV advertising across 11 Western states, a significant expansion of this type of marketing activity. In addition, the recently launched 24-ounce single-serve can continues to gain traction as the #1 new item nationally in IRI channels. Our Pacifico marketing investments are obviously paying off as this brand grew depletions more than 20% for the quarter. 
And let's not forget about Ballast Point, which continues to be the fastest-growing major craft brand in the U.S. and achieved solid high double-digit depletion growth during the quarter. We continued to expand distribution of Ballast Point brand throughout the U.S. and recently began the buildout of a new Ballast Point East Coast brewery in Virginia. 
Operationally, during the quarter, our recently expanded Nava Brewery and our supply chain performed well in delivering product supply to support our sales growth during our pre-peak sales period. As you are aware, we have been transitioning directly from our recently completed 20-million-hectoliter Nava expansion to our next critical capacity milestone of 25 million hectoliters. This project is progressing extremely well. 
Last quarter, I mentioned that we have fired up our second glass furnace at the Nava glass plant. I'm proud to report that in less than 90 days we are producing and packaging quality glass from the furnace at an improved efficiency rate. 
And finally, construction at our new brewery in Mexicali is picking up momentum, including an infrastructure investments to support future capacity expansions. Overall, the strong results of the beer business achieved in the second quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to our EPS guidance for fiscal 2017. 
We are now targeting EBIT growth for the beer business in the high teens range, which is expected to drive an operating margin of approximately 35% to 36% for the segment in fiscal 2017 versus our previous margin estimate of about 35%. 
And now I would like to discuss the results for our wine and spirits business. During the quarter, our wine and spirits business grew earnings and expanded margins while continuing to drive share gains for our recently acquired premium wine brands, Meiomi and The Prisoner, which posted IRI growth of about 70% and 35%, respectively. 
These premium margin accretive wine acquisitions have been excellent additions to our portfolio. As a matter of fact, at current growth rates, we are on track for Meiomi to achieve the 1 million case mark this year. And the Wine Spectator recently awarded the 2014 Prisoner a 91-point score, which marks the 5th consecutive vintage that The Prisoner has scored 90-plus points. 
Our higher-margin Focus Brands had an outstanding quarter, posting depletion growth of 9%, driven by Meiomi and Kim Crawford, Black Box, Prisoner, Clos du Bois, The Dreaming Tree and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. Several of these brands were also recognized as Blue Chip brands by Impact Databank as they met the criteria for this award in terms of profitability and by posting several consecutive years of volume growth. 
As you can see, we are reaping the benefits of our investments in our Focus Brands, which continued to have excellent growth potential and represent the majority of the revenue and profitability for our wine and spirits business. During the quarter, our innovation team rolled out new margin-enhancing offerings like Cooper & Thief, a bourbon-barrel aged red blend at the superluxury price point as well as the Kelly Collection [ph] priced in the superpremium price segment. 
We are also gaining traction with Robert Mondavi Private Selection, bourbon barrel-aged Cabernet and Ravage Cabernet, both of which are achieving their goals so for this year. 
As we head into the key holiday season -- selling season for our wine and spirits business, we will be executing programming designed to ensure that we continue to drive growth, especially for our Focus Brands. As is typical at this point of this year, I would like to provide an update relative to the California grape harvest, which is currently more than 60% complete and expected to be finished by early November. 
The current California industry estimate is for our total harvest yield of approximately 4 million tons versus 3.7 million tons last year. The crop is up this year versus last, which is needed to replace inventory levels. The quality looks good to be fantastic with excellent color and flavors. 
From a pricing perspective, we continue to expect grain pricing to increase slightly versus last year, depending on the variety, location and demand. So in closing, we are at the halfway point of the year, and I am extremely pleased with our impressive results. Our beer business continues to deliver industry-leading results while our wine business is gaining share and is on track to meet its goals for the year, and I am pleased to welcome High West to our family of brands, and we continue to progress as planned with our brewery and glass plant expansions in Mexico. 
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David, who will review our second quarter financial results."

As highlighted by Rob, we're pleased with our impressive results for Q2 and first half of fiscal '17. Strong execution and smart investments continued to fuel our growth and solidify our leadership position in t",1178,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. As highlighted by Rob, we're pleased with our impressive results for Q2 and first half of fiscal '17. Strong execution and smart investments continued to fuel our growth and solidify our leadership position in total beverage alcohol. 
This is demonstrated by the 17% comparable basis diluted EPS growth we generated during the first half of fiscal '17. As a result of this performance, we are increasing our full year comparable basis diluted EPS target to a range of $6.30 to $6.45 versus our previous guidance of $6.05 to $6.35. 
Looking at our Q2 fiscal '17 performance in more detail, where I will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. You can see organic beer net sales increased 15%, primarily due to volume growth of 13% and favorable pricing. 
Beer depletion growth for the quarter came in at 14%. Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 8%. This primarily reflects 6% volume growth and favorable mix. 
Our U.S. depletions grew a little more than 3% in Q2. Our U.S. shipment volume outpaced depletions during the first half of fiscal '17. This is mostly timing related as we expect U.S. shipment volume to generally align with depletion volume for the year. 
As a result, we expect wine and spirits net sales and EBIT growth in the second half of the year to be lower than the first half, with Q3 net sales expected to be flattish to down slightly and EBIT down further due to anticipated marketing and SG&A investment during the key holiday selling period. 
Beer operating margin increased 200 basis points to 36.9%. This reflects benefits from pricing, volume, freight and foreign currency. These positive factors were partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense, driven by our capacity expansion activities. 
Wine and spirits operating margin improved 120 basis points to 25.8%. The increase was primarily related to favorable volume, COGS and mix and benefit from the addition of the Meiomi and Prisoner wine brands, partially offset by higher investment in SG&A and marketing. 
Interest expense for the quarter increased $17 million, primarily due to higher average borrowings. Additionally, during Q2, we recorded an adjustment on our balance sheet related to a prior year period for the conversion of $132 million from equity interest into debt for the Nava glass plant JV. As a result, we recognized $7 million of interest expense associated with this debt during Q2. This was offset by an increase in the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest line of our income statement. 
At the end of Q2, this debt totaled $159 million with an average interest rate of 5.7%. I would also like to note that at the end of August, we redeemed our $700 million 7 1/4% senior notes that were coming due in September of 2016. This was primarily funded with cash. 
When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt at the end of Q2 totaled $7.9 billion, a decrease of $146 million since the end of fiscal '16. Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.4x at the end of Q2 versus 3.8x at the end of fiscal '16. 
Our leverage ratio at the end of Q2 does not yet reflect a full year EBITDA benefit from the Ballast Point and Prisoner acquisitions. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 31.8% versus 24.6% for Q2 last year. 
Last year's rate reflected the favorable outcome of various tax items that were effectively settled in connection with IRS examinations. We continue to expect our full year fiscal '17 effective tax rate to approximate 29%. 
Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For first half of fiscal '17, we generated $676 million of free cash flow compared to $508 million for the same period last year. 
Operating cash flow was above the $1 billion mark, up 30%, driven by our earnings growth. CapEx for the first half of the year was $369 million compared to $295 million for the prior year period. While our CapEx is up versus last year, it's tracking below our original plan. This primarily reflects some shift in the timing of Nava brewery capital payments into next year. 
Primarily as a result of this activity, we've lowered full year CapEx guidance by $125 million to a range of $1.125 billion to $1.225 billion. The lower CapEx is driving an increase in our fiscal '17 free cash flow guidance to a range of $375 million to $475 million. 
Moving to our full year fiscal '17 P&L outlook. I shared earlier that we now expect our comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.30 to $6.45. This represents mid- to high teen growth versus last year. The increase is being driven by the strong performance of the beer business, which is now targeting net sales growth in the range of 16% to 17% with organic net sales expected to be in the 12% to 13% range. These sales targets represent the high end of our previous guidance ranges and includes 1% to 2% of anticipated pricing benefit for our Mexican portfolio. 
Operating income growth for the beer business is now expected to be in the high teens. This new guidance now targets our beer operating margins to be in the 35% to 36% range. The improvement versus our previous guidance is primarily being driven by lower depreciation than we originally anticipated and some additional foreign currency favorability versus our original plan. We are now estimating beer segment depreciation and amortization to be closer to $125 million for fiscal '17, which is approximately $15 million lower than our original estimate. 
For the wine and spirits business, we continue to expect net sales growth in the mid-single-digit range and operating income growth in the mid- to high single-digit range. In addition, we continue to project organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range. 
Rob provided highlights of the High West acquisition, and I would just add that from a financial perspective, High West generates approximately $25 million in annual sales, and we expect minimal financial impact from the transaction for fiscal '17. 
I would also note before closing that our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. 
In closing, our results for the first half of fiscal '17 have put us on track to achieve another year of strong growth and financial performance and drive growth for the overall total beverage alcohol category. 
Our focus on strong execution in the marketplace and making investments to support our business positions us to continue to propel future growth. We expect the addition of the High West Distillery and its portfolio of award-winning, high-end craft whiskeys will provide us an excellent opportunity to strengthen our spirits platform with fast-growing, consumer favorite products in an exciting category. 
With that, Rob and I are happy to take your questions."

First of all, as it relates to the wine -- the on-premise, right, I would say that the condition of the on-premise remains fairly poor in that -- to the extent that it's measurable, the on-premise I think continues to be sort of on the down-ish, slightly down-ish side. For us, our on-premise business is very strong. So we're clearly gaining share in on-premise. So while the channel is not performing particularly well, we're extremely pleased with our performance in the on-premise. And then to your second question, Nik, there's definitely white space that we think is very good white space that we don't participate in. You mentioned, for instance, the SMB category, that's a very good category in terms of its premium positioning, margins and growth. So that's clearly a subcategory that we'll be looking at in terms of developing our portfolio for the future. And then secondly, there's other areas of white space I think, a good example of our filling white space in our portfolio is our High West acquisition, right. So that has put us in the craft brown spirits, right, American straight whiskey category, and that's a fantastic category in terms of growth and margins, which we see no abatement in that trend in any time in the near future. So we've got a great entrant there and we'll be continuing to look at other areas of white space that would be available to us and make sense in terms of our portfolio and from a synergy perspective, which really anything in beverage alcohol really fits that bill because obviously, we have strong sales organizations across wine, beer and spirits and extremely strong distribution networks in wine and spirits and beer. So we're really in a position to attack anything that meets our criteria in the wine and spirits and beer business, which is pretty simple, right? High growth and high margin are really the 2 things that are critical to us."

I think Casa Noble is another great example, right? Fastest-growing luxury tequila -- of any luxury tequila growing in IRI at 45%. Basically, what we're able to do with these brands, and we will be able to do with High West, is use our sales organization, our expertise and execution in our extremely strong distribution network to take a brand like High West and really grow it into something material in the category that it participates in. So I think that we'll be very successful in scaling that brand. And the brand already has fantastic momentum and it already is of significant size at 70,000 cases. So you apply these kind of high double-digit growth rates and for the next several years, and you can definitely see this being scaled into a material brand, especially when you think about the price point and the high margins that are associated with the brand in the category.

The whole point of sort of our selection process as we make these sort of smaller tuck-in acquisitions is to buy brands that stand on their own and have the momentum to be of a scale to contribute material -- materially to Constellation's growth and margins. And I am quite confident that High West will be one of those brands as are the other brands in our spirits portfolio. So just like we bought SVEDKA years ago and have grown that to be the second-largest vodka in the entire United States and the #1 import brand and fundamentally changed the vodka category with that brand. I think that our other spirits additions have a lot of great potential similar to that. So I guess we don't really think about the, how we compete effectively in a whole category.

So we're overinvesting and when I say overinvesting, I mean, we're investing more than we have traditionally specifically in marketing of our wines and spirits brands. And so what you're seeing is advertising campaigns that we've initiated to drive brands like Kim Crawford. We've got tests going on in various states like Texas, for instance, to a really heavy-consumer weight-type advertising for our brand like Kim Crawford to see how that drives the brand, which, by the way, is driving the brand fantastically. And I think that we're proving that our investments in media advertising on wine, on brands like Kim Crawford and Woodbridge is another one that we've really heavy-ed up our advertising on. But these are paying back at a rapid rate, meaning a rate greater than what you traditionally see in consumer products, which is very similar to our beer brands in particular Corona and Modelo Especial, where we see sort of the payback rates on our advertising activities at a much faster rate than what would typically be seen in consumer products.

We're seeing a definitive shift up in that regard and now you're sort of seeing this $15 to $25 segment really coming on strong as well as segments above that. So this is what's driving the growth of brands like Meiomi, which are about $20 a bottle or even Prisoner closer to $40 a bottle as this premiumization trend, which we think is going to continue unabated in certainly the midterm. So I'd say that the outlook for the category continues to be extremely positive."

And mix in the form of nonorganic, such as Meiomi and The Prisoner, but also mix within our base portfolio has improved as well, or our organic portfolio has improved as well. In addition to that, we have had some benefits from freight savings in the U.S. on wine. But I would say that we would expect wine margin trends to remain somewhat consistent in the second half. Although as I called out in my script, we can expect that since over the course of the year, shipments will roughly equal depletions that will have a slowdown on the shipments line in the second half.

The proposition is all about the founders of the company going into the business before bourbon and rye had really reached the level craft bourbon and rye in particular reached the level of popularity that it has to today. They took a view that much like the Scotch whiskey category that sort of a combination of distilling and aging their own whiskey and then combining that with blending could create a product that was really superior so that they did create those products. And I'll say through the expertise of master blenders that they brought in created a product that really appeals to the luxury American straight whiskey and bourbon and rye consumer and was able therefore to take advantage of the whole sort of craft trend in that area. So we think it's a relatively unique proposition and that certainly is reflecting itself in the way that the company has been able to grow the brand. And we think that we're going to be able to really take that platform and accelerate that. Distribution agreements, we have no interest in whatsoever, okay? Number one, you don't own the brand. Number two, distribution agreements are short term, nobody is going to sign up and give you the distribution rights for life. Number three, distribution margins are small relative to the kind of margins that we at Constellation generate through our owned brand portfolio and certainly the type of margins that we're talking about on luxury spirits. So we don't have really any interest at all in distribution, low margin, short-term distribution agreements that would utilize probably one of our most valuable assets, which is our sales and marketing organization. So we don't see that -- we don't see distribution arrangements as an add-on for the future. As I said, way, way, way too low margin and no brand equity related there too."

And we continue to see payback from our investment in Modelo Especial. Let me give you an example. When we were talking about our thoughts for the second quarter at the end of the first quarter, we actually thought that we would see a spike in marketing spend in Q2. We did spend more in marketing, but as a percentage of sales, it ended up being in line with our projections, simply because we got a significant short-term payback from that investment. So we continue to monitor that on an ongoing basis and that's our work on the beer side. And, as Rob had talked about the marketing investment on the wine piece of our business, we're bringing that same rigor to marketing spend in wine."

We're certainly trying to drive that trend through our category management efforts. I would say that as a general proposition, we probably think that craft is over-SKU-ed and over spaced and imports given the importance and the growth of high-end imports are under-SKU-ed and under spaced. And premium domestics are way over-SKU-ed and over space. So that's something that we spent a lot of time sort of thinking about, which is assortment in the high-end, especially, and I think we're in a very strong position to advise our retail customers through our category management initiatives as to ways that they can improve their velocity as well as their profit per unit space that they're devoting to beer. So that's a big part of what we're doing, and I think that the trend that you're alluding to is definitely occurring. And I think that, that bodes really well for us in a couple of ways. Craft, even though you're going to see some shakeout there, I think that what will also occur there simultaneously is that the bigger, stronger, faster growing brands like Ballast Point will and should be given more space, more SKUs sort of for the obvious reasons because it's moving and it's highly, highly profitable. And I think that you can say the same thing about imports because it's going to become obvious to the retailer that that's the best way to maximize, as I say, their velocity and profitability for the unit space that they're devoting to the category. So the trend that you mentioned is occurring and it bodes extremely well for our entire beer business because we only play in craft and the high-end."

I think that, that team certainly had some knowledge and credentials, but I don't think that they have anywhere near the level of sophistication and knowledge, okay, that the team that we supplanted them with has. First of all, as far as that team goes, okay, we replaced the CEO with Marty Birkel, who is the guy who ran national sales for our beer business for 8 years and probably the fastest growth period in our entire beer business and therefore, is really one of the stars in the beer business period. And also was our sales president for our wine and spirits business as well for many years. And he brings a level of knowledge and expertise in growing brands and in wholesale and distributor relations and sales execution that far exceeds with the previous management team had. And then if you look at the sales side of the business, we replaced the sales guy with the #2 sales guy that was heading California already at Ballast Point, and California presented a very large proportion of the business. And this is the guy that was driving that portion of the business. And then the other changes aren't going to have any real commercial effect on the business. So I would say if anything, we're really excited about the changes that have been made and we think that it's going to lead to even stronger results on Ballast Point as it grows into a much larger business and needs a degree of professionalism that I don't think that the old management team could bring. And then as it relates to the product itself, we have the same production team, the same expertise in the making of what really is the highest quality and most award-winning craft beer brand of any size in the country. And they're just -- they're going about their business and doing what they've done in the past and they're probably doing it better than they've ever done it before. So there's a lot of really exciting stuff. And then sort of culturally, everybody is acutely aware of the type of culture that needs to be maintained in sort of that fast-moving craft-type business, where it's important to continue to proliferate new products and new types that the consumer is really interested in, that particular craft consumer. So I don't think that we're going to see anything lost there. So we're very optimistic and very pleased with the changes that we've made."

Before I begin a review of the quarter, I'd like to focus your attention on the press release issued earlier today reporting that we have an agreement to purchase Utah-based High West Distillery for approximately $160 million. Now this acquisition includes a portfolio of award-winning, high-end American straight whiskeys and other spirit brands at the greater than $30 retail price point. 
With the addition of High West to our portfolio, we are entering the profitable, high-end craft whiskey market segment. High West sells approximately 70,000 cases annually and has experienced double-digit volume growth for each of the last 3 years. The portfolio includes 4 core products: American Prairie Bourbon, Double Rye!, Rendezvous Rye and High West Whiskey Campfire. High West will be an excellent addition to our spirits portfolio as we expect it to bolster our position in the dynamic and growing spirits category. 
Now let's turn to our discussion of our quarterly results, which reflect excellent performance across our businesses, especially our beer business, which is significantly outperforming the U.S. beer market and our own expectations. As a matter of fact, during the quarter, Constellation beers contributed 60% of the total U.S. beer industry IRI dollar growth, driven by the excellent performance of our top brands, and we remain the #1, #1 share gainer in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, with double-digit depletion growth of almost 14% for the second quarter. 
These results were driven by excellent execution by the beer team during the peak summer selling season. Our ""120 Days of Summer"" marketing campaign drove marketing share gains during the 4th of July and continued throughout the heart of the summer and into the Labor Day holiday. This performance was led by Corona Extra and Modelo Especial, both of which held category-leading positions as the #3 and the #2 overall brand share gainers, driven by continued distribution and velocity gains from increased marketing investments and consumer demand. 
Corona Extra continued to air TV campaigns in both national English and Spanish language TV while making investments in boxing with the launch of limited-edition boxing bottles at the end of August. 
In addition, Corona Extra recently became an official partner of the Los Angeles Rams, as the exclusive import beer sponsor and official Cerveza of the team and kicked off the NFL preseason with in-stadium and retail execution end [ph] market. 
During the quarter, we introduced Casa Modelo, a new master brand and portfolio approach for the Modelo family of brands, including Especial, Negra and Chelada. Casa Modelo reestablishes Modelo as an iconic Mexican brewer and allows for more effective cross promotion and awareness building for each Modelo brand, setting the stage for enhanced product innovation and product line extensions. 
This new strategy leverages the momentum of Modelo Especial, the fastest-growing major beer in America and the #2 imported beer in the U.S., and directly links it to the leadership of its sister Modelo brand, Negra and Chelada. Negra, which has been renamed Modelo Negra, is the #1 dark Mexican beer, while Modelo Chelada owns nearly 25% share of the Chelada market. 
With its entire portfolio under one roof, consumers will begin to see a new thought advertising campaign, unified packaging, including a fully redesigned look for Modelo Negra, and a new point-of-sale at retail inspired by Modelo's heritage, tradition and high-quality standard. 
During the second quarter, Casa Modelo continued TV advertising via both national, Spanish language TV and national general market TV for Modelo Especial, including a spot supporting Modelo Chelada. 
I'd also like to highlight the Pacifico brand, which launched TV advertising across 11 Western states, a significant expansion of this type of marketing activity. In addition, the recently launched 24-ounce single-serve can continues to gain traction as the #1 new item nationally in IRI channels. Our Pacifico marketing investments are obviously paying off as this brand grew depletions more than 20% for the quarter. 
And let's not forget about Ballast Point, which continues to be the fastest-growing major craft brand in the U.S. and achieved solid high double-digit depletion growth during the quarter. We continued to expand distribution of Ballast Point brand throughout the U.S. and recently began the buildout of a new Ballast Point East Coast brewery in Virginia. 
Operationally, during the quarter, our recently expanded Nava Brewery and our supply chain performed well in delivering product supply to support our sales growth during our pre-peak sales period. As you are aware, we have been transitioning directly from our recently completed 20-million-hectoliter Nava expansion to our next critical capacity milestone of 25 million hectoliters. This project is progressing extremely well. 
Last quarter, I mentioned that we have fired up our second glass furnace at the Nava glass plant. I'm proud to report that in less than 90 days we are producing and packaging quality glass from the furnace at an improved efficiency rate. 
And finally, construction at our new brewery in Mexicali is picking up momentum, including an infrastructure investments to support future capacity expansions. Overall, the strong results of the beer business achieved in the second quarter are the primary driver of the upward revision to our EPS guidance for fiscal 2017. 
We are now targeting EBIT growth for the beer business in the high teens range, which is expected to drive an operating margin of approximately 35% to 36% for the segment in fiscal 2017 versus our previous margin estimate of about 35%. 
And now I would like to discuss the results for our wine and spirits business. During the quarter, our wine and spirits business grew earnings and expanded margins while continuing to drive share gains for our recently acquired premium wine brands, Meiomi and The Prisoner, which posted IRI growth of about 70% and 35%, respectively. 
These premium margin accretive wine acquisitions have been excellent additions to our portfolio. As a matter of fact, at current growth rates, we are on track for Meiomi to achieve the 1 million case mark this year. And the Wine Spectator recently awarded the 2014 Prisoner a 91-point score, which marks the 5th consecutive vintage that The Prisoner has scored 90-plus points. 
Our higher-margin Focus Brands had an outstanding quarter, posting depletion growth of 9%, driven by Meiomi and Kim Crawford, Black Box, Prisoner, Clos du Bois, The Dreaming Tree and Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi. Several of these brands were also recognized as Blue Chip brands by Impact Databank as they met the criteria for this award in terms of profitability and by posting several consecutive years of volume growth. 
As you can see, we are reaping the benefits of our investments in our Focus Brands, which continued to have excellent growth potential and represent the majority of the revenue and profitability for our wine and spirits business. During the quarter, our innovation team rolled out new margin-enhancing offerings like Cooper & Thief, a bourbon-barrel aged red blend at the superluxury price point as well as the Kelly Collection [ph] priced in the superpremium price segment. 
We are also gaining traction with Robert Mondavi Private Selection, bourbon barrel-aged Cabernet and Ravage Cabernet, both of which are achieving their goals so for this year. 
As we head into the key holiday season -- selling season for our wine and spirits business, we will be executing programming designed to ensure that we continue to drive growth, especially for our Focus Brands. As is typical at this point of this year, I would like to provide an update relative to the California grape harvest, which is currently more than 60% complete and expected to be finished by early November. 
The current California industry estimate is for our total harvest yield of approximately 4 million tons versus 3.7 million tons last year. The crop is up this year versus last, which is needed to replace inventory levels. The quality looks good to be fantastic with excellent color and flavors. 
From a pricing perspective, we continue to expect grain pricing to increase slightly versus last year, depending on the variety, location and demand. So in closing, we are at the halfway point of the year, and I am extremely pleased with our impressive results. Our beer business continues to deliver industry-leading results while our wine business is gaining share and is on track to meet its goals for the year, and I am pleased to welcome High West to our family of brands, and we continue to progress as planned with our brewery and glass plant expansions in Mexico. 
With that, I would now like to turn the call over to David, who will review our second quarter financial results."
258589,383138116,1053482,"Constellation Brands Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Oct 05, 2016",2016-10-05,"Earnings Calls","Constellation Brands, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. As highlighted by Rob, we're pleased with our impressive results for Q2 and first half of fiscal '17. Strong execution and smart investments continued to fuel our growth and solidify our leadership position in t",1178,"Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone. As highlighted by Rob, we're pleased with our impressive results for Q2 and first half of fiscal '17. Strong execution and smart investments continued to fuel our growth and solidify our leadership position in total beverage alcohol. 
This is demonstrated by the 17% comparable basis diluted EPS growth we generated during the first half of fiscal '17. As a result of this performance, we are increasing our full year comparable basis diluted EPS target to a range of $6.30 to $6.45 versus our previous guidance of $6.05 to $6.35. 
Looking at our Q2 fiscal '17 performance in more detail, where I will generally focus on comparable basis financial results. You can see organic beer net sales increased 15%, primarily due to volume growth of 13% and favorable pricing. 
Beer depletion growth for the quarter came in at 14%. Wine and spirits net sales on an organic constant currency basis increased 8%. This primarily reflects 6% volume growth and favorable mix. 
Our U.S. depletions grew a little more than 3% in Q2. Our U.S. shipment volume outpaced depletions during the first half of fiscal '17. This is mostly timing related as we expect U.S. shipment volume to generally align with depletion volume for the year. 
As a result, we expect wine and spirits net sales and EBIT growth in the second half of the year to be lower than the first half, with Q3 net sales expected to be flattish to down slightly and EBIT down further due to anticipated marketing and SG&A investment during the key holiday selling period. 
Beer operating margin increased 200 basis points to 36.9%. This reflects benefits from pricing, volume, freight and foreign currency. These positive factors were partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense, driven by our capacity expansion activities. 
Wine and spirits operating margin improved 120 basis points to 25.8%. The increase was primarily related to favorable volume, COGS and mix and benefit from the addition of the Meiomi and Prisoner wine brands, partially offset by higher investment in SG&A and marketing. 
Interest expense for the quarter increased $17 million, primarily due to higher average borrowings. Additionally, during Q2, we recorded an adjustment on our balance sheet related to a prior year period for the conversion of $132 million from equity interest into debt for the Nava glass plant JV. As a result, we recognized $7 million of interest expense associated with this debt during Q2. This was offset by an increase in the net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest line of our income statement. 
At the end of Q2, this debt totaled $159 million with an average interest rate of 5.7%. I would also like to note that at the end of August, we redeemed our $700 million 7 1/4% senior notes that were coming due in September of 2016. This was primarily funded with cash. 
When factoring in cash on hand, our net debt at the end of Q2 totaled $7.9 billion, a decrease of $146 million since the end of fiscal '16. Our net debt to comparable basis EBITDA leverage ratio came in at 3.4x at the end of Q2 versus 3.8x at the end of fiscal '16. 
Our leverage ratio at the end of Q2 does not yet reflect a full year EBITDA benefit from the Ballast Point and Prisoner acquisitions. Our comparable basis effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 31.8% versus 24.6% for Q2 last year. 
Last year's rate reflected the favorable outcome of various tax items that were effectively settled in connection with IRS examinations. We continue to expect our full year fiscal '17 effective tax rate to approximate 29%. 
Now let's review free cash flow, which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx. For first half of fiscal '17, we generated $676 million of free cash flow compared to $508 million for the same period last year. 
Operating cash flow was above the $1 billion mark, up 30%, driven by our earnings growth. CapEx for the first half of the year was $369 million compared to $295 million for the prior year period. While our CapEx is up versus last year, it's tracking below our original plan. This primarily reflects some shift in the timing of Nava brewery capital payments into next year. 
Primarily as a result of this activity, we've lowered full year CapEx guidance by $125 million to a range of $1.125 billion to $1.225 billion. The lower CapEx is driving an increase in our fiscal '17 free cash flow guidance to a range of $375 million to $475 million. 
Moving to our full year fiscal '17 P&L outlook. I shared earlier that we now expect our comparable basis diluted EPS to be in the range of $6.30 to $6.45. This represents mid- to high teen growth versus last year. The increase is being driven by the strong performance of the beer business, which is now targeting net sales growth in the range of 16% to 17% with organic net sales expected to be in the 12% to 13% range. These sales targets represent the high end of our previous guidance ranges and includes 1% to 2% of anticipated pricing benefit for our Mexican portfolio. 
Operating income growth for the beer business is now expected to be in the high teens. This new guidance now targets our beer operating margins to be in the 35% to 36% range. The improvement versus our previous guidance is primarily being driven by lower depreciation than we originally anticipated and some additional foreign currency favorability versus our original plan. We are now estimating beer segment depreciation and amortization to be closer to $125 million for fiscal '17, which is approximately $15 million lower than our original estimate. 
For the wine and spirits business, we continue to expect net sales growth in the mid-single-digit range and operating income growth in the mid- to high single-digit range. In addition, we continue to project organic net sales and operating income growth to be in the low to mid-single-digit range. 
Rob provided highlights of the High West acquisition, and I would just add that from a financial perspective, High West generates approximately $25 million in annual sales, and we expect minimal financial impact from the transaction for fiscal '17. 
I would also note before closing that our comparable basis guidance excludes comparable adjustments, which are detailed in the release. 
In closing, our results for the first half of fiscal '17 have put us on track to achieve another year of strong growth and financial performance and drive growth for the overall total beverage alcohol category. 
Our focus on strong execution in the marketplace and making investments to support our business positions us to continue to propel future growth. We expect the addition of the High West Distillery and its portfolio of award-winning, high-end craft whiskeys will provide us an excellent opportunity to strengthen our spirits platform with fast-growing, consumer favorite products in an exciting category. 
With that, Rob and I are happy to take your questions."

And then the second question is just when you think about the overall portfolio, obviously, you have a beverage alcohol play here across all the segments. And when you think about the beer industry and a lot of areas that you're actually not competing in today, some of the new areas like cider or spiked seltzer, what have you, can you just give us your thought process and how you think about some of those verticals as white space over the coming years?"

First of all, as it relates to the wine -- the on-premise, right, I would say that the condition of the on-premise remains fairly poor in that -- to the extent that it's measurable, the on-premise I think continues to be sort of on the down-ish, slightly down-ish side. For us, our on-premise business is very strong. So we're clearly gaining share in on-premise. So while the channel is not performing particularly well, we're extremely pleased with our performance in the on-premise. And then to your second question, Nik, there's definitely white space that we think is very good white space that we don't participate in. You mentioned, for instance, the SMB category, that's a very good category in terms of its premium positioning, margins and growth. So that's clearly a subcategory that we'll be looking at in terms of developing our portfolio for the future. And then secondly, there's other areas of white space I think, a good example of our filling white space in our portfolio is our High West acquisition, right. So that has put us in the craft brown spirits, right, American straight whiskey category, and that's a fantastic category in terms of growth and margins, which we see no abatement in that trend in any time in the near future. So we've got a great entrant there and we'll be continuing to look at other areas of white space that would be available to us and make sense in terms of our portfolio and from a synergy perspective, which really anything in beverage alcohol really fits that bill because obviously, we have strong sales organizations across wine, beer and spirits and extremely strong distribution networks in wine and spirits and beer. So we're really in a position to attack anything that meets our criteria in the wine and spirits and beer business, which is pretty simple, right? High growth and high margin are really the 2 things that are critical to us."

I think Casa Noble is another great example, right? Fastest-growing luxury tequila -- of any luxury tequila growing in IRI at 45%. Basically, what we're able to do with these brands, and we will be able to do with High West, is use our sales organization, our expertise and execution in our extremely strong distribution network to take a brand like High West and really grow it into something material in the category that it participates in. So I think that we'll be very successful in scaling that brand. And the brand already has fantastic momentum and it already is of significant size at 70,000 cases. So you apply these kind of high double-digit growth rates and for the next several years, and you can definitely see this being scaled into a material brand, especially when you think about the price point and the high margins that are associated with the brand in the category.

The whole point of sort of our selection process as we make these sort of smaller tuck-in acquisitions is to buy brands that stand on their own and have the momentum to be of a scale to contribute material -- materially to Constellation's growth and margins. And I am quite confident that High West will be one of those brands as are the other brands in our spirits portfolio. So just like we bought SVEDKA years ago and have grown that to be the second-largest vodka in the entire United States and the #1 import brand and fundamentally changed the vodka category with that brand. I think that our other spirits additions have a lot of great potential similar to that. So I guess we don't really think about the, how we compete effectively in a whole category. We think about, what's the quality of the brands that we're buying and how can they contribute to Constellation's continued stellar growth in the top line and the bottom line."

So we're overinvesting and when I say overinvesting, I mean, we're investing more than we have traditionally specifically in marketing of our wines and spirits brands. And so what you're seeing is advertising campaigns that we've initiated to drive brands like Kim Crawford. We've got tests going on in various states like Texas, for instance, to a really heavy-consumer weight-type advertising for our brand like Kim Crawford to see how that drives the brand, which, by the way, is driving the brand fantastically. And I think that we're proving that our investments in media advertising on wine, on brands like Kim Crawford and Woodbridge is another one that we've really heavy-ed up our advertising on. But these are paying back at a rapid rate, meaning a rate greater than what you traditionally see in consumer products, which is very similar to our beer brands in particular Corona and Modelo Especial, where we see sort of the payback rates on our advertising activities at a much faster rate than what would typically be seen in consumer products.

We're seeing a definitive shift up in that regard and now you're sort of seeing this $15 to $25 segment really coming on strong as well as segments above that.

The proposition is all about the founders of the company going into the business before bourbon and rye had really reached the level craft bourbon and rye in particular reached the level of popularity that it has to today. They took a view that much like the Scotch whiskey category that sort of a combination of distilling and aging their own whiskey and then combining that with blending could create a product that was really superior so that they did create those products. And I'll say through the expertise of master blenders that they brought in created a product that really appeals to the luxury American straight whiskey and bourbon and rye consumer and was able therefore to take advantage of the whole sort of craft trend in that area. So we think it's a relatively unique proposition and that certainly is reflecting itself in the way that the company has been able to grow the brand. And we think that we're going to be able to really take that platform and accelerate that. Distribution agreements, we have no interest in whatsoever, okay? Number one, you don't own the brand. Number two, distribution agreements are short term, nobody is going to sign up and give you the distribution rights for life. Number three, distribution margins are small relative to the kind of margins that we at Constellation generate through our owned brand portfolio and certainly the type of margins that we're talking about on luxury spirits. So we don't have really any interest at all in distribution, low margin, short-term distribution agreements that would utilize probably one of our most valuable assets, which is our sales and marketing organization. So we don't see that -- we don't see distribution arrangements as an add-on for the future. As I said, way, way, way too low margin and no brand equity related there too."

Craft, even though you're going to see some shakeout there, I think that what will also occur there simultaneously is that the bigger, stronger, faster growing brands like Ballast Point will and should be given more space, more SKUs sort of for the obvious reasons because it's moving and it's highly, highly profitable.

So we think that there's a lot of opportunity on the distribution front. And I would say, as it relates to just overall velocity, I think, we have a little bit of an effect as we grow points of distribution that we're driving down our own brands' velocity. But we continue to be pleased with the brand. As Rob mentioned, we've got depletions that are up 40% on a year-to-date basis. We have -- we're very pleased with where we are from a profitability standpoint as we've continued to get leverage in the production environment at Ballast Point. So we're just generally very happy with where we are with Ballast Point."

I think that, that team certainly had some knowledge and credentials, but I don't think that they have anywhere near the level of sophistication and knowledge, okay, that the team that we supplanted them with has. First of all, as far as that team goes, okay, we replaced the CEO with Marty Birkel, who is the guy who ran national sales for our beer business for 8 years and probably the fastest growth period in our entire beer business and therefore, is really one of the stars in the beer business period. And also was our sales president for our wine and spirits business as well for many years. And he brings a level of knowledge and expertise in growing brands and in wholesale and distributor relations and sales execution that far exceeds with the previous management team had. And then if you look at the sales side of the business, we replaced the sales guy with the #2 sales guy that was heading California already at Ballast Point, and California presented a very large proportion of the business. And this is the guy that was driving that portion of the business. And then the other changes aren't going to have any real commercial effect on the business. So I would say if anything, we're really excited about the changes that have been made and we think that it's going to lead to even stronger results on Ballast Point as it grows into a much larger business and needs a degree of professionalism that I don't think that the old management team could bring. And then as it relates to the product itself, we have the same production team, the same expertise in the making of what really is the highest quality and most award-winning craft beer brand of any size in the country. And they're just -- they're going about their business and doing what they've done in the past and they're probably doing it better than they've ever done it before. So there's a lot of really exciting stuff. And then sort of culturally, everybody is acutely aware of the type of culture that needs to be maintained in sort of that fast-moving craft-type business, where it's important to continue to proliferate new products and new types that the consumer is really interested in, that particular craft consumer. So I don't think that we're going to see anything lost there. So we're very optimistic and very pleased with the changes that we've made."
